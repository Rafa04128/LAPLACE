germanyprince william and his son at a moment when the entire world has its eyes fixed upon the invalid of the villa zurio it appears to us to be of interest to publish the portrait of his son prince william the military spirit of the hohenzollerns is found in him in all its force and exclusiveness it was hoped that the accession of the crown prince to the throne of germany would temper the harshness of it and modernize its aspect but the painful disease from which he is suffering warns us that the moment may soon come in which the son will be called to succeed the emperor william his grandfather of whom he is morally the perfect portrait like him he loves the army and makes it the object of his entire attention no colonel more scrupulously performs his duty than he when he enters the quarters of the regiment of red hussars whose chief he is his solicitude for the army manifests itself openly it is not without pride that he regards his eldest son who will soon be six years old and who is already clad in the uniform of a fusilier of the guard prince william is a soldier in spirit just as harsh toward himself as severe toward others so he is the friend and emulator of prince von bismarck who sees in him the depositary of the military traditions of the house of prussia and who is preparing him by his lessons and his advice to receive and preserve the patrimony that his ancestors have conquered prince william was born january 27 1859 on the 29th of february 1881 he married princess augusta victoria daughter of the duke of sleswickholstein their eldest son little prince william represented with his father in our engraving was born at potsdam may 6 1882lillustration general f perrier francois perrier who was born at valleraugue gard on the 18th of april 1835 descended from an honorable family of protestants of cevennes after finishing his studies at the lyceum of nimes and at st barbe college he was received at the polytechnic school in 1853 and left it in 1857 as a staff officer endowed with perseverance and will he owed all his grades and all his success to his splendid conduct and his important labors lieutenant in 1857 captain in 1860 major of cavalry in 1874 lieutenantcolonel in 1879 he received a year before his death the stars of brigadiergeneral he was commander of the legion of honor and president of the councilgeneral of his department general perrier long ago made a name for himself in science after some remarkable publications upon the trigonometrical junction of france and england 1861 and upon the triangulation and leveling of corsica 1865 he was put at the head of the geodesic service of the army in 1879 in 1880 the learned geodesian was sent as a delegate to the conference of berlin for settling the boundaries of the new grecoturkish frontiers in january of the same year he was elected a member of the academy of sciences as successor to m de tessan he was a member of the bureau of longitudes from 1875 in 1882 perrier was sent to florida to observe the transit of venus thanks to his activity and ability his observations were a complete success thenceforward his celebrity continued to increase until his last triangulating operations in algeria illustration general francois perrier do you not remember said mr janssen recently to the academy of sciences the feeling of satisfaction that the whole country felt when it learned the entire success of that grand geodesic operation that united spain with our algeria over the mediterranean and passed through france a meridian arc extending from the north of england as far as to the sahara that is to say an arc exceeding in length the greatest arcs that had been measured up till then this splendid result attracted all minds and rendered perriers name popular but how much had this success been prepared by long and conscientious labors that cede in nothing to it in importance the triangulation and leveling of corsica and the connecting of it with the continent the splendid operations executed in algeria which required fifteen years of labor and led to the measurement of an arc of parallels of nearly 10 in extent that offers a very peculiar interest for the study of the earths figure and again that revision of the meridian of france in which it became necessary to utilize all the progress that had been made since the beginning of the century in the construction of instruments and in methods of observation and calculation and it must be added that general perrier had formed a school of scientists and devoted officers who were his colaborers and upon whom we must now rely to continue his work the merits of general perrier gained him the honor of being placed at the head of a service of high importance the geographical service of the army to the organization of which he devoted his entire energy in general perrier the man ceded in nothing to the worker and scientist good affable generous he joined liveliness and good humor with courage and energy incessantly occupied with the prosperity and grandeur of his country he knew that true patriotism does not consist in putting forth vain declamations but in endeavoring to accomplish useful and fruitful workla nature general perrier died at montpellier on the 20th of february 1888 the presidents annual address to the royal microscopical society1 footnote 1 delivered by the rev dr dallinger frs at the annual meeting of the royal microscopical society feb 8 1888nature retrospect may involve regret but can scarcely involve anxiety to one who fully appreciates the actual and above all the potential importance of this society in its bearing upon the general progress of scientific research in every field of physical inquiry the responsibilities of president will not be lightly while they may certainly be proudly undertaken i think it may be now fairly taken for granted that as this society has from the outset promoted and pointed to the higher scientific perfection of the microscope so now more than ever it is its special function to place this in the forefront as its raison detre the microscope has been long enough in the hands of amateur and expert alike to establish itself as an instrument having an application to every actual and conceivable department of human research and while in the earliest days of this society it was possible for a zealous fellow to have seen and been more or less familiar with all the applications to which it then had been put it is different today specialists in the most diverse areas of research are assiduously applying the instrument to their various subjects and with results that if we would estimate aright we must survey with instructed vision the whole ground which advancing science covers from this it is manifest that this society cannot hope to infold or at least to organically bind to itself men whose objects of research are so diverse but these are all none the less linked by one inseverable bond it is the microscope and while amid the inconceivable diversity of its applications it remains manifest that this society has for its primary object the constant progress of the instrumentwhether in its mechanical construction or its optical appliances whether the improvements shall bear upon the use of high powers or low powers whether it shall be improvement that shall apply to its commercial employment its easier professional application or its most exalted scientific use so long as this shall be the undoubted aim of the royal microscopical society its existence may well be the pride of englishmen and will commend itself more and more to men of all countries this and this only can lift such a society out of what i believe has ceased to be its danger that of forgetting that in proportion as the optical principles of the microscope are understood and the theory of microscopical vision is made plain the value of the instrument over every region to which it can be applied and in all the varied hands that use it is increased without definable limit it is therefore by such means that the true interests of science are promoted it is one of the most admirable features of this society that it has become cosmopolitan in its character in relation to the instrument and all the everimproving methods of research employed with it from meeting to meeting it is not one country or one continent even that is represented on our tables nay more not only are we made familiar with improvements brought from every civilized part of the world referring alike to the microscope itself and every instrument devised by specialists for its employment in every department of research but also by the admirable persistence of mr crisp and mr jno mayall jr we are familiarized with every discovery of the old forms of the instrument wherever found or originally employed the value of all this cannot be overestimated for it will even where prejudices as to our judgment may exist gradually make it more and more clear that this society exists to promote and acknowledge improvements in every constituent of the microscope come from whatever source they may and in connection with this to promote by demonstrations exhibitions and monographs the finest applications of the finest instruments for their respective purposes to give all this its highest value of course the theoretical side of our instrument must occupy the attention of the most accomplished experts we may not despair that our somewhat too practical past in this respect may right itself in our own country but meantime the splendid work of german students and experts is placed by the wise editors of our journal within the reach of all i know of no higher hope for this important society than that it may continue in ever increasing strength to promote criticise and welcome from every quarter of the world whatever will improve the microscope in itself and in any of its applications from the most simple to the most complex and important in which its employment is possible there are two points of some practical interest to which i desire for a few moments to call your attention the former has reference to the group of organisms to which i have for so many years directed your attention viz the monads which throughout i have called putrefactive organisms there can be no longer any doubt that the destructive process of putrefaction is essentially a process of fermentation the fermentative saprophyte is as absolutely essential to the setting up of destructive rotting or putrescence in a putrescible fluid as the torula is to the setting up of alcoholic fermentation in a saccharine fluid make the presence of torul impossible and you exclude with certainty fermentative action in precisely the same way provide a proteinaceous solution capable of the highest putrescence but absolutely sterilized and placed in an optically pure or absolutely calcined air and while these conditions are maintained no matter what length of time may be suffered to elapse the putrescible fluid will remain absolutely without trace of decay but suffer the slightest infection of the protected and pure air to take place or from some putrescent source inoculate your sterilized fluid with the minutest atom and shortly turbidity offensive scent and destructive putrescence ensue as in the alcoholic lactic or butyric ferments the process set up is shown to be dependent upon and concurrent with the vegetative processes of the demonstrated organisms characterizing these ferments so it can be shown with equal clearness and certainty that the entire process of what is known as putrescence is equally and as absolutely dependent on the vital processes of a given and discoverable series of organisms now it is quite customary to treat the fermentative agency in putrefaction as if it were wholly bacterial and indeed the putrefactive group of bacteria are now known as saprophytes or saprophytic bacteria as distinct from morphologically similar but physiologically dissimilar forms known as parasitic or pathogenic bacteria it is indeed usually and justly admitted that b termo is the exciting cause of fermentative putrefaction cohn has in fact contended that it is the distinctive ferment of all putrefactions and that it is to decomposing proteinaceous solutions what torula cerevisi is to the fermenting fluids containing sugar in a sense this is no doubt strictly true it is impossible to find a decomposing proteinaceous solution at any stage without finding this form in vast abundance but it is well to remember that in nature putrefactive ferments must go on to an extent rarely imitated or followed in the laboratory as a rule the pabulum in which the saprophytic organisms are provided and cultured is infusions or extracts of meat carefully filtered and if vegetable matter is used extracts of fruit treated with equal care and if needful neutralized are used in a similar way to these may be added all the forms of gelatine employed in films masses and so forth but in following the process of destructive fermentation as it takes place in large masses of tissue animal or vegetable but far preferably the former as they lie in water at a constant temperature of from 60 to 65 f it will be seen that the fermentative process is the work not of one organism nor judging by the standard of our present knowledge of one specified class of vegetative forms but by organisms which though related to each other are in many respects greatly dissimilar not only morphologically but also embryologically and even physiologically moreover although this is a matter that will want most thorough and efficient inquiry and research to understand properly its conditions yet it is sufficiently manifest that these organisms succeed each other in a curious and even remarkable manner each does a part in the work of fermentative destruction each aids in splitting up into lower and lower compounds the elements of which the masses of degrading tissue are composed while apparently each set in turn does by vital action coupled with excretion 1 take up the substances necessary for its own growth and multiplication 2 carry on the fermentative process and 3 so change the immediate pabulum as to give rise to conditions suitable for its immediate successor now the point of special interest is that there is an apparent adaptation in the form functions mode of multiplication and order of succession in these fermentative organisms deserving study and fraught with instruction let it be remembered that the aim of nature in this fermentative action is not the partial splitting of certain organic compounds and their reconstruction in simpler conditions but the ultimate setting free by saprophytic action of the elements locked up in great masses of organic tissuethe sending back into nature of the only material of which future organic structures are to be composed i have said that there can be no question whatever that bacterium termo is the pioneer of saprophytes exclude b termo and therefore with it all its congeners and you can obtain no putrefaction but wherever in ordinary circumstances a decomposable organic mass say the body of a fish or a considerable mass of the flesh of a terrestrial animal is exposed in water at a temperature of 60 to 65 f b termo rapidly appears and increases with a simply astounding rapidity it clothes the tissues like a skin and diffuses itself throughout the fluid the exact chemical changes it thus effects are not at present clearly known but the fermentative action is manifestly concurrent with its multiplication it finds its pabulum in the mass it ferments by its vegetative processes but it also produces a visible change in the enveloping fluid and noxious gases continuously are thrown off in the course of a week or more dependent on the period of the year there is not inevitably but as a rule a rapid accession of spiral forms such as spirillum volutans s undula and similar forms often accompanied by bacterium lineola and the whole interspersed still with inconceivable multitudes of b termo these invest the rotting tissues liked an elastic garment but are always in a state of movement these again manifestly further the destructive ferment and bring about a softness and flaccidity in the decomposing tissues while they without doubt at the same time have by their vital activity and possible secretions affected the condition of the changing organic mass there can be so far as my observations go no certainty as to when after this another form of organism will present itself nor when it does which of a limited series it will be but in a majority of observed cases a loosening of the living investment of bacterial forms takes place and simultaneously with this the access of one or two forms of my putrefactive monads they were among the first we worked at and have been by means of recent lenses among the last revised mr s kent named them cercomonas typica and monas dallingeri respectively they are both simple oval forms but the former has a flagellum at both ends of the longer axis of the body while the latter has a single flagellum in front the principal difference is in their mode of multiplication by fission the former is in every way like a bacterium in its mode of selfdivision it divides acquiring for each half a flagellum in division and then in its highest vigor in about four minutes each half divides again the second form does not divide into two but into many and thus although the whole process is slower develops with greater rapidity but both ultimately multiplythat is commence new generationsby the equivalent of a sexual process these would average about four times the size of bacterium termo and when once they gain a place on and about the putrefying tissues their relatively powerful and incessant action their enormous multitude and the manner in which they glide over under and beside each other as they invest the fermenting mass is worthy of close study it has been the life history of these organisms and not their relations as ferment that has specially occupied my fullest attention but it would be in a high degree interesting if we could discover or determine what besides the vegetative or organic processes of nutrition are being effected by one or both of these organisms on the fast yielding mass still more would it be of interest to discover what if any changes were wrought in the pabulum or fluid generally for after some extended observations i have found that it is only after one or other or both of these organisms have performed their part in the destructive ferment that subsequent and extremely interesting changes arise it is true that in some three or four instances of this saprophytic destruction of organic tissues i have observed that after the strong bacterial investment there has arisen not the two forms just named nor either of them but one or other of the striking forms now called tetramitus rostratus and polytoma uvella but this has been in relatively few instances the rule is that cercomonas typica or its congener precedes other forms that not only succeed them in promoting and carrying to a still further point the putrescence of the fermenting substance but appear to be aided in the accomplishment of this by mechanical means by this time the mass of tissue has ceased to cohere the mass has largely disintegrated and there appears among the countless bacterial and monad forms some one and sometimes even three forms that while they at first swim and gyrate and glide about the decomposing matter which is now much less closely invested by cercomonas typica or those organisms that may have acted in its place they also resort to an entirely new mode of movement one of these forms is heteromita rostrata which it will be remembered in addition to a front flagellum has also a long fiber or flagellumlike appendage that gracefully trails as it swims at certain periods of its life they anchor themselves in countless billions all over the fermenting tissues and as i have described in the life history of this form they coil their anchored fiber as does a vorticellan bringing the body to the level of the point of anchorage then shoot out the body with lightninglike rapidity and bring it down like a hammer on some point of the decomposition it rests here for a second or two and repeats the process and this is taking place by what seems almost like rhythmic movement all over the rotting tissue the results are scarcely visible in the mass but if a group of these organisms be watched attached to a small particle of the fermenting tissue it will be seen to gradually diminish and at length to disappear now there are at least two other similar forms one of which heteromita uncinata is similar in action and the other of which dallingeria drysdali is much more powerful being possessed of a double anchor and springing down upon the decadent mass with relatively far greater power now it is under the action of these last forms that in a period varying from one month to two or three the entire substance of the organic tissues disappears and the decomposition has been designated by me exhausted nothing being left in the vessel but slightly noxious and pale gray water charged with carbonic acid and a fine buff colored impalpable sediment at the bottom my purpose is not by this brief notice to give an exhaustive or even a sufficient account of the progress of fermentative action by means of saprophytic organisms on great masses of tissue my observations have been incidental but they lead me to the conclusion that the fermentative process is not only not carried through by what are called saprophytic bacteria but that a series of fermentative organisms arise which succeed each other the earlier ones preparing the pabulum or altering the surrounding medium so as to render it highly favorable to a succeeding form on the other hand the succeeding form has a special adaptation for carrying on the fermentative destruction more efficiently from the period at which it arises and thus ultimately of setting free the chemical elements locked up in dead organic compounds that these later organisms are saprophytic although not bacterial there can be no doubt a set of experiments recorded by me in the proceedings of this society some years since would go far to establish this monthly microscopical journal 1876 p 288 but it may be readily shown by extremely simple experiments that these forms will set up fermentative decomposition rapidly if introduced in either a desiccated or living condition or in the spore state into suitable but sterilized pabulum thus while we have specific ferments which bring about definite and specific results and while even infusions of proteid substances may be exhaustively fermented by saprophytic bacteria the most important of all ferments that by which natures dead organic masses are removed is one which there is evidence to show is brought about by the successive vital activities of a series of adapted organisms which are forever at work in every region of the earth there is one other matter of some interest and moment on which i would say a few words to thoroughly instructed biologists such words will be quite needless but in a society of this kind the possibilities that lie in the use of the instrument are associated with the contingency of large error especially in the biology of the minuter forms of life unless a well grounded biological knowledge form the basis of all specific inference to say nothing of deduction i am the more encouraged to speak of the difficulty to which i refer because i have reason to know that it presents itself again and again in the provincial societies of the country and is often adhered to with a tenacity worthy of a better cause i refer to the danger that always exists that young or occasional observers are exposed to amid the complexities of minute animal and vegetable life of concluding that they have come upon absolute evidences of the transformation of one minute form into another that in fact they have demonstrated cases of heterogenesis this difficulty is not diminished by the fact that on the shelves of most microscopical societies there is to be found some sort of literature written in support of this strange doctrine you will pardon me for allusion again to the field of inquiry in which i have spent so many happy hours it is as you know a region of life in which we touch as it were the very margin of living things if nature were capricious anywhere we might expect to find her so here if her methods were in a slovenly or only half determined condition we might expect to find it here but it is not so know accurately what you are doing use the precautions absolutely essential and through years of the closest observation it will be seen that the vegetative and vital processes generally of the very simplest and lowliest life forms are as much directed and controlled by immutable laws as the most complex and elevated the life cycles accurately known of monads repeat themselves as accurately as those of rotifers or planarians and of course on the very surface of the matter the question presents itself to the biologist why it should not be so the irrefragable philosophy of modern biology is that the most complex forms of living creatures have derived their splendid complexity and adaptations from the slow and majestically progressive variation and survival from the simpler and the simplest forms if then the simplest forms of the present and the past were not governed by accurate and unchanging laws of life how did the rigid certainties that manifestly and admittedly govern the more complex and the most complex come into play if our modern philosophy of biology be as we know it is true then it must be very strong evidence indeed that would lead us to conclude that the laws seen to be universal break down and cease accurately to operate where the objects become microscopic and our knowledge of them is by no means full exhaustive and clear moreover looked at in the abstract it is a little difficult to conceive why there should be more uncertainty about the life processes of a group of lowly living things than there should be about the behavior in reaction of a given group of molecules the triumph of modern knowledge is the certainty which nothing can shake that natures laws are immutable the stability of her processes the precision of her action and the universality of her laws is the basis of all science to which biology forms no exception once establish by clear and unmistakable demonstration the life history of an organism and truly some change must have come over nature as a whole if that life history be not the same tomorrow as today and the same to one observer in the same conditions as to another no amount of paradox would induce us to believe that the combining proportions of hydrogen and oxygen had altered in a specified experimenters hands in synthetically producing water we believe that the melting point of platinum and the freezing point of mercury are the same as they were a hundred years ago and as they will be a hundred years hence now carefully remember that so far as we can see at all it must be so with life life inheres in protoplasm but just as you cannot get abstract matterthat is matter with no properties or modes of motionso you cannot get abstract protoplasm every piece of living protoplasm we see has a history it is the inheritor of countless millions of years its properties have been determined by its history it is the protoplasm of some definite form of life which has inherited its specific history it can be no more false to that inheritance than an atom of oxygen can be false to its properties all this of course within the lines of the great secular processes of the darwinian laws which by the way could not operate at all if caprice formed any part of the activities of nature but let me give a practical instance of how what appears like fact may override philosophy if an incident or even a group of incidents per se are to control our judgment eighteen years ago i was paying much attention to vorticell i was observing with some pertinacity vorticella convallaria for one of the calices in a group under observation was in a strange and semiencysted state while the remainder were in full normal activity i watched with great interest and care and have in my folio still the drawings made at the time the stalk carrying this individual calyx fell upon the branch of vegetable matter to which the vorticellan was attached and the calyx became perfectly globular and at length there emerged from it a small form with which in this condition i was quite unfamiliar it was small tortoiselike in form and crept over the branch on set or hairlike pedicels but carefully followed i found it soon swam and at length got the long necklike appendage of amphileptus anser here then was the cup or calyx of a definite vorticellan form changing into an absolutely different infusorian viz amphileptus anser now i simply reported the fact to the liverpool microscopical society with no attempt at inference but two years after i was able to explain the mystery for finding in the same pond both v convallaria and a anser i carefully watched their movements and saw the amphileptus seize and struggle with a calyx of convallaria and absolutely become encysted upon it with the results that i had reported two years before and there can be no doubt but this is the key to the cases that come to us again and again of minute forms suddenly changing into forms wholly unlike it is happily among the virtues of the man of science to rejoice in the truth even though it be found at his expense and true workers earnest seekers for natures methods in the obscurest fields of her action will not murmur that this source of danger to younger microscopists has been pointed out or recalled to them and now i bid you as your president farewell it has been all pleasure to me to serve you it has enlarged my friendships and my interests and although my work has linked me with the society for many years i have derived much profit from this more organic union with it and it is a source of encouragement to me and will i am sure be to you that after having done with simple pleasure what i could i am to be succeeded in this place of honor by so distinguished a student of the phenomena of minute life as dr hudson i can but wish him as happy a tenure of office as mine has been inquiries regarding the incubator ph jacobs space in the rural is valuable and so important a subject as artificial incubation cannot perhaps be made entirely plain to a novice in a few articles but as interested parties have written for additional information it may interest others to answer them here among the questions asked are does the incubator described in the rural dispense entirely with the use of a lamp using at intervals a bucket of water to maintain proper temperature i fear this will not be satisfactory unless the incubator is kept in a warm room or cellar all incubators must be kept in a warm location whether operated by a lamp or otherwise the warmer the room or cellar the less warmth required to be supplied bear in mind that the incubator recommended has four inches of sawdust surrounding it and more sawdust would still be an advantage the sawdust is not used to protect against the outside temperature but to absorb and hold a large amount of heat and that is the secret of its success the directions given were to first fill the tank with boiling water and allow it to remain for 24 hours in the meantime the sawdust absorbs the heat and more boiling water is then added until the eggdrawer is about 110 or 115 degrees by this time there is a quantity of stored heat in the sawdust the eggs will cool the drawer to 103 the loss of heat due to its being held by the sawdust will be very slow all that is needed then is to supply that which will be lost in 12 hours and a bucket of boiling water should keep the heat about correct if added twice a day but it may require more as some consideration must be given to fluctuations of the temperature of the atmosphere the third week of incubation owing to animal heat from the embryo chicks a bucket of boiling water will sometimes hold temperature for 24 hours no objection can be urged against attaching a lamp arrangement but a lamp is dangerous at night while the flame must be regulated according to temperature the object of giving the hot water method was to avoid lamps we have a large number of them in use no lamps here and they are equal to any others in results with all due respect to some inquirers the majority of them seem afraid of the work now there is some work with all incubators what is desired is to get rid of the anxiety i stated that a bucket of water twice a day would suffice i trusted to the judgment of the reader somewhat of course if the heat in the egg drawer is 90 degrees and the weather cold it may then take a wash boiler full of water to get the temperature back to 103 degrees but when it is at 103 keep it there even if it occasionally requires two buckets of boiling water to judge of what may be required let us suppose the operator looks at the thermometer in the morning and it is exactly 103 degrees he estimates that it will lose a little by night and draws off half a bucket of water at night he finds it at 102 knowing that it is on what we term the down grade he applies a bucket and a half always allowing for the night being colder than the day as stated the sawdust will not allow the drawer to become too cold as it gives off heat to the drawer and as the sawdust absorbs it is not easy to have the heat too high one need not even look at the drawer until the proper times no watchingthe incubator regulates itself if a lamp is used too much heat may accumulate the flame must be occasionally turned up or down and the operator must remain at home and watch it while during the third week he will easily cook his eggs the incubator can be made at home for so small a sum about 5 for the tank 1 for faucet etc with 116 feet of lumber that it will cost but little to try it a piece of glass can be placed in front of the egg drawer if preferred if the heat goes down to 90 or rises at times to 105 no harm is done but it works well and hatches the proof being that hundreds are in use i did not give the plan as a theory or an experiment they are in practical use here and work alongside of the more expensive ones and have been in use for four years to use a lamp attachment all that is necessary is to have a no 2 burner lamp with a riveted sheetiron chimney the chimney fitting over the flame like an ordinary globe and extending the chimney using an elbow through the tank from the rear ending in front it should be soldered at the tank the heat from the lamp will then pass through the chimney and consequently warm the surrounding waterrural newyorker for description and illustrations of this incubator see supplement no 630 the peak of teneriffe the hon ralph abercromby made a trip to the island of teneriffe in october 1887 for the purpose of making some electrical and meteorological observations and now gives some of the results which he obtained which may be summarized as follows the electrical condition of the peak of teneriffe was found to be the same as in every other part of the world the potential was moderately positive from 100 to 150 volts at 5 ft 5 in from the ground even at considerable altitudes but the tension rose to 549 volts on the summit of the peak 12200 ft and to 247 volts on the top of the rock of gayga 7100 feet a large number of halos were seen associated with local showers and cloud masses the necessary ice dust appeared to be formed by rising currents the shadow of the peak was seen projected against the sky at sunset the idea of a southwest current flowing directly over the northeast trade was found to be erroneous there was always a regular vertical succession of air currents in intermediate directions at different levels from the surface upward so that the air was always circulating on a complicated screw system estrades high speed locomotive we illustrate a very remarkable locomotive which has been constructed from the designs of m estrade a french engineer this engine was exhibited last year in paris although the engine was built m estrade could not persuade any railway company to try it for him and finally he applied to the french government who have at last sanctioned the carrying out of experiments with it on one of the state railway lines the engine is in all respects so opposed to english ideas that we have hitherto said nothing about it as however it is going to be tried an importance is given to it which it did not possess before and as a mechanical curiosity we think it is worth the consideration of our readers in order that we may do m estrade no injustice we reproduce here in a condensed form and in english the arguments in its favor contained in a paper written by m max de nansouty ce who brought m estrades views before the french institution of civil engineers on may 21 1886 m nansoutys paper has been prepared with much care and contains a great deal of useful data quite apart from the estrade engine the paper in question is entitled memoire relatif au materiel roulant a grand vitesse dm estrade about thirty years ago m estrade formerly pupil of the polytechnic school invented rolling stock for high speed under especial conditions and capable of leading to important results more especially with regard to speed following step by step the progress made in the construction of railway stock the inventor from time to time modified and improved his original plan and finally in 1884 arrived at the conception of a system entirely new in its fundamental principles and in its execution a description of this system is the object of the memoir the great number of types of locomotives and carriages now met with in france england and the united states renders it difficult to combine their advantages as m estrade proposed to do in a system responding to the requirements of the constructor his principal object however has been to construct under specially favorable conditions a locomotive tender and rolling stock adapted to each other so as to establish a perfect accord between these organs when in motion it is in fact a complete train and not as sometimes supposed a locomotive only of an especial type which has been the object he set before him before entering into other considerations we shall first give a description of the stock proposed by m estrade the idea of the invention consists in the use of coupled wheels of large diameter and in the adoption of a new system of double suspension the locomotive and tender we illustrate were constructed by mm boulet co the locomotive is carried on six driving wheels 8 feet 3 inches in diameter the total weight of the engine is thus utilized for adhesion the accompanying table gives the principal dimensions table i ft in total length of engine 32 8 width between frames 4 1 wheel base total 16 9 diameter of cylinder 1 6 length of stroke 2 3 grate surface 25 sq feet total heating surface 1400 sq ft weight empty 38 tons weight full 42 tons the high speeds77 to 80 miles an hourin view of which this stock has been constructed have it will be seen caused the elements relative to the capacity of the boiler and the heating surfaces to be developed as much as possible it is in this in fact that one of the great difficulties of the problem lies the practical limit of stability being fixed by the diameter of the driving wheels speed can only be obtained by an expenditure of steam which soon becomes such as rapidly to exhaust the engine unless the heating surface is very large the tender also fitted with wheels of 8 ft 3 in in diameter offers no particular feature it is simply arranged so as to carry the greatest quantity of coal and water m estrade has also designed carriages one has been constructed by mm reynaud bechade gire co which has very few points in common with those in general use independently of the division of the compartments into two stories wheels 8 ft 3 in in diameter are employed and the double system of suspension adopted two axles 16 ft apart support by means of plate springs an iron framing running from end to end over the whole length its extremities being curved toward the ground each frame carries in its turn three other plate springs to which the body is suspended by means of iron tierods serving to support it this is then a double suspension which at once appears to be very superior to the systems adopted up to the present time the great diameter of the wheels has necessitated the division into two stories the lower story is formed of three equal parts lengthened toward the axles by narrow compartments which can be utilized for luggage or converted into lavatories etc above is one single compartment with a central passage which is reached by staircases at the end all the vehicles of the same train are to be united at this level by jointed platforms furnished with hand rails it is sufficient to point out the general disposition without entering into details which do not affect the system and which must vary for the different classes and according to the requirements of the service illustration m estrades high speed locomotive m nansouty draws a comparison between the diameters of the driving wheels and cylinders of the principal locomotives now in use and those of the estrade engine as set forth in the following table we only give the figures for coupled engines table ii diameter of size of driving wheels cylinder position of ft in in in cylinder great eastern 7 0 18 24 inside southeastern 7 0 19 26 glasgow and southwestern 6 1 18 26 midland 1884 7 0 19 26 northeastern 7 0 17 24 london and northwestern 6 6 17 24 lancashire and yorkshire 6 0 17 26 north british 6 4 17 24 nord 7 0 17 24 parisorleans 1884 6 8 17 23 outside ouest 6 0 17 25 this table the examination of which will be found very instructive shows that there are already in use for locomotives with single drivers diameters of 9 ft 8 ft 1 in and 8 ft 2 for locomotives with four coupled wheels diameters 6 ft to 7 ft there is therefore an important difference between the diameters of the coupled wheels of 7 ft and those of 8 ft 3 in as conceived by m estrade however the transition is not illogically sudden and if the conception is a bold one it cannot says m nansouty on the other hand be qualified as rash he goes on to consider in the first place especial types of uncoupled wheels the diameters of which form useful samples for our present case the engines of the bristol and exeter line are express tender engines adopted on the english lines in 1853 some specimens of which are still in use1 these engines have ten wheels the single drivers in the center 9 ft in diameter and a fourwheeled bogie at each end the driving wheels have no flanges the bogie wheels are 4 ft in diameter the cylinders have a diameter of 16 in and a piston stroke of 24 in the boiler contains 180 tubes and the total weight of the engine is 42 tons these locomotives constructed for 7 ft gauge have attained a speed of seventyseven miles per hour footnote 1 m nansouty is mistaken none of the bristol and exeter tank engines with 9 ft wheels are in use so far as we know ed e the single driver locomotives of the great northern are powerful engines in current use in england the driving wheels carry 17 tons the heating surface is 1160 square feet the diameters of the cylinders 18 in and that of the driving wheels 8 ft 1 in we have here then a diameter very near to that adopted by m estrade and which together with the previous example forms a precedent of great interest the locomotive of the great northern has a leading fourwheeled bogie which considerably increases the steadiness of the engine and counterbalances the disturbing effect of outside cylinders acting on the same principles which have animated m estrade that is to say with the aim of reducing the retarding effects of rolling friction the constructor of the locomotive of the great northern has considerably increased the diameter of the wheels of the bogie in this engine all the bearing are inside while the cylinders are outside and horizontal the tender has six wheels also of large dimensions it is capable of containing three tons and a half of coal and about 3000 gallons of water this type of engine is now in current and daily use in england m nansouty next considers the broad gauge great western engines with 8 ft driving wheels the diameters of their wheels approach those of m estrade and exceed considerably in size any lately proposed m nansouty dwells especially upon the boiler power of the great western railway because one of the objections made to m estrades locomotive by the learned societies has been the difficulty of supplying boiler power enough for high speeds contemplated and he deals at considerable length with a large number of english engines of maximum power the dimensions and performance of which are too well known to our readers to need reproduction here aware that a prominent weak point in m estrades design is that no matter what size we make cylinders and wheels we have ultimately to depend on the boiler for power m nansouty argues that m estrade having provided more surface than is to be found in any other engine must be successful but the total heating surface in the engine which we illustrate is but 1400 square feet while that of the great western engines on which he lays such stress is 2300 square feet and the table which he gives of the heating surface of various english engines really means very little it is quite true that there are no engines working in england with much over 1500 square feet of surface except those on the broad gauge but it does not follow that because they manage to make an average of 53 miles an hour that an addition of 500 square feet would enable them to run at a speed higher by 20 miles an hour there are engines in france however which have as much as 1600 square feet as for example on the parisorleans line but we have never heard that these engines attain a speed of 80 miles an hour leaving the question of boiler power m nansouty goes on to consider the question of adhesion about this he says is the locomotive proposed by m estrade under abnormal conditions as to weight and adhesion this appears to have been doubted especially taking into consideration its height and elegant appearance we shall again reply here by figures while remarking that the adhesion of locomotives increases with the speed according to laws still unknown or imperfectly understood and that consequently for extreme speeds ignorance of the value of the coefficiency of adhesion f in the formula d 2 i fp 065 p r d renders it impossible to pronounce upon it before the trials earnestly and justly demanded by the author of this new system in present practice f 17 is admitted m nansouty gives in a table a resume of the experience on this subject and goes on the english engineers as will be seen make a single axle support more than 17 tons in france the maximum weight admitted is 14 tons and the constructor of the estrade locomotive has kept a little below this figure the question of total weight appears to be secondary in a great measure for taking the models with uncoupled wheels the english engines for great speed have on an average for a smaller total weight an adhesion equal to that of the french locomotives the plm type of engine which has eight wheels four of which are coupled throws only 286 tons upon the latter being 58 per cent of the total weight on the other hand that of the english great eastern throws 68 per cent of the total weight on the driving wheels numerous other examples could be cited we cannot we repeat give an opinion rashly as to the calculation of adhesion for the high speed estrade locomotive before complete trials have taken place which will enable us to judge of the particular coefficients for this entirely new case m nansouty then goes on to consider the question of curves and says it has been asked not without reason notably by the institution of civil engineers of paris whether peculiar difficulties will not be met with by m estrades locomotivewith its three axles and large coupled wheelsin getting round curves we have seen in the preceding tables that the driving wheels of the english locomotives with independent wheels are as much as 8 ft in diameter the driving wheels of the english locomotives with four coupled wheels are 7 ft in diameter m estrades locomotive has certainly six coupled wheels with diameters never before tried but these six coupled wheels constitute the whole rolling length while in the above engines a leading axle or a bogie must be taken into account independent it is true but which must not be lost sight of and which will in a great measure equalize the difficulties of passing over the curves is it opposed to absolute security to attack the line with driving wheels this generally admitted principle appears to rest rather on theoretic considerations than on the results of actual experience m estrade besides sets in opposition to the disadvantages of attacking the rails with driving wheels those which ensue from the use of wheels of small diameter as liable to more wear and tear we should further note with particular care that the leading axle of this locomotive has a certain transverse play also that it is a driving axle this disposition is judicious and in accordance with the best known principles a careful perusal of m nansoutys memoir leaves us in much doubt as to what m estrades views are based on so far as we understand him he seems to have worked on the theory that by the use of very large wheels the rolling resistance of a train can be greatly diminished on this point however there is not a scrap of evidence derived from railway practice to prove that any great advantage can be gained by augmenting the diameters of wheels in the next place he is afraid that he will not have adhesion enough to work up all his boiler power and consequently he couples his wheels thereby greatly augmenting the resistance of the engine he forgets that large coupled wheels were tried years ago on the great western railway and did not answer a single pair of drivers 8 ft 3 in in diameter would suffice to work up all the power m estrades boiler could supply at sixty miles an hour much less eighty miles an hour on the london and brighton line mr stroudley uses with success coupled leading wheels of large diameter on his express engines and we imagine that m estrades engine will get round corners safely enough but it is not the right kind of machine for eighty miles an hour and so he will find out as soon as a trial is made the experiment is however a notable experiment and m estrade has our best wishes for his successthe engineer concrete1 footnote 1 read july 5 1887 before the western society of engineers by john lundie the subject of cement and concrete has been so well treated of in engineering literature that to give an extended paper on the subject would be but the collection and reiteration of platitudes familiar to every engineer who has been engaged on foundation works of any magnitude it shall therefore be the object of this communication to place before the society several notes stated briefly and to the point rather as a basis for discussion than as an attempt at an exhaustive treatment of the subject concrete is simply a low grade of masonry it is a comparatively simple matter to trace the line of continuity from heavy squared ashlar blocks down through coursed and random rubble to grouted indiscriminate rubble and finally to concrete improvements in the manufacture of hydraulic cements have given an impetus to the use of concrete but its use is by no means of recent date it is no uncommon thing in the taking down of heavy walls several centuries old to find that the method of building was to carry up face and back with rubble and stiff mortar and to fill the interior with bowlders and gravel the interstices of which were filled by groutingthe whole mass becoming virtually a monolith modern quicksetting cement accomplishes this object within a time consistent with the requirements of modern engineering works the formation of a monolithic mass within a reasonable time and with materials requiring as little handling as possible being the desideratum the materials of concrete as used at present are cement sand gravel broken stone and of course water it is perhaps unnecessary to say that one of the primary requirements in materials is that they should be clean stone should be angular gravel well washed sand coarse and sharp cement fine and possessing a fair proportion of the requirements laid down in the orthodox specification the addition of lime water saccharated or otherwise has been suggested as an improvement over water pure and simple but no satisfactory experiments are on record justifying the addition of lime water regarding the mixing of cement and lime with saccharated water the writer made some experiments several months ago by mixing neat cement and lime with pure water and with saccharated water with the result that the sugar proved positively detrimental to the cement while it increased the tenacity of briquettes of lime stone which will pass a 2 inch is usually specified for ordinary concrete it will be found that stone broken to this limit of size has fifty per cent of its bulk voids this space must be filled by mortar or preferably by gravel and mortar if the mixing of concrete is perfect the proportion of stone by bulk to other materials should be two to one a percentage excess of other materials is however usually allowed to compensate for imperfection in mixing while an excess of good mortar is not detrimental to concrete as it will harden in course of time to equal the stone still on the score of economy it is advisable to use gravel or a finer grade of stone in addition to the 2 inch ring stone to fill the intersticesgravel is cheaper than cement the statement that excess in stone will give body to concrete is a fallacy hardly worth contradicting in short the proportion of material should be so graded that each particle of sand should have its jacket of cement necessitating the cement being finer than the sand this forms the mortar then each pebble and stone should have its jacket of mortar the smaller the interstices between the gravel and stones the better the quantity of water necessary to make good concrete is a sorely debated question the quantity necessary depends on various considerations and will probably be different for what appears to be the same proportion of materials it is a well known fact that brick mortar is made very soft and bricks are often wet before being laid while a very hard stone is usually set with very stiff mortar so in concrete the amount of water necessarily depends to a great extent on the porosity or dryness of the stone and other material used but as to using a larger or smaller quantity of water with given materials as a matter of observation it will be found that the water should only be limited by its effect in washing away mortar from the stone where can better concrete be found than that which has set under water a certain definite amount of water is necessary and sufficient to hydrate the cement less than that amount will be detrimental while an excess can do no harm provided as before mentioned that it does not wash the mortar from the stone again dry concrete is apt to be very porous which in certain positions is a very grave objection to itthis not only from the fact of its porosity but from the liability to disintegration from water freezing in the crevices concrete when ready to be placed in position should be of the consistency of a pulpy mass which will settle into place by its own weight every crevice being naturally filled pounding dry concrete is apt to break adjacent work which will never again set properly there should be no other object in pounding concrete than to assist it to settle into the place it is intended to fill this is one of the evils concomitant with imperfection of mixing the greater perfection of mixing attained the nearer we get to the ideal monolith the less handling concrete has after being mixed the better immediately after the mass is mixed setting commences therefore the sooner it is in position the more perfect will be the hardened mass and on the other hand the more it is handled the more is the process interrupted and in like degree is the finished mass deteriorated a low drop will be found the best method of placing a batch in position too much of a drop scatters the material and undoes the work of thorough mixing let the mass drop and then let it alone if of proper temper it will find its own place with very little trimming care should be taken to wet adjacent porous material or the wooden form into which concrete is being placed otherwise the water may be extracted from the concrete to its detriment it has been found on removing boxing that the portion adjacent to the wood was frequently friable and of poor quality owing to the fact just stated it is usual to face or plaster concrete work after removing the boxing on breakwater work where the writer was engaged the wall was faced with cement and flint grit and this was found to form a particularly hard and lasting protection to the face of the work batches of concrete should be placed in position as if they were stones in block masonry as the union of one days work with a previous is not by any means so perfect as where one batch is placed in contact with another which has not yet set a slope cannot be added to with the same degree of perfection that one horizontal layer can be placed on another consequently where work must necessarily be interrupted it should be stepped and not sloped off experience in concrete work has shown that its true place is in heavy foundations retaining walls and such like and then perfectly independent of other material arches thin walls and such like are very questionable structures in continuous concrete and are on record rather as failures than otherwise this may to a certain degree be due to the high coefficient of expansion portland cement concrete has by heat this was found by cunningham to be 0000005 of its bulk for one degree fahrenheit it is a matter which any intelligent observer may remark the invariable breakage of continuous concrete sidewalks while those made in small sections remain good this may be traced to expansion and contraction by heat together with friction on the lower side in foundations according to the same authority above quoted properly made portland cement concrete may be trusted with a safe load of 25 tons per square foot in large masses concrete should be worked continuously while in small masses it should be moulded in small sections which should be independent of each other and simply form artificial stones the facility with which concrete can be used in founding under water renders it particularly suitable for subaqueous structures the method of dropping it from hopper barges in masses of 100 tons at a time inclosed in a bag of coarse stuff has been successfully employed by dyce cay and others this can be carried on till the concrete appears above water when the ordinary method of boxing can be employed to complete the work this method was employed in the north pier breakwater at aberdeen the breakwater being founded on the sand with a very broad base the advantage of bags is apparent in the leveling off of an uneven foundation in breakwater works on the tay in scotland where the writer was engaged large blocks perforated vertically were employed these were constructed below high water mark and an air tight cover placed over them they were lifted by pontoons as the tide rose and conveyed to and deposited in place the hollows being filled with air serving to give buoyancy to the mass after placing in position the vertical hollows were filled with concrete so binding the whole togetherthey being placed vertically over each other as mentioned before continuous stretches of concrete in small sections should be guarded against owing to expansion by heat but the fact of a few cracks appearing in heavy masses of concrete should not cause apprehension these occur from unequal settlement and other causes they should continue to be carefully grouted and faced until settlement is complete the use of concrete is becoming more and more general for foundation works the desideratum hitherto has been a perfect and at the same time an economical mixer concrete can be mixed by hand and the materials well incorporated but this is an expensive and mankilling method as the handling of the wet mass by the shovel is extremely hard work besides which the slowness of the method allows part of a large batch to set before the other is mixed so that small batches with attendant extra handling are necessary to make a good job mixers with a multiplicity of knives to toss the material have been used but with little economical success of simple conveyers such as a worm screw little need be said they are not mixers and it seems a positive waste of time to pass material through a machine when it comes out in little better shape than it is put in a box of the shape of a barrel has been used it being trunnioned at the sides the objection to this is that the material is thrown from side to side as a mass there being a waste of energy in throwing about the material in mass without accomplishing an equivalent amount of mixing then a rectangular box has been used trunnioned at opposite corners but here the grave objection is that the concrete collects in the corners and after a few turns it requires cleaning out the material so sticking in the corners that it gets clogged up and ceases to mix the writer has just protected by letters patent a machine in devising which the following objects were borne in mind 1st that every motion of the machine should do some useful work hitherto box or barrel mixers have gone on the principle of throwing the material about indiscriminately expecting that somehow or other it would get mixed 2d that the sticking of the material anywhere within the mixer should be obviated 3d that an easy discharge should be obtained 4th that the water should be introduced while the mixer revolves with these desiderata in view a box was designed which in half a turn gathers the material then spreads it and throws it from one side to the other at the same time that water is being introduced through a hollow trunnion it is also so constructed that all the sides slope steeply toward the discharge and there is not a rectangular or acute angle within the box a machine has now been worked steadily for several weeks putting in the concrete in the foundations of the new jackson street bridge in this city by general fitzsimons the result exceeds expectations the concrete is perfectly mixed the discharge is simple complete and effective and at the same time the cost of labor in mixing and placing in position is lessened by 50 per cent as compared with any known to have been put in under similar circumstancesjour association of engineering societies machine designing1 footnote 1 a lecture delivered before the franklin institute philadelphia monday jan 30 1888 from the journal of the institute by john e sweet carrying coals to newcastle the oft quoted comparison fittingly indicates the position i place myself in when attempting to address members of this institute on the subject of machine designing philadelphia the birthplace of the great and nearly all the good work in this the noblest of all industrial arts needs no help or praise at my hands but i hope her sons may be prevailed upon to do in their right way what i shall try to do roughlythat is formulate some rules or establish principles by which we who are not endowed with genius may so gauge our work as to avoid doing that which is truly bad no great author was ever made by studying grammar rhetoric language history or by imitating some other author however great neither has there ever been any great poet or artist produced by training but there are many writers who are not great authors many rhymsters who are not poets and many painters who are not artists and while training will not make great men of them it will help them to avoid doing that which is absolutely bad and so may it not be with machine designing if there are among you some who have a genius for it what i shall have to say will do you no good for genius needs no rules no laws no help no training and the sooner you let what i have to say pass from your minds the better rules only hamper the man of genius but for us who either from choice or necessity work away at machine designing without the gift cannot some simple ruling facts be determined and rules formulated or principles laid down by which we can determine what is really good and what bad one of the most important and one of the first things in the construction of a building is the foundation and the laws which govern its construction can be stated in a breath and ought to be understood by every one assuming the ground upon which a building is to be built to be of uniform density the width of the foundation should be in proportion to the load the foundation should taper equally on each side and the center of the foundation should be under the center of pressure in other words it is as fatal to success to have too much foundation under the light load as it is too little under a heavy one cannot we analyze causes and effects cost and requirements so as to formulate some simple laws similar to the above by which we shall be able to determine what is a good and what a bad arrangement of machinery foundation framing or supports a vast amount of work is expended to make machines true and the machines or a large majority of them are expected to produce true work of some kind in turn then if this be admitted cannot the following law be established that every machine should be so designed and constructed that when once made true it will so remain regardless of wear and all external influences to which it is liable to be subjected one tool maker says that it is right and another that it cannot be done no matter whether it can or cannot is it not the thing wanted and if so is it not an object worth striving for one tool maker says that all machine tools engines and machinery should set on solid stone foundations should they they do not always for in substantial philadelphia some machine tools used by machine builders stand upon second floors or perhaps higher up and of these machine tools none or few at least except those mounted upon a single pedestal are free from detrimental torsion where the floor upon which they rest is distorted by unequal loading but to first consider those of such magnitude as to render it absolutely necessary to erect themnot rest themon masonry is due consideration always taken to arrange an unequal foundation to support the unequal loadsand they cannot be expected to remain true if not when one has the good fortune to have a machine to design of such extent that the masonry becomes the main part of it what part of the glory does he give to the mason is the masonry part of it always satisfactory and is not this resorting to the mason for a frame rather than a support adopted on smaller machines than is necessary is it necessary even in a planing machine of forty feet length of bed and a thirty foot table could not the bed be cast in three pieces the center a rectangular box 5 or 6 or 7 feet square 20 feet long with internal end flanges ways planed on its upper surface and ends squared off a monster perhaps but if our civil engineers wanted such a casting for a bridge theyd get it add to this central section two bevel pieces of half the length and set the whole down through the floor where your masonry would have been and rest the whole on two cross walls and you would have a structure that if once made true would remain so regardless of external influences cost yes and so do frodsham watchesmore than waterbury it may be claimed in fact i have seen lathes resting on six and eight feet engines on ten and a planing machine on a dozen do they remain true sometimes they do and many times they do not is the principle right not when it can be avoided and when it cannot be avoided the true principle of foundation building should be employed a strange example of depending on the stone foundation for not simply support but to resist strain may be found in the machines used for beveling the edges of boiler plate not so particularly strange that the first one might have like topsy growed but strange because each builder copies the original you will remember it a complete machine set upon a stone foundation to straighten and hold a plate and another complete machine set down by the side of it and bolted to the same stone to plane off the edge a lot of wasted material and a lot of wasted genius it always seems to me going around robin hoods barn is the old comparison why not hook the tool carriage on the side of the clamping structure and thus dispense with one of the frames altogether many of the modern builders of what chordal calls the hyphen corliss engine claim to have made a great advance by putting a post under the center of the frame but whether in acknowledgment that the frame would be likely to go down or the stonework come up i could never make out what i should fear would be that the stone would come up and take the frame with it every brick mason knows better than to bed mortar under the center of a window sill and this putting a prop under the center of an engine girder seems a parallel case they say mr corliss would have done the same thing if he had thought of it i do not believe it if mr corliss had found his frames too weak he would soon have found a way to make them stronger john richards once a resident of this city and likely the best designer of woodworking machinery this country if not the world ever saw pointed out in some of his letters the true form for constructing machine framing and in a way that it had never been forced on my mind before as dozens yes hundreds of new designs have been brought out by machine tool makers and engine builders since john richards made a convert of me without any one else so far as i know having applied the principle in its broadest sense i hope to present the case to you in a material form in the hope that it may be more thoroughly appreciated the usual form of lathe and planer beds or frames is two side plates and a lot of cross girts their duty is to guide the carriages or tables in straight lines and carry loads resisting bending and torsional strains if a designer desires to make his lathe frame stronger than the other fellows he thinks if he thinks at all that he will put in more iron rather than as he ought to think how shall i distribute the iron so it will do the most good in illustration of this peculiar way of doing things which is not wholly confined to machine designers i should like to relate a story and as i had to carry the large end of the joke it may do for me to tell it while occupying a prominent position and yet compelled to carry my dinner my wife thought the common dinner pail with which you are probably familiar by sight of course was not quite the thing for a professor even by brevet to be seen carrying through the streets so she interviewed the tinsmith to see if he could not get up something a little more tony than the regulation fiftycent sort oh yes he could do that very nicely how much would the best one he could make cost well if she could stand the racket he could make one worth a dollar she thought she could and the pail was ordered made and delivered with pride perhaps you can guess the result a facsimile of the original only twice the size now this is a very fair illustration of the fallacy of making things stronger by simply adding iron to illustrate what i think a much better way i have had made these crude models see fig 1 for the full force of which as i said before i am indebted to john richards and i would here add that the mechanic who has never learned anything from john richards is either a very good or very poor one or has never read what john richards has written or heard what he has had to say three models as shown in fig 1 were exhibited all were of the same general dimensions and containing the same amount of material the one made on the box principle c proved to be fifty per cent stiffer in a vertical direction than either a or b from twenty to fifty times stiffer sidewise and thirteen times more rigid against torsion than either of the others however strong a frame may be its own weight and the weight of the work upon it tends to spring it unless evenly distributed and to twist it unless evenly proportioned for all small machines the single post obviates all trouble but for machine tools of from twice to a half dozen times their own length the single post is not available four legs are used for machines up to ten feet or so and above that legs various and then solid masonry if the four legs were always set upon solid masonry and leveled perfectly when set no question could be raised against the usual arrangement unless it be this ought they not to be set nearly onefourth the way from the end of the bed or to put it in another form will not the bed of an iron planing machine twelve feet in length be equally as well supported by four legs if each pair is set three feet from the endsthat is six feet apartas by six legs two pairs at the ends and one in the center and the pairs six feet apart there being six feet of unsupported bed in either case with this advantage in favor of the four over the six settling of the foundation would not bend the bed it is not likely that onehalf of the fourlegged machine tools used in this country are resting upon stable foundations nor that they ever will be and while this is a fact it must also remain a fact that they should be built so as to do their best on an unstable one any one of the thousand iron planing machines of the country if put in good condition and set upon the ordinary wood floors may be made to plane work winding in either direction by shifting a moving load of a few hundred pounds on the floor from one corner of the machine to the other and the ways of the ordinary turning lathe may be more easily distorted still machine tool builders do not believe this simply because they have not tried it that is i suppose this must be so for the proof is so positive and the remedy so simple that it does not seem possible they can know the fact and overlook it the remedy in the case of the planer is to rest the structure on the two housings at the rear end and on a pair of legs about onefourth of the way back from the front pivoted to the bed on a single bolt as near the top as possible illustration a b c fig 1 illustrate the models shown by mr sweet which represented three forms of lathe and planer construction the box form c proved to be fifty per cent stronger in its vertical direction than either a or b fifty times stronger sideways than a and twenty times stronger than b and more than thirteen times stronger than either when subject to torsional strain a fig 2 represents an ordinary pinion tooth and b shows one of the same size strengthened by cutting put metal at the root c and d were models showing the same width of teeth extended to six times the length showing what would be their character if considered as springs a similar arrangement applies to the lathe and machine tools of that characterthat is machines of considerable length in proportion to their width and with beds made sufficiently strong within themselves to resist all bending and torsional strains fill the requirements so far as all except wear is concerned that is if the frames are once made true they will remain so regardless of all external influences that can be reasonably anticipated among woodworking machines there are many that cannot be built on the single rectangular box planrested on three points of support fortunately the requirements are not such as demand absolute straight and flat work because in part from the fact that the material dealt with will not remain straight and flat even if once made so and in the design of woodworking machinery it is of more importance to so design that one section or element shall remain true within itself than that the various elements should remain true with one another the lathe the planing machine the drilling machine and many others of the now standard machine tools will never be superseded and will for a long time to come remain subjects of alteration and attempted improvement in every detail the head stock of a lathethe back gear in particularis about as hard a thing to improve as the link motion of a locomotive some arrangement by which a single motion would change from fast to slow and a substitute for the flanges on the pulleys which are intended to keep the belt out of the gear but never do might be improvements if the flanges were cast on the head stock itself and stand still rather than on the pulley where they keep turning the belt would keep out from between the gear for a certainty one motion should fasten a foot stock and as secure as it is possible to secure it and a single motion free it so it could be moved from end to end of the bed the reason any lathe takes more than a single motion is because of elasticity in the parts imperfection in the planing and from another cause infinitely greater than the others the swinging of the holddown bolts should not the propelling powers of a lathe slide be as near the point of greatest resistance as possible as is the case in a sellers lathe and the guiding ways as close to the greatest resistance and propelling power as possible and all other necessary guiding surfaces made to run as free as possible a common expression to be found among the description of new lathes is the one that says the carriage has a long bearing on the ways long is a relative word and the only place i have seen any long slides among the lathes in the market is in the advertisements but if any one has the courage to make a long one they will need something besides material to make a success of it it needs only that the guiding side that should be long and that must be as rigid as possiblenothing short of casting the apron in the same piece will be strong enough because with a long elastic guide heavy work will spring it down and wear it away at the center and then with light work it will ride at the ends with a chattering cut as a consequence an almost endless and likely profitless discussion has been indulged in as to the proper way to guide a slide rest and different opinions exist it is a question that so far as principle is concerned there ought to be some way to settle which should not only govern the question in regard to the slide rest of a lathe but all slides that work against a torsional resistance as it may be calledthat is a resistance that does not directly oppose the propelling power in other words in a lathe the cutting point of the tool is not in line with the lead screw or rack and a twisting strain has to be resisted by the slides whereas in an upright drill the sliding sleeve is directly over and in line with the drill and subject to no side strain does not the foregoing statement that the propelling power should be as near the resistance as possible and the guide be as near in line with the two as possible embody the true principle neither of the two methods in common use meets this requirement to its fullest extent the twov new england plan seems like sending two men to do what one can do much better alone and the inconsistency of guiding by the back edge of a flat bed is prominently shown by considering what the result would be if carried to an extreme if a slide such as is used on a twenty inch lathe were placed upon a bed or shears twenty feet wide it would work badly and that which is bad when carried to an extreme cannot well be less than half bad when carried half way the ease with which a cast iron bar can be sprung is many times overlooked there is another peculiarity about cast iron and likely other metals which an exaggerated example renders more apparent than can be done by direct statement cast iron when subject to a bending strain acts like a stiff spring but when subject to compression it dents like a plastic substance what i mean is this if some plastic substance say a thick coating of mud in the street be leveled off true and a board be laid upon it it will fit but if two heavy weights be placed on the ends the center will be thrown up in the air far away from the mud so too will the same thing occur if a perfectly straight bar of cast iron be placed on a perfectly straight planer bedthe two will fit but when the ends of the bar are bolted down the center of the bar will be up to a surprising degree and so with sliding surfaces when working on oil if to any extent elastic they will when unequally loaded settle through the oil where the load exists and spring away where it is not the tool post or tool holder that permits of a tool being raised or lowered and turned around after the tool is set without any sacrifice of absolute stability will be better than one in which either one of these features is sacrificed handiness becomes the more desirable as the machines are smaller but handiness is not to be despised even in a large machine except where solidity is sacrificed to obtain it the weak point in nearly all and so nearly all that i feel pretty safe in saying all small planing machines is their absolute weakness as regards their ability to resist torsional strain in the bed and both torsional and bending strain in the table is it an uncommon thing to see the ways of a planer that has run any length of time cut in fact is it not a pretty difficult thing to find one that is not cut and is this because they are overloaded not at all figure up at even fifty pounds to the square inch of wearing surface what any planer ought to carry and you will find that it is not from overloading twist the bed upon the floor and any of them will twist as easy as two basswood boards and your table will rest the hardest on two corners strap or bolt or wedge a casting upon the table or tighten up a piece between a pair of centers eight or ten inches above the table and bend the table to an extent only equal to the thickness of the film of oil between the surface of the ways and the large wearing surface is reduced to two wearing points in designing it should always be kept in mind or in fact it is found many times to be the correct thing to do to consider the piece as a stiff spring and the stiffer the better the tooth of a gear wheel is a cast iron spring and if only treated as would be a spring many less would be broken a point in evidence the pinions in a train of rolls which compel the two or more rolls to travel in unison are necessarily about as small at the pitch line as the rolls themselves they are subject to considerable strain and a terrible hammering by back lash and break discouragingly frequent or do when made of cast iron if not of very coarse pitch that is with very few teetheleven or twelve sometimes in a certain case it became desirable to increase the number of teeth when it was found that the breakages occurred about as the square root of their number when the form was changed by cutting out at the root in this form fig 2 the breakage ceased a fig 2 shows an ordinary gear tooth and b the form as changed c and d show the two forms of the same width but increased to six times the length if the two are considered as springs it will be seen that d is much less likely to be broken by a blow or strain the remedy for the flimsy bed is the box section the remedy for the flimsy planer table is the deep box section and with this advantage that the upper edge can be made to shelve over above the reversing dogs to the full width between the housings the parabolic form of housing is elegant in appearance but theoretically right only when of uniform cross section in some of the counterfeit sort the designers seem to have seen the original sellers remembering the form just well enough to have got the curve wrong end up and knowing nothing of the principle have succeeded in building a housing that is absolutely weak and absolutely ugly with just enough of the original left to show from where it was stolen if the housing is constructed on the brace plan should not the braces be straight as in the old bement and the center line of strain pass through the center line of the brace if the housing is to take the form of a curve the section should be practically uniform and the curve drawn by an artist many times housings are quite rigid enough in the direction of the travel of the table but weak against side pressure the hollow box section with secure attachment to the bed and a deep cross beam at the top are the remedies raising and lowering cross heads large and small by two screws is a slow and laborious job and slow when done by power counterweights just balancing the cross head with metal straps rather than chains or ropes large wheels with small antifriction journals and the cross head guarded by one post only changes a slow to a quick arrangement and a task to a comfort housings of the hollow box section furnish an excellent place for the counterweights the moving head which is not expected to move while under pressure seems to have settled into one form and when hooked over a square ledge at the top a pretty satisfactory form too but in other machines built in the form of planing machines in which the head is traversed while cutting as is the case with the profiling machine the planer head form is not right both the propelling screw or whatever gives the side motion should be as low down as possible as should also be the guide there is a principle underlying the sellers method of driving a planer table that may be utilized in many ways the endurance goes far beyond any mans original expectations and the explanation very likely lies in the fact that the point of contact is always changing to apply the same principle to a common worm gear it is only necessary to use a worm in a plain spur gear with the teeth cut at an angle the wrong way and set the worm shaft at an angle double the amount rather than at 90 such a worm gear will i fancy outwear a dozen of the scientific sort it would likely be found a convenience to have the head of a planing machine traverse by a handle or crank attached to itself so it could be operated like the slide rest of a lathe rather than as is now the case from the end of the cross head the principle should be to have things convenient even at an additional cost anything more than a single motion to lock the cross head to the housing or stanchions should not be countenanced in small planers at least many of the inferior machines show marked improvements over the better sorts so far as handiness goes while there is nothing to hinder the handy from being good and the good handy when we consider that since the postdrilling machine first made its appearance there have been added blasdells quick return the automatic feed beltdriven spindles back gears placed where they ought to be with many minor improvements it is not safe to assume that the end has been reached and when we consider that as a piece of machine designing considered in an artistic sense entirely the bement post drill is the finest the world ever saw the porterallen engine not excepted which is saying a good deal is it not strange that of all mechanical designs none other has taken on such outrageous forms as this one thing that would seem to be desirable and that ordinary skill might devise is some sort of snap clutch by which the main spindle could be stopped instantly by touching a trigger with the foot many drills and accidents would be saved thereby of the many special devices i have seen for use on a drilling machine one used by mr lipe might be made of universal use it is in the form of a bracket or knee adjustably attached to the post which has in its upper surface a v into which round pieces of almost any size can be fastened so that the drill will pass through it diametrically it is not only useful in making holes through round bars but straight through bosses and collars as well the radial drill has got so it points its nose in all directions but skyward but whether in its best form is not certain the handle of the belt shipper in none that i have seen follows around within reach of the drill as conveniently as one would like as the one suggestion i have to make in regard to the shaping machine best illustrates the subject of maintaining true wearing surfaces i will leave it until i reach that part of my paper to be continued the mechanics of a liquid a liquid comes in handy sometimes in measuring the volume of a substance where the length breadth and thickness is difficult to get at it is a very simple operation only requiring the material to be plunged under water and measure the amount of displacement by giving close attention to the overflow it is a process that was first brought into use in the days when jewelers and silversmiths were inclined to be a little dishonest and to make the most of their earnings out of the rule of their country if we remember rightly the voice of some one crying eureka was heard about that time from somebody who had been taking a bath up in the country some two miles from home tradition would have us believe that the inventor left for the patent office long before his bathing exercises were half through with and that he did the most of his traveling at a lively rate while on foot but it is more reasonable to suppose that bath tubs were in use in those days and that he noticed as every good philosopher should that his bathing solution was running over the edge of the tub as fast as his body sunk below the surface taking to the heels is something that we hear of even at this late day illustration it was not many years ago that an inventor of a siphon noticed how water could be drawn up hill with a lamp wick and the thought struck him that with a soaking arrangement of this kind in one leg of the siphon a flow of water could be obtained that would always be kept in motion without taking a second thought he dropped his work in the hay field and ran all the way to london a distance of twenty miles to lay his scheme before a learned man of science he must have felt like being carried home on a stretcher when he learned that a performance of this kind was a failure among the others who have given an exhibition of this kind we notice an observer who was more successful being an overseer in a cotton mill he had only to run over to his dining room and secure two empty fruit jars and pipe them up as shown he had had trouble in measuring volume by the liquid process by having everything he attempted to measure get a thorough wetting and there were many substances that were to be experimented upon that would not stand this part of the operation such as fibers and a number of pulverized materials one of the jars was packed in tight nearly half full of cotton and the other left entirely empty the question now is to measure the volume of cotton without bringing any of the fibers in contact with the water the liquid is poured into the tunnel in the upright tube under head enough to partially fill the jars when the overflow that stands on a level with the line d e is open to allow the air in each jar to adjust itself as the straight portions are wanted to work from the overflow is then closed and head enough of water put on to compress the air in the empty jar down into half its volume it may take a pipe long enough to reach up into the second story but it need not be a large one and pipes round a cotton mill are plentiful in the jar containing cotton the water has not risen so high there being not so much air to compress and comes to rest on the line c now we have this simple condition to work from if the water has risen so as to occupy half of the space that has been taken up by the amount of air in one jar it must have done the same in the other and if it could have been carried to twice the extent in volume would reach the bottom of the jar in the one containing nothing but air and to the line h i in the jar containing cotton the fibers then must have had an amount of material substance about them to fill the remaining space entirely full so that a particle of air could not be taken into account anywhere the cotton has produced the same effect that a solid substance would do if it just filled the space shown above the line h i for the water has risen into half the space that is left below it this enables an overseer to look into the material substance of textile fibers by bringing into use the elasticity of atmospheric air reserving the liquid process for measuring volume to govern the amount of compressibilityboston journal of commerce volute double distilling condenser this distiller and condenser which we illustrate has been designed says engineering for the purpose of obtaining fresh water from sea water it is very compact and the various details in connection with it may be described as follows steam from the boiler is admitted into the evaporator through a reducing valve at a pressure of about 60 lb and passing through the volute b evaporates the salt water contained in the chamber c the vapor thus generated passing through the pipe d into the volute condenser e where it is condensed the fresh water thus obtained flows into the filter from which it is pumped into suitable drinking tanks illustration volute double distilling apparatus the steam from the boiler after passing through the volute b is conveyed by means of a pipe to the second volute h where it is condensed and the water resulting is conveyed by means of a pump to the hot well or feed tank the necessary condensing water enters at j and is discharged at k the method of keeping the supply of salt water in the evaporator at a constant level is very efficient and ingenious to the main circulating discharge pipe a small pipe l is fitted which is in communication with the chamber m and through this the circulating sea water runs back until it attains a working level in the evaporator when a valve in the end of pipe l is closed by the action of the float n the regulation of admission being thus automatic and certain the steam from the boiler can be regulated by means of a stop valve and the pressure in the evaporator should not exceed 4 lb while the pressure gauge is so arranged that the pressure in both condenser and evaporator is shown at the same time a safety valve is fitted at the top of the condenser and an automatic blowoff valve p is arranged to blow off when a certain density of brine has been attained in the evaporator the esco triple pump fig 3 which has been specially manufactured for this purpose has three suctions and deliveries one for circulating water the second for the condensed steam and a third for the filtered drinking water so that the latter is kept fresh and clean the condenser and pumps are manufactured by ernest scott co close works newcastle on tyne and were shown by them at the late exhibition in their town improved current meter paul kotlarewsky of st petersburg has invented an instrument for measuring or ascertaining the velocity of water and air currents upon the shaft or axis of the propeller wheel or upon a shaft geared therewith there is a hermetically closed tube or receptacle d which is placed at right angles with the shaft and preferably so that its longitudinal axis shall intersect the axis of said shaft in this tube or receptacle is placed a weight such as a ball which is free to roll or slide back and forth in the tube the effect of this arrangement is that as the shaft revolves the weight will drop alternately toward opposite ends of the tube and its stroke as it brings up against either end will be distinctly heard by the observer as well as felt by him if as is usually the case the apparatus when in use is held by him by counting the strokes which occur during a given period of time the number of revolutions during that period can readily be ascertained and from that the velocity of the current to be measured can be computed in the usual way when the apparatus is submerged in water by a rope held by the observer it will at once adjust itself to the direction of the current the force of the current acting against the wings or blades of the propeller wheel puts the latter in revolution and the tube d will be carried around and the sliding weight according to the position of the tube will drop toward and bring up against alternately opposite ends of said tube making two strokes for every revolution of the shaft illustration the flower industry of grasse a paper on this subject was read before the chemists assistants association on march 8 by mr fw warrick and was listened to with much interest mr warrick first apologized for presenting a paper on such a frivolous subject to men who had shown themselves such ardent advocates of the higher pharmacy of the ologies in preference to the groceries perfumeries and other eries but if perfumery could not hope to take an elevated position in the materi pharmaceutic it might be accorded a place as an adjunct if only on the plea that those also serve who only stand and wait mr warrick mentioned that his family had been connected with this industry for many years and that for many of the facts in the paper he was indebted to a cousin who had had twenty years practical experience in the south and who was present that evening grasse the town of grasse is perhaps more celebrated than any other for its connection with the perfume industry in a province which is itself well known to be its home this the department of the alpes maritimes forms the southeastern corner of france its most prominent geographical features are an elevated mountain range a portion of the alps and a long seaboard washed by the mediterraneanwhence the name alpes maritimes the calcareous hills round grasse and to the north of nice are more or less bare though they were at one time well wooded the reafforesting of these parts has however made of late great progress nearer the sea vegetation is less rare and there many a promontory excites the just admiration of the visitor by its growth of olives orange and lemon trees and odoriferous shrubs who that has ever sojourned in this province can wonder that goethes mignon should have ardently desired a return to these sunny regions visitors on these shores on the first day of this year found goethes lines more poetical than true where a wind ever soft from the blue heaven blows and the groves are of laurel and myrtle and rose for they gathered round their fires and coughed and groaned in chorus and entertained each other with accounts of their ailments but this was exceptional and the climate of the alpes maritimes is on the whole as near perfection as anything earthly can be this however is not due to its latitude but rather to its happy protection from the north by its alps and to its being bathed on the south by the warm mediterranean and the soft breezes of an eastern wind which evidently there bears a different reputation to that which it does with us the mistral or cold breeze from the hills is indeed the only climatic enemy if we except an occasional earthquake the town of grasse itself is situated in the southern portion of the department and enjoys its fair share of the advantages this situation affords it is about ten miles from cannes lord broughams creation and as the crow flies twentyfive miles from nice though about forty miles by rail for the line runs down to cannes and thence along the shore to nice built on the side of a hill some 1000 feet above the level of the sea the town commands magnificent views over the surrounding country especially in the direction of the sea which is gloriously visible an abundant stream the foux issuing from the rocks just above the town is the all productive genius of the place it feeds a hundred fountains and as many factories and then gives life to the neighboring fields and gardens the population of grasse is about 12000 and the flora of its environs represents almost all the botany of europe among the splendid pasture lands 7000 feet above the sea are fields of lavender thyme etc from 7000 to 6000 feet there are forests of pine and other gymnosperms from 6000 to 4000 feet firs and the beech are the most prominent trees between 4000 and 2000 feet we find our familiar friends the oak the chestnut cereals maize potatoes below this is the mediterranean region here orange lemon fig and olive trees the vine mulberry etc flourish in the open as well as any number of exotics palms aloes cactuses castor oil plants etc it is in this region that nature with lavish hand bestows her flowers which unlike their compeers in other lands are not born to waste their fragrance on the desert air or to die like the bubble on the fountain but rather to paraphrase george eliots lofty words to die and live again in fats and oils made nobler by their presence the following are the plants put under contribution by the perfume factories of the district viz the orange tree bitter and sweet the lemon eucalyptus myrtle bay laurel cherry laurel elder the labiates lavender spike thyme etc the umbelliferous fennel and parsley the composite wormwood and tarragon and more delicate than these the rose geranium cassie jasmin jonquil mignonette and violet the perfume factory in the perfume factory everything is done by steam starting from the engine room at the bottom the visitor next enters the receiving room where early in the morning the chattering patoisspeaking natives come to deliver the flowers for the supply of which they have contracted the next room is occupied with a number of steamjacketed pans a mill and hydraulic presses next comes the still room the stills in which are all heated by steam in the extract department which is next reached are large tinnedcopper drums fitted with stirrers revolving in opposite directions on vertical axes descending to the cellarthe coolest part of the buildingwe find the simple apparatus used in the process of enfleurage the apparatus is of two kinds the smaller is a frame fitted with a sheet of stout glass a number of these all of the same size when placed one on the top of the other form a tolerably air tight box the larger is a frame fitted with wire netting over which a piece of molleton is placed the other rooms are used for bottling labeling etc the following are some of the details of the cultivation and extraction of perfumes as given in mr warricks paper orange perfumes the orange tree is produced from the pip which is sown in a sheltered uncovered bed when the young plant is about 4 feet high it is transplanted and allowed a year to gain strength in its new surroundings it is then grafted with shoots from the portugal or bigaradier it requires much care in the first few years must be well manured and during the summer well watered and if at all exposed must have its stem covered up with straw in winter it is not expected to yield a crop of flowers before the fourth year after transplantation the flowering begins toward the end of april and lasts through may to the middle of june the buds are picked when on the point of opening by women boys and girls who make use of a tripod ladder to reach them these villagers carry the fruits or rather flowers of their days labor to a flower agent or commissionnaire who weighs them spreads them out in a cool place the flowers not the villagers where they remain until 1 or 2 am he then puts them into sacks and delivers them at the factory before the sun has risen they are here taken in hand at once on exceptional days as many as 160 tons being so treated in the whole province after the following season say end of june the farmers prune their trees these prunings are carted to the factory where the leaves are separated and made use of during the autumn the ground round about the trees is well weeded dug about and manured the old practice of planting violets under the orange trees is being abandoned later on in the year those blossoms which escaped extermination have developed into fruits these when destined for the production of the oil are picked while green the orange trees produce a second crop of flowers in autumn sometimes of sufficient importance to allow of their being taken to the factories and always of sufficient importance to provide brides with the necessary bouquets nature having been thus assisted to deliver these her wonderful productions the flowers the leaves and the fruits of the orange tree at the factory man has to do the rest he does it in the following manner the flowers are spread out on the stone floor of the receiving room in a layer some 6 to 8 inches deep they are taken in hand by young girls who separate the sepals which are discarded such of the petals as are destined for the production of orange flower water and neroli are put into a still through a large canvas chute and are covered with water which is measured by the filling of reservoirs on the same floor the manhole of the still is then closed and the contents are brought to boiling point by the passage of superheated steam through the coils of a surrounding worm the water and oil pass over are condensed and fall into a florentine receiver where the oil floating on the surface remains in the flask while the water escapes through the tube opening below a piece of wood or cork is placed in the receiver to break up the steam flowing from the still this gives time for the small globules of oil to cohere while it breaks the force of the downward current thus preventing any of the oil being carried away the first portions of the water coming from the still are put into large tinned copper vats capable of holding some 500 gallons and there stored to be drawn off as occasion may require into glass carboys or tinned copper bottles this water is an article of very large consumption in france our english cooks have no idea to what an extent it is used by the chefs in the land of the darned mounseer the oil is separated by means of a pipette filtered and bottled off it forms the oil of neroli of commerce 1000 kilos of the flowers yield 1 kilo of oil that obtained from the flowers of the bigaradier or bitter orange is the finer and more expensive quality the delicate scent of orange flowers can be preserved quite unchanged by another and more gentle process viz that of maceration it was noticed by some individual whose name has not been handed down to us that bodies of the nature of fat and oil are absorbers of the odorimparting particles exhaled by plants this property was seized upon by some other genius equally unknown to fame who utilized it to transfer the odor of flowers to alcohol where oil is used it is the very finest olive produced by the trees in the neighborhood this is put into copper vats holding about 50 gallons 1 cwt of flowers is added after some hours the flowers are strained out by means of a large tin sieve the oil is treated with another cwt of flowers and still another until sufficiently impregnated it is then filtered through paper until it becomes quite bright lastly it is put into tins and is ready for exportation or for use in the production of extracts where fat is employed as the macerating agent the fat used is a properly adjusted mixture of lard and suet both of which have been purified and refined during the winter months and kept stored away in well closed tins one cwt of the fat is melted in a steamjacketed pan and poured into a tinned copper vat capable of holding from 5 to 6 cwt about 1 cwt of orange flowers being added these are well stirred in with a wooden spatula after standing for a few hours which time is not sufficient for solidification to take place the contents are poured into shallow pans and heated to 60 c the mixture thus rendered more fluid is poured on to a tin sieve the fat passes through the flowers remain behind these naturally retain a large amount of macerating liquor to save this they are packed into strong canvas bags and subjected to pressure between the plates of a powerful hydraulic press the fat squeezed out is accompanied by the moisture of the flowers from which it is separated by skimming being returned to the original vat our macerating medium receives another complement of flowers to rob of their scent and yet others until the strength of the pomade desired is reached the fat is then remelted decanted and poured into tins or glass jars to make the extrait the pomade is beaten up with alcohol in a special air tight mixing machine holding some 12 gallons stirrers moved by steam power agitating the pomade in opposite directions after some hours agitation a creamy liquid is produced which after resting separates the alcohol now containing the perfume by passing the alcohol through tubes surrounded by iced water the greater part of the dissolved fat is removed these are the processes applied to the flowers the leaves are distilled only for the oil of petit grain this name was given to the oil because it was formerly obtained from miniature orange fruits from 1000 kilos of leaves 2 kilos of oil are obtained the oil obtained from the fruit of the orange like that of the lemon is extracted at grasse by rolling the orange over the pricks of an ecueille an instrument with a hollow handle into which the oil flows the oil is sometimes taken up by a sponge where the oil is produced in larger quantities as at messina more elaborate apparatus is employed a less fragrant oil is obtained by distilling the raspings of the rind the eucalyptus myrtle etc of later introduction than the trees of the orange family is the eucalyptus globulus which not being able to compete with the former in the variety of nasal titillations it gives rise to probably consoles itself with coming off the distinct victor in the department of power and penetration the leaves and twigs of this tree are distilled for oil this oil is in large demand on the continent the fact of there being no other species than the globulus in the neighborhood being a guarantee of the uniformity of the product whereas the eucalyptus is but a newcomer in these regions another member of the same family the common myrtle can date its introduction many centuries back an oil is distilled from its leaves and also a water associated with the myrtle we find the leaves of the bay laurel forming the victorious wreaths of the ancients the oil produced is the oil of bay laurel oil of sweet bay this must not be confounded with the oil of bays of the west indies the produce of the myrcia acris nor yet with the cherry laurel a member of yet another family the leaves of which are sometimes substituted for those of the sweet bay the leaves of this plant yield the cherry laurel water of the bp it can hardly be said to be an article of perfumery it also yields an oil another water known to the british pharmacopoeia is that produced from the flowers of the elder which flourishes round about grasse the rue also grows wild in these parts and is distilled the labiates the family which overshadows all others in the quantity of essential oils which it puts at the disposal of the grassois and their neighbors is that of the labiat foremost among these we have the lavender spike thyme and rosemary these are all of a vigorous and hardy nature and require no cultivation the tops of these plants are generally distilled in situ under contract with the grasse manufacturer by the villagers in the immediate vicinity the higher the altitude at which these grow the more esteemed the oil the finest oil of lavender is produced by distilling the flowers only about 100 tons of lavender 25 of spike 40 of thyme and 20 of rosemary are sent out from grasse every year among the less abundant labiates of these parts is the melissa which yields however a very fragrant oil in the same family we have the sage and the sweet or common basil also giving up their essential oils on distillation the umbellifers whereas the flowers of the labiate family are treated by the distillers as favorites are by the gods and are cut off in their youth those of the umbellifer are allowed to mature and develop into the oilyielding fruits its representatives the fennel and parsley grow wild round about the town and are laid under contribution by the manufacturers the composites are represented by the wormwood and tarragon estragon the geranium oil of geranium is produced from the rose or oakleaved geranium cuttings of which are planted in well sheltered beds in october during the winter they are covered over with straw matting in april they are taken up and planted in rows in fields or upon easily irrigated terraces of water they require quantum sufficit of natures other gift which cheers and not inebriatesthe glorious sunshinethey cannot have too much they soon grow into bushes three or four feet high at nice they generally flower at the end of august at grasse and cooler places they flower about the end of october the whole flowering plant is put into the still the rose allied to the oil of geranium in odor are the products of the rose the rose de provence is the variety cultivated it is grown on gentle slopes facing the southeast young shoots are taken from a fiveyearold tree and are planted in ground which has been well broken up to a depth of three or four feet in rows like vines when the young plant begins to branch out the top of it is cut off about a foot from the ground during the first year the farmer picks off the buds that appear in order that the whole attention of the plant may be taken up in developing its system in the fourth or fifth year the tree is in its full yielding condition the flowering begins about midapril and lasts through may to early june on some days as many as 150 tons of roses are gathered in the province of the alpes maritimes the buds on the point of opening are picked in the early morning scott says they are sweetest washed with morning dew the purchaser may think otherwise where the dew has to be paid for the flowering season over the trees are allowed to run wild in january they are pruned and the branches left are entwined from tree to tree all along the line and form impenetrable fences a rose tree will live to a good age but does not yield much after its seventh year at that period it is dug up and burned and corn potatoes or some other crop is grown on the land for twelve months or more in the factory the petals are separated from the calyx and are distilled with water for the production of rose water and the otto for the production of the huile and pomade they are treated by maceration they are finished off however by the process of enfleurage in which the frames before alluded to are made use of the fat or pomade is spread on to the glass on both sides the blossoms are then lightly strewn on to the upper surface a number of trays so filled are placed one on the top of the other to a convenient height forming a tolerably air tight box the next day the old flowers are removed and fresh ones are substituted for them this is repeated until the fat is sufficiently impregnated from time to time the surface of the absorbent is renewed by serrating it with a comblike instrument this of course is necessary in order to give the hungry nonsaturated lower layers a chance of doing their duty where oil is the absorbent the wired frames are used in connection with cloths the cloth acts as the holder of the oil and the flowers are spread upon it and the process is conducted in the same way as with the frames with glass from the pomade the extrait de rose is made in the same way as the orange extrait cassie the stronger though less delicate cassie is grown from seeds which are contained in pods which betray the connection of this plant with the leguminous family after being steeped in water they are sown in a warm and well sheltered spot when two feet high the young plant is grafted and transplanted to the open groundground well exposed to the sun and sheltered from the cold winds it flourishes best in the neighborhood of grasse and cannes the season of flowering is from october to january or february according to the presence or absence of frost the flowers are gathered twice a week in the daytime and are brought to the factories in the evening they are here subjected to maceration jonquil a plant of humbler growth is the jonquil the bulbs of this are set out in rows the flowers put in an appearance about the end of march four or five on each stem each flower as it blooms is picked off at the calyx they are treated by maceration and enfleurage chiefly the latter the harvesting period of the jonquil is of very short duration and it often takes two seasons for the perfumer to finish off his pomades of extra strength the crop is also very uncertain jasmin a more reliable crop is that of the jasmin this plant is reared from cuttings of the wild jasmin which are put in the earth in rows with trenches between level ground is chosen if hillside only is available this is formed into a series of terraces when strong enough the young stem is grafted with shoots of the jasminum grandiflorum the first year it is allowed to run wild the second it is trained by means of rods canes and other appliances at the approach of winter the plants are banked up with earth to half their height the exposed parts then die off when the last frost of winter is gone the earth is removed and what remains of the shrub is trimmed and tidied up for the coming season it grows to four or five feet support is given by means of horizontal and upright poles which join the plants of one row into a hedgelike structure water is provided by means of the ditches already mentioned when not used for this purpose the trenches allow of the passage of women and children to gather the flowers these begin to appear in sufficient quantity to repay collecting about the middle of july the jasmin is collected as soon as possible after it blooms this occurs in the evening and up to about august 15 early enough for the blossoms to be gathered the same day they are delivered at the factories at once where they are put on to the chassis immediately the work on them continuing very often till long after midnight later on in the year they are gathered in the early morning directly the dew is off the farmer is up betimes and as soon as he sees the blossoms are dry he sounds a bugle made from a sea shell to announce the fact to those engaged to pick for him tuberose the tuberose is planted in rows in a similar way to the jasmin the stems thrown up by the bulbs bear ten or twelve flowers each flower as it blooms is picked off the harvesting for the factories takes place from about the first week in july to the middle of october there is an abundant yield indeed after this but it is only of service to the florist the valued scent not being present in sufficient quantity the flowers are worked up at the factory directly they arrive by the enfleurage process mignonette the reseda or mignonette is planted from seed as here in england the flowering tops are used to produce the huile or pomade violets last in order and least in size comes the violet for the flower of sweetest smell is shy and lowly and has taken a modest place in the paper violets are planted out in october or april october is preferred as it is the rainy season nor are the young plants then exposed to the heat of the sun or to the drought as they would be if starting life in april the best place for them is in olive or orange groves where they are protected from the too powerful rays of the sun in summer and from the extreme cold in winter specks of violets appear during november by december the green is quite overshadowed and the whole plantation appears of one glorious hue for the leaves having developed sufficiently for the maintenance of the plant rest on their oars and seem to take a silent pleasure in seeing the young buds they have protected shoot past them and blossom in the open the flowers are picked twice a week they lose both color and flavor if they are allowed to remain too long upon the plant they are gathered in the morning and delivered at the factories by the commissionnaires or agents in the afternoon when they are taken in hand at once the products yielded by this flower are prized before all others in the realms of perfumery and cannot be improved for as one great authority on all matters has said to throw a perfume on the violet were wasteful and ridiculous excess how to make photo printing plates the drawing intended for reproduction is pinned on a board and placed squarely before a copying camera in a good even light the lens used for this purpose must be capable of giving a perfectly sharp picture right up to the edges and must be of the class called rectilinear ie giving straight lines the picture is then accurately focused and brought to the required size a plate is prepared in the dark room by the collodion process which is then exposed in the camera for the proper time and developed in the ordinary way after development the plate is fixed and strongly intensified in order to render the white portions of the drawings as opaque as possible on looking through a properly treated negative of this kind it will be seen that the parts representing the lines and black portions of the drawing are clear glass and the whites representing the paper a dense black the negative after drying is ready for the next operation ie printing upon zinc this is done in several ways one method will however be sufficient for the purpose here i obtain a piece of the bichromatized gelatine paper previously mentioned and place it on the face of the negative in a printing frame this is exposed to sunlight if there is any or daylight for a period varying from five to thirty minutes according to the strength of the light this exposed piece of paper is then covered all over with a thin coating of printing ink and wetted in a bath of cold water in a few minutes the ink leaves the white or protected parts of the paper remaining only on the lines where the light has passed through the negative and affected the gelatine we now have a transcript of the drawing in printing ink on a paper which as soon as dry is ready for laying down on a piece of perfectly clean zinc and passing through a press the effect and purpose of passing this cleaned sheet of zinc through the press in contact with the picture on the gelatine paper is this owing to the stronger attraction of the greasy ink for the clean metal than for the gelatine it leaves its original support and attaches itself strongly to the zinc giving a beautifully sharp and clean impression of our original drawing in greasy ink on the surface of the zinc the zinc plate is next damped and carefully rolled up with a roller charged with more printing ink and the image is thus made strong enough to resist the first etching this etching is done in a shallow bath which is so arranged that it can be rocked to and fro for the first etching very weak solution of nitric acid and water is used the plate is placed with this acid solution in the bath and steadily rocked for five or ten minutes the plate is then taken out washed and again inked then it is dusted over with powdered resin which sticks to the ink on the plate after this the plate is heated until the ink and resin on the lines melt together and form a strong acidresisting varnish over all the work the plate is again put into the acid etching bath and further etched these operations are repeated five or six times until the zinc of the unprotected or white part of the picture is etched deep enough to allow the lines to be printed clean in a press like ordinary type or an engraved wood block i ought perhaps to explain that between each etching the plate is thoroughly inked and that this ink is melted down the sides of the line so as to protect the sides as well as the top from the action of the acid were this neglected the acid would soon eat out the lines from below the greatest skill and care is therefore necessary in this work especially so in the case of some of the exquisitely fine blocks which are etched for some art publications there are many details which are necessary to successful etching but those now given will be sufficient to convey to you generally the method of making the zinc plate for the typographic block after etching there only remains the trimming of the zinc a little touching up and mounting it on a block of mahogany or cherry of exact thickness to render it type high and it is now ready for insertion with type in the printers form from a properly etched plate hundreds of thousands of prints may be obtained or it may be electrotyped or stereotyped and multiplied

their power of extinguishing fire is but three or fourfold that of water one of these grenades of a popular brand of which i have not found an analysis was examined by mr catlett with the following results the blue corked flask was so open as to show that it contained no gas under pressure and upon warming its contents but 4 or 5 cubic inches of a gas were given off the grenade contained about 600 cc of a neutral solution which gave on analysis in 1000 cc in the flask grammes grains calcium chloride 9250 8508 magnesium 1871 1732 sodium 2220 2069 potassium 114 106 13455 12415 trace of

the liquid for filling such grenades is obtained by adding two volumes of water to one of the bittern the latter statement is fairly proved by the presence of the bromine and certainly from an economical standpoint such should be its method of manufactureamer chem jour molecular weights a new and most valuable method of determining the molecular weights of nonvolatile as well as volatile substances has just been brought into prominence by prof victor meyer berichte 1888 no 3 the method itself was discovered by m raoult and finally perfected by him in 1886 but up to the present has been but little utilized by chemists it will be remembered that prof meyer has recently discovered two isomeric series of derivatives of benzil differing only in the position of the various groups in space if each couple of isomers possess the same molecular weight a certain modification of the new vant hoffwislicenus theory as to the position of atoms in space is rendered necessary but if the two are polymers one having a molecular weight n times that of the other then the theory in its present form will still hold hence it was imperative to determine without doubt the molecular weight of some two typical isomers but the compounds in question are not volatile so that vapor density determinations were out of the question in this difficulty prof meyer has tested the discovery of m raoult upon a number of compounds of known molecular weights and found it perfectly reliable and easy of application the method depends upon the lowering of the solidifying point of a solvent such as water benzine or glacial acetic acid by the introduction of a given weight of the substance whose molecular weight is to be determined the amount by which the solidifying point is lowered is connected with the molecular weight m by the following extremely simple formula m t x p c where c represents the amount by which the point of congelation is lowered p the weight of anhydrous substance dissolved in 100 grammes of the solvent and t a constant for the same solvent readily determined from volatile substances whose molecular weights are well known on applying this law to the case of two isomeric benzil derivatives the molecular weights were found as expected to be identical and not multiples hence prof meyer is perfectly justified in introducing the necessary modification in the position in space theory now that this generalization of raoult is placed upon a secure basis it takes its well merited rank along with that of dulong and petit as a most valuable means of checking molecular weights especially in determining which of two or more possible values expresses the truthnature continued from supplement no 642 page 10258 the direct optical projection of electrodynamic lines of force and other electrodynamic phenomena1 footnote 1 an expansion of two papers read before the aaas at the ann arbor meeting by prof jw moore ii loops if the wire with its lines of force be bent into the form of a vertical circle 118 in in diameter and fixed in a glass plate some of the lines of force will be seen parallel to the axis of the circle if the loop is horizontal the lines become points illustration fig 14 illustration fig 14a fields of loops and magnets place now a vertical loop opposite to the pole of a short bar magnet cemented to the glass plate with the n pole facing it if the current passes in one direction the field will be as represented by fig 14b if it is reversed by the commutator fig 14c is an image of the spectrum applying faradays second principle it appears that attraction results in the first case and repulsion in the second the usual method of stating the fact is that if you face the loop and the current circulates from left over to right the n end of the needle will be drawn into the loop illustration fig 14b illustration fig 14c it thus becomes evident that the loop is equivalent to a flat steel plate one surface of which is n and the other s facing the loop if the current is right handed the s side is toward you to show the actual attraction and repulsion of a magnet by a magnetic shell produce the field as before fig 14 carry a suspended magnetic needle over the field it will tend to place itself parallel to the lines of force with the n pole in such a position that if the current passes clockwise as you look upon the plane of the loop it will be drawn into the loop reversing the position of the needle or of current will show repulsion clerk maxwells method of stating the fact is that every portion of the circuit is acted on by a force urging it across the lines of magnetic induction so as to include a greater number of these lines within the embrace of the circuit2 footnote 2 electricity and magnetism maxwell p 137 489 490 if the horizontal loop is used fig 14a the needle tries to assume a vertical position with the n or s end down according to the direction of the current if it is desired to show that if the magnet is fixed and the loop free the loop will be attracted or repelled a special support is needed illustration fig 15 a strip fig 15 of brass j having two iron mercury cups k1 k2 screwed near the ends one insulated from the strip is fastened upon the horizontal arm of the ring support fig 9 already described the cups may be given a slight vertical motion for accurate adjustment small conductors figs 16 17 18 which are circles rectangles solenoids etc may be suspended from the top of the plate by unspun silk with the ends dipping into the mercury the apparatus is therefore an amperes stand with the weight of the movable circuit supported by silk and with means of adjusting the contacts the rectangles or circles are about two inches in their extreme dimension horizontal and vertical astatic system are also usedfigs 18 18a the apparatus may be used with either the horizontal or vertical lantern illustration fig 16 fig 17 illustration fig 18 fig 18a if the rectangle or circle is suspended and a magnet brought near it when the current passes the loop will be attracted or repelled as the law requires the experiments usually performed with de la rives floating battery may be exhibited the great similarity between the loop and the magnet may be shown by comparing the fields above figs 14b 14c with the actual fields of two bar magnets figs 19 19a it will be noticed that the lines in fig 19 where unlike poles are opposite are gathered together as in fig 14bwhere the n end of the magnet faces the s side of the magnetic shell and that in 19a where two norths face the line of repulsion has the same general character as in 14c in which the n end of the magnet faces the n side of the shell illustration fig 19 illustration fig 19a instead of placing the magnet perpendicular to the plane of the loop it may be placed parallel to its plane fig 14d shows the magnet and loop both vertical the field shows that the magnet will be rotated and will finally take for stable equilibrium an axial position with the n end pointing as determined by the rule already given illustration fig 14d if two loops are placed with their axes in the same straight line as follows figs 14f 14g a reproduction of figs 14b and 14c will become evident it is obvious from these spectra that the two loops attract or repel each other according to the direction of the current which fact may be shown by bringing a loop near to another loop suspended from the ring stand fig 9 or by using the ordinary apparatus for that purposede la rives battery and amperes stand illustration fig 14f illustration fig 14g if two loops are placed in the same vertical plane as in figs 14h and 14i there will be attraction or repulsion according to the direction of the adjacent currents the fields become the same as figs 8 and 8a as may be seen by comparing them with those figures illustration fig 14h illustration fig 14i having thus demonstrated the practical identity of a loop and a magnet we proceed to examine the effects produced by loops on straight wires if the loop is placed with a straight wire in its plane along one edge there will be attraction or repulsion according to the direction of the two currents figs 20 and 20a which are obviously the same as figs 8 and 8a illustration fig 20 illustration fig 20a illustration fig 20b illustration fig 20c if the wire is placed parallel to the plane of the loop and to one side figs 20b and 20c there will be rotation same as figs 4b and 4c if the loop is horizontal and the wire vertical and on one side the figs 20d 20e are the same as 4d and 4e if the loop is horizontal and the wire vertical and axial 20f and 20g there will be rotation and the figures are mere duplicates of 4g and 4h illustration fig 20d illustration fig 20e illustration fig 20f illustration fig 20g illustration fig 20h fig 20h shows a view of 20f when the wire is horizontal and the plane of the loop vertical it is like 4i to verify these facts suspend a loop from amperes stand fig 9 and bring a straight wire near a small rectangle or circle may be hung in a similar manner when the circuit is closed it tends to place itself with its axis in a n and s direction through the earths influence the supposition of an e and w horizontal earth current will explain this action to exemplify rotation of a vertical wire by a horizontal loop fig 21 may be shown a circular copper vessel with a glass bottom fig 21 has wound around its rim several turns of insulated wire in the center of the vessel is a metallic upright upon the top of which is balanced in a mercury cup a light copper inverted u shaped strip the ends of the inverted u dip into the dilute sulphuric acid contained in the circular vessel the current passes from the battery up the pillar down the legs of the u to the liquid thence through the insulated wire back to the battery illustration fig 21 this is the usual form of apparatus modified in size for the vertical or horizontal lantern to be continued poisons poisons and poisoning was the subject of a discourse a few days ago at the royal institution the lecturer professor meymott tidy began by directing attention to the derivation of the word toxicology the science of poisons the greek word greek toxon signified primarily that specially oriental weapon which we call a bow but the word in the earliest authors included in its meaning the arrow shot from the bow dioscorides in the first century ad uses the word greek to toxikon to signify the poison to smear arrows with thus by giving an enlarged sense to the wordfor words ever strive to keep pace if possible with scientific progress we get our modern and significant expression toxicology as the science of poisons and of poisoning a certain grim historical interest gathers around the story of poisons it is a history worth studying for poisons have played their part in history the subtil serpent taught men the power of a poisoned fang poison was in the first instance a simple instrument of open warfare thus our savage ancestors tipped their arrows with the snake poison in order to render them more deadly the use of vegetable extracts for this purpose belongs to a later period the suggestion is not unreasonable that if war chemists with their powders their gun cotton and their explosives had not been invented warlike nations would have turned for their instrumenta belli to toxicologists and their poisons at any rate the toxicologists may claim that the very cradle of science was rocked in the laboratory of the toxicological worker early in the history of arrow tipping the admixture of blood with the snake poison became a common practice even the use of animal fluids alone is recordedeg the arrows of hercules which were dipped in the gall of the lernan hydra hercules himself at last fell a victim to the blood stained tunic of the dead centaur nessus as late as the middle of the last century blumenbach persuaded one of his class to drink 7 oz of warm bullocks blood in order to disprove the then popular notion that even fresh blood was a poison the young man who consented to drink the blood did not die a martyr to science the first important question we have to answer is what do we mean by a poison the law has not defined a poison although it requires at times a definition the popular definition of a poison is a drug which destroys life rapidly when taken in small quantity the terms small quantity as regards amount and rapidly as regards time are as indefinite as hodges piece of chalk as regards size the professor defined a poison as any substance which otherwise than by the agency of heat or electricity is capable of destroying life either by chemical action on the tissues of the living body or by physiological action by absorption into the living system this definition excepted from the list of poisons all agencies that destroyed life by a simple mechanical action thus drawing a distinction between a poison and a destructive thing it explains why nitrogen is not a poison and why carbonic acid is although neither can support life this point the lecturer illustrated a poison must be capable of destroying life it was nonsense to talk of a deadly poison if a body be a poison it is deadly if it be not deadly it is not a poison three illustrations of the chemical actions of poisons were selected the first was sulphuric acid here the molecular death of the part to which the acid was applied was due to the tendency of sulphuric acid to combine with water the stomach became charred the molecular death of certain tissues destroyed the general functional rhythmicity of the system until the disturbance became general somatic death that is the death of the entire body resulting the second illustration was poisoning by carbonic oxide the professor gave an illustrated description of the origin and properties of the coloring matter of the blood known as hmoglobin drawing attention to its remarkable formation by a higher synthetical act from the albumenoids in the animal body and to the circumstance that contrary to general rule both its oxidation and reduction may be easily effected it was explained that on this rhythmic action of oxidizing and reducing hmoglobin life depended carbonic oxide like oxygen combined with hmoglobin produced a comparatively stable compound at any rate a compound so stable that it ceased to be the efficient oxygen carrier of normal hmoglobin this interference with the ordinary action of hmoglobin constituted poisoning by carbonic oxide in connection with this subject the lecturer referred to the use of the spectroscope as an analytical agent and showed the audience the spectrum of blood extracted from the hat of the late mr briggs for the murder of whom muller was executed and this was the first case in which the spectroscopic appearances of blood formed the subject matter of evidence the third illustration of poisoning was poisoning by strychnine here again the power of the drug for undergoing oxidation was illustrated it was noted that although our knowledge of the precise modus operandi of the poison was imperfect nevertheless that the coincidence of the first fit in the animal after its exhibition with the formation of reduced hmoglobin in the body was important there followed upon this view of the chemical action of poison in the living body this question given a knowledge of certain properties of the elementsfor example their atomic weights their relative position according to the periodic law their spectroscopic character and so forthor given a knowledge of the molecular constitution together with the general physical and chemical properties of compoundsin other words given such knowledge of the element or compound as may be learned in a laboratorydoes such knowledge afford us any clew whereby to predicate the probable action of the element or of the compound respectively on the living body the researches of blake rabuteau richet bouchardat fraser and crumbrown were discussed the results of their observations being that at present we were unable to determine toxicity or physiological action by any general chemical or physical researches the lecturer pointed out that such relationship was scarcely to be expected poisons acted on different tissues while even the same poison according to the dose administered and other conditions expended its toxic activity in different ways further the allotropic modifications of elements and the isomerism of compounds increased the difficulties why should yellow phosphorus be an active poison and red phosphorus be inert why should piperine be the poison of all poisons to keep you awake and morphine the poison of all poisons to send you asleep although to the chemist these two bodies were of identical composition the lecturer urged that the science of medicine for the poisons of the toxicologist were the medicines of the physician must be experimental guard jealously against all wanton cruelty to animals but to deprive the higher creation of life and health lest one of the lower creatures should suffer was the very refinement of cruelty are ye not of much more value then they spoke a still small voice amid the noisy babble of well intentioned enthusiastslondon times artificial mother for infants all the journals have recently narrated the curious story of the triplets that were born prematurely at the clinic of assas street placed at their birth in an apparatus constructed on the principle of an incubator in order to finish their development therein these frail beings are doing wonderfully well thanks to the assiduous care bestowed upon them and are even showing it appears a true emulation to become persons of importance every one now knows the incubator or artificial henthat box with a glass top in which under the influence of a mild heat hens eggs laid upon wire cloth hatch of themselves in a few days and allow pretty little chicks to make their way out of the cracked shell this ingenious apparatus which has been adopted by most breeders gives so good results that it has already supplanted the mother hens in all large poultry yards and at present thanks to it large numbers of eggs that formerly ended in omelets are now changing into chickens although not belonging to the same race a number of children at their birth are none the less delicate than these little chicks there are some that are so puny and frail among the many brought into the world by the anmic and jaded women of the present generation that in the first days of their existence their blood incapable of warming them threatens at every instant to congeal in their veins there are some which born prematurely are so incapable of taking nourishment of themselves of breathing and of moving that they would be fatally condemned to death were not haste made to take up their development where nature left it in order to carry it on and finish it in such a case it is not as might be supposed to the exceptionally devoted care of the mother that the safety of these delicate existences is confided as the sitting hen often interferes with the hatching of her eggs by too much solicitude so the most loving and attentive mother in this case would certainly prove more prejudicial than useful to her nursling so for this difficult task that she cannot perform there is advantageously substituted for her what is known as an artificial mother this apparatus which is identical with the one employed for the incubation of chickens consists of a large square box supporting upon a double bottom a series of bowls of warm water above these vessels which are renewed as soon as the temperature lowers is arranged a basket filled with cotton and in this is laid as in a nest the weak creature which could not exist in the open air illustration still birth warming apparatus through the glass in the cover the mother has every opportunity of watching the growth of her new born babe but this is all that she is allowed to do the feeding of the infant which is regulated by the physician at regular hours is effected by means of a special rubber apparatus through the aid of an intelligent woman who has sole charge of this essential operation the aeration of the little being which is no less important is assured by a free circulation in the box of pure warm air which is kept at a definite temperature and is constantly renewed through a draught flue the least variations in the temperature are easily seen through a horizontal thermometer placed beneath the glass thus protected against all those bad influences that are often so fatal at the inception of life even to the healthiest babes preserved from an excess or insufficiency of food sheltered from cold and dampness protected against clumsy handling and against pernicious microbes sickly or prematurely born babies soon acquire enough strength in the apparatus to be able finally like others to face the various perils that await us from the cradle the results that have been obtained for some time back at paris where the surroundings are so unfavorable no longer leave any doubt as to the excellence of the process at the lyingin clinic of assas street doctors farnier chantreuil and budin succeeded in a few days in bringing some infants born at six months genuine human dolls weighing scarcely more than from 2 to 4 pounds up to the normal weight of 7 poundslillustration gastrostomy surgery has as is well known made great progress in recent years apropos of this subject we shall describe to our readers an operation that was recently performed by one of our most skillful surgeons dr terrillon under peculiar circumstances in which success is quite rare the subject was a man whose oesophagus was obstructed and who could no longer swallow any food or drink the least quantity of liquid and to whom death was imminent dr terrillon made an incision in the patients stomach and through a tube enabled him to take nourishment and regain his strength we borrow a few details concerning the operation from a note presented by the doctor at one of the last meetings of the academy of medicine illustration fig 1feeding a patient through a stomachal tube illustration fig 2details of the tube c rubber tube for leading food to the stomach e b b rubber balls which inflated with air by means of the tube t and rubber ball p effect a hermetic closing a stopper for the tube c r cock of the air tube mr x fiftythree years of age is a strong man of arthritic temperament he has suffered for several years with violent gastralgia and obstinate dyspepsia for which he has long used morphine the oesophagal symptoms appear to date back to the month of september 1887 when he had a painful regurgitation of a certain quantity of meat that he had swallowed somewhat rapidly since that epoch the passage of solid food has been either painful or difficult and often followed by regurgitation the food seemed to stop at the level of the pit of the stomach so he gave up solid food and confined himself to liquids or semiliquids which readily passed up to december 20 1887 at this epoch he remarked that liquids were swallowed with difficulty especially at certain moments they remaining behind the sternum and afterward slowly descending or being regurgitated this state of things was more marked especially in the first part of january he was successfully sounded several times but soon the sound was not able to pass doctors affre and bazenet got him to come to paris where he arrived february 5 1888 for ten days the patient had not been able to swallow anything but about a quart of milk or bouillon in small doses as soon as he had swallowed the liquid he experienced distress over the pit of the stomach followed by painful regurgitations for three days every attempt made by dr terrillon to remove the obstacle that evidently existed at the level of the cardia entirely failed several times after such attempts a little blood was brought out but there was never any hemorrhage the patient suffered grew lean and impatient and was unable to introduce into his stomach anything but a few spoonfuls of water from time to time as he was not cachectic and no apparent ganglion was found and as his thoracic respiration was perfect it seemed to be indicated that an incision should be made in his stomach the patient at once consented the operation was performed february 9 at 11 oclock with the aid of dr routier the patient being under the influence of chloroform a small aperture was made in the wall of the stomach and a red rubber sound was at once introduced in the direction of the cardia and great tuberosity this gave exit to some yellowish gastric liquid the tube was fixed in the abdominal wall with a silver wire the operation took three quarters of an hour the patient was not unduly weakened and awoke a short time afterward he had no nausea but merely a burning thirst the operation was followed by no peritoneal reaction or fever three hours afterward bouillon and milk were injected and easily digested passing in silence the technical details which would not interest the majority of our readers we shall be content to say that mr x thanks to this alimentation has regained his strength and is daily taking his food as shown in fig 1 the aperture made in the stomach permits of the introduction of the rubber apparatus shown in fig 2 the object of which is to prevent the egress of the liquids of the stomach and at the same time to introduce food a funnel is fitted to the tube and the liquid or semiliquid food is directly poured into the stomach digestion proceeds with perfect regularity and mr x who has presented himself of his own accord before the academy and whom we have recently seen has resumed his health and good spiritsla nature how to catch and preserve moths and butterflies there is no part

easily reach the bottom with the bottle to be described in the other hand never touch wing of moth or butterfly with your fingers the colors are in the dusty down as you call it which comes off at a touch get a glass bottle or vial with large open mouth and cork which you can easily put in and take out the bottles in which druggists usually get quinine are the most convenient it should not be so large that you cannot easily carry it in your pocket let the druggist put in the bottle a half ounce of cyanide of potassium on this pour water to the depth of about threefourths of an inch and then sprinkle in and mix gently and evenly enough plaster of paris to form a thick cream which will set in a cake in the bottom of the vial let it stand open an hour to set and dry then wipe out the inside of the vial above the cake and keep it corked this is the regular entomological poison bottle used everywhere an insect put in it dies quietly at once it will last several months these two tools the net and the poison bottle are your catching and killing instruments you know where to look for butterflies moths are vastly more numerous and while equally beautiful present more varieties of beauty than butterflies they can be found by daylight in all kinds of weather in the grass fields in brush in dark woods sometimes on flowers many spend the daytime spread out others with close shut wings on the trunks of trees in dark woods the night moths are more numerous and of great variety they come around lamps set out on verandas in the night in great numbers a european fashion is to spread on tree trunks a sirup made of brown sugar and rum and visit them once in a while at night with net and lantern catch your moth in the net take him out of it by cornering him with the open mouth of your poison bottle so that you secure him unrubbed now comes the work of stretching your moths this is easy but must be done carefully provide your own stretching boards these can be made anywhere with hammer and nail and strips of wood you want two flat strips of wood about seveneighths or threefourths of an inch thick and eight to fourteen inches long nailed parallel to each other on another strip so as to leave a narrow open space between the two parallel strips make two or three or more of these with the slit or space between the strips of various widths for large and small moths and butterflies make as many of them with as various widths of slit as your catches may demand take your moth by the feet gently in your fingers put a long pin down through his body set the pin down in the slit of the stretching board so that the body of the moth will be at the top of the slit and the wings can be laid out flat on the boards on each side have ready narrow slips of white paper lay out one upper wing flat raising it gently and carefully by using the point of a pin to draw it with until the lower edge of this upper wing is nearly at a right angle with the body pin it there temporarily with one pin carefully while you draw up the under wing to a natural position and pin that put a slip of paper over both wings pinning one end above the upper and the other below the under wing thus holding both wings flat on the stretching board take out the pins first put in the wings and let the paper do the holding treat the opposite wings in the same way put as many moths or butterflies on your stretching board as it will hold and let them remain in a dry room for two three or more days according to size of moths and dampness of climate put them in sunshine or near a stove to hasten drying when dry take off the slips of paper lift the moth out by the pin through the body and place him permanently in your collectionwm c prime in ny jour of commerce the clavi harp the beautiful instrument which we illustrate today is the invention of m dietz of brussels his grandfather was one of the first manufacturers of upright pianos and being struck with the difficulties and defects of the harp constructed in 1810 an instrument cordes pinces clavierthe strings connected with a keyboard many improvements have from time to time been made on this model which at last arrived at the perfection exhibited in the newly patented clavi harp the difficulty of learning to play the ordinary harp and the inherent inconveniences of the instrument limit its use it is furnished with catgut strings which are affected by all the influences of temperature and require to be frequently tuned the necessity of playing the strings with the fingers renders it difficult to obtain equality in the sounds it gives only the natural sounds of the diatonic gamut and in order to obtain changes of modulation the pedals must be employed harmonics and shakes are very difficult to execute on the harp andlast but not leastit is not provided with dampers the external form of the clavi harp resembles that of the harp and all the cords or strings are visible the mechanism which produces the sound is put into motion directly a key is depressed and acts in a similar manner to the fingers of a harpist the strings being pulled not struck the clavi harp is free from all the objections inherent in the ordinary harp the strings are of a peculiar metal covered with an insulating material which has for its object the production of sounds similar to that obtained from catgut strings and to prevent the strings from falling out of tune the keyboard exactly like that of a piano permits of playing in all keys without the employment of pedals the clavi harp has two pedals the first connected with the dampers permits the playing of sustained sounds or damping them instantaneously the second pedal divides certain strings into two equal parts to give the harmonic octaves by the aid of this pedal the performer can produce ten harmonic sounds simultaneously on the ordinary harp only four simultaneous harmonics are possible an ordinary keyboard being the intermediary between the performer and the movement of the mechanical fingers which pluck the strings perfect equality of manipulation is secured the mechanical fingers instantaneously quit the strings on which they operate and are ready for further action the fingers are covered with suitable material so that their contact with the strings takes place with the softness necessary to obtain the most beautiful tones possible illustration the clavi harp the clavi harp is much lighter than the pianoso that it can easily be moved from room to room or taken into an orchestra by one or two personsand is of an elegant form favorable to artistic decoration sufficient will have been said to give a general idea of the new instrument it is undeniable that at the present day that beautiful instrument the harp is seldom played still seldomer well played this is attributable to the difficulties it presents to pupils its seven pedals must be employed in different ways when notes are to be raised or lowered a semitone chromatic passages easy of execution on the piano are almost impracticable on the harp the same may be said of the shake and it is only after long and exclusive devotion to its study that the harp can become endurable in the hands of an amateur or the means of furnishing a professional harpist with a moderate income it is needless to point out how far in these respects the harp is surpassed by the clavi harp vocalists who accompany themselves on the harp are forced by the extension of their arms to reach the lower strings and by frequent employment of their feet on the pedals into postures and movements unfavorable to voice production but they can accompany themselves with ease on the clavi harp composers are restricted in the introduction of harp passages in their orchestral scores owing to the paucity of harpists in some cases composers have written harp passages beyond the possibility of execution by a single harpist and the difficulty and cost of providing two harpists have been inevitable these difficulties will disappear and composers may give full play to their inspirations when the harp is displaced by the clavi harpbuilding news the argand burner argand a poor swiss invented a lamp with a wick fitted into a hollow cylinder up which a current of air was permitted to pass thus giving a supply of oxygen to the interior as well as the exterior of the circular frame at first argand used the lamp without a glass chimney one day he was busy in his work room and sitting before the burning lamp his little brother was amusing himself by placing a bottomless oil flask over different articles suddenly he placed it upon the flame of the lamp which instantly shot up the long circular neck of the flask with increased brilliancy it did more for it flashed into argands mind the idea of the lamp chimney by which his invention was perfected the subterranean temples of india during the last fifteen years bombay has undergone a complete transformation and the english are now making of it one of the prettiest cities that it is possible to see the environs likewise have been improved and thanks to the railways and bungalows inns many excursions may now be easily made and tourists can thus visit the wonders of india such as the subterranean temples of ajunta elephanta nassik etc without the difficulties of heretofore the excavations of elephanta are very near bombay and the trip in the bay by boat to the island where they are located is a delightful one the deplorable state in which these temples now exist with their broken columns and statues detracts much from their interest the temples of ajunta perhaps the most interesting of all are easier of access and are situated 250 miles from bombay and far from the railway station at pachora where it is necessary to leave the cars here an ox cart has to be obtained and thirty miles have to be traveled over roads that are almost impassable it takes the oxen fifteen hours to reach the bungalow of furdapore the last village before the temples and so it is necessary to purchase provisions in these wild and most picturesque places the hindoos cannot give you a dinner even of the most primitive character it was formerly thought that the subterranean temples of india were of an extraordinary antiquity the hindoos still say that the gods constructed these works but of the national history of the country they are entirely ignorant and they do not so to speak know how to estimate the value of a century the researches made by mr jas prinsep between 1830 and 1840 have enlightened the scientific world as to the antiquity of the monuments of india he succeeded in deciphering the buddhist inscriptions that exist in all the north of india beyond the indus as far as to the banks of the bengal these discoveries opened the way to the work done by mr turnour on the buddhist literature of ceylon and it was thus that was determined the date of the birth of sakya muni the founder of buddhism he was born 625 bc and his death occurred eighty years later in 543 it is also certain that buddhism did not become a true religion until 300 years after these events under the reign of aoska the first subterranean temples cannot therefore be of a greater antiquity researches that have been made more recently have in all cases confirmed these different results and we can now no longer doubt that these temples have been excavated within a period of fourteen centuries dasaratha the grandson of aoska first excavated the temples known under the name of milkmaid in behar bengal 200 bc and the finishing of the last monument of ellora dedicated by indradyumna to indra subha occurred during the twelfth century of our era illustration fig 1facade of the temple of pandu lena we shall speak first of the temples of pandu lena situated in the vicinity of nassik near bombay these are less frequented by travelers and that is why i desired to make a sketch of them fig 1 the church of pandu lena is very ancient inscriptions have been found upon its front and in the interior on one of the pillars that teach us that it was excavated by an inhabitant of nassik under the reign of king krishna in honor of king badrakaraka the fifth of the dynasty of sunga who mounted the throne 129 bc the front of this church all carved in the rock is especially remarkable by the perfection of the ornaments in these it is to be seen that the artist has endeavored to imitate in rock a structure made of wood this is the case in nearly all the subterranean temples and it is presumable that the architects of the time did their composing after the reminiscences of the antique wooden monuments that still existed in india at their epoch but which for a long time have been forever destroyed the large bay placed over the small front door gives a mysterious light in the nave of the church and sends the rays directly upon the main altar or dagoba leaving the lateral columns and porticoes in a semiobscurity well calculated to inspire meditation and prayer the temples and monasteries of ajunta too are of the highest interest they consist of 27 grottoes of which four only are churches or chaityas the 23 other excavations compose the monasteries or viharas begun 100 bc they have remained since the tenth century of our era as we now see them the subterranean monasteries are majestic in appearance sustained by superb columns with curiously sculptured capitals they are ornamented with admirable frescoes which make us live over again the ancient hindoo life the paintings are unfortunately in a sad state yet for the tourist they are an inexhaustible source of interesting observations the excavations which have been made one after another in the wall of volcanic rock of the mountain form like the latter a sort of semicircle but the churches and monasteries have fronts whose richness of ornamentation is unequaled the profusion of the sculptures and friezes ornamented with the most artistic taste strikes you with so much the more admiration in that in these places they offer a perfect and varied ensemble of the true type of the buddhist religion during this long period of centuries the picturesque landscape that surrounds these astonishing sculptures adds to the beauty of these various pictures the temples of ellora are no less remarkable but they do not offer the same artistic ensemble the excavations may be divided into three series ten of them belong to the religion of buddha fourteen to that of brahma and six to the dravidian sect which resembles that of jaius of which we still have numerous specimens in the indies excavated in the same amygdaloid rock the temples and monasteries differ in aspect from those of ajunta on account of the form of the mountain ajunta is a nearly vertical wall at ellora the rock has a gentle slope so that in order to have the desired height for excavating the immense halls of the viharas or the naves of the chaityas it became necessary to carve out a sort of forecourt in front of each excavation illustration fig 2plan of the temples of kylas some of the churches thus have their entrance ornamented with porticoes and the immense monasteries which are sometimes three stories high with lateral entrances and facades the mountain has also been excavated in other places so as to form a relatively narrow entrance which gives access to the internal court of one of these monasteries it thus becomes nearly invisible to whoever passes along the road formed on the sloping side of the mountain the greatest curiosity among the monuments of ellora is the group of temples known by the name of kylas fig 2 the monks have excavated the rocky slope on three faces so as to isolate completely in the center an immense block out of which they have carved an admirable temple see t in the plan fig 2 with its annexed chapels these temples are thus roofless and are sculptured externally in the form of pagodas literally covered with sculptures composed with infinite art they form a very unique collection these temples seem to rest upon a fantastic base in which are carved in alto rilievo all the gods of hindoo mythology along with symbolic monsters and rows of elephants these are so many caryatides of strange and mysterious aspect certainly designed to strike the imagination of the ancient indian population fig 3 illustration fig 3subterranean temple at ellora two flights of steps at s and s fig 2 near the main entrance of kylas lead to the top of this unique base and to the floor of the temples the interior of the central pagoda ornamented with sixteen magnificent columns formerly covered like the walls with paintings and the central sanctuary that contains the great idol are composed with a perfect understanding of architectural proportions exit from this temple is effected through two doors at the sides these open upon a platform where there are five pagodas of smaller size that equal the central temple in the beauty of their sculptures and the elegance of their proportions around these temples great excavations have been made in the sides of the mountain at a fig 2 on a level with the ground is seen a great cloister ornamented with a series of bass reliefs representing the principal gods of the hindoo paradise the side walls contain large twostoried halls ornamented with superb sculptures of various divinities columns of squat proportions support the ceilings a small stairway x fig 2 leads to one of these halls communication was formerly had with its counterpart by a stone bridge which is now broken there still exist two p which lead from the floor of the central temple to the first story of the detached pavilion or mantapa d and to that of the entrance pavilion or gopura c at g we still see two sorts of obelisks ornamented with arabesques and designed for holding the fires during religious fetes at e are seen two colossal elephants carved out of the rock these structures made upon a general plan of remarkable character are truly without an equal in the entire world we may thus see how much art feeling the architects of these remote epochs possessed and express our wonder at the extreme taste that presided over all these marvelous subterranean structuresa tissandier in la nature nature timber and some of its diseases1 footnote 1 continued from supplement no 640 p 10222 by h marshall ward iv before proceeding further it will be of advantage to describe another treekilling fungus which has long been well known to mycologists as one of the commonest of our toadstools growing from rotten stumps and decaying woodwork such as old water pipes bridges etc this is agaricus melleus fig 15 a tawny yellow toadstool with a ring round its stem and its gills running down on the stem and bearing white spores and which springs in tufts from the base of dead and dying trees during september and october it is very common in this country and i have often found it on beeches and other trees in surrey but it has been regarded as simply springing from the dead rotten wood etc at the base of the tree as a matter of fact however this toadstool is traced to a series of dark shining strings looking almost like the purpleblack leaf stalks of the maidenhair fern and these strings branch and meander in the wood of the tree and in the soil and may attain even great lengthsseveral feet for instance the interest of all this is enhanced when we know that until the last few years these long black cords were supposed to be a peculiar form of fungus and were known as rhizomorpha they are however the subterranean vegetative parts mycelium of the agaric we are concerned with and they can be traced without break of continuity from the base of the toadstool into the soil and tree fig 16 i have several times followed these dark mycelial cords into the timber of old beeches and spruce fir stumps but they are also to be found in oaks plums various conifers and probably may occur in most of our timber trees if opportunity offers the most important point in this connection is that agaricus melleus becomes in these cases a true parasite producing fatal disease in the attacked timber trees and as hartig has conclusively proved spreading from one tree to another by means of the rhizomorphs under ground only the last summer i had an opportunity of witnessing on a large scale the damage that can be done to timber by this fungus hundreds of spruce firs with fine tall stems growing on the hillsides of a valley in the bavarian alps were shown to me as victims to a kind of rot in most cases the trees which at first sight appeared only slightly unhealthy gave a hollow sound when struck and the foresters told me that nearly every tree was rotten at the core i had found the mycelium of agaricus melleus in the rotting stumps of previously felled trees all up and down the same valley but it was not satisfactory to simply assume that the rot was the same in both cases though the foresters assured me it was so illustration fig 15a small group of agaricus armillaria melleus the toadstool is tawny yellow and produces white spores the gills are decurrent and the stem bears a ring the fine hairlike appendages on the pileus should be bolder by the kindness of the forest manager i was allowed to fell one of these trees it was chosen at hazard after the men had struck a large number to show me how easily the hollow trees could be detected by the sound the tree was felled by sawing close to the roots the interior was hollow for several feet up the stem and two of the main roots were hollow as far as we could poke canes and no doubt further the darkcolored rotting mass around the hollow was wet and spongy and consisted of disintegrated wood held together by a mesh work of the rhizomorphs further outward the wood was yellow with white patches scattered in the yellow matrix and again the rhizomorph strands were seen running in all directions through the mass illustration fig 16sketch of the base of a young tree s killed by agaricus melleus which has attacked the roots and developed rhizomorphs at r and fructifications to the right the fructifications have been traced by dissection to the rhizomorph strands which produced them not to follow this particular case furthersince we are concerned with the general features of the diseases of timberi may pass to the consideration of the diagnosis of this disease caused by agaricus melleus as contrasted with that due to trametes radiciperda of course no botanist would confound the fructification of the trametes with that of the agaricus but the fructifications of such fungi only appear at certain seasons and that of trametes radiciperda may be underground and it is important to be able to distinguish such forms in the absence of the fructifications the external symptoms of the disease where young trees are concerned are similar in both cases in a plantation at freising in bavaria prof hartig showed me young weymouth pines p strobus attacked and killed by agaricus melleus the leaves turn pale and yellow and the lower part of the stemthe socalled collarbegins to die and rot the cortex above still looking healthy so far the symptoms might be those due to the destructive action of other forms of treekilling fungi on uprooting a young pine killed or badly attacked by the agaric the roots are found to be matted together with a ball of earth permeated by the resin which has flowed out this is very pronounced in the case of some pines less so in others on lifting up the scales of the bark there will be found not the silky white delicate mycelium of the trametes but probably the dark cordlike rhizomorphs there may also be flat white rhizomorphs in the young stages but they are easily distinguished these dark rhizomorphs may also be found spreading around into the soil from the roots and they look so much like thin roots indeed that we can at once understand their namerhizomorph the presence of the rhizomorphs and in the case of the resinous pines the outflow of resin and sticking together of soil and roots are good distinctive features no less evident are the differences to be found on examining the diseased timber as exemplified by prof hartigs magnificent specimens the wood attacked assumes brown and bright yellow colors and is marked by sharp brown or nearly black lines bounding areas of one color and separating them from areas of another color in some cases the yellow color is quite brightcanary yellow or nearly so the white areas scattered in this yellow matrix have no black specks in them and can thus be distinguished from those due to the trametes in advanced stages the purpleblack rhizomorphs will be found in the soft spongy wood the great danger of agaricus melleus is its power of extending itself beneath the soil by means of the spreading rhizomorphs these are known to reach lengths of several feet and to pass from root to root keeping a more or less horizontal course at a depth of six or eight inches or so in the ground on reaching the root of another tree the tips of the branched rhizomorph penetrate the living cortex and grow forward in the plane of the cambium sending off smaller ramifications into the medullary rays and in the case of the pines etc into the resin passages the hyph of the ultimate twigs enter the tracheides vessels etc of the wood and delignify them with changes of color and substance as described reference must be made to prof hartigs publications for the details which serve to distinguish histologically between timber attacked by agaricus melleus and by trametes or other fungi enough has been said to show that diagnosis is possible and indeed to an expert not difficult it is at least clear from the above sketch that we can distinguish these two kinds of diseases of timber and it will be seen on reflection that this depends on knowledge of the structure and functions of the timber and cambium on the one hand and proper acquaintance with the biology of the fungi on the other it is the victory of the fungus over the timber in the struggle for existence which brings about the disease and one who is ignorant of these points will be apt to go astray in any reasoning which concerns the whole question any one knowing the facts and understanding their bearings on the contrary possesses the key to a reasonable treatment of the timber and this is important because the two diseases referred to can be eradicated from young plantations and the areas of their ravages limited in older forests suppose for example a plantation presents the following case a tree is found to turn sickly and die with the symptoms described and trees immediately surrounding it are turning yellow the first tree is at once cut down and its roots and timber examined and the diagnosis shows the presence of agaricus melleus or of trametes radiciperda as the case may be knowing this the expert also knows more if the timber is being destroyed by the trametes he knows that the ravaging agent can travel from tree to tree by means of roots in contact and he at once cuts a ditch around the diseased area taking care to include the recently infected and neighboring trees then the diseased timber is cut because it will get worse the longer it stands and the diseased parts burnt if agaricus melleus is the destroying agent a similar procedure is necessary but regard must be had to the much more extensive wanderings of the rhizomorphs in the soil and it may be imperative to cut the moat round more of the neighboring trees nevertheless it has also to be remembered that the rhizomorphs run not far below the surface however my purpose here is not to treat this subject in detail but to indicate the lines along which practical application of the truths of botanical science may be looked for the reader who wishes to go further into the subject may consult special works of course the spores are a source of danger but need be by no means so much so where knowledge is intelligently applied in removing young fructifications i will now pass on to a few remarks on a class of diseaseproducing timber fungi which present certain peculiarities in their biology the two fungi which have been described are true parasites attacking the roots of living trees and causing disease in the timber by traveling up the cambium etc into the stem the fungi i am about to refer to are termed wound parasites because they attack the timber of trees at the surfaces of wounds such as cut branches torn bark frost cracks etc and spread from thence into the sound timber when we are reminded how many sources of danger are here open in the shape of wounds there is no room for wonder that such fungi as these are so widely spread squirrels rats cattle etc nibble or rub off bark snow and dew break branches insects bore into stems wind hail etc injure young parts of trees and in fact small wounds are formed in such quantities that if the fructifications of such fungi as those referred to are permitted to ripen indiscriminately the wonder is not that access to the timber is gained but rather that a tree of any considerable age escapes at all one of the commonest of these is polyporus sulphureus which does great injury to all kinds of standing timber especially the oak poplar willow hazel pear larch and others it is probably well known to all foresters as its fructification projects horizontally from the diseased trunks as tiers of bracketshaped bodies of a cheeselike consistency bright yellow below where the numerous minute pores are and orange or somewhat vermilion above giving the substance a corallike appearance i have often seen it in the neighborhood of englefield green and windsor and it is very common in england generally if the spore of this polyporus lodges on a wound which exposes the cambium and young wood the filaments grow into the medullary rays and the vessels and soon spread in all directions in the timber especially longitudinally causing the latter to assume a warm brown color and to undergo decay in the infested timber are to observed radial and other crevices filled with the dense feltlike mycelium formed by the common growth of the innumerable branched filaments in bad cases it is possible to strip sheets of this yellowish white felt work out of the cracks and on looking at the timber more closely of the oak for instance the vessels are found to be filled with the fungus filaments and look like long white streaks in longitudinal sections of the woodshowing as white dots in transverse sections it is not necessary to dwell on the details of the histology of the diseased timber the ultimate filaments of the fungus penetrate the walls of all the cells and vessels dissolve and destroy the starch in the medullary rays and convert the lignified walls of the wood elements back again into cellulose this evidently occurs by some solvent action and is due to a ferment excreted from the fungus filaments and the destroyed timber becomes reduced to a brown mass of powder i cannot leave this subject without referring to a remarkably interesting museum specimen which prof hartig showed and explained to me last summer this is a block of wood containing an enormous irregularly spheroidal mass of the white felted mycelium of this fungus polyporus sulphureus the mass had been cut clean across and the section exposed a number of thin brown ovoid bodies embedded in the closely woven felt these bodies were of the size and shape of acorns but were simply hollow shells filled with the same feltlike mycelium as that in which they were embedded they were cut in all directions and so appeared as circles in some cases these bodies are in fact the outer shells of so many acorns embedded in and hollowed out by the mycelium of polyporus sulphureus hartigs ingenious explanation of their presence speaks for itself a squirrel had stored up the acorns in a hollow in the timber and had not returned to themwhat tragedy intervenes must be left to the imagination the polyporus had then invaded the hollow and the acorns and had dissolved and destroyed the cellular and starchy contents of the latter leaving only the cuticularized and corky shells looking exactly like fossil eggs in the matrix i hardly think geology can beat this for a true story the three diseases so far described serve very well as types of a number of others known to be due to the invasion of timber and the dissolution of the walls of its cells fibers and vessels by hymenomycetous fungi ie by fungi allied to the toadstools and polypores they all rot the timber by destroying its structure and substance starting from the cambium and medullary rays to mention one or two additional forms trametes pini is common on pines but unlike its truly parasitic ally tr radiciperda which attacks sound roots it is a wound parasite and seems able to gain access to the timber only if the spores germinate on exposed surfaces the disease it produces is very like that caused by its ally probably none but an expert could distinguish between them though the differences are clear when the histology is understood polyporus fulvus is remarkable because its hyph destroy the middle lamella and thus isolate the tracheides in the timber of firs polyporus borealis also produces disease in the timber of standing conifers polyporus igniarius is one of the commonest parasites on trees such as the oak etc and produces in them a disease not unlike that due to the last form mentioned polyporus dryadeus also destroys oaks and is again remarkable because its hyph destroy the middle lamella with reference to the two fungi last mentioned i cannot avoid describing a specimen in the museum of forest botany in munich since it seems to have a possible bearing on a very important question of biology viz the action of soluble ferments it has already been stated that some of these treekilling fungi excrete ferments which attack and dissolve starch grains and it is well known that starch grains are stored up in the cells of the medullary rays found in timber now polyporus dryadeus and p igniarius are such fungi their hyph excrete a ferment which completely destroys the starch grains in the cells of the medullary rays of the oak a tree very apt to be attacked by these two parasites though p igniarius at any rate attacks many other dicotyledonous trees as well it occasionally happens that an oak is attacked by both of these polyporei and their mycelia become intermingled in the timber when this is the case the starch grains remain intact in those cells which are invaded simultaneously by the hyph of both fungi prof hartig lately showed me longitudinal radial sections of oak timber thus attacked and the medullary rays showed up as glistening white plates these plates consist of nearly pure starch the hyph have destroyed the cell walls but left the starch intact it is easy to suggest that the two ferments acting together exert with respect to the starch a sort of inhibitory action one on the other but it is also obvious that this is not the ultimate explanation and one feels that the matter deserves investigation it now becomes a questionwhat other types of timber diseases shall be described of course the limits of a popular article are too narrow for anything approaching an exhaustive treatment of such a subject and nothing has as yet been said of several other diseases due to crustlike fungi often found on decaying stems or of others due to certain minute fungi which attack healthy roots then there is a class of diseases which commence in the bark or cortex of trees and extend thence into the cambium and timber some of these cankers as they are often called are proved to be due to the ravages of fungi though there is another series of apparently similar cankers which are caused by variations in the environmentthe atmosphere and weather generally it would need a long article to place the reader au courant with the chief results of what is known of these diseases and i must be content here with the bare statement that these cankers are in the main due to local injury or destruction of the cambium if the normal cylindrical sheet of cambium is locally irritated or destroyed no one can wonder that the thickening layers of wood are not continued normally at the locality in question the uninjured cells are also influenced and abnormal cushions of tissue formed which vary in different cases now in cankers this isput shortlywhat happens it may be and often is due to the local action of a parasitic fungus or it may be and again often is owing to injuries produced by the weather in the broad sense and saprophytic organisms may subsequently invade the wounds the details as to how the injury thus set up is propagated to other partshow the canker spreads into the bark and wood aroundare details and would require considerable space for their description the chief point here is again the destructive action of mycelia of various fungi which by means of their powers of pervading the cells and vessels of the wood and of secreting soluble ferments which break down the structure of the timber render the latter diseased and unfit for use the only too well known larch disease is a case in point but since this is a subject which needs a chapter to itself i may pass on to more general remarks on what we have learned so far it will be noticed that whereas such fungi as trametes radiciperda and agaricus melleus are true parasites which can attack the living roots of trees the other fungi referred to can only reach the interior of the timber from the exposed surfaces of wounds it has been pointed out along what lines the special treatment of the former diseases must be followed and it only remains to say of the latter take care of the cortex and cambium of the tree and the timber will take care of itself it is unquestionably true that the diseases due to wound parasites can be avoided if no open wounds are allowed to exist many a fine oak and beech perishes before its time or its timber becomes diseased and a high wind blows the tree down because the spores of one of these fungi alight on the cut or torn surface of a pruned or broken branch of course it is not always possible to carry out the surgical operations so to speak which are necessary to protect a tree which has lost a limb and in other cases no doubt those responsible have to discuss whether it costs more to perform the operations on a large scale than to risk the timber with these matters i have nothing to do here but the fact remains that by properly closing over open wounds and allowing the surrounding cambium to cover them up as it will naturally do the term of life of many a valuable tree can be prolonged and its timber not only prevented from becoming diseased and deteriorating but actually increased in value there is no need probably for me to repeat that although the present essay deals with certain diseases of timber due to fungi there are other diseases brought about entirely by inorganic agencies some of these were touched upon in the last article and i have already put before the readers of nature some remarks as to how trees and their timber may suffer from the roots being in an unsuitable medium in the next paper it is proposed to deal with the
