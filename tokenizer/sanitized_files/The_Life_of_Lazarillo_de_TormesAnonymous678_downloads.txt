tormes the author of lazarillo de tormes was a scion of one of the noblest families of spain and some account of it should precede a notice of the authors life1 1 doubt has been thrown on the

created marquis of santillana in 1445 he was opposed to alvaro de luna the famous minister of juan ii born in the asturias the marquis was a poet among his writings was a little serranilla moza tan fermosa no vi en la frontera como una vaquera de la finojosa en un verde prado de rosas y flores guardando ganado con otros pastores la vi tan fermosa que apenas creyera que fuese vaquera de la finojosa translation the sweetest girl without compare in all my days ive ever seen was that young maid so lithe and fair on finojosas frontier green in pleasant shade of beech and pine a verdant meadow did appear and here she watched the browsing kine with other girls but none like her by nature deckd and well arrayed she looked like some bright summer queen and not a common village maid of finojosas frontier green but the chief poetical work of the marquis of santillana was the comedieta de ponza founded on the story of a great seafight near the island of ponza in 1435 between the aragon fleet and the genoese at the request of king juan ii he also made a collection of proverbs for his son enrique iv this was the earliest collection of proverbs made in modern times sidenote

veinte y tres generaciones la prosapia de mendoza no hay linage en toda espaa de quien conozca tan notable antiguedad lope de vega don diego hurtado de mendoza author of lazarillo de tormes don diego hurtado de mendoza was the fifth son of the marquis of mondejar and count of tendilla first spanish governor of granada by francisca pacheco daughter of the duke of escalona the governor had a palace in the alhambra near the torre de picos which is now demolished but the smaller house of his esquire antasio de bracamonte still stands in a garden built against the exquisite little mosque on the walls there are three shields of arms carved on the walls of bracamontes house the palace and the esquires house both within the walls of the alhambra looked across the valley of the darro to the albaicn both buildings were surrounded by gardens and fruittrees sidenote birth of don diego in the alhambra in this romantic spot diego was born in the year 1503 and he passed his early years with his brothers and sisters there pedro martir de angleria was his tutor at an early age he went to the university of salamanca where he learnt latin greek and arabic and studied canon and civil law sidenote don diego at salamanca while he was a student at salamanca don diego wrote lazarillo de tormes on leaving the university don diego went to serve with the spanish armies in italy sidenote his services in italy he also attended lectures at rome bologna and padua and was a profound scholar as well as a statesman and a soldier charles v appreciated his ability and his acquirements in 1538 at the age of thirtyfive he was appointed ambassador at venice he assisted and patronised the aldi and josephus was first printed complete from his library afterwards he was for some time military governor of sienna and he was sent to the council of trent to maintain the imperial interests there his next employment was at rome as special plenipotentiary to rebuke and overawe pope julius iii which he did don diego hurtado de mendoza returned to spain in 1554 at the age of fifty sidenote the library he was not appreciated by philip ii and seldom came to court living with his splendid library in his house at granada in his retirement he wrote a good deal of poetry but his great work was the guerra de granada a narrative of the rebellion of the moors in 15681570 sidenote the guerra de granada he did the moors such impartial justice that his book could not be published until many years after his death sallust was his model the first edition appeared in 1610 and the second more complete edition at valencia in 1776 it is one of the finest pieces of prosewriting in the spanish language in his last years don diego found much pleasant employment in his library sidenote last days he corresponded with zurita the historian of aragon telling him how the work of looking over his books reminded him of many longforgotten things and supplied him with much food for thought while in italy he had been diligent in obtaining greek mss and in other respects his library was quite unique he bequeathed it to philip ii and it is now in the escurial sidenote death of don diego hurtado de mendoza don diego died at madrid in april 1575 aged 72 the book lazarillo de tormes ticknor3 describes lazarillo de tormes as a work of genius unlike anything that had preceded it sidenote ticknors opinion of the work its object is to give a pungent satire on all classes of society it is written in a very bold rich and idiomatic castilian style some of its sketches are among the most fresh and spirited that can be found in the whole range of prose works of fiction those of the friar and the seller of indulgences were put under the ban of the church they were expurgated by the inquisition in 1573 when an expurgated edition was published at madrid and in the index expurgatorius of 1667 3 history of spanish literature i 46971 the first edition in spain was published at burgos in 15544 it is excessively rare sidenote first edition there is a copy at chatsworth but none in the british museum the duke of devonshire allowed the late mr h butler clarke to transcribe his copy of the first edition this was done with great care exactly as it was printed in 1897 mr butler clarke printed 250 copies at oxford with a facsimile of the old titlepage 4 brunet mentions an antwerp edition of 1553 many other editions followed the first of 15545 in mr grenvilles library there is an antwerp edition 12mo of 1555 sidenote value of copies for which he paid seven guineas colonel stanleys copy fetched 3110s mr hanroths 2010s the paris editor of 1827 could only find a 1595 edition 5 at tarragona 1586 zaragoza 1595 medina del campo and valladolid 1603 zaragoza again 1652 with lunas second part madrid 1664 without the second part there was a new edition published at paris in 1847 with the second parts a second part by some wretched scribbler soon appeared without any merit it makes lazarillo go to sea in the algiers expedition of 1541 the ship founders he sinks to the bottom crawls into a cave and is turned into a tunny fish sidenote spurious second parts he is then caught in a seine returns by an effort of will to the human form and finally goes to live at salamanca there was another second part by juan de luna a teacher of spanish at paris it continues the story by making lazaro serve several other masters and then become a religious recluse both second parts are miserable rubbish and ought never to be reprinted yet they are included in recent spanish editions which is much to be deplored for the work itself is a classic in at least two instances the dictionary of the spanish academy refers to lazarillo de tormes as an authority for the meaning of words english translations lazarillo de tormes was first translated into english by david rowlands of anglesey he called it the pleasant history of lazarillo de tormes drawn out of spanish it was published by abel jeffes in the fore street without grepellgate near groube street at the sign of the bell and dedicated to sir thomas gresham it contains the prologue and a short chapter at the end about lazaros continued prosperity which is not in the first edition of 1554 this is the best translation it was published in 1586 a new edition appeared in 1596 also published by abel jeffes who had then removed to the blacke fryers near puddle wharfe there were twenty editions or reprints and lazarillo was exceedingly popular with the elizabethan reading public james blakiston brought out a new edition in 1653 dedicated to lord chandos it consists of the translation by david rowlands omitting the prologue and of a translation of the spurious second part by juan de luna another edition appeared in 1669 another in 1677 the title is the excellent history of lazarillo de tormes the witty spaniard in 1726 there appeared the life and adventures of lazarillo de tormes with twenty curious copper cuts in 1727 the nineteenth edition was published this version is a bad translation omits the prologue and includes the spurious second parts the worst performance of all was the edition of 1789 in two volumes the type is better but it is a very careless reprint of a bad translation it omits the execrable illustrations of the earlier editions spanish names are scarcely recognisable gelves is called the battle of geleas for escalona we have evealona all these translations are from late editions none from the first edition notes on the character of lazaro the conception of the author don diego hurtado de mendoza was first to portray a boy with everything against him rising from the lowest rank of society to a prosperous condition and to give a humorous account of his adventures and secondly to satirise certain types of men the products of the age in which he wrote through the medium of his boy hero the author himself was a boy at the time or at least a very young man a student at salamanca he had no model and the conception was quite original he makes lazarillo de tormes a boy of his own age sidenote the author made lazaros age coincide with his own don diego was born in 1503 assuming lazarillo to have been born in 15036 he was about 10 years old when he took service with the blind man three years with his first three masters and 14 years old when he took service with the seller of indulgences he carried on the business of watercarrier from the ages of 15 to 19 and was 20 when he married that would bring him to 1523 the next year when the cortes met at toledo is made to be the year when lazarillo de tormes wrote the story of his life doubtless it was the year when don diego really completed his little romance also aged 21 6 lazarillo was about eight years old when his father went in the gelves expedition in 1510 in conceiving the character of lazaro it is likely that the young student had in his mind what he himself might have been if he had been born in the same obscurity sidenote the authors conception of the two destinies the two destinies7 were framed out of a noble and an ignoble birth success in the latter case being far more meritorious than in the former we find this reflection in the last sentence of the prologue where don diego points out how much more those have done who not being favoured by noble birth have nevertheless by cleverness and force of character arrived at a good estate if this idea of a boy such as the author but without his noble birth and other advantages was in don diegos mind we should expect to find lazaro portrayed as a boy of a naturally good disposition and fine instincts whose bad qualities were due to his lowly birth and vicious surroundings it is just such a boy as this that don diego presents to us 7 see sir francis doyles poem nothing could be worse than poor lazaros home his mother was a widow who had intimacies with a groom of moorish blood had a child by him and lived on the proceeds of his thieving while lazaro was employed to dispose of the stolen goods sidenote lazaros baneful surroundings as a child his mother not unfeeling when they were found out the widows position became most precarious just then the wonderfully clever and plausible blind man appeared on the scene he offered what in comparison with the boys lot with his mother seemed to be a decent provision she is accused of unfeeling conduct in thus parting with her son i do not think this is intended the poor woman did what she thought was best for the child and their parting was sorrowful and affectionate don diego made her a thief and worse but not a mother without feeling the account of the professional cleverness and knowledge of the blind man is very interesting but in spite of it all the little boy seems to have held his own to some extent with the old rascal sidenote capital stories most amusingly told the trick with the half blancas the story of the wine and of the bunch of grapes are capitally told and very amusing it is true that the old man was handicapped by his blindness though his strength cleverness and experience made up for it he treated lazaro abominably but it must be acknowledged that great as the provocation was the boys revenge was cruel and unfeeling he was sorry afterwards for he wrote that his understanding was blinded in that hour the boys ingenious ways of getting at the provisions of his second master who was starving him are capitally and most amusingly told but the funniest and most witty story in the book is the boys terror at the coffin he believed to be coming to the house and the reason he thought so with the first two masters it was an incessant fight against starvation lazaros resourceful ingenuity was conspicuous and under the circumstances he had a perfect right to use all his wits against the wretches who illtreated him but there was no opportunity of bringing out his finer qualities with the third master it was very different he was a penniless esquire starving himself and so excessively proud that he thought only of concealing his poverty lazaro had to resort to begging and so he kept his poor master as well as himself alive here lazaro comes out in an excellent light sidenote lazaros higher qualities shown in his intercourse with the esquire he was not only kindhearted and generous but he showed tact and a wish to avoid hurting the poor proud creatures feelings don diego thus shows his hero in the light of one of natures gentlemen the esquires account of himself and his views of honour and its obligations are interesting as showing a type of character which was common in spain in those days it was more elaborately portrayed by cervantes lazaro is made to tell the story of the seller of indulgences and a very amusing story it is no doubt true to life for it aroused the anger of the inquisition and was expurgated from future editions but lazaro merely appears as a narrator and his character is not developed though it is in the rapid sketch of his rise to prosperity sidenote development of lazaros character he was a lad who was liked his girlfriends who were kind to him in adversity as well as the archpriest and many others who were good friends when he rose to prosperity showed that he was a favourite among those with whom he came in contact his marriage brought him great advantages critics have called it disgraceful because we are told that evil tongues suggested that the girl had been the archpriests mistress but there is nothing in the narrative to justify the belief that the evil tongues did not lie on the contrary the conclusion is the other way and the story ends with a defence of his wife by lazaro himself the work is the production of a genius sidenote merits of the work its originality and the admirable way in which the stories in it are told make it deserving of a wider audience though of course it is well known to students of the literature of europe seldom has so much wit fun and wisdom been gathered into so small a compass prologue i hold it to be good that such remarkable things as have happened to me perhaps never before seen or heard of should not be buried in the tomb of oblivion sidenote reasons for relating all the circumstances of his life it may be that some one who reads may find something that pleases him for those who do not go very deep into the matter there is a saying of pliny that there is no book so bad that it does not contain something that is good8 moreover all tastes are not the same and what one does not eat another will thus we see things that are thought much of by some depreciated by others hence no circumstance ought to be omitted how insignificant soever it may be but all should be made known especially as some fruit might be plucked from such a tree 8 cervantes knew his lazarillo well he copies this quotation and puts it into the mouth of the curate when he was examining the books of don quixote if this were not so very few would write at all for it cannot be done without hard work sidenote motives of authors not to gain money but to win fame authors do not wish to be recompensed with money but by seeing that their work is known and read and if it contains anything that is worthy that it is praised on this point tully says honour creates the arts think you that the soldier who is first on the ladder cares less for his life than the others certainly not it is the desire for fame that leads him to seek such danger it is the same in the arts and in letters we say the doctor preaches very well and he is one who desires much the welfare of souls but ask him whether he is much offended when they say how wonderfully your reverence has done it so also in arms men report how such an one has jousted wretchedly and he has given his arms to a jester because he praised him for using his lances so well what would he have given if he had been told the truth now that all things go in this manner i confess that i am not more righteous than my neighbours i write in this rough style and all who may find any pleasure in it will be satisfied to know that there lives a man who has met with such fortunes encountered such dangers and suffered such adversities i beseech your honour that you will accept the poor service of one who would be richer if his power was equal to his desire well your honour this author writes what he writes and relates his story very fully it seemed to him that he should not begin in the middle but quite at the beginning sidenote success of the poor should be a lesson to the rich so that there might be a full notice of his personality and also that those who inherit noble estates may consider how little fortune owes them having been so very partial to them in its gifts and how much more those have done who not being so favoured have by force and management arrived at a good estate i lazaro relates the way of his birth and tells whose son he is well your honour must know before anything else that they call me lazarillo de tormes and that i am the son of thom gonales and antonia perez natives of tejares9 a village near salamanca my birth was in the river tormes10 for which reason i have the river for a surname and it was in this manner 9 tejares is a small village on the left bank of the river tormes about two miles from salamanca it consists of a church dedicated to san pedro and about fifty houses on the skirts of a hill 10 the river tormes rises in the sierra de gredos a range of hills dividing estremadura from old castille on the confines of the province of avila its chief sources are a large sheet of water called the laguna de gredos and a perennial stream called tornella receiving several streams from the gredos hills the tormes flows north passing by alba de tormes where there is a stone bridge and then turns northwest passing salamanca where there is another fine stone bridge and ledesma finally it falls into the douro on the portuguese frontier the tormes turns many flour mills my father whom god pardon had charge of a flour mill which was on the banks of that river he was the miller there for over fifteen years and my mother being one night taken with me in the mill she gave birth to me there so that i may say with truth that i was born in the river when i was a child of eight years old they accused my father of certain misdeeds done to the sacks of those who came to have their corn ground he was taken into custody and confessed and denied not suffering persecution for justices sake so i trust in god that he is in glory for the evangelist tells us that such are blessed at that time there was a certain expedition against the moors11 and among the adventurers was my father who was banished for the affair already mentioned he went in the position of attendant on a knight who also went and with his master like a loyal servant he ended his life 11 this expedition against the moors started from malaga under the command of don garcia de toledo in 1510 when lazarillo was seven years old the fleet first touched at sicily and then made for the island of los gelves off the african coast between tunis and tripoli now called zerbi with toledo were diego de vera and count pedro navarro zerbi was a low sandy island covered with palmtrees ruled by a sheikh of its own the army landed on the 8th of august 1510 but the spaniards fell into an ambuscade and were defeated toledo being among the slain four thousand were killed or taken prisoners the rest escaped to the ships and returned to sicily toledo was a grandson of the first duke of alva sidenote death of lazaros father and his mother goes into service my widowed mother finding herself without husband or home determined to betake herself to the good things so as to be among them so she went to live in the city she hired a small house and was employed to prepare victuals for certain students she also washed the clothes of the stableboys who had charge of the horses of the comendador de la magdalena12 thus she frequented the stables she and a darkcoloured man who was one of those who had the care of the horses they came to know each other sidenote flitting sometimes he came to our house late and went away in the morning at other times he came to the door in the daytime with the excuse that he wanted to buy eggs and walked into the house at first i did not like him for i was afraid of his colour and his ugly face but when i saw that his coming was the sign of better living i began to like him for he always brought pieces of meat bread and in the winter fuel to warm us 12 comendadores were knights of the orders of santiago calatrava and alcantara each had a title affixed to their knighthood the comendador of la magdalena was a knight of the order of alcantara sidenote a swarthy stepfather and a little brown brother this intercourse went on until one day my mother gave me a pretty little brown brother whom i played with and helped to keep warm i remember once that when my stepfather was fondling the child it noticed that my mother and i were white and that he was not it frightened the child who ran to my mother pointing with its finger and saying mother he is ugly to this he replied laughing but i noticed the words of my little brother and though so young i said to myself how many there are in the world who run from others because they do not see themselves in them it was our fate that the intimacy of the zayde for so they called my stepfather came to the ears of the steward sidenote the punishment for receiving and living on stolen goods on looking into the matter he found that half the corn he gave out for the horses was stolen also that the fuel aprons pillions horsecloths and blankets were missing and that when nothing else was left the horseshoes were taken with all this my mother was helped to bring up the child we need not wonder at a priest or a friar when one robs the poor and the other his female devotees to help a friend such as himself when the love of a poor stablelad brings him to this all i have related was proved because they crossquestioned me with threats and being a child i answered and let out all i knew from fear sidenote stolen horseshoes down to certain horseshoes which by my mothers order i sold to a blacksmith they flogged my unhappy stepfather and put my mother on the accustomed penance as a punishment an order was given that she was not to enter the stables of the comendador nor to receive the flogged zayde in her house the poor woman complied with the sentence that she might not lose all and to avoid danger and silence evil tongues she went away into service sidenote lazaro helps at the inn takes service with a blind man she was employed in the open gallery of an inn and so she contrived to rear the little brother though suffering from many difficulties she raised him until he could walk and me until i was a fine little boy who went for wine and lights for the guests and for anything else they wanted illustration lazarillo helps at the inn first master how lazaro took service with a blind man at that time a blind man came to lodge at the inn who seeing that i would do to lead him asked for me from my mother sidenote lazaro enters the service of a blind man she gave me to him saying that i was the son of a good father and boasting that he had been killed at the island of gelves13 she told the blind man that she trusted in god that i would not turn out a worse man than my father and she begged him to treat me well and look after me as i was an orphan he answered that he would do so and that he received me not as his servant but as his son thus it was that i began to serve and to lead my new master we were in salamanca for some days but as the earnings were not to my masters liking he determined to go somewhere else sidenote lazaros farewell to his mother when we were about to depart i went to see my mother and both weeping she gave me her blessing and said i shall see you no more strive to be good and may god direct your ways you have been brought up and are now put with a good master farewell and so i went away to my master who was waiting for me 13 see note p 5 sidenote a cruel trick of the wicked old blind man we went out of salamanca and came to the bridge there is at the entrance of it an animal of stone14 which almost has the shape of a bull the blind man told me to go near this animal and being there he said lazaro put your ear against this bull and you will hear a great noise inside i did so like a simpleton believing it to be as he said when he felt that my head was against the stone he raised his hand and gave me a tremendous blow against the devil of a bull so that i felt the pain for more than three days sidenote lazaro and the blind man then he said to me this will teach you that a blind mans boy ought to be one point more knowing than the devil himself and he laughed heartily at his joke it seemed to me that in an instant i awoke from my simplicity in which i had reposed from childhood i said to myself this man says truly that it behoves me to keep my eyes open for i am alone and have to think for myself illustration he answered that he received me not as his servant but as his son 14 there was a huge mass of granite rudely carved in the shape of an animal which had been on the bridge from time immemorial and which lazarillo thought was like a bull its great weight was considered a danger and it was removed about thirty years ago it is now in the vestibule of the cloister of san domingo at salamanca but without a head we set out on our road and in a very few days i showed myself to be sprightly which pleased the blind man and he said i can give you neither gold nor silver but i can teach you much in the ways of getting a livelihood sidenote wonderful sagacity and cleverness of the blind man it was so that after a few days he showed me many things and being blind himself he enlightened and guided me in the ways of life i mention these trifles to your honour to show how much knowledge men must have when they are down and to keep from falling when they are exalted speaking of the good there was in my blind man your honour must know that since god created the world he has not made a being more astute and sagacious in his own line he was unequalled he knew a hundred or more prayers of the choir he recited in a low and very tuneful voice he put on a devout and very humble countenance when he recited without making faces or gestures as others usually do besides this he had a hundred other ways and means of getting money he knew how to make prayers on different occasions for women who were childless for those who were about to bear children and for those who had married unhappily that their husbands might like them well he foretold whether a woman would have a boy or a girl in the matter of medicine he said that galen did not possess half his knowledge for curing toothaches fainting fits or illnesses of mothers finally no one mentioned what pain or illness he or she was suffering from but he told them at oncedo this you should do that gather such a herb take such a root in this way he went with all the world after him especially the women they believed whatever he said and from them he drew great profits by the arts i have described for he gained more in a month than a hundred other blind men would in a year i also desire that your honour should know that in spite of all he acquired and had i never met a man so avaricious and stingy insomuch that he nearly killed me with hunger depriving me of the necessaries of life sidenote the blind mans way of making money and his avarice i tell the truth that if by way of subtlety and cunning i had not found a remedy i should many times have succumbed to starvation with all his knowledge and experience i managed so well that oftener than not i got the best of it on account of these matters there were infernal rows between us of which i will relate some but not all he carried the bread and all the rest of his things in a linen knapsack closing the mouth with an iron chain having a padlock and key he put in and took out his things himself using great vigilance and he kept such a close account that there was not a man in all the world who could have taken so much as a crumb without his knowing it sidenote lazaro finds his way into the blind mans knapsack well i had to take the lazars allowance which he gave me it was all despatched in less than two mouthfuls after he had locked the bag and was not looking out thinking that i was attending to other things by a little unstitching i often opened one side of the bag and sewed it up again bleeding the avaricious knapsack not only of bread but of good pieces of bacon and sausage thus i watched for convenient times to make up for the infernal wrong that the wicked blind man inflicted on me sidenote lazaros adroit contrivance with the half blancas all that i could pilfer and steal i carried in half blancas when they paid him for saying prayers for them they gave him a whole blanca but as he could not see i had got it in my mouth and put a half blanca in its place before his hand had reached it quick as he was so that he only got halfprice the evilminded blind man complained when he found that it was not a whole blanca he said to me how the devil is it that since you have been with me they only give half blancas and before it used to be a whole blanca or even a maravedi that they gave me15 the illluck has come with you so he shortened up the prayers and did not give them more than half ordering me to remind him to stop by pulling his sleeve then he began to cry out that they had called for such and such a prayer from him such as he used to recite and that he had given it 15 the copper maravedi was a coin the value of which varied it may be taken as a penny the blanca was so called from the whiteness of the metal of which it was made in the time of alonso xi there were three blancas to the maravedi from 1497 the maravedi was worth two blancas the great dictionary of the spanish academy quotes lazarillo de tormes as the authority for the value of the blanca and half blanca or farthing the blind man used to have a small jug of wine near him when he dined and quick as thought i gave it silent kisses when i put it down for him but it was not long before he noticed the loss in what he drank so he never let the jug out of his hand but always kept it by him sidenote various ways of getting at the wine however he had no magnet to point to what went on while i had a long oaten straw which i prepared for this need of mine slipping it into the mouth of the jug i sucked up the wine to my hearts content the old rascal being very astute suspected something so he put the jug between his knees and covering the mouth with his hand drank in security seeing the wine go i craved for it the straw being no longer of any avail i hit upon another plan i succeeded in making a tiny hole in the bottom of the jug and stopped it with a small piece of wax when dinnertime came i pretended to be cold and got between the old mans legs to warm myself at the poor little light we had with the same light i melted the wax and very soon a little fountain began to drain into my mouth which i placed so that i should not lose a drop when the poor old man wanted to drink he got nothing his astonishment was expressed in curses devoting the wine and the jug to the devil you cannot think that i have been drinking uncle i said for you have not let the jug out of your hand but he gave the jug so many twists and turns that at last he found the hole he said nothing sidenote the wicked blind mans cruel revenge next day i was sucking at my hole as usual thinking no evil and little dreaming of what he was getting ready for me i was seated on the ground taking in those delicious draughts my face turned up to heaven my eyes half closed the better to enjoy the toothsome liquor when the wicked blind man took his revenge he raised the jug with both hands and with all his might sent it crashing down on my mouth poor lazaro was quite off his guard being careless and joyous as at other times truly it seemed to me as if the sky and all that was in it had fallen upon me the blow was so great that the pieces of the jug cut my face in several parts and broke my teeth so that i remain without them to this day sidenote a coolness arises between lazaro and the blind man from that time i wished evil to the cruel blind man and although he was kind to me afterwards and cured me i saw very well that he enjoyed my cruel punishment he washed the bruises and places torn by the bits of the broken jug but he smiled as he did so saying what would you have lazaro if i wish you ill i cure you and restore you to health with other jokes which were not to my taste when i had only half recovered from my wounds i now wanted to free myself from him thinking that a few more such blows might free him from me he was not much inclined to see to my health and welfare and even if i had wished to forgive him the blow with the jug his evil treatment of me from that time would have prevented it without cause or reason the malignant blind man was always beating me and knocking me about if any one asked him why he treated me so badly he told the story of the jug adding think you that my boy is a little innocent well listen and judge whether the devil himself could have played such tricks who could believe that such a small boy could be so depraved then they said chastise him in gods name and he never did anything else so i led him by the worst ways seeking to do him harm taking him over stony places and into mud sidenote lazaro is beaten so the blind man is led into the mud he always beat me on the back of my head so that it was covered with bruises and although i cried out that i did not do it on purpose but only because there was no better road he did not believe me such was the astuteness and intelligence of the old ruffian in order that your honour may judge of the cleverness of this knowing old man i will relate one thing out of many that happened while i was with him when we left salamanca his intention was to go to toledo for he said that the people there were richer though not very charitable he repeated this saying the hard man gives more than the penniless man we took the road by the best places where we were well received it happened that we came to a place called almorox16 at the time of the vintage a grapegatherer gave us a bunch out of charity as the baskets are knocked about and the grapes at that time are very hard the blind man kept the bunch in his hand and to content me he determined to have a banquet with it instead of putting it in his bag for on that day he had given me many blows and kicks 16 almorox is a village with three hundred houses formed in irregular streets and an open square the church of san cristoval has a fine north door the place belonged to the duke of escalona its vineyards produce wine like valdepeas it is about twelve miles from the town of escalona we sat down in an enclosed place and he said now i am going to treat you with liberality sidenote the way lazaro and the blind man shared a bunch of grapes we will both eat this bunch of grapes in equal shares and it shall be in this way you take one and i will take another you must only take one at a time and i will take another until it is finished in this way there can be no trick so we began at the second turn the old traitor began to take two at a time as he had broken the agreement i thought that i ought to do the same not content to do as he did i began to take three at a time when the bunch was finished he sat for some time with the stalk in his hand sidenote an example of the blind mans cleverness then he said lazaro you have deceived me i would swear to god that you have been eating three at a time i did not eat so i declared why do you suspect me would you know how i am certain that you took three at a time he replied it is because when i began to take two at a time you said nothing though only a boy i noted the cleverness of the old man but to avoid being dull i will leave out many things both curious and remarkable that happened to me while i was with my first master for i wish to come to the leavetaking and with that there is an end of him we were at escalona17 a town belonging to the duke of that name lodging at an inn 17 the duke of escalona was the maternal grandfather of the author the town of escalona is on the right bank of the river alberche and about one hundred feet above it escalona is twentyfive miles northwest of toledo it was surrounded by a wall ten feet thick and thirty feet high with two gates in the principal square there were arcades and a stone cross juan ii gave escalona to the constable alvaro de luna in 1424 who built a great palace there which was demolished by the french under marshal soult king henry iv gave escalona to juan pacheco the master of santiago in lazarillos time it belonged to don diego lopez de pacheco second duke of escalona and marquis of villena he distinguished himself in the last moorish war in granada and died in 1529 he resided in the old palace built by the constable alvaro de luna where he dispensed hospitality among many others to don alonzo enriquez de guzman see translation of that young adventurers life and acts p 71 hakluyt society 1862 madoz states that in his time escalona consisted of 190 houses population 580 sidenote lazaro falls into temptation and eats the sausage the blind man gave me a piece of sausage to roast when the sausage had been basted and the toasted bread on which the grease was poured had been eaten he took a maravedi out of his bag and sent me to fetch wine from a tavern the devil put the temptation before my eyes which as they say is how a thief is made there was also a long piece of colewort18 on the fire which being unfit for the pot ought to have been thrown away there was nobody but the blind man and myself and i became very greedy under the delicious smell of the sausage i only thought of present enjoyment without considering what might happen afterwards as the blind man took the money out of his bag i took the sausage and quickly put the colewort to be cooked in its place when my master handed the money to me i took it and went for the wine not failing to eat the sausage 18 nabo called colewort in the neuman and baretti dictionary more likely what gervase markham country farm p 185 calls navet a sort of small turnip when the sinful blind man found the colewort in the pot of which he knew nothing he thought it was the sausage and bit it then he said what is this lazaro i said had i not gone for the wine some one else has been here and has done it for fun no no he cried that is impossible for i have never let the pan out of my hand i then turned to swear and swore again that it was not me but it availed me nothing from the cunning of the cursed blind man nothing could be hidden sidenote dreadful trouble about the sausage my master got up and took me by the head presently he began to smell me and forcing my mouth open he put his nose in it was a long pointed nose what with the turn i had the choke in my throat and the fright i was in the sausage would not stay on my stomach and the whole thing came back to its owner the evil blind man so worked my inside that the halfmasticated sausage and the long nose came out of my mouth together o lord who would not rather have been buried than go through that misery the rage of the perverse old man was such that if people had not been drawn there by the noise he would not have left me alive they took me from him leaving his few hairs in my hands and his face and throat all scratched which he deserved for his cruel treatment of me the blind man related all my misfortunes over and over again including the story of the jug and of the bunch of grapes the laughter was so loud that all the passersby came in to see the fun for the old wretch told the stories of my misfortunes so well that even i illtreated as i was could not help half joining in the laughter sidenote lazaro recovers from the effects of the sausage remembering my troubles there came a weakness upon me but my stomach recovered and the landlady of the inn with others who were present washed my face and throat with the wine that had been brought to drink this enraged the wicked blind man who declared that i would cost him more wine with my washings in one year than he could drink in two lazaro he said you owe more to the wine than to your father he got you once but the wine has brought you to life several times then he counted how many times he had torn and bruised my face and afterwards cured it with wine if there is a man in the world who ought to be lucky with wine he added it is you those who were washing me laughed a good deal at what the old man said though i dissented however the prognostications of the blind rascal did not turn out false and afterwards i often thought of that man who certainly had the spirit of prophecy19 the evil things he did to me made me sad though i paid him back as your honour will presently hear 19 see p 98 sidenote lazaro determined to leave the blind man seeing all this and how the blind man made me a laughingstock i determined that at all hazards i would leave him this resolution was always in my mind and the last game he played confirmed it on another day we left the town to seek alms it had rained a great deal in the previous night it continued to rain in the daytime and we got under some arcades in that town so as to keep out of the wet night was coming on and the rain did not cease the blind man said to me lazaro this rain is very persistent and as the night closes in it will not cease so we will make for the inn in good time to go there we have to cross a stream which will have become swollen by the heavy rain i replied uncle the stream is now very broad but if you like i can take you to a place where we can get across without being wet for it becomes much narrower and by jumping we can clear it this seemed good advice so he said you are discreet and you shall take me to that place where the stream becomes so narrow for it is winter time and a bad thing to get our feet wet sidenote lazaro prepares to revenge himself on the blind man seeing that things were going as i wished i took him out of the arcade and placed him just in front of a stone pillar that stood in the square then i said to him uncle this is the narrowest part of the stream sidenote lazaros cruel vengeance on the blind man as the rain continued and he was getting wet we were in a hurry to get shelter from the water that was falling upon us the principal thing was seeing that god blinded my understanding in that hour to be avenged the old man believed in me and said put me in the right place while you jump over the stream so i put him just in front of the pillar and placed myself behind it i then said jump with all your might so as to clear the stream i had hardly finished speaking when the poor old man balancing himself like a goat gave one step backwards and then sprang with all his force his head came with such a noise against the pillar that it sounded like a great calabash he fell down half dead how was it you could smell the sausage and not the post oh oh i shouted sidenote lazaro leaves his first master i left him among several people who ran to help him while i made for the gate of the town at a sharp trot so that before nightfall i might be in torrijos not knowing nor caring what afterwards happened to my blind man20 20 the pillar was a stone cross which still stands in the plaza of escalona illustration second master how lazaro took service with a clergyman and of the things that happened to him sidenote the clergymans chest next day as i did not feel that i should be quite safe at torrijos21 i stopped at a place called maqueda22 where for my sins i took service with a clergyman going to him to ask for alms he inquired whether i knew how to assist at mass i said yes which was true for though the blind man illtreated me he taught me many useful things and one of them was this finally the clergyman took me as his servant sidenote out of the fryingpan into the fire i had escaped from the thunder to fall under the lightning for compared with this priest the blind man was an alexander the great i will say no more than that all the avarice in the world was combined in this man but i know not whether it was naturally born in him or whether it was put on with the priestly habit he had an old chest closed with a key which he carried with him fastened to the belt of his gown when he brought the bodigos23 from the church they were quickly locked up in the chest and there was nothing to eat in the house such as is to be seen in other houses a piece of bacon some bits of cheese on a shelf or in a cupboard or a few pieces of bread that may have remained over from the table it seemed to me that the sight of such things even if i could not have them would have been a consolation 21 torrijos is sixteen miles northwest of toledo and eight miles from the tagus in a valley on the road from maqueda to toledo it was walled and still has two old gateways madoz gives it 480 houses and in the plaza is the palace of the count of altamira built of stone the church is dedicated to san gil here beatriz the daughter of king pedro by maria de padilla was born in 1353 the country round yields abundant oil and the place is sometimes called torrijos de los olivares 22 maqueda is six leagues northwest of toledo built on a hill on the margin of a stream of the same name which falls into the alberche a tributary of the tagus it has 112 houses scattered along badly paved dirty streets there is an old castle and two churches san juan bautista and san domingo water is abundant maqueda was taken from the moors by alfonso vi in 1083 and in 1177 it was granted to the knights of calatrava ferdinand and isabella made diego de cardenas duke of maqueda 23 small loaves made of the finest flour offered to the church the dictionary of the spanish academy quotes lazarillo de tormes as the authority for the meaning of this word sidenote nothing in the clergymans house but an old chest and a string of onions there was only a string of onions and these were under lock and key in an upper chamber one being allowed for every four days if i asked for the key to fetch the allowance and any one else was present he put his hand in his pocket and gave it to me with great ceremony telling me to take it and return at once without taking anything else as if all the conserves of valencia were there yet there was not a thing in the room but the onions hanging from a nail and he kept such a strict account of them that if i ever took more than my allowance it cost me dear at last i was near dead with hunger if he showed little charity to me he treated himself as badly small bits of meat formed his usual food for dinner and supper it is true that he shared the gravy with me but nothing more except a small piece of bread on saturdays they eat sheeps head in those parts and my master sent me for one that was to cost three maravedis he cooked it and ate all the eyes tongue brains and the meat off the cheeks giving me the wellpicked bone on a plate and saying take eat triumph for you is the world and you live better than the pope sidenote lazaro was sinking into the silent tomb from hunger at the end of three weeks i became so weak that i could scarcely stand on my feet for hunger i saw myself sinking down into the silent tomb if god and my own intelligence had not enabled me to avail myself of ingenious tricks there would have been no remedy for me sidenote extraordinary stinginess of the clergyman when we were at the offertory not a single blanca was dropped into the shell without being registered by him he kept one eye on the congregation and the other on my hands moving his eyes about as if they were quicksilver he knew exactly how many blancas had been given and as soon as the offertory was over he took the shell from me and put it on the altar during all the time i lived or rather was dying in his service i never was master of a single blanca i never brought a blanca worth of wine from a tavern but it was put into his chest to last for a week to conceal his extreme stinginess he said to me look here boy priests have to be very frugal in eating and drinking and for this reason i do not feed like other people but he lied shamefully for at meetings and funerals where we had to say prayers and responses and where he could get food at the expense of others he ate like a wolf and drank more than a proposer of toasts sidenote lazaro prayed for the deaths of sick people for the sake of the funeral feasts and why do i speak of funerals god forgive me for i never was an enemy to the human race except on those occasions then we could eat well and i wished and even prayed to god that he would kill some one every day when we gave the sacraments to the sick especially extreme unction the priest was called upon to say prayers for those who were present i was certainly not the last in prayer for with all my heart i besought the lord that he would take the sick man to himself if any one recovered i devoted him to the devil a thousand times he who died received many benedictions from me yet the number of persons who died during the whole time i was there which was over six months only amounted to twenty i verily believed that i killed them or rather that they died in answer to my prayers the lord seeing how near death i was and that their deaths gave me life but there was no remedy for if on the days of the funerals i lived on the days when no one died i was starving and i felt it all the more so that there seemed to be no rest for me but in death and i often desired it for myself as well as for others i frequently thought of leaving my penurious master but two things detained me the first was that i feared my legs would not carry me so reduced was i by starvation the other was the consideration that i had had two masters the first starved me the second brought me to deaths door and a third might finish me it appeared that any change might be for the worse sidenote lazaro is saved from starvation by an angel of a locksmith one day when my wretched master was out a locksmith came to the door by chance i thought that he was an angel sent to me by the hand of god in the dress of a workman he asked me whether i had any work for him to do inspired by the holy spirit i replied uncle i have lost a key and i fear that my master will whip me kindly see if there are any on your bunch that will fit the lock and i will pay you for it sidenote the chest opened the angelic locksmith began to try his keys and soon the chest was opened and i beheld the lords gift in the form of bread i have no money i said to give you for the key but take what you like in payment he took one of the loaves that looked the best and went away quite satisfied leaving the key with me sidenote lazaro is happy until the clergyman begins to smell a rat i did not touch anything at the moment because i did not feel the need my wretched master came back and as god willed it he did not look into the trunk which that angel had opened but next day when he had gone out i opened my bread paradise and took a loaf between the hands and teeth in two credos i made it invisible not forgetting the open chest i rejoiced to think that with this remedy my life would be less miserable thus i was happy with him for two days but it was not destined that this should continue sidenote the clergyman counts the loaves of bread for on the third day at the very time that i was dying of hunger he was to be seen at our chest counting and recounting the loaves i dissimulated and in my secret prayers and devotions i implored that he might be blinded after he had been counting for a long time he said if i did not keep such an exact account i should think that some loaves have been taken from this chest from this day i shall have a more accurate account there are now nine loaves and part of another new misfortunes have come i said to myself and i felt that my stomach would soon be in the same wretched state as before when the priest went out i opened the chest as some consolation and when i saw the bread i began to worship it giving it a thousand kisses but i did not pass that day so happily as the day before as my hunger increased so did my longing for more bread at length god who helps the afflicted showed me a remedy i said to myself this chest is old and broken in some parts though the holes are very small the belief might be suggested that rats had got through these holes and had eaten some of the bread it would not do to eat wholesale but i began to crumble the bread over some not very valuable cloth taking some and leaving some and thus i got a meal when the priest came to examine the damage he did not doubt that it had been done by the rats because it seemed to be done just in the way that rats would do it he looked over the chest from one end to the other and saw the holes by which the rats might have entered he then called to me and said lazaro look look what damage has been done to our bread last night i appeared to be much astonished and wondered how it could have happened sidenote it was the rats it is the rats he declared they would leave us nothing we went to our meal and even there it pleased god that i should come off well for he gave me more than usual including all the parts he thought the rats had touched saying eat this which the rat has cleaned thus the work of my hands or rather nails was added to my allowance sidenote the clergyman boards up all the rat holes in the old chest presently i beheld another piece of work the wretched priest was pulling nails out of the wall and looking for small boards with which to cover all the holes in the ancient chest o lord i then said to myself to what miseries and disasters are we born and how brief are our pleasures in this our toilsome life i thought that by this poor little contrivance i might find a way to pass out of my misery and i even ventured to rejoice at my goodfortune and now my illluck has returned using all the diligence in his power for misers as a rule are not wanting in that commodity he shut the door of my consolation while he boarded up the holes in the chest thus i made my lamentation as an end was made to the work with many small boards and nails now said the priest the traitor rats will find little in this house and had better leave us for there is not a hole left large enough for a mosquito to get in illustration it is the rats he declared when he was gone i opened the chest with my key without any hope of profit from doing so there were the three or four loaves which my master thought the rats had not begun upon night and day i thought of some other plan with the help of my hunger for they say that it is an aid to invention it certainly was so with me one night i was deep in thought meditating how i might use the contents of the chest again my master was snoring loudly so i took an old knife and went to the chest i used the knife in the way of a gimlet and as the ancient piece of furniture was without strength or heart it soon surrendered and allowed me to make a nice hole this done i opened the chest had a good meal and went back to my straw bed where i rested and slept next day my master saw both the hole and the damage done to his provisions he began to commend the rats to the devil saying what shall we say to this never have i known rats in this house until now he may well have spoken the truth for such creatures do not stay where there is nothing to eat sidenote what the clergyman did by day lazaro undid by night he turned to find more nails in the wall and a small board to cover the hole night came and he retired to rest while i set to work to open by night what he had closed up in the day it was like the weaving of penelope for all he did by day i undid by night in a few days we got the poor old chest into such a state that it might be described as a sieve of old time rather than a chest when the miserly priest saw that his remedies were of no use he said this chest is so knocked about and the wood is so old and weak that there is not a rat against which it can be defended we will leave it without defence outside and i will go to the cost of three or four reals as the best outside guard is no use i will attack these cursed rats from the inside he presently borrowed a rattrap and begged some pieces of cheese from the neighbours this was a great help to me in truth i did not need much sauce for my bread still i enjoyed the bits of cheese which i got from the rattrap sidenote the rattrap adds cheese to lazaros bread when he found the bread eaten in rats fashion the cheese gone and no rats caught he again commended the rats to the devil he asked the neighbours how the cheese could have been taken without the rat being caught they agreed that it could not have been a rat one neighbour remembered that there used to be a snake in the house and they all concurred that it must have been the snake sidenote it must have been a snake as it is long it could have taken the cheese without being caught in the trap this exercised the mind of my master very much and from that time he slept so lightly that the slightest sound made him think that the snake was going into the chest then he would jump up and give the chest many violent blows with a stick intending to frighten the snake the noise used to awaken the neighbours while i could not sleep he rolled about my straw and me with it because the neighbours said that snakes liked to keep warm in the straw or in cradles where there are babies where they even bit them and were dangerous i generally went to sleep again and he told me about it in the morning saying did you feel nothing last night my boy i was after the snake and i even think it came to your bed for when snakes are cold they seek for warmth i replied it was lucky it did not bite me but i am terribly frightened i did not get up or go to the chest at night but waited until my master was in church he used to see the inroads on his bread but knew not how to apply a remedy i began to be afraid that with all my diligence he might find my key which i kept amongst the straw i thought it would be safer to put it in my mouth sidenote lazaro determined to keep the key in his moutha fatal mistake for when i lived with the blind man i used my mouth as a purse keeping ten or twelve maravedis in it all in half blancas without being prevented from eating without that plan i could not have kept a blanca from the knowledge of the cursed blind man for i had not a seam or a lining which he did not examine very minutely so as i have said i put the key in my mouth every night and slept without fear that my wizard of a master would find it but when misfortune comes wit and diligence are of no avail it chanced owing to illluck or rather owing to my sins that i was sleeping one night with the key in my mouth in such a position that the air went out of the hollow in the key and caused it to whistle so that for my sins my master heard it so he got up with the club in his hand and came to me very quietly that the snake might not hear for he felt no doubt that it was the snake he thought that it was in the straw and he raised the club with the intention of giving it such a blow as to kill it so he hit me on the head with all his force and left me senseless sidenote lazaro is found out and half killed in the process seeing the quantity of blood he understood the harm he had done me and went in a great hurry to get a light coming back he found me with the key in my mouth half of it projecting in the same way as it was when i was whistling with it the killer of snakes was astounded that it should have been the key he took it out of my mouth to see what it was then he went to try it in the lock and found out my practices he said that the rats and the snake that devoured his substance were found what happened in the next three days i know not for i was in the belly of the whale at the end of that time my senses returned i found myself lying on my straw and my head covered with unguents and plasters i was astounded and said what is this the cruel priest answered that he had caught the rats and the serpent finding myself so evilly treated i began to understand what had happened at this time an old woman came in and dressed my wound then the neighbours began to take off the bandages they rejoiced when they saw that i had recovered my senses and began to laugh over my misfortunes while i as the sinner mourned over them sidenote lazaro recovers and is shown the door with all this they gave me something to eat so that in a fortnight i could get up and was out of danger though suffering from hunger on another day when i was up my master took me by the hand and put me outside the door being in the street he said from today lazaro you are your own master and not my servant seek another master and go in gods name for i do not want such a diligent person in my service who is only fit to be a blind mans guide he then crossed himself as if he thought i had a devil went back into the house and shut the door illustration third master how lazaro took service with a gentleman and what happened to him thus i was obliged to seek strength out of weakness and little by little with the help of kind people i reached this famous city of toledo sidenote lazaro reaches toledo and seeks for a master at the end of fifteen days by the mercy of god my wound was healed while i was ill people gave me some alms but as soon as i was well they all said you lazy little vagabond go and seek for a master whom you may serve but where can i find one i said to myself sidenote on the road to toledo i was wandering about from door to door without any settled purpose when i came upon an esquire24 who was walking down the street fairly well dressed and groomed he looked at me and i at him sidenote the esquire he then said boy are you seeking for a master i replied yes sir then come along behind me he said for god has shown mercy to you by letting you meet with me so i followed him giving thanks to god judging from his dress and manner i thought he was the sort of master of whom i stood in need 24 escudero the english equivalent is esquire latin armiger selden says that the original of this title was the office or function of armiger or scutifer our esquire and the french escuyer are derived from scutarius in froissart we have knights and esquires in spain cavalleros knights and escuderos esquires sidenote lazaro enters the service of an esquire it was in the morning when i met with my third master and i followed him over a great part of the city he passed by the place where they sell bread and other provisions and i thought and desired that he would employ me to carry what he bought for it was the time for marketing but with a slow step he passed by all these things perhaps i thought he is not satisfied with them and intends to make his purchases in some other place in this way we walked about until eleven in the forenoon when he entered the principal church and i at his heels i saw him hear mass and the other divine offices very devoutly until the service was all finished and the people had gone then we left the church and began to walk down the street i was the happiest boy in the world to see that my master had not troubled himself about marketing for i deduced from that the belief that he had everything at home where i should find all that i desired at last we came to a house before which my master stopped and i with him illustration i followed him over a great part of the city sidenote the esquire takes lazaro to his house throwing the end of his cloak over his left shoulder he took a key out of his sleeve and opened the door we entered the house it was so dark and dismal that it might cause fear to any one coming in within there was a small court and fairsized rooms he then took off his cloak and first asking whether i had clean hands he shook it and folded it then after very carefully blowing the dust off a bench that was there he put the cloak on it having done this he sat upon it and began to ask me questions in great detail as to where i came from and how i reached the city i had to give him a much longer account than i cared for as it seemed to me that it was a more convenient time for laying the cloth and getting the meal ready than for answering what he asked nevertheless i satisfied his curiosity with the best lies i could invent relating all i had done well and holding my tongue about the rest which did not appear to me to be appropriate sidenote nothing to eat in the esquires house this done we remained in the same place for a while it was now nearly two oclock in the afternoon and there was no more sign of anything to eat than there would be for the dead after this my master closed the door and locked it and neither above nor below was there a sign of any other person in the house all i had seen was walls without chairs or table or even a chest like that of the rats and snake it was like a house bewitched at this juncture he said to me you my boy have you eaten no sir said i for it was not eight oclock when i met your worship well he said although i have breakfasted this morning i shall be fasting until night so you must hold on and afterwards we will have supper sidenote lazaro sees trouble ahead about food but he dissimulates when i heard this i was very much depressed not so much from hunger as from the knowledge that the luck was continuing to be against me for my hardships seemed to be coming back i mourned over my troubles and remembered what i once thought when i was meditating on leaving the priest that illfortune might bring me to something worse finally i began to weep over my miserable past life and over my approaching death at the same time i dissimulated as well as i could sir i said i am a boy who does not trouble much about eating blessed be god so that i am able to receive praise among all my equals as the one who has the most moderate appetite and for this i have even been praised up to this time by my former masters this is a virtue he replied and for this i like you better gluttony is for pigs and to eat with moderation for respectable people well do i understand you said i to myself and cursed be such medicine and such kindness as i have had from my masters who give me nothing but starvation sidenote the esquire and lazaro sup on the boys three pieces of bread i then put myself in one corner of the doorway and took some pieces of bread out of my bosom which remained from what had been given me when he saw it he said to me come here my boy what is it you are eating i came to him and showed him he took for himself the largest of the three pieces i had and said to me by my life this bread seems good and sir said i it is good yes by my faith said he where did you get it fromare you sure it was kneaded with clean hands i do not know that said i but the smell of it does not turn my stomach please god said my poor master and putting it to his mouth he began to take as voracious mouthfuls as i did with mine it is most delicious he said i feared he would finish first and that he would want to help me with what was left of mine so we both came to an end at the same time sidenote a meagre supper and a wretched bed my master then began to collect with his hand a few crumbs which had remained on our breasts then he went into a small room and brought out a jug without a spout and not very new after he had had a drink he offered it to me i said sir i do not drink wine it is water he replied and you can well drink it then i took the jug and drank but not very much as thirst was not my complaint so we remained until the night talking about things he had asked me while i gave the best answers i could he took me into the chamber out of which he had brought the jug of water and said boy stay here and see how we make this bed that you may know how to make it henceforward he put me at one end and himself at the other and he made the miserable bed there was not much to make he had a sort of hurdle on trestles over this he spread clothes they did not look very like a mattress but served as one with much less blanket than was necessary what there was we spread out but it was impossible to soften the bed it was too hard when the bed was made and the night being come he said to me lazaro it is now too late it is a long way to the marketplace and in this city there are many thieves who prowl about at night we must do the best we can and tomorrow when it is light god will have mercy being alone i am not provided for i have been in the habit of having my meals outside but now we will arrange things in another way sidenote the esquires apology for no supper his philosophical view of starvation sir i replied do not trouble about me for i can pass a night like this you will become more and more healthy he then told me for there is nothing in the world that lives long but it eats little if that is so i said to myself i shall never die for i have always been obliged to observe that rule by force and even if my illluck continues it may be so all my life he lay down on the bed using his hose and doublet for a pillow and ordered me to put myself at his feet i did so but not to go to sleep for the canes of the hurdle and my protruding bones struggled with each other without ceasing what with my hardships misery and starvation i do not think there was a pounds weight of flesh on my body sidenote a very bad night as i had scarcely eaten anything all day i was wild with hunger which is not a friend of sleep i cursed my fate and my illluck a thousand times may god pardon me i was like that most of the night not daring to turn for fear of awakening my master and i prayed to god many times for death sidenote the esquire attends to his outward appearance when morning came we got up and began to shake and brush the doublet and hose the coat and cloak my master dressed himself very carefully combed his hair washed his hands and put his sword on as he did so he said to me ah my boy if you only knew what a weapon this sword is there is not a mark of gold in the whole world for which i would give it moreover there is not a sword among all that antonio ever made that has the steel so tempered as this one then he drew it out and tried it with his finger saying look here i am obliged to use a ball of wool for it i said to myself and i need a piece of bread for my teeth though they are not made of steel he put his sword back and with a stately pace his body erect his head turned gently from side to side throwing the end of his cloak over his shoulder and putting his right hand on his side he said lazaro take care of the house make the bed fetch water from the river for the jug as it is getting low i am going to hear mass lock the door that nothing may be stolen placing the key on the hook by the hinge that i may be able to come in when i return illustration what there was we spread out sidenote stately appearance of the esquire when he walked abroad he then marched down the street with such a contained and noble air that any one who did not know the contrary would have thought that he was a very near relation to the count of arcos25 or at least his chamberlain who had been clothed by him a blessing on you my lord i was left saying who gives the disease and provides the remedy who would meet my master and judging from his satisfied look not suppose that he had supped well and slept in a comfortable bed and that in the morning he had had a good breakfast sidenote lazaros reflections on the secrets hidden under the esquires cloak great secrets sir are those which you keep and of which the world is ignorant who would not be deceived by that fair presence and decent cloak and who would think that the same gentleman passed all that day without eating anything but the bit of bread which his servant lazaro had carried all day in his bosom where it was not likely to find much cleanliness today washing his hands and face he had to wipe them with the end of his cloak for want of a towel certainly no one would have suspected it o lord how many such as him must be scattered over the world who suffer for the jade they call honour that which they would not suffer for a friend 25 the duke of arcos was a very grand nobleman the title belonged to the family of ponce de leon but before this was written the head of the family had become duke of cadiz a title which was afterwards changed to that of duke of arcos the second duke was flourishing at this time and died in 1590 count in the text is a mistake it should be duke sidenote lazaros reflections he goes for water and finds his master flirting on the river bank i was standing at the door looking out and thinking of these and many other things until my master disappeared down the long and narrow street then i went back into the house and in the time that it would take to say a credo i had run all over it without finding anything i made the hard bed took up the jug and went with it to the river there i saw my master in great request with two fair ladies in a garden there were other ladies for many think it fashionable to go and refresh themselves on summer mornings by those pleasant banks in confidence that they will be well received several gentlemen of the place also frequent the riverside as i have said my master was among them saying the sweetest things that ovid ever wrote they had no shame in asking him to pay for their breakfasts but he finding that he was as cold in the purse as he was empty in the stomach began to have that feeling which robs the face of its colour and to make not very valid excuses when they saw his infirmity they went to those who were not suffering from it i was breaking my fast with some stalks of vegetables with great diligence and not seeing any more of my master i went back to the house i thought of sweeping some part of it which was very necessary but i could find nothing with which to do it so i set myself to think what i should do next sidenote lazaro waits long for his master to bring food but he never came i thought i would wait for my master until noon when he came he might by good luck bring something for us to eat but there was no such experience for me it was two oclock my master had not come and i was desperately hungry so i shut the door put the key where i was told and gave all my attention to my own necessities sidenote lazaros successful begging expedition with a low and feeble voice and my hands in my bosom the good god before my eyes and my tongue repeating his name i began to pray for bread at the largest houses and doors i came upon as this method was sucked in with my mothers milk or i should say that i learnt it from that great master of it the blind man so good a disciple was i that although in this city little is known of charity nor had it been an abundant year i made such a good haul that before the clock struck four i had several pounds of bread inside me and two loaves up my sleeve and in my bosom i returned to the house and in passing a tripeshop i begged of one of the shopwomen who gave me a piece of a cows foot and several pieces of boiled tripe when i got back to the house my good master was already there the cloak was folded and put on the bench and he was pacing up and down he came up to me and i thought he was going to scold me for being late he asked me where i had been and i said sir i was here until it struck two but when i saw that you were not coming i went over the city to commend myself to the kind people and they have given me what you see i showed him the bread and the tripe which i carried in the end of my skirt at this he seemed well pleased and said well i waited for you to eat and when you did not come i ate what there was but you have done well in this for it is better to beg in the name of god than to steal he helps me as he sees fit sidenote what touches the esquires honour i merely charge you that people must not be told that you live with me for it touches my honour though i well believe that it will be kept secret because very few people know me here illustration gave me a piece of a cows foot and several pieces of boiled tripe do not be troubled about that sir i replied to him for cursed be he who asks the question and myself if i tell him anything no we shall soon be free from want when i saw that nothing good came into this house i went out surely the ground must be bad or there must be unlucky houses which bring illluck to those who live in them this one must be so without doubt he replied i promise you that after a month i will not stay in it even if it is given me as my own i sat down at the end of the bench and that he might not take me for a glutton i said nothing about the meal i began supper and to bite my bread and tripe sidenote the esquire longs for a share of lazaros supper looking stealthily i saw that my unhappy master could not take his eyes off my skirt which served as a plate may god have as much pity for me as i had for him i could feel what he felt and have been feeling so every day i thought whether it would be right for me to invite him to share for as he had told me that he had dined he might decline the invitation finally i asked that sinner to help me in my work and to break his fast as he did the day before he had a better chance the food being better and my hunger less it pleased god to comply with my wish and i even think with his for as he passed in walking up and down he came to me and said i assure you lazaro that you have the best grace in eating that i ever saw in any one and that no one can see you doing it without having a longing to eat even when he had no such longing before the great longing that you have makes you think my way of eating so beautiful i said to myself and causes your wish to help me sidenote lazaros courtesy tact and kindness he longed to join me and i opened a way by saying sir the good tools make the good craftsman this bread is delicious and this cows foot is so well cooked and seasoned that there is no one that would not be drawn to it by the smell alone cows foot is it he said yes sir i tell you that is the best mouthful in the world there is not even a pheasant that is so good try it sir said i and see whether it is as good as you think sidenote lazaro generously provides his master with a supper i put on one side the cows foot and three or four pieces of bread and he sat down by my side and began to eat as if he would like to devour every little bone this wonderful food is like a hotchpotch he said you eat with the best kind of sauce i replied before god said he if i had known i would not have eaten a mouthful all day thus the good years avenge me i said to myself he asked me for the jug of water and i gave it to him just as i had brought it my master had not overeaten and it is a sign of this that there was no want of water we both drank and went to bed in the same way as the night before well contented to avoid prolixity i may say that the same thing went on for the next eight or ten days in the mornings my master went out to take the air in the streets with the same satisfied look leaving poor lazaro with the head of a wolf i often reflected on my misfortune that escaping from the evil masters i had served and seeking to better myself i should have found one who not only did not maintain me but whom i had to support with all that i liked him well enough seeing that he could not do better my feeling was rather of sorrow than of enmity often i fared ill in bringing to the house that with which he might be satisfied sidenote lazaro examines the esquires clothes and finds nothing one morning the sad esquire got out of bed in his shirt and went up to the roof of the house i quickly searched the hose and doublet at the head of the bed and found a small purse of velvet but there had not been so much as a blanca in it for many a day this man i said to myself is really poor and cannot give what he has not got the avaricious blind man and the illconditioned clergyman may god reward them both nearly killed me with hunger the one with a kiss on the hand the other with a deceitful tongue those it is right for me to detest but for this poor man to have a tender feeling god is my witness that even now when i meet with any one dressed like this and walking with the same pompous air it makes me sad to think that he might be suffering what i saw my poor master suffer sidenote lazaro has a kindly feeling for his third master with all his poverty i liked serving him but not the other two masters i only felt some discontent for i should have liked him not to be quite so proud and to have lowered his pretensions just a little when his necessities were so great but it seems to me that it is a wellestablished rule among such people to march with their caps well cocked though they have not a blanca to their names the lord have mercy on those who have to die of this disease sidenote begging prohibited i was in this condition passing the life i have described when my illluck again began to pursue me in that land the year was one which only yielded a bad harvest so the municipal authorities resolved that all mendicants should leave the town with the addition that any who remained after four days should be punished by whipping then the law took effect and there were processions of poor people being whipped down the four streets this so frightened me that i did not dare to transgress by begging so you may imagine the abstinence of our house and the sadness and silence of its inmates we were two or three days without eating a mouthful or speaking a word sidenote lazaro is kept alive by some kind shopgirls some young women sewers of cotton who made caps and lived near us kept me alive for i had made friends with them from the little they had they gave me enough to keep body and soul together i was not so unhappy for myself as for my forlorn master who in eight days never ate a mouthful at least in the house i do not know where he went or what he had to eat when he went out i used to see him come back at noon walking along the street with dignified carriage thinner than a greyhound of good breed and with regard to what touched the nonsense he called honour he brought a straw of which we had not enough in the house sidenote master and boy in a miserable and starving condition coming to the door he would grind his teeth with nothing between them complaining all the time of his bad lodging and saying it is a bad thing to see and a most unlucky place to have to live in and while we have to be here it will always be wretchedly sad we have got to endure it but i wish that this month was over so that we might leave it sidenote the esquire brings home a real but bemoans his fate being in this miserable and starving condition one day i know not through what goodfortune or chance my poor master became possessed of a real he came to the house with it as delighted as if he had got all the riches of venice and smiling at me with a very joyous expression he said take it lazaro for god has at length begun to open his hand go to the market for bread meat and wine for we will break the devils eye i would further have you to know that i have taken another house and that we shall not have to be in this wretched one for more than another month may it be accursed and he who placed the first tile to build it o lord how have i lived here scarcely a drop of wine have i drunk nor a morsel of bread have i eaten nor have i ever had any rest here and it looks so sad and forbidding go and return quickly for today we will eat like counts i took the jug and the real and giving speed to my feet i began to run up the street to the market very joyful and contented but of what avail if evil fortune always brought anxiety with my joy so it was on this occasion as i ran up the street i was calculating how i could spend the money to the best advantage and most profitably giving thanks to god that my master had got something to spend sidenote terror of lazaro thinking they were bringing a dead body to his house suddenly i met a funeral with many priests and mourners i got up against the wall to let them pass presently they came one in deep mourning apparently the wife of the deceased with other women she was crying with a loud voice and saying o my lord and husband whither are they taking you to the sad and empty house to the dark and wretched place to the house where there is nothing to eat and drink when i heard this the heaven and earth seemed to be joined together i exclaimed o unhappy me it is to our house that they are taking this dead body i turned back slipped through the crowd of people and ran down the street as fast as i could to our house sidenote lazaro bars the door to keep out the dead body when i got there i began to close the door in great haste calling on my master to come and help and to defend the entrance he was rather surprised thinking it was something else and said to me what is this my boy what are you making a noise about what are you doing why are you shutting the door in such a fury oh sir i cried they are bringing a dead body here how do you know he said i met it in the street i replied and the dead mans wife was crying and shouting my lord and husband whither do they take you to the dark and dismal house to the sad and wretched place to the house where they never eat nor drink it must be here sir that they are bringing it certainly when my master heard this though he had no great reason to be merry he laughed so heartily that it was a long time before he could speak by this time i had got the beam across the door and put my shoulder against it to make it more secure sidenote lazaro barring the door the people passed with their corpse and all the time i pushed against the door to prevent them from getting into the house at last when he had had much more of laughing than of eating my good master said to me in truth lazaro seeing what the widow was saying you were right to think as you did but god has been good to us and they have passed so open open and go and get the food let me wait sir until they are out of the street i begged sidenote at last the esquire unbars the door and lazaro does his marketing at last my master came and opened the door in spite of me which was necessary because i was so upset with fear and excitement i then went out we ate well on that day but i took no pleasure in it nor did my colour come back for three more days while my master smiled a good deal whenever he noticed the state i had been in in this way i continued with my third and poorest master the esquire for several succeeding days always longing to know the reason of his coming and remaining in this place for from the first day that i took service with him i saw that he was a stranger from the little intercourse he had with the inhabitants sidenote the esquire tells his story to lazaro at last i accomplished my desire and came to know what i wanted it was one day when we had eaten reasonably well and were rather well satisfied he told me about his affairs and said that he came from old castille he said he had left his home for no other reason than that he had not taken off his cap to a knight who was his neighbour sir i said if that was what happened and he was greater than you were you not wrong in not having doffed your cap first but he ought to have taken his off as well he went on to say that the knight did take off his cap to him but that he had taken his off first so many times that it was well to see what the other would do it seems to me sir said i that you should have doffed to one greater and richer than yourself sidenote the esquire expounds his views of honour to lazaro you are only a boy he replied and cannot understand the things appertaining to honour in which at the present time is all the wealth of respectable people you must remember that i am as you know an esquire i swear to god that if i met a count in the street and he did not salute me i would not salute him if i met him again i should enter some house as if i had business there or turn down another street before he came near me for a gentleman owes nothing to any one but god and the king nor is it right for a man of honour to forego his selfrespect i remember that one day in my country i affronted and nearly came to blows with an officer because whenever i saluted him he said may god preserve your honour you are a wretch i said for you are not well bred you said to me god preserve you as if i was nobody from that time he took off his cap and behaved properly sidenote the esquire continues to discourse on the same subject is it not good manners for one man to salute another i asked or to say god preserve you he answered it is only underbred people who talk thus to gentlemen like myself it should be not less than i kiss the hands of your honour or at the very least i kiss your hand sir if he who speaks is a knight in my own land i would not suffer a mere god preserve you nor will i suffer it from any man in the world from the king downwards sinner that i am said i for having taken so little care about it but will you not suffer any one to pray for you he continued above all i am not so poor but that i possess in my own country an estate of houses which are wellbuilt sixteen leagues from where i was born in the vicinity of valladolid they would be worth two hundred times a thousand maravedis if they were in good repair and i also have a pigeoncote which if it was not demolished would give out two hundred pigeons every year as well as other things about which i am silent as it might touch my honour sidenote the esquires honour makes him fastidious in accepting employment i came to this city because i expected to find a good appointment but things have not turned out as i thought canons and other churchmen find plenty because their profession is not overcrowded careless gentlemen also seek me but to serve with such people involves great trouble for a man must lose his selfrespect with them if not they tell you to go in gods name while the pay is usually at long intervals when they wish to clear their consciences and pay for your work they make you free of a wardrobe containing a worn doublet and a frayed cloak sidenote service with a great lord is not to the esquires liking when a man takes service with a titled lord there is also misery i cannot undertake to serve or content such by the lord if i should engage myself to one i think that i should be a great favourite and that he would confer great favours on me but i should have to like his habits and customs though not the best in the world i should be expected never to say a word that would displease to be very careful in word and deed not to kill myself in doing things which the great man would not see never to consort with those who would do him disservice because it would behove me to guard his interests if some servant of his excites his anger by neglecting his duties and it should appear that something might be said for the accused on the contrary you must scoff at the poor fellow maliciously it is a duty to inform against those in the house and to find out what is done outside so as to report it many other things of a like kind are the custom in a palace and with the lord of it who appears honourable but such lords do not want to see virtuous men in their houses on the contrary they hate and despise them calling them useless and unacquainted with business i do not wish to trust my fortunes with such people sidenote when the people came for their rent the esquire disappeared in this way my master was lamenting his illfortune and giving me an account of his valorous person while he was thus employed a man and an old woman came in by the door the man asked for the rent of the house and the old woman for the rent of the bed saying that they were hired from two months to two months i think the sum required was twelve to thirteen reals my master gave them a very civil answer saying that he would go out and get change and return in the afternoon but his departure was without any return they returned in the afternoon when it was late and i told them that he had not yet come back the night came but he did not i was afraid to stay in the house alone so i went to my girlfriends told them what had happened and slept there when morning came the creditors returned and asked for the lodger the girls answered that his boy was there and that the key was in the door they asked me where my master was and i answered that i did not know where he was but that he had gone out to get change i thought that he had gone with the change from me as well as from them sidenote creditors search for the esquires effects but there are none when they had heard what i had to say they went for an officer and a scrivener presently they returned with them they took the key called me and some witnesses opened the door and went in to take possession of my masters effects until he had paid his debts they went all over the house and found it empty then they asked me where my masters effects were his chest clothes and jewelry i said that i did not know no doubt they said they have got up in the night and taken them somewhere else sidenote lazaro is taken into custody sir they said to the officer take this boy into custody for he knows where the effects are on this the officer came and took me by the collar saying boy you are my prisoner if you do not show us the goods of your master illustration they returned in the afternoon i never was in such a plight as this though i had been taken by the collar many times i was dreadfully frightened and began to cry promising to tell them all they might ask that is well they said tell all you know and you have nothing to fear the scrivener then sat down on the bench to write out the inventory asking me what there was i said what my master has according to what he told me is a very good estate consisting of houses and a demolished pigeoncote this is worth little they said but it will do for the payment of his debts in what part of the town is it in his own country i replied by the lord this is a fine business they exclaimed and where is his country he told me that it was in old castille i said the officer and the scrivener laughed a good deal and said this is a good story to cover your debts sidenote lazaro is released at the intercession of his girlfriends the girls who were my neighbours and who were present then said sirs this is an innocent child and has only been a few days with that esquire and knows no more than your worships he used to come to our house and we gave him to eat what we could spare for the love of god and at night he went to sleep with the esquire seeing that i was innocent they let me go then the officer and the scrivener asked for their fees from the man and the old woman over which there was much contention and noise they declared that they ought not to be forced to pay for they had got nothing to pay with and that the seizure of goods had not been made the others maintained that they had been taken away from other business of more consequence finally after making a great noise they went away and i do not know how it ended sidenote lazaro finds himself deserted by his master having rested from my past troubles i went about to seek employment thus i left my poor third master and know not his unhappy fate looking back at all that had gone against me i found that i had managed my affairs in a reverse way masters are usually deserted by their boys but with me it was not so for my master deserted and fled from me fourth master how lazaro took service with a friar of the order of mercy and what happened to him i had to seek for my fourth master he was a friar of the order of mercy who was pointed out to me by my girlfriends they called him a relation he was a great enemy of the choir and of having his meals in the convent he was fond of walking about of secular business and of paying visits so much so that i think he wore out more shoes than any one else in the convent the friar gave me the first shoes i ever burst in my life they did not last eight days i could not endure so much trotting about for this reason and some other little things i will not mention i left him fifth master how lazaro took service with a seller of papal indulgences my fifth master chanced to be a man engaged in the sale of papal indulgences26 he was the most shameless and impudent distributor of them that ever i saw or hope to see nor do i believe that any one else ever saw one like him for he had and sought out his own modes and methods and very cunning inventions coming to the place where he wanted to effect the sales he began by making trifling presents to the clergy but nothing of any great value a lettuce of murcia if it was the season a couple of lemons or oranges a peach a couple of nectarines or some green pears in this way he got them into good humour for favouring his business and inducing their parishioners to buy his indulgences 26 the pardoner or seller of indulgences was also caricatured in chaucers canterbury tales a century and a half earlier sidenote subtle contrivances of the seller of indulgences if they said that they understood latin he did not say a word in that language for fear of stumbling but he resorted a gentle and wellconsidered way of telling his story with a most seductive tongue if he found that the clergy were of the reverend class he talked to them in latin for two hours at least what appeared like latin though it might not have been so when the people did not buy the indulgences freely he sought how to make them do so by bringing trouble on their village at other times he tried cunning tricks but as all his devices would take long to relate i will only recount one that was specially subtle and proved his sufficiency he had preached for two or three days in a village near toledo using all his accustomed arts but no one had bought an indulgence nor was there any sign of an intention to do so he had devoted them all to the devil and was meditating what to do next when he determined to call the parishioners together the next morning and make a last effort sidenote sham quarrel between the seller of indulgences and the constable that night he and the constable27 after supper sat down to play at cards and they began to quarrel over the game and make use of bad language the seller of indulgences called the constable a thief and the constable called him a liar on this my master took up a lance which was in the doorway the constable put his hand on his sword at the row they were making the guests and neighbours came and got between them in great fury the combatants struggled to free themselves and get at each other but as the place was full of people they saw that they would be prevented from fighting so they again resorted to abusive language among other things the constable said to my master that he was a liar and that the indulgences about which he preached were false at last the people as they could not pacify the disputants determined to take the constable away thus my master was left in a great rage later on the guests and neighbours entreated him to moderate his anger and go to bed which in the end we all did 27 a pardoner always had a sergeant or constable with him to help him in such houses as refused to pay for their pardons at the appointed time when morning came my master went to the church to arrange about the mass and about preaching the sermon to announce the indulgences the people assembled but they came murmuring at the indulgences saying that they were false and that the constable himself had found it out if before they disliked buying them they now detested the idea sidenote the seller of indulgences begins his sermon the commissary or seller of indulgences went up into the pulpit and began his sermon by urging the people not to fail in getting the benefit of such a blessing and such indulgences as the sacred bull brought them when he was in the middle of his sermon the constable entered by the door of the church and when he had said a prayer he got up and addressed the people in a loud voice good people he said hear one word from me and then listen to any one you like i came here with this cheat who is preaching to you and he deceived me he said that i should help him in this business and that we would divide the profits now see the harm he would have done to my conscience and to your pockets sidenote sham denunciation of the indulgences by the constable i plainly declare to you that the indulgences he is preaching about are false and that you should not believe in them nor buy them i will not be a party to it directly nor indirectly from this time i give up the wand of office and put it on the ground if hereafter this man is punished for his falsehoods you must be my witness that i am not a party to them and have neither aided nor abetted them on the contrary i have undeceived you and exposed his imposture then he concluded his speech some respectable men wanted to take the constable and turn him out of the church to avoid scandal but my master raised his hand and ordered that no one should molest him on pain of excommunication he declared that the constable must be allowed to say whatever he liked when the constable had finished my master asked him whether he wanted to say anything more the constable replied i could say a good deal more about your falsehoods but this will do for the present the commissary then knelt down in the pulpit clasped his hands turned his eyes up and said o lord from whom nothing is hidden and to whom all things are known to whom nothing is impossible but all things are possible thou knowest the truth and how unjustly i have been accused all that concerns myself i freely pardon as thou lord hast pardoned me look not at this man who knows not what he does or says i only pray for justice some who are present may perchance have intended to take these holy indulgences and on hearing the false words of that man they may have changed their minds so i pray to thee o lord that thou wilt work a miracle in this way sidenote sham miracle worked on the constable if what my accuser says is true that i am evil and false let this pulpit sink from me forty feet under ground and never appear again but if what i say is true and that man is persuaded by the devil to try to deprive those present of such great benefits let him be punished that all may know his malice scarcely had my devout master finished his speech when the bad constable fell to the ground with such a noise that the church resounded then he began to groan and foam at the mouth making hideous faces throwing about his arms and legs and rolling about on the ground the noise made by the people was so great that they could not hear each other speak some were astounded and terrified others cried to god for help a few not without trepidation took his arms and held his legs for there is not a mule in the world that could have given fiercer kicks so they held him for a long time there being more than fifteen men keeping him down and to all he gave blows and if they were not careful kicks also all this time my master was on his knees in the pulpit with hands and eyes raised to heaven transported by the divine essence the noise and disturbance in the church had no effect on his sacred contemplations sidenote the people intercede for the constable some good men came to him and speaking loudly to arouse him entreated him to succour that poor creature who was dying they besought him not to dwell upon things that were past and not to consider his evil deeds as he had been punished they prayed to him that if he could do any good he would deliver the man from his sufferings for the love of god they declared that they clearly saw the sin of the culprit and my masters truth and goodness but entreated him to pray to the lord not to prolong the mans punishment sidenote all the people pray for the constable to be forgiven the commissary like one awaking from a delicious dream looking long at the culprit and at those who were round him then said my good friends you have interceded for a man on whom god has so signally laid his hands but he has enjoined us not to return evil for evil and to pardon injuries we may confidently pray that his goodness will pardon this offender who has tried to put obstacles into the working of his holy faith let us all pray for this he then came down from the pulpit and desired that all should pray very devoutly to our lord to pardon that sinner and restore him to health and sound judgment delivering him from the devil if for his great sin the evil one had been permitted to enter into him all went down on their knees before the altar while the clergy began to chant a litany in a low voice coming with a cross and the holy water after singing over it my master raised his hands to heaven and turned his eyes up until scarcely anything could be seen but the whites sidenote the farce is carried on to completion he then commenced an address not less long than devout which made the people weep as they do over a sermon on the passion delivered by a famous preacher he prayed to the lord not to require the death of the sinner but rather to give his life back to one who had been led away by the devil that being convinced of his sin unto death he might receive pardon life and health and that he might repent and confess this done he would receive the indulgence presently the sinful constable began gradually to recover until he was himself again when he was well he fell at the feet of the commissary asking for pardon and confessing that what he had said was by order of the devil to do my master harm and to be avenged on him but principally because the devil was very much annoyed at the good that was done by the indulgences being received my master pardoned him and signs of friendship were passed between them then there was such eagerness to buy the indulgences that scarcely a soul in the place was without onehusbands and wives sons and daughters boys and girls the news of what had happened soon spread to the neighbouring villages and when we came to them it was not necessary to preach nor even to go to church in ten or twelve villages of that neighbourhood where we were my master sold as many thousand indulgences without having to preach a single sermon when he performed this farce i confess that i was astounded and believed like many others sidenote lazaro was behind the scenes but afterwards i was a witness to the jokes and laughter that my master and the constable had over the business i knew how it had been planned and arranged by the industry and inventive talent of my master though only a boy i fell into thought and said to myself how many more tricks will the rogues play on these innocent people i was nearly four months with my fifth master during which i also suffered plenty of hardships illustration the news soon spread to the neighbouring villages sixth master how lazaro took service with a chaplain and how he prospered after this i took service with a master who painted tumbrels my duty was to grind the colours and here also i suffered many evil things having now grown to be a fine lad i went into the principal church and one of the chaplains took me to be his servant he gave me charge of a donkey four jars and a whip so i began to carry water for the city this was the first step i ascended to reach a decent life for i gave thirty maravedis of profit to my master every day and on saturdays i was allowed the profits for myself and everything else beyond the thirty maravedis a day i went on so well that at the end of four years i had put something by and was able to dress myself very well i bought a doublet of fustian a coat with sleeves and a woollen cloak as well as a sword shortly i saw myself clothed like a respectable man i said to my master that he might take the donkey as i did not intend to follow that occupation any longer illustration seventh master how lazaro took service with a constable and what happened afterwards having taken leave of the chaplain i entered the service of a constable but stayed a very short time with him for my occupation appeared to me to be dangerous especially one night when we were attacked with stones and sticks they treated my master badly but they could not catch me this business made me retire from the constables service thinking how i should live so as to find some rest and save a little for my old age it pleased god to enlighten me and to put me on a profitable road with the favour of friends and patrons all my labours and hardships up to that time were repaid on reaching what i sought and obtained sidenote lazaro gets a government appointment and is married this was a government appointment such as enabled no one to thrive except those who occupied it in it i live and reside to this day in the service of god and your honour my duty is to have charge of the inspection of wine that is sold in this city as well at public sales as elsewhere also to accompany those who are condemned for default and to cry out their transgressions being a crier speaking in good castilian it has happened also that almost everything appertaining to the office passes through my hands throughout the whole city he who wants to draw wine for sale may reckon on deriving little profit unless lazaro de tormes is consulted in the matter at this time his honour the archpriest of st saviours28 my lord and the friend of your worship seeing my cleverness and noticing my presentable appearance when employed by him in announcing his wines made an arrangement that i should marry one of his servant girls seeing myself that this would bring me benefits and favours i gave my consent i was married to her and to this day i have had no reason to repent it for i found her to be a good girl and diligent in service i have favour and help from my lord the archpriest he always gives us during the year a load of wheat meat on festivals sometimes loaves of fine bread and the shoes he has left off wearing he arranged for us to rent a small house near his own on almost every sunday and on feast days we dine in his house 28 formerly there were two kinds of parishes in toledo those of the muzarabes founded by the gothic king athanagild the grandfather of st ildefonso continued through moorish times they were existing when alfonso vi took toledo in 1085 their number was six reduced to two the others were called latinas formed afterwards of which there were twenty reduced to nine st saviours was one of the latter it has been joined to that of san pedro since lazarillos time sidenote evil tongues but evil tongues are never wanting and never let people live in peace they said i know not what about my wife because she went to make the bed and cook the dinner and in this they spoke the truth but she was not a woman who would give occasion for their scoffing my lord the archpriest had promised what i think he will perform and one day he spoke to me fully on the subject lazaro de tormes he said he who listens to evil tongues will never prosper i say this because your wife may be seen entering my house and leaving it she comes with honour to herself and to you and this i promise you do not attend to what they say and be assured that what i tell you is for your good i replied that i was determined to care for and preserve my honesty it is true i said that some of my friends have spoken to me about this and have even certified to me that before i was married to my wife she had borne a child three times speaking with reverence to your worship my wife took such oaths on the subject that i thought the house would come down upon us and then she began to weep and to curse the day she had married me she went on in such a way that i wished i had died before i let such words out of my mouth illustration but evil tongues are never wanting i on one side and the archpriest on the other entreated her to leave off crying and i swore that never in all my life would i refer to the matter again i declared that i should rejoice to see her go in and out of our patrons house whenever she liked as i was convinced of her honesty sidenote a good understanding so we all three continued to have a good understanding as to this and have never heard more about it when any one tries to say anything i stop him by saying look here if you are a friend do not say anything that will annoy me for i do not look upon him as my friend who causes me sorrow more especially if he tries to make trouble between me and my wife for she is the thing in the world that i care for most i love her and may god show favour to her she is a far better wife than i deserve and i swear before the consecrated host that she is as good a woman as can be found within the gates of toledo he who says the contrary shall answer to me for it by this means i manage that they shall say nothing and i have peace in my house sidenote conclusion this was in the same year that our victorious emperor entered into this famous city of toledo and held the cortes here29 and there were great rejoicings as your worship will have heard at this time i was prosperous and at the summit of all good fortune 29 in 1525 at the time when francis i arrived as a prisoner at madrid charles held a general cortes of castille at toledo there were present most of the grandees and all the foreign ambassadors the viceroy carlos de lannoy arrived at toledo and was cordially received by the emperor after having brought francis to madrid the cortes petitioned charles to marry isabel the infanta of portugal while the english ambassadors proposed to him his cousin mary tudor the cortes sat until
