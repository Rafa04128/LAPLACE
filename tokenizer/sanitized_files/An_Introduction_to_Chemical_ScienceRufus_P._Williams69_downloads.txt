science appendix textbook advertisements that appeared in the original edition info about this etext edition preface by rp williams the object held constantly in view in writing this book has been to prepare a suitable textbook in chemistry for the average high schoolone that shall be simple practical experimental and inductive rather than a cyclopaedia of chemical information for the accomplishment of this purpose the author has endeavored to omit superfluous matter and give only the most useful and interesting experiments facts and theories in calling attention by questions and otherwise to the more important phenomena to be observed and facts to be learned the best features of the inductive system have been utilized especially is the writing of equations which constitute the multum in parvo of chemical knowledge insisted upon as soon as the pupil has become imbued with the spirit and meaning of chemical equations he need have little fear of failing to understand the rest to this end chapters ix xi and xvi should be studied with great care in the early stages of the work the equations may with advantage be memorized but this can soon be discontinued whenever symbols are employed pupils should be required to give the corresponding chemical names or better both names and symbols the classification of chemical substances into acids bases and salts and the distinctions and analogies between each of these classes have been brought into especial prominence the general relationship between the three classes and the general principles prevailing in the preparation of each must be fully understood before aught but the merest smattering of chemical science can be known chapters xvxxi should be mastered as a key to the subsequent parts of the book the mathematical and theoretical parts of chemistry it has been thought best to intersperse throughout the book placing each where it seemed to be especially needed in this way it is hoped that the tedium which pupils find in studying consecutively many chapters of theories will be avoided and that the arrangement will give an occasional change from the discussion of facts and experiments to that of principles in these chapters additional questions should be given and the pupil should be particularly encouraged to make new problems of his own and to solve theta it is needless to say that this treatise is primarily designed to be used in connection with a laboratory like all other text books on the subject it can be studied without such an accessory but the author attaches very little value to the study of chemistry without experimental work the required apparatus and chemicals involve but little expense and the directions for experimentation are the result of several years experience with classes as large as are to be found in the laboratory of any school or college in the country during the present year the author personally supervises the work of more than 180 different pupils in chemistry this enables him not only to assure himself that the experiments of the book are practical but that the directions for performing them are ample it is found advisable to perform most of the experiments with full explanation in presence of the class before requiring the pupils either to do the work or to recite the lesson in the laboratory each pupil has a locker under his table furnished with apparatus as specified in the appendix each has also the authors laboratory manual which contains on every lefthand page full directions for an experiment with observations to be made etc the righthand page is blank and on that the pupil makes a record of his work these notes are examined at the time or subsequently by the teacher and the pupil is not allowed to take the book from the laboratory nor can he use any other book on chemistry while experimenting by this means he learns to make his own observations and inferences for the benefit of the science and the added interest in the study it is earnestly recommended that teachers encourage pupils to fit up laboratories of their own at home this need not at first entail a large outlay a small attic room with running water a very few chemicals and a little apparatus are enough to begin with these can be added to from time to time as new material is wanted in this way the student will find his love for science growing apace while endeavoring by securing an able corps of critics and in all other ways possible to reduce errors to a minimum the author disclaims any pretensions to a work entirely free from mistakes holding himself alone responsible for any shortcomings and trusting to the leniency of teachers and critics the manuscript has been read by prof henry carmichael phd of boston and to his broad and accurate scholarship as well as to his deep personal interest in the work the author is indebted for much valuable and original matter the following persons have generously read the proof as a whole

gas volumes and weights quantitative experiments with oxygen and hydrogenproblems an introduction to chemical science chapter i the metric system 1 the metric system is the one here employed a sufficient knowledge of it for use in the study of this book may be gained by means of the following experiments which should be performed at the outset by each pupil 2 length experiment 1note the length of 10 cm centimeters on a metric ruler as shown in figure 1 estimate by the eye alone this distance on the cover of a book and then verify the result do the same on a tt testtube try this several times on different objects till you can carry in mind a tolerably accurate idea of 10 cm about how many inches is it in the same way estimate the length of 1 cm verifying each result how does this compare with the distance between two blue lines of foolscap measure the diameter of the old nickel five cent piece next try in the same way 5 cm carry each result in mind taking such notes as may be necessary fig 1 3 capacity experiment 2into a graduate shown in figure 2 holding 25 or 50 cc cubic centimeters put 10 cc of water then pour this into a tt note without marking what proportion of the latter is filled pour out the water and again put into the tt the same quantity as nearly as can be estimated by the eye verify the result by pouring the water back into the graduate repeat several times until your estimate is quite accurate with a tt of given size if you wish try it with other sizes now estimate 1 cc of a liquid in a similar way do the same with 5 cc a cubic basin 10 cm on a side holds a liter a liter contains 1000 cc if filled with water it weighs under standard conditions 1000 grams verify by measurement 4 weight experiment 3put a small piece of paper on each pan of a pair of scales on one place a 10 g gram weight balance this by placing fine salt on the other pan note the quantity as nearly as possible with the eye then remove now put on the paper what you think is 10 g of salt verify by weighing repeat as before several times weigh 1 g and estimate as before can 1 g of salt be piled on a onecent coin experiment with 5 g 5 resumelengths are measured in centimeters liquids in cubic centimeters solids in grams in cases where it is not convenient to measure a liquid or weigh a solid the estimates above will be near enough for most experiments herein given different solids of the same bulk of course differ in weight but for one gram what can be piled on a onecent piece may be called a sufficiently close estimate the distance between two lines of foolscap is very nearly a centimeter a cubic centimeter is seen in figure 1 temperatures are recorded in the centigrade scale chapter ii what chemistry is 6 divisibility of matter experiment 4examine a few crystals of sugar and crush them with the fingers grind them as fine as convenient and examine with a lens they are still capable of division put 3 g of sugar into a tt pour over it 5 cc of water shake well boil for a minute holding the tt obliquely in the flame using for the purpose a pair of wooden nippers fig 3 if the sugar does not disappear add more water when cool touch a drop of the liquid to the tongue evidently the sugar remains though in a state too finely divided to be seen this is called a solution the sugar is said to be soluble in water and water to be a solvent of sugar fig 3 now fold a filter paper as in figure 4 arrange it in a funnel fig 5 and pour the solution upon it catching what passes through which is called the filtrate in another tt that rests in a receiver fig 5 after filtering notice whether any residue is left on the filter paper taste a drop of the filtrate has sugar gone through the filter if so what do you infer of substances in solution passing through a filter save half the filtrate for experiment 5 and dilute the other half with two or three times its own volume of water shake well and taste fig 4 fig 5 we might have diluted the sugar solution many times more and still the sweet taste would have remained thus the small quantity of sugar would be distributed through the whole mass and be very finely divided by other experiments a much finer subdivision can be made a solution of00000002 g of the red coloring matter fuchsine in 1 cc of alcohol gives a distinct color such experiments would seem to indicate that there is no limit to the divisibility of matter but considerations which we cannot discuss here lead to the belief that such a limit does exist that there are particles of sugar and of all substances which are incapable of further division without entirely changing the nature of the substance to these smallest particles the name molecules is given a mass is any portion of a substance larger than a molecule it is an aggregation of molecules a molecule is the smallest particle of a substance that can exist alone a substance in solution may be in a more finely divided state than otherwise but it is not necessarily in its ultimate state of division 7 a chemical changecannot this smallest particle of sugar the molecule be separated into still smaller particles of something else may it not be a compound body and will not some force separate it into two or more substances the next experiment will answer the question experiment 5take the sugar solution saved from experiment 4 and add slowly 4 ccof strong sulphuric acid note any change of color also the heat of the tt add more acid if needed a substance entirely different in color and properties has been formed now either the sugar the acid or the water has undergone a chemical change it is in fact the sugar but the molecule is the smallest particle of sugar possible the acid must have either added something to the sugar molecules or subtracted something from them it was the latter here then is a force entirely different from the one which tends to reduce masses to molecules the molecule has the same properties as the mass only a physical force was used in dissolving the sugar and no heat was liberated the acid has changed the sugar into a black mass in fact into charcoal or carbon and water and heat has been produced a chemical change has been brought about from this we see that molecules are not the ultimate divisions of matter the smallest sugar particles are made up of still smaller particles of other things which do not resemble sugar as a word is composed of letters which alone do not resemble the word but can the charcoal itself be resolved into other substances and these into still others and so on carbon is one of the substances from which nothing else has been obtained there are about seventy others which have not been resolved these are called elements and out of them are built all the compounds mineral vegetable and animalwhich we know 8 an element is a chemically indivisible substance or one from which nothing else can be extracted a compound is a substance which is made up of elements united in exact proportions by a force called chemism or chemical affinity a mixture is composed of two or more elements or compounds blended together but not held by any chemical attraction to which of these three classes does sugar belong carbon the solution of sugar in water carbon is an element we call its smallest particle an atom an atom is the smallest particle of an element that can enter into combination atoms are indivisible and usually do not exist alone both elements and compounds have molecules the molecule of an element usually contains two atoms that of a compound may have two or it may have hundreds for a given compound the number is always definite chemism is the force that binds atoms together to form molecules the sugar molecule contains atoms fortyfive in all of three different elements carbon hydrogen and oxygen that of salt has two atoms one of sodium one of chlorine should we say an atom of sugar why of what is a mass of sugar made up a molecule a mass of carbon a molecule did the chemical affinity of the acid break up masses or molecules in this respect it is a type of all chemical action the distinction between physics and chemistry is here well shown the molecule is the unit of the physicist the atom that of the chemist however large the masses changed by chemical action that action is always on the individual molecule the atoms of which are separated if the molecule were an indivisible particle no science of chemistry would be possible the physicist finds the properties of masses of matter and resolves them into molecules the chemist breaks up the molecule and from its atoms builds up other compounds analysis is the separation of compounds into their elements synthesis is the building up of compounds from their elements of which is the sugar experiment an example metathesis is an exchange of atoms in two different compounds it gives rise to still other compounds a chemical change may add something to a substance or subtract something from it or it may both subtract and add making a new substance with entirely different properties sulphur and carbon are two stable solids the chemical union of the two forms a volatile liquid a substance may be at one time a solid at another a liquid at another a gas and yet not undergo any chemical change because in each case the chemical composition is identical state which of these are chemical changes rusting of iron falling of rain radiation of heat souring of milk evaporation of water decay of vegetation burning of wood breaking of iron bleaching of cloth give any other illustrations that occur to you chemistry treats of matter in its simplest forms and of the various combinations of those simplest forms chapter iii molecules and atoms 9 molecules are extremely smallit has been estimated that a liter of any gas at 0 degrees and 760 mm pressure contains 1024 molecules ie one with twentyfour ciphers thomson estimates that if a drop of water were magnified to the size of the earth and its molecules increased in the same proportion they would be larger than fine shot but not so large as cricket balls a german has recently obtained a deposit of silver twomillionths of a millimeter thick and visible to the naked eye the computed diameter of the molecule is only one and a half millionths of a millimeter by a law of chemistry there is the same number of molecules in a given volume of every gas if the temperature and pressure are the same hence all gaseous molecules are of the same size including of course the surrounding space they are in rapid motion and the lighter the gas the more rapid the motion this gives rise to diffusion see page 114 10 we know nothing definite of the form of moleculesin this book they will always be represented as of the same size that of two squares a molecule is itself composed of atomsfrom two to several hundred the size of the atom of most elements we represent by one square11 atomsif the gaseous molecules be of the same size it is clear that either the atoms themselves must be condensed or the spaces between them must be smaller than before we suppose the latter to be the case and that they do not touch one another the same thing being true of molecules atoms composing sugar must be crowded nearer together than those of salt these atoms are probably in constant motion in the molecule as the latter is in the mass if we regard this square as a mass of matter the dots may represent molecules if we call it a molecule the dots may be called atoms though many molecules have no more than two or three atoms the following experiments illustrate the union of atoms to form molecules and of elements to form compounds 12 union of atoms experiment 6mix on a paper 5 g of iron turnings and the same bulk of powdered sulphur and transfer them to an ignition tube a tube of hard glass for withstanding high temperatures hold the tube in the flame of a burner till the contents have become redhot after a minute break it by holding it under a jet of water put the contents into an evaporatingdish and look for any uncombined iron or sulphur both iron and sulphur are elements is this an example of synthesis or of analysis why is the chemical union between masses of iron and sulphur or between molecules or between atoms is the product a compound an element or a mixture experiment 7try the same experiment using copper instead of iron the full explanation of these experiments is given on page 13 chapter iv elements and binaries 13 about seventy different elements are now recognized half of which have been discovered within little more than a century these differ from one another in 1 atomic weight 2 physical and chemical properties 3 mode of occurrence etc page 12 contains the most important elements the symbol of an element is usually the initial letter or letters of its latin name and stands for one atom of the element c is the symbol for carbon and represents one atom of it o means one atom of oxygenthe symbols of elements will also be used in this book to stand for an indefinite quantity of them eg o will be used for oxygen in general as well as for one atom the text will readily decide when symbols have a definite meaning and when they are used in place of words write explain and memorize the symbols of the elements in heavy type 14 the atomic weight of an element is the weight of its atom compared with that of hydrogen h is taken as the standard because it has the least atomic weight the atomic weight of o is 16 which means that its atom weighs 16 times as much as the h atom every symbol then stands for a definite weight of the element ie its atomic weight as well as for its atom how much bromine by weight does br stand for what do these symbols meanas na n p if o represents one atom how much does o2 or 2 o stand for how much by weight most elements have two atoms in the molecule how many molecules in 6 h 10 n s8 i20 the symbol of a compound is formed by

compounds are binariesa binary is a substance composed of two elements eg common salt which is a compound of sodium and chlorine its symbol is nacl its chemical name sodium chloride the ending ide is applied to the last name of binaries how many parts by weight of na and of cl in nacl what is the molecular weight ie the weight of its molecule name kcl how many atoms in its molecule parts by weight

composition of a binary a prefix is often used to denote the number so2 is called sulphur dioxide to distinguish it from so3 sulphur trioxide name these co2 sio2 mno2 the prefixes are mono or proto one di or bi two tri or ter three tetra four pente five hex six etc diarsenic pentoxide is written as2o5 symbolize these carbon protoxide diphosphorus pentoxide diphosphorus trioxide iron disulphide iron protosulphide often only the prefix of the last name is used 16 an oxide is a compound of oxygen and some other element as hgo what is a chloride define sulphide phosphide arsenide carbide bromide iodide fluoride in experiment 6 where s and fe united the symbol of the product was fes name it how many parts by weight of each element what is its molecular weight to produce fes a chemical union took place between each atom of the fe and of the s we may express this reaction ie chemical action by an equation iron sulphur iron sulphide or using symbols fe s fes using atomic weights 56 32 88 these equations are explained by saying that 56 parts by weight of iron unite chemically with 32 parts by weight of sulphur to produce 88 parts by weight of iron sulphide this then indicates the proportion of each element which combines and which should be taken for the experiment if 56 g of fe be used 32 g of s should be taken if we use more than 56 parts of fe with 32 of s will it all combine if more than 32 of s with 56 of fe there is found to be a definite quantity of each element in every chemical compound symbols would have no meaning if this were not so write and explain the equation for the experiment with copper and sulphur using names symbols and weights as above chapter v manipulation 17 to break glass tubing experiment 8lay the tubing on a flat surface and draw a sharp threecornered file two or three times at right angles across it where it is to be broken till a scratch is made take the tube in the hands having the two thumbs nearly opposite the scratch and the fingers on the other side press outward quickly with the thumbs and at the same time pull the hands strongly apart and the tubing should break squarely at the scratch to break large tubing or cut off bottles lamp chimneys etc first make a scratch as before then heat the handle of a file or a blunt ironin a blastlamp flame by preferencetill it is redhot and at once press it against the scratch till the glass begins to crack the fracture can be led in any direction by keeping the iron just in front of it reheat the iron as often as necessary 18 to make ignitiontubes experiment 9hold the glass tubing between the thumb and forefinger of each hand resting it against the second finger heat it in the upper flame slowly at first then strongly but heat only a very small portion in length and keep it in constant rotation with the right hand hold it steadily and avoid twisting it as the glass softens the yielding is detected by the yellow flame above the glass and by an uneven pressure on the hands pull it a little as it yields then heat a part just at one side of the most softened portion rotate constantly without twisting and soon it can be separated into two closed tubes no thread should be attached but if there be one it can be broken off and the end welded the bottom can be made more symmetrical by heating it redhot then blowing gradually into the open end this being inserted in the mouth the parts should be annealed by holding above the flame for a short time to cool slowly for hard glassbohemianor large tubes the blastlamp or blowpipe is needed in the blastlamp air is forced out with illuminating gas this gives a high degree of heat bulbs can be made in the same way as ignitiontubes and thistletubes are made by blowing out the end of a heated bulb and rounding it with charcoal 19 to bend glass tubing experiment 10hold the tube in the upper flame rotate it so as to heat all parts equally and let the flame spread over 3 or 4 cm in length when the glass begins to yield without removing from the flame slowly bend it as desired avoid twisting and be sure to have all parts in the same plane also avoid bending too quickly if you would have a wellrounded joint anneal each bend as made heated glass of any kind should never be brought in contact with a cool body for making o h etc a glass tube deliverytube50 cm long should have three bends as in figure 6 the pupil should first experiment with short pieces of glass 10 or 15 cm long an ordinary gas flame is the best for bending glass 20 to cut glass experiment 11lay the glass plate on a flat surface and draw a steel glasscutterrevolving wheelover it holding this against a ruler for a guide and pressing down hard enough to scratch the glass then break it by holding between the thumb and fingers having the thumbs on the side opposite to the scratch and pressing them outward while bending the ends of the glass inward the break will follow the scratch holes can be bored through glass and bottles with a broken end of a round file kept wet with a solution of camphor in oil of turpentine 21 to perforate corks experiment 12first make a small hole in the cork with the pointed handle of a roundrattailfile have the hole perpendicular to the surface of the cork this can be done by holding the cork in the left hand and pressing against the larger surface or upper part of the cork with the file in the right hand only a mere opening is made in this way which must be enlarged by the other end of the file a second or third file of larger size may be employed according to the size of the hole to be made which must be a little smaller than the tube it is to receive and perfectly round chapter vi oxygen 22 to obtain oxygen experiment 13take 5 g of crystals of potassium chlorate kclo3 and without pulverizing mix with the same weight of pure powdered manganese dioxide mno2 put the mixture into a tt and insert a dtdeliverytubehaving the cork fit tightly hang it on a rsringstand as in figure 7 having the other end of the dt fig 7 under the shelf in a pneumatic trough filled with water just above the shelf fill three or more receiverswidemouthed bottleswith water cover the mouth of each with a glass plate invert it with its mouth under water and put it on the shelf of the trough removing the plate no air should be in the bottles have the end of the dt so that the gas will rise through the orifice hold a lighted lamp in the hand and bring the flame against the mixture in the tt keep the lamp slightly in motion with the hand so as not to break the tt by overheating in one place heat the mixture strongly if necessary the upper part of the tt is filled with air allow this to escape for a few seconds then move a receiver over the orifice and fill it with gas as soon as the lamp is taken away remove the dt from the water the gas contracts on cooling and if not removed water will be drawn over and the tt will be broken let the tt hang on the rs till cool with glass plates take out the receivers leaving them covered mouth upward fig 8 with little or no water inside when cool the tt may be cleaned with water by covering its mouth with the thumb or hand and shaking it vigorously what elements and how many in kclo3 in mn02 it is evident that each of these compounds contains o why then could we not have taken either separately instead of mixing the two this could have been done at a sufficiently high temperature mu02 requires a much higher temperature for dissociation ie separation into its elements than kclo3 while a mixture of the two causes o to come off from kclo3 at a lower temperature than if alone it is not known that mn02 suffers any change each molecule of potassium chlorate undergoes the following change potassium chlorate potassium chloride oxygen kclo3 kcl 3 o is this analysis or synthesis complete the equation by using weights and explain it notice whether the right hand member of the equation has the same number of atoms as the left has anything been lost or gained what element has heat separated does the experiment show whether o is very soluble in water how many grams of o are obtainable from 12258 g kcio3 properties 23 combustion of carbon oxygen experiment 14examine the gas in one of the receivers put a lighted splinter into the receiver sliding along the glass cover remove it blow it out and put in again while glowing is it rekindled repeat till it will no longer burn is the gas a supporter of combustion how did the combustion compare with that in air is it probable that air is pure o why did the flame at last go out has the o been destroyed or chemically united with something else wood is in part c co2 is formed by the combustion name it the equation is c 2o co2 affix the names and weights is co2 a supporter of combustion note that when c is burned with plenty of o co2 is always formed and that no matter how great the conflagration the union is atom by atom combustion as here shown is only a rapid union of o with some other substance as c or h 24 combustion of sulphur experiment 15hollow out one end of a piece of electriclight pencil or of crayon 3 cm long and attach it to a cu wire fig 9 put into this a piece of s as large as a pea ignite it by holding in the flame and then hold it in a receiver of o note the color and brightness of the flame and compare with the same in the air also note the color and odor of the product the new gas is so2 name it and write the equation for its production from s and o how do you almost daily perform a similar experiment is the product a supporter of combustion 25 combustion of phosphorus experiment 16with forceps which should always be used in handling this element put a bit of p half as large as the s aboveinto the crayon called a deflagratingspoon heat another wire touch it to the p and at once lower the latter into a receiver of o notice the combustion the color of the flame and of the product after removing be sure to burn every bit of p by holding it in a flame as it is liable to take fire if left the product of the combustion is a union of what two elements is it an oxide its symbol is p2o5 write the equation using symbols names and weights towards the close of the experiment when the o is nearly all combined p2o3 is formed as it is also when p oxidizes at a low temperature name it and write the equation 26 combustion of iron experiment 17take in the forceps a piece of iron picturecord wire 6 or 8cm long hold one end in the flame for an instant then dip it into some s enough s will adhere to be set on fire by holding it in the flame again then at once dip it into a receiver of o with a little water in the bottom the iron will burn with scintillations is this analysis or synthesis what elements combine a watchspring heated to take out the temper may be used but picturewire is better the product is fe3o4 write the equation how much fe by weight in the formula how much o what per cent by weight of fe in the compound multiply the fractional part by 100 what per cent of 0 whatper cent of c0 is c o2 find the percentage composition of so2 p2o5 from the last five experiments what do you infer of the tendency of o to unite with other elements 27 oxygen is a gas without color odor or taste it is chemically a very active element that is it unites with almost everything fluorine is the only element with which it will not combine when oxygen combines with a single element what is the compound called we have found that o makes up a certain portion of the air later we shall see how large the proportion is its tendency to combine with almost everything is a reason for the decay rust and oxidation of so many substances and for conflagrations great and small new compounds are thusformed of which o constitutes one factor water h2o is only a chemical union of o and h iron rust fe2o3 and h2o is composed of o fe and water the burning of wood or of coal gives rise to carbon dioxide co2 and water decay of animal and vegetable matter is hastened by this allpervading element o forms a portion of all animal and vegetable matter of almost all rocks and minerals and of water it is the most abundant of all elements and makes up from onehalf to two thirds of the earths surface compute the proportion of it by weight in water h2o it is the union of o in the air with c and h in our blood that keeps up the heat of the body and supports life see page 81 there are many ways of preparing this element besides the one given above it may be obtained from water experiment 38 and from many other compounds eg by heating mercury oxide hgo chapter vii nitrogen 28 separation experiment 18fasten a piece of electriclight pencil or of crayon to a wire as in experiment 15 and bend the wire so it will reach halfway to the bottom of a receiver using forceps put into the crayon a small piece of phosphorus pass the wire up through the orifice in the shelf of a pt pneumatic trough having water at least l cm above the shelf heat another wire touch it to the p and quickly invert an empty receiver over the p having the mouth under water so as to admit no air fig 10 let the p burn as long as it will then remove the wire and the crayon letting in no air note the color of the product and leave till it is tolerably clear then remove the receiver with a glass plate leaving the water in the bottom do the fumes resemble those of experiment 16 does it seem likely fig 10 that part of the air is o why a part only find what proportion of the receiver is filled with water by measuring the water with a graduate then fill it with water and measure that compute the percentage which the former is of the latter what proportion of the air then is o what was the only means of escape for the p2o6 and p2o2 formed these products are solids are they soluble in water compute the percentage composition always by weight of p2o2 and p2o5 the gas left in the receiver is evidently not o experiment 19 will prove this conclusively and show the properties of the new gas 29 properties experiment 19when the white cloud has disappeared slide the plate along and insert a burning stick try one that still glows see whether the p and s on the end of a match will burn is the gas a supporter of combustion since it does not unite with c s or p is it an active or a passive element compare it with o air is about 14 12 times as heavy as h which is heavier air or n see page 12 air or o write out the chief properties physical and chemical of n as found in this experiment 30 inactivity of nn will scarcely unite chemically except on being set free from compounds it has however an intense affinity for boron and will even go through a carbon crucible to unite with it it is not combined with o in the air but the two form a mixture page 86 of which n makes up fourfifths its use being to dilute the o what would be the effect in case of a fire if air were pure o what effect on the human system growing plants need a great deal of n but they are incapable of making use of that in the air on account of the chemical inactivity of the element their supply comes from compounds in earth water and air by reason of its inertness n is very easily set free from its compounds for this reason it is a constituent of most explosives as gunpowder nitroglycerine dynamite etc these solids by heat or concussion are suddenly changed to gases which thereby occupy much more space causing an explosion nitrogen exists in many compounds such as the nitrates but the great source of it all is the atmosphere see page 85 chapter viii hydrogen 31 preparation experiment 20prepare apparatus as for making o be sure that the cork perfectly fits both dt and tt or the h will escape cover 5 g granulated zn in the tt with 10 cc h2o and add 5 cc chlorhydric acid hcl adjust as for o fig 7 except that no heat is to be applied if the action is not brisk enough add more hcl collect several receivers of the gas over water adding small quantities of hcl when necessary observe the black floating residuum it is carbon lead etc with a glass plate remove the receivers keeping them inverted fig 11 or the h will escape 32 the chemical change is as follows zinc hydrogen chloride zinc chloride hydrogen zn 2 hcl zncl2 2h complete by adding the weights and explain notice that the water does not take part in the change it is added to dissolve the zncl2 formed and thus keep it from coating the zn and preventing further action of the acid note also that zn has simply changed places with h one atom of the former having driven off two atoms of the latter the h having nothing to unite with is set free as a gas and collected over water of course zn must have a stronger chemical affinity for cl than h has or the change could not have taken place why one zn atom replaces two h atoms will be explained later asfar as an explanation is possible this equation should be studied carefully as a type of all equations the lefthand member shows what were taken ie the factors the righthand shows what were obtained ie the products h2so4 might have been used instead of hcl in that case the reaction or equation would have been zinc hydrogen sulphate zinc sulphate hydrogen zn h2so4 znso4 2h iron might have been used instead of zinc in which case the reactions would have been iron hydrogen chloride iron chloride hydrogen fe 2 hcl fecl2 2 h iron hydrogen sulphate iron sulphate hydrogen fe h2so4 feso4 2 h write the weights and explain the equations the latter should be memorized 33 properties experiment 21lift with the left hand a receiver of h still inverted and insert a burning splinter with the right fig 12 does the splinter continue to burn does the gas burn if so where is the light brilliant note the color of the flame is there any explosion try this experiment with several receivers is the gas a supporter of combustion ie will carbon burn in it is it combustible ie does it burn if so it unites with some part of the air with what part34 collecting h by upward displacement experiment 22pass a dt from a h generator to the top of a receiver or tt fig 13 the escaping h being so much lighter than air will force the latter down to obtain the gas unmixed with air the dt should tightly fit a cardboard placed under the mouth of the receiver when filled the receiver can be removed inverted as usual and the gas tested in this and other experiments for generating h a thistletube the end of which dips under the liquid can be used for pouring in acid as in figure 13 35 philosophers lamp and musical flame experiment 23fit to a cork a piece of glass tubing 10 or 15 cm long having the outer end drawn out to a point with a small opening and insert it in the h generator before igniting the gas at the end of the tube take the precaution to collect a tt of it by upward displacement and bring this in contact with a flame if a sharp explosion ensues air is not wholly expelled from the generator and it would be dangerous to light the gas when no sound or very little follows light the escaping gas the generation of h must not be too rapid neither should the tt be held under the face as the cork is liable to be forced out by the pressure of h a safetytube similar to the thistle tube above will prevent this this apparatus is called the philosophers lamp thrust the flame into a long glass tube 1 12 to 3 cm in diameter as shown in figure 14 and listen for a musical note 36 product of burning h in air experiment 24fill a tube 2 or 3 cm in diameter with calcium chloride cacl2 and connect one end with a generator of h fig 15 at the other end have a philosophers lamptubeobserving the usual precautions light the gas and hold over it a receiver till quite a quantity of moisture collects all water was taken from the gas by the dryer cacl2 what is therefore the product of burning h in air complete this equation and explain it 2h o figure 16 shows a drying apparatus arranged to hold cacl2 fig 15fig 16 37 explosiveness of h experiment 25 fill a sodawater bottle of thick glass with water invert it in a pneumatic trough and collect not over 14 full of h now remove the bottle still inverted letting air in to fill the other 34 mix the air and h by covering the mouth of the bottle with the hand and shaking well then hold the mouth of the bottle slightly inclined in a flame explain the explosion which follows if 34 was air what part was o what use did the n serve note any danger in exploding h mixed with pure o what proportions of o and h by volume would be most dangerously explosive what proportion by weight by the rapid union of the two elements the high temperature suddenly expanded the gaseous product which immediately contracted both expansion and contraction produced the noise of explosion 38 pure h is a gas without color odor or taste it is the lightest of the elements 14 12 times as light asair it occurs uncombined in coalmines and some other places but the readiness with which it unites with other elements particularly o prevents its accumulation in large quantities it constitutes twothirds of the volume of the gases resulting from the decomposition of water and oneninth of the weight compute the latter from its symbol it is a constituent of plants and animals and some rocks considering the volume of the ocean the total amount of h is large it can be separated from h2o by electrolysis or by c as in the manufacture of water gas when burned with o it forms h2o pure o and h when burning give great heat but little light the oxyhydrogen blowpipe fig 17 is a device for producing the highest temperatures of combustion it has o in the inner tube and h in the outer why would it not be better the other way these unite at the end and are burned giving great heat a piece of lime put into the flame gives the brilliant drummond or calcium light chapter ix union by weight 39 in the equation zn 2 hcl zncl2 2 h 65 73 136 2 65 parts by weight of zn are required to liberate 2 parts by weight of h or by using 65 g zn with 73 g hcl we obtain 2 g h if twice as much zn 130 g were used 4 g h could be obtained with of course twice as much hcl with 260 g zn how much h could be liberated a proportion may be made as follows zn given zn required h given h required 65 260 2 x footnote given as here used means the weight called for by the equation required means that called for by the question solving we have 8 g h how much h is obtainable by using 5 g zn as in the experiment to avoid error in solving similar problems the best plan is as follows zn 2hcl zncl2 2 h 6552x 65 2 65 x 10 5 x x 1065 213 ans 213 g the equation should first be written next the atomic or molecular weights which you wish to use and only those to avoid confusion then on the third line the quantity of the substance to be used with underneath the substance wanted the example above will best how this this plan will prevent the possibility of error the proportion will then be a given a required b given b required how much zn is required to produce 30 g h zn 2hcl zncl2 2h 23065x 65 2 2x 1950 x 30 x 975 ans 975 g zn solve 1 how much zn is necessary for 14 g h 2 how many pounds of zn are necessary for 3 pounds of h 3 how many grams of h from 17 g of zn 4 how many tons of h from 12 ton of zn suppose we wish to find how much chlorhydric acidpure gas will give 12 g h the question involves only hcl and h arrange as follows zn 2hcl zncl2 2 h h giv h req hcl giv hcl req 73 2 2 12 73 x x 12 2x876 x438 ans 438 g hcl solve 1 how much hcl is needed to produce 100 g h 2 how much h in 10 g hcl 3 how much zncl2 is formed by using 50 g hcl the question is now between hcl and zncl2 zn 2hc1 zncl2 2h 73 136 arrange the proportion and solve 50 x suppose we have generated h by using h2s04 the equation is zn h2s04 znso4 2 h there is the same relation as before between the quantities of zn and of h but the h2s04 and zns04 are different how much h2so4 is needed to generate 12 g h zn h2so4 zns04 2 h 98 2 make the proportion and solve x 12 solve 1 how much h in 200 g h2s04 2 how much zns04 is produced from 200 g h2s04 3 how much h2s04 is needed for 7 12 g h 4 how much zn will 40 g h2so4 combine with 5 how much fe will 40 g h2so4 combine with 6 how much h can be obtained by using 75 g fe these principles apply to all reactions suppose for example we wish to get l0 g of o how much kclo3 will it be necessary to use the reaction is kclo3 kcl o3 48 10 1225 x 1225 48 x 10 ans 255 g kclo3 the pupil should be required to make up problems of his own using various reactions and to solve them chapter x carbon examine graphite anthracite coal bituminous coal cannel coal wood gas carbon coke 40 preparation of c experiment 26hold a porcelain dish or a plate in the flame of a candle or of a bunsen burner with the openings at the bottom closed after a minute examine the deposit it is carbon ie lamp black or soot which is a constituent of gas or of the candle open the valve at the base of the bunsen burner and hold the deposit in the flame does the c gradually disappear if so it has been burned to co2 c 2 o co2 is c a combustible element experiment 27ignite a splinter and observe the combustion and the smoke if any try to collect some c in the same way as before with plenty of o and high enough temperature all the c is burned to co2 whether in gas candle or wood co2 is an invisible gas the porcelain when held in the flame cools the c below the point at which it burns called the kindlingpoint and hence it is deposited the greater part of smoke is unburned carbon experiment 28hold an inverted dry tt or receiver over the flame of a burning candle and look for any moisture h2o what two elements are shown by these experiments to exist in the candle the same two are found in wood and in gas experiment 29put into a small hessian crucible fig 18 some pieces of wood 2 or 3 cm long cover with sand and heat the crucible strongly when smoking stops cool the crucible remove the contents and examine the charcoal the gases have been driven off from the wood and the greater part of what is left is c experiment 30put 1 g of sugar into a porcelain crucible and heat till the sugar is black c is left see experiment 5 remove the c with a strong solution of sodium hydrate page 208 41 allotropic formscarbon is peculiar in that it occurs in at least three allotropic ie different forms all having different properties these are diamond graphite and amorphous not crystallinecarbon the latter includes charcoal lamp black boneblack gas carbon coke and mineral coal all these forms of c have one property in common they burn in o at a high temperature forming co2 this proves that each is the element c though it is often mixed with some impurities allotropy or allotropism is the quality which an element often has of appearing under various forms with different properties the forms of c are a good illustration 42 diamond is the purest c but even this in burning leaves a little ash showing that it is not quite pure it is a rare mineral found in india south africa and brazil and is the hardest and most highly refractive to light of all minerals boron is harder footnote b not occurring free is not a mineral when heated in the electric arc at very high temperatures diamond swells and turns black 43 graphite or plumbago is one of the softest mineralsit is black and infusible and oxidizes only at very high temperatures higher than the diamond it contains from 95 to 98 per cent c graphite is found in the oldest rock formations in the united states and siberia it is artificially formed in the iron furnace graphite is employed for crucibles where great heat is required for a lubricant for making metal castings and mixed with clay for leadpencils it is often called blacklead 44 amorphous carbon comprises the following varieties charcoal is made by heating wood for a long time out of contact with the air the volatile gases are thus driven off from the wood what is left is c and a small quantity of mineral matter which remains as ash when the coal is burned 45 lampblack is prepared as in experiment 26 or by igniting turpentine c1oh16 naphtha and various oils and collecting the c of the smoke it is used for making printers ink india ink etc a very pure variety is obtained from natural gas boneblack or animal charcoal is obtained by distilling bones ie by heating them in retorts into which no air is admitted the c is the charred residue gas carbon is formed in the retorts of the gashouse see page 182 it is used to some extent in electrical work 46 coke is the residue left after distilling soft coal it is tolerably pure carbon with some ash and a little volatile matter it burns without flame 47 mineral coal is fossilized wood or other vegetable matter millions of years ago trees and other vegetation covered the earth as they do today in certain places they slowly sank together with the land into the interior of the earth were covered with sand rock and water and heated from the earths interior a slow distillation took place which drove off some of the gases and converted vegetable matter into coal all the coal dug from the earth represents vegetable life of a former period millions of years were required for the transformation but the same change is in progress now where peat beds are forming from turf coal is found in all countries the largest beds being in the united states from the nature of its formation coal varies much in purity anthracite or hard coal is purest in carbon some varieties having from 90 to 95 per cent this represents most complete distillation in the earth ie the gases have mostly been driven off it is much used in new england 48 bituminous or soft coal crocks the hands and burns rapidly with much flame and smoke the greater part of the coal in the earth is bituminous it represents incomplete distillation hence by artificially distilling it illuminating gas is made see page 180 it is far less pure c than anthracite 49 cannel coal is a variety of bituminous coal which can be ignited like a candle this is because so many of the gases are still left and it shows cannel to be less pure c than bituminous coal 50 lignite peat turf etc are still less pure varieties of c construct a table of the naturally occurring forms of this element in the order of their purity carbon forms the basis of all vegetable and animal life it is found in many rocks mineral oils asphaltum natural gas and in the air as co2 51 c a reducing agent experiment 31put into a small ignitiontube a mixture of 4 or 5 g of powdered copper oxide cuo with half its bulk of powdered charcoal heat strongly for ten or fifteen minutes examine the contents for metallic copper with which element of cuo has c united the reaction may be written cu0 c co cu complete and explain a reducing or deoxidizing agent is a substance which takes away oxygen from a compound c is the most common and important reducing agent being used for this purpose in smelting iron and other ores making watergas etc an oxidizing agent is a substance that gives up its o to a reducing agent what oxidizing agent in the above experiment 52 c a decolorizer experiment 32put 3 or 4 g of boneblack into a receiver and add 10 or 15 ccof cochineal solution shake this thoroughly covering the bottle with the hand then pour the whole on a filter paper and examine the filtrate if all the color is not removed filter again what property of c is shown by this experiment any other coloring solution may be tried the decolorizing power of charcoal is an important characteristic animal charcoal is used in large quantities for decolorizing sugar the coloring matter is taken out mechanically by the c there being no chemical action 53 c a disinfectant experiment 33repeat the previous experiment adding a solution of h2s3 ie hydrogen sulphide in water instead of cochineal solution see page 120 note whether the bad odor is removed if not repeat charcoal has the property of absorbing large quantities of many gases illsmelling and noxious gases are condensed in the pores of the c o is taken in at the same time from the air and these gases are there oxidized and rendered odorless and harmless for this reason charcoal is much used in hospitals and sickrooms as a disinfectant this property of condensing o as well as other gases is shown in the experiment below 54 c an absorber of gases and a retainer of heat experiment 34put a piece of phosphorus of the size of a pea and well dried on a thick paper cover it well with boneblack and look for combustion after a while o has been condensed from the air absorbed by the c and thus communicated to the p burn all the p at last valence 55 the symbols nacl and mgcl2 differ in two wayswhat are they let us see why the atom of mg unites with two cl atoms while that of na takes but one if the atoms of two elements attract each other there must be either a general attraction all over their surfaces or else some one or more points of attraction suppose the latter to be true each atom must have one or more poles or bonds of attraction like the poles of a magnet different elements differ in their number of bonds na has one which may be written graphically na cl has one cl when na unites with cl the bonds of each element balance as follows nacl the element mg however has two such bonds as mg or mg when mg unites with cl in order to balance or saturate the bonds it is evident that two atoms of cl must be used as clmgcl or mgcl2 a compound or an element in order to exist must have no free bonds in organic chemistry the exceptions to this rule are very numerous and in fact we do not know that atoms have bonds at all but we can best explain the phenomena by supposing them and for a general statement we may say that there must be no free bonds in binaries the bonds of each element must balance 56 the valence quantivalence of an element is its combining power measured by bondsh having the least number of bonds one is taken as the unit valence has always to be taken into account in writing the symbol of a compound it is often written above and after the elements ie written like an exponent as ki mgii an element having a valence of one is a monad of two a dyad three a triad four tetrad five pentad six hexad etc it is also said to be monovalent di or bivalent etc this theory of bonds shows why an atom cannot exist alone it would have free or unused bonds and hence must combine with its fellow to form a molecule in case of an element as well as in that of a compound this is illustrated by these graphic symbols in which there are no free bonds hh oo n3bond symboln c4bond symbolc a graphic symbol shows apparent molecular structure after all how do we know that there are twice as many cl atoms in the chloride of magnesium as in that of sodium the compounds have been analyzed over and over again and have been found to correspond to the symbols mgcl2 and nacl this will be better understood after studying the chapter on atomic weights in writing the symbol for the union of h with o if we take an atom of each the bonds do not balance ho the former having one the latter two evidently two atoms of h are needed as hoh or h o or h2o in the union of zn and o each has two bonds h hence they unite atom with atom zn o or zno write the grapbic and the common symbols for the union of hi and cli of ki and bri agi and oii nai and sii hi and piii study valences it will be seen that some elements have a variable quantivalence sn has either 2 or 4 p has 3 or 5 it usually varies by two for a given element as though a pair of bonds sometimes saturated each other eg sn a quantivalence of 4 and sn a quantivalence of 2 there are therefore two oxides of tin sno and sno2 or sno and osno write symbols for the two chlorides of tin two oxides of p two oxides of arsenic the chlorides of iron are fecl2 and fe2cl6 in the latter it might be supposed that the quantivalence of fe is 3 but the graphic symbol shows it to be 4 it is called a pseudotriad or false triad cr and al are also pseudotriads cl cl clfefecl cl cl write formulae for two oxides of iron the oxide of al 57 a radical is a group of elements which has no separate existence but enters into combination like a single atom eg no3 in the compounds hno3 or kno3 so4 in h2so4 in hno3 the radical has a valence of 1 to balance that of h hno3 in h2so4 what is the valence of so4 give it in each of these radicals noting first that of the first element kno3 na2so4 na2co3 kclo3 h3po4 ca3po42 na4sio4 suppose we wish to know the symbol for calcium phosphate ca and po4 are the two parts in h3po4 the radical is a triad to balance h3 ca is a dyad cap04 the least common multiple of the bonds 2 and 3 is 6 which divided by 2 no ca bonds gives 3 no ca atoms to be taken 6 3 no po4 bonds gives 2 no po4 radicals to be taken hence the symbol ca3p042 verify this by writing graphically write symbols for the union of mg and so4 na and po4 zn and no3 k and no3 k and so4 mg and po4 fe and so4 both valences of fe fe and no3 taking the valences of the radicals from hno3 h2so4 h3po4 chapter xii electrochemical relation of elements 58 examine untarnished pieces of iron silver nickel lead etc also quartz resin silk wood paper notice that from the first four light is reflected in a different way from that of the others this property of reflecting light is known as luster metals have a metallic luster which is peculiar to themselves and this for the present may be regarded as their chief characteristic are they at the positive or negative end of the list see page 43 how is it with the nonmetals this arrangement has a significance in chemistry which we must now examine the three appended experiments show how one metal can be withdrawn from solution by a second this second by a third the third by a fourth and so on for expedition three pupils can work together for the three following experiments each doing one and examining the results of the others 59 deposition of silver experiment 35put a tencent ag coin into an evaporatingdish and pour over it a mixture of 5 cc hno3 and 10 cc h2o warm till all or nearly all the ag dissolves remove the lamp 3 ag 4 hno3 3 agno3 2 h2o no then add 10 cc h2o and at once put in a short piece of cu wire or a cent leave till quite a deposit appears then pour off the liquid wash the deposit thoroughly and remove it from the coin see whether the metal resembles ag 2 agno3 cu 60 deposition of copper experiment 36dissolve a cent or some cu turnings in dilute hno3 as in experiment 35 and dilute the solution 3 cu 8 hn09 3 cu noa4 h2o2 no then put in a clean strip of pb and set aside as before examining the deposit finally cuno3 pb 61 deposition of lead experiment 37perform this experiment in the same manner as the two previous ones dissolving a small piece of pb and using a strip of zn to precipitate the pb 3 pb 8 hno3 3 pb no42 4 ha0 2 no pb no3 2 zn h 62 explanation these experiments show that cu will replace ag in a solution of agno3 that pb will replace and deposit cu from a similar compound and that zn will deposit pb in the same way they show that the affinity of zn for no3 is stronger than either ag cu or pb we express this affinity by saying that zn is the most positive of the four metals while ag is the most nega tive cu is positive to ag but negative to pb and zn which of the four elements are positive to pb and which negative mg would withdraw zn from a similar solution and be in its turn withdrawn by na the table on page 43 is founded on this relation a given element is positive to every element above it in the list and negative to all below it metals are usually classed as positive nonmetals as negative each in union with o and 1i gives rise to a very important class of compoundsthe negative to acids the positive to bases in the following note whether the positive or the negative element is written firsthcl na20as2s3 mgbr2 ag2s na2so4 is made up of two parts na2 being positive the radical so4 negative like elements radicals are either positive or negative in the following separate the positive element from the negative radical by a vertical line na2co3 nano3 znso4 kclo3 the most common positive radical is nh4 ammonium as in nh4cl it always deports itself as a metal the commonest radical is the negative oh called hydroxyl from hydrogen oxygen take away h from the symbol of water hoh and hydroxyl oh with one free bond is left if an element takes the place of h ie unites with oh the compound is called a hydrate koh is potassium hydrate name naoh caoh2 nh4oh znoh2 al2oh6 is the first part of each symbol above positive or negative h has an intermediate place in the list it is a constituent of both acids and bases and of the neutral substance water order negative or nonmetallic elements acidforming with husually oh oxygen sulphur nitrogen fluorine chlorine bromine iodine phosphorus arsenic carbon silicon hydrogen positive or metallic elements baseforming with oh gold platinum mercury silver copper tin lead iron zinc aluminium magnesium calcium sodium potassium chapter xiii electrolysis the following experiment is to be performed only by the teacher but pupils should make drawings and explain 63 decomposition of water experiment 38arrange in series two or more cells of a bunsen battery physics page 164 references are made in this book to gages introduction to physical science and attach the terminal wires to an electrolytic apparatus fig 19 filled with water made slightly acid with h2so4 construct a diagram of the apparatus marking the zn in the liquid since it is positive and the c or other element mark the electrode attached to the zn and that attached to the c positive electricity at one end of a body commonly implies negative at the other opposites attract while like electricities repel each other these analogies will aid the memory at the electrode is the element of h2o and at the electrode the element note page 43 whether h or o is positive with reference to the other and write the symbol for each at the proper electrode compare the diagram with the apparatus to verify your conclusion why does gas collect twice as fast at one electrode as at the other what does this prove of the composition of water when filled test the gases in each tube for o and h with a burning stick electrical analysis is called electrolysis if a solution of nacl be electrolyzed which element will go to the pole which if the salt were k2so4 explain these reactions in the electrolysis of that salt k2so4 k2 s03 o so4 is unstable and breaks up into so3 and o both k and so3 have great affinity for water k2 2 h2o 2 koh h2 s03 h2o h2so4 the base koh would be found at the electrode and the acid h2so4 at the electrode the positive portion k uniting with h2o forms a base the negative part s03 with h2o forms an acid of what does this show a salt to be composed 64 conclusionsthese experiments show 1 that at the electrode there always appears the negative element or radical of the compound and at the electrode the positive element 2 that these elements unite with those of water to make in the former case acids in the latter bases 3 that acids and bases differ as negative and positive elements differ each being united with o and h and yet producing compounds of a directly opposite character 4 that salts are really compounded of acids and bases this explains why salts are usually inactive and neutral in character while acids and bases are active agents thus we see why the most positive or the most negative elements in general have the strongest affinities while those intermediate in the list are inactive and have weak affinities why alloys of the metals are weak compounds why a neutral substance like water has such a weak affinity for the salts which it holds in solution and why an aqueous solution is regarded as a mechanical mixture rather than a chemical compound in this view the division line between chemistry and physics is not a distinct one these will be better understood after studying the chapters on acids bases and salts chapter xiv union by volume 66 avogadros law of gasesequal volumes of all gases the temperature and pressure being the same have the same number of molecules this law is the foundation of modern chemistry a cubic centimeter of o has as many molecules as a cubic centimeter of h a liter of n the same number as a liter of steam under similar conditions compare the number of molecules in 5 l of n2o with that in 10 l cl 7 cc vapor of i to 6 cc vapor of s the halfmolecules of two gases have of course the same relation to each other and in elements the halfmolecule is usually the atom the molecular volumesmolecules and the surrounding spaceof all gases must therefore be equal as must the halfvolumes notice that this law applies only to gases not to liquids or solids let us apply it to the experiment for the electrolysis of water in this we found twice as much h by volume as o evidently then steam has twice as many molecules of h as of o and twice as many halfmolecules or atoms if the molecule has one atom of o it must have two of h and the formula will be h2o suppose we reverse the process and synthesize steam which can be done by passing an electric spark through a mixture of h and o in a eudiometer over mercury we should need to take twice as much h as o now when 2 cc of h combine thus with 1 cc of o only 2 ccof steam are produced three volumes are condensed into two volumes and of course three molecular volumes into two three atomic volumes into two this may be written as follows h h o h2o this is a condensation of onethird if 2 l of chlorhydric acid gas be analyzed there will result 1 l of h and 1 l of cl the same relation exists between the molecules and the atoms and the reaction is hcl h cl reverse the process and 1 l of h unites with 1 l of cl to produce 2 l of the acid gas there is no condensation and the symbol is hcl in seven volumes hcl how many of each constituent the combination of two volumes of h with one volume of s is found to produce two volumes of hydrogen sulphide therefore two atoms of h combine with one of s to form a molecule whose symbol is h2s h h s h2s what is the condensation in this case problems 1 how many liters of s will it take to unite with 4 l of h how much h2s will be formed 2 how many liters of h will it take to combine with 5 l of s how much h2s results 3 in 6 l h2s how many liters h and how much s prove 4 in four volumes h2s how many volumes of each constituent 5 if three volumes of h be mixed with two volumes of s so as to make h2s how much will be formed how much of either element will be left an analysis of 2 cc of ammonia gives 1 cc n and 3 cc h the symbol must then be nh3 the reaction nh3 n h h h what condensation in the synthesis of nh3 in 12 cc nh3 how many cubic centimeters of each element in 2 12 cc how much h by volume is required to combine with nine volumes of n how many volumes of nh3 are produced in elements that have not been weighed in the gaseous state as c the evidence of atomic volume is not direct but we will assume it thus two volumes of marsh gas would separate into one of c and four of h what is its symbol and supposed condensation two volumes of alcohol vapor resolve into two of c six of h and one of o what is its symbol its condensation the symbol itself of a compound will usually show what its condensation is eg hcl hbr hf etc have two atoms hence there will be no shrinkage in h2o so2 co2 the molecule has three atoms condensed into the space of two or onethird shrinkage in nh3 four volumes are crowded into the space of two a condensation of onehalf p as hg zn have exceptional atomic volumes chapter xv acids and bases 66 what acids are experiment 39pour a

necessary of nh4oh and add this to the red litmus solution noting the alkaline reaction experiment in the same way with the two other principal acids and the two other alkalies litmus paper is commonly used to test these reactions and hereafter whenever the term litmus is employed in that sense the testpaper should be understood this paper can be prepared by dipping unglazed paper into a strong aqueous solution of litmus chapter xvi salts 71 acids and bases are usually opposite in characterwhen two forces act in opposition they tend to neutralize each other we may see an analogy to this in the union of the two opposite classes of compounds acids and bases to form salts 72 neutralization experiment 44put into an evaporatingdish 5 cc of naoh solution add hcl to this from a tt a

are other modes of obtaining salts but this is the only one which we sball consider 76 salts occur abundantly in nature such as nacl mgso4 caco3 acids and bases are found in small quantities only why is this why are there not springs of h2so4 and nh4oh we have seen that acids and bases are extremely active have opposite characters and combine to form relatively inactive salts if they existed in the free state they would soon combine by reason of their strong affinities this is what in all ages of the world has taken place and this is why salts are common acids and bases rare active agents rarely exist in the free state in large quantities oxygen seems to be an exception but this is because there is a superabundance of it while vast quantities are locked up in compounds in rocks water and salts of the earth much remains with which there is nothing to combine chapter xvii chlorhydric acid 77 we have seen that salts are made by the union of acids and bases can these last be obtained from salts 78 preparation of hcl experiment 47into a flask put 10 g coarse nacl and add 20 cc h2so4 connect with woulff bottles woulff bottles may be made by fitting to widemouthed bottles corks with three holes through which pass two delivery tubes and a central safety tube dipping into the liquid as in figures 22 and 23 partly filled with water as in figure 22 one bottle is enough to collect the hcl but in that case it is less pure since some h2so4 and other impurities are carried over several may be connected as in figure 23 the water in the first bottle must be nearly saturated before much gas will pass into the second heat the mixture 15 or 20 minutes not very strongly to prevent too much foaming notice any current in the first bottle nacl h2so4 hnaso4 hcl intense heat would have given

characteristic tests for this acid 80 chlorhydric hydrochloric or muriatic acid is a gasas used it is dissolved in water for which it has great affinity water will hold according to temperature from 400 to 500 times its volume of hcl hundreds of thousands of tons of the acid are annually made mostly in europe as a byeproduct in na2co3 manufacture the gas is passed into towers through which a spray of water falls this absorbs it the yellow color in most commercial hcl indicates impurities some of which are fe s as and organic matter as s etc come from the pyrites used in making h2so4 chemically pure cp acid is freed from these and is without color the gas may be dried by passing it through a glass tube holding cacl2 fig 16 and collecting it over mercury the muriatic acid of commerce consists of about two thirds water by weight hcl can also be made by direct union of its constituents81 useshcl is used to make cl and also bleaching powder its use as a reagent in the laboratory is illustrated by the following experiment experiment 49put into a tt 2 cc agno3 solution add 5 cc h2o then add slowly hcl so long as a ppt precipitate is formed this ppt is agcl now in another tt put 2 cc cuno32 solution add 5 cc h2o then a little hcl no ppt is formed now if a solution of agno3 and a solution of cuno32 were mixed and hcl added it is evident that the silver would be precipitated as chloride of silver while the copper would remain in solution if now this be filtered the silver will remain on the filter paper while in the filtrate will be the copper thus we shall have performed an analysis or separated one metal from another perform it note however that any soluble chloride as nacl would produce the same result as hcl bromhydric and iodihydric acids 82 nacl being the most abundant compound of cl is the source of commercial hcl kcl treated in the same way would give a like product theoretically hbr and hi might be made in the same way from nabr and nai but the affinity of h for br and i is weak and the acids separate into their elements when thus prepared 83 to make hi experiment 50drop into a tt three or four crystals of i and add 10 cc h2o hold in

fluorite into a shallow lead tray eg 4x5 cm and pour over it 4 or 5 cc h2so4 a piece of glass large enough to cover this should previously be warmed and covered on one side with a very thin coat of beeswax to distribute itevenly warm the other side of the glass over a flame when cool scratch a design fig 24 through the wax with a sharp metallic point lay the glass film side down over the lead tray warm this five minutes or more by placing it high over a small flame fig 25 to avoid melting the wax do not inhale the fumes take away the lamp and leave the tray and glass where it is not cold for half an hour or more then remove the wax and clean the glass with naphtha or benzine look for the etching two things should have occurred 1 the generation of hf write the equation for it 2 its etching action on glass in this last process hf acts on sio2 of the glass forming h2o and sif4 why cannot hf be kept in glass bottles a dilute solution of hf which is a gas may be kept in gutta percha bottles the anhydrous acid in platinum only but for the most part it is used as soon as made its chief use being to etch designs on glassware glass is also often etched by a blast of sand sio2 notice

desired fig 27 86 properties and tests experiment 531 note the color of the prepared liquid 2 put a drop on the finger then wash it off at once 3 dip a quill or piece of white silk into it then wash off the acid what color is imparted to animal substances 4 add a little to a few bits of cu turnings or to a cu coin write the equation 5 to 2 ccindigo solution add 2 cc hno3 state the leading properties of hno3 from these tests 87 chemically pure hno3 is a colorless liquid the yellow color of that prepared in experiment 52 is due to liquid no2 dissolved in it it is then called fuming hno3 and is very strong no2 is formed at a high temperature commercial or ordinary hno3 is made from nano3 this being cheaper than kno3 it is about half water 88 uses hno3 is the basis of many nitrates as agno3 used for photography bano32 and srno32 for fireworks and others for dyeing and printing calico it is employed in making aqua regia sulphuric acid nitroglycerine guncotton aniline colors zylonite etc enough experiments have been performed to answer the question whether some acids can be prepared from their salts h2so4 is not so made because no acid is strong enough to act on its salts in making hcl hno3 etc sulphuric acid was used being the strongest aqua regia 89 preparation and action experiment 54into a tt put 2 cc hno3 and 14 qcm of either au leaf or pt warm in a flame if the metal is pure no action takes place into another tube put 6 cc hcl and add a similar leaf heat this also there should be no action pour the contents of one tt into the other note the effect which is stronger one of the acids or the combination of the two note the odor it is that of cl 3hcl hno3 nocl 2h2o cl2 this reaction is approximate only the strength is owing to nascent chlorine which unites with au au 3cl aucl3 if pt be used ptcl4 is produced no other acid except nitrohydrochloric will dissolve au or pt hence the ancients called it aqua regia or king of liquids it must be made as wanted since it cannot be kept and retain its strength chapter xix sulphuric acid 90 preparation experiment 55having fitted a cork with four or five perforations to a large tt pass a dt from three of these to three smaller tt leaving the others open to the air as in figure 28 into one tt put 5 cc h2o into another 5 g cu turnings and 10 cc h2so4 into the third 5 g cu turnings and 10 cc dilute hno3 half water hang on a ring stand and slowly heat the tubes containing h2o and h2so4 notice the fumes that pass into the large tt trace out and apply to figure 28 these reactions 1 cu 2 h2so4 cuso4 2 h2o so2 2 3 cu 8 hno3 3 cuno32 4 h2o 2 no 3 no o no2 4 so2 h2o no2 h2so4 no 4 comes from combining the gaseous products in 1 2 3 in 3 no takes an atom of o from the air becoming no2 and at once gives it up to the h2so3 h2o so2 making h2so4 and again goes through the same operation of taking up o and passing it along no is thus called a carrier of o it is a reducing agent while no2 is an oxidizing agent this is a continuous process and very important since it changes useless h2so3 into valuable h2so4 if exposed to the air h2so3 would very slowly take up o and become h2so4 instead of the last experiment this may be employed if preferred burn a little s in a receiver put into an evaporatingdish 5 cc hno3 and dip a paper or piece of cloth into it hang the paper in the receiver of so2 letting no hno3 drop from it continue this operation till a small quantity of liquid is found in the bottle the fumes show that hno3 has lost o 2 hno3 so2 h2so4 2 no2 91 tests for h2so4 experiment 561 test the liquid with litmus 2 transfer it to a tt and add an equal volume of bacl2 solution h2so4 bacl2 is baso4 soluble 3 put one drop h2so4 from the reagent bottle in 10 cc h2o in a clean tt and add 1 cc bacl2 solution look for any cloudiness this is the characteristic test for h2so4 and soluble sulphates and so delicate that one drop in a liter of h2o can be detected 4 instead of h2so4 try a little na2so4 solution 5 put two or three drops of strong h2so4 on writingpaper and evaporate high over a flame so as not to burn the paper examine it when dry 6 put a stick into a tt containing 2 cc h2so4 and note the effect 7 review experiment 5 8 into an ed pour 5 cc h2o and then 15 cc h2so4 stir it meantime with a small tt containing 2 or 3 cc nh4oh and notice what takes place in the latter also note the heat of the ed the effects of 5 6 7 and 8 are due to the intense affinity which h2so4 has for h2o so thirsty is it that it even abstracts h and o from oxalic acid in the right proportion to form h2o combines them and then absorbs the water 92 affinity for waterthis acid is a desiccator or dryer and is used to take moisture from the air and prevent metallic substances from rusting in this way it dilutes itself and may increase its weight threefold in diluting the acid must always be poured into the water slowly and with stirring not water into the acid since as h2o is lighter than h2so4 heat enough may be set free at the surface of contact to cause an explosion contraction also takes place as may be shown by accurately measuring each liquid in a graduate before mixing and again when cold the mixture occupies less volume than the sum of the two volumes for the best results the volume of the acid should be about three times that of the water 93 sulphuric acid made on a large scale involves the same principles as shown in experiment 55 excepting that s02 is obtained by burning s or roasting fes2 pyrite fig 29 and hno3 is made on the spot from nano3 and h2so4 so2 enters a large leaden chamber often 100 to 300 feet long and jets of steam and small portions of hno3 are also forced in the chamber acid thus formed is very dilute and must be evaporated first in leaden pans and finally in glass or platinum retorts since strong h2so4 especially if hot dissolves lead see experiment 124 study figure 29 and write the reactions 2 hno3 breaks up into 2 no2 h2o and o 94 importancesulphuric acid has been called next to human food the most indispensable article known there is hardly a product of modern civilization in the manufacture of which it is not directly or indirectly used nearly a million tons are made yearly in great britain alone it is the basis of all acids as na2co3 is of alkalies it is the life of chemical industry and the quantity of it consumed is an index of a peoples civilization only a few of its uses can be stated here the two leading ones are the reduction of ca3po42 for artificial manures and the sodium carbonate manufacture foods depend on the productiveness of soils and on fertilizers and thus indirectly our daily bread is supplied by means of this acid and from sodium carbonate glass soap saleratus baking powders and most alkalies are made directly or indirectly h2so4 is employed in bleaching dyeing printing telegraphy electroplating galvanizing iron and wire cleaning metals refining au and ag making alum blacking vitriols glucose mineral waters ether indigo madder nitroglycerine gun cotton parchment celluloid etc etc fuming sulphuric acid 95 nordhausen or fuming sulphuric acid h2s207 used in dissolving indigo and preparing coaltar pigments is made by distilling feso4 4feso4 h2o h2s207 2fe203 2s02 this was the original sulphuric acid it is also formed when s03 is dissolved in h2so4 when exposed to the air s03 escapes with fuming chapter xx ammonium hydrate 96 preparation of baseswe have seen that many acids are made by acting on a salt of the acid required with a stronger acid this is the direct way the following experiments will show that bases may be prepared in a similar way by acting on salts of the base required with other bases which we may regard as stronger than the ones to be obtained 97 preparation of nh4oh and nh3 experiment 57powder 10 g ammonium chloride nh4cl in a mortar and mix with 10 g calcium hydrate caoh2 recently slaked lime is the best cover with water in a flask and

2nh4oh nh4oh is broken up into nh3 ammonia gas and water nh4oh nh3 h2o these pass over into the first bottle where the water takes up the nh3 for which it has great affinity one volume of water at 0 will absorb more than 1000 volumes of nh3 thus nh4oh may be called a solution of nh3 in h2o write the reaction experiment 58powder and mix 2 or 3 g each of ammonium nitrate nh4no3 and caoh2 put them

washes it from the atmosphere into the soil plants take it from the soil animals extract it from plants coal bones horns etc are the chief sources of it and from them it is obtained by distillation it results also from decomposing animal matter nh3 can be produced by the direct union of n and h only by an electric discharge or by ozone it may be collected over hg like other gases that are very soluble in water 100 uses ammonium hydrate nh4oh and ammonia nh3 are used in chemical operations in making artificial ice and to some extent in medicine from them also may be obtained ammonium salts state what you would put with nh4oh to obtain nh42so4 to obtain nh4no3 the use of nh4oh in the laboratory may be illustrated by the following experiment experiment 60into a tt put 10 cc of a solution of ferrous sulphate feso4 into another put 10 cc of sodium sulphate solution na2so4 add a little nh4oh to each notice a ppt in the one case but none in the other if solutions of these two compounds were mixed the metals fe and na could be separated by the addition of nh4oh similar to the separation of ag and cu by hcl try the experiment chapter xxi sodium hydrate 101 preparation experiment 61dissolve 3 g sodium carbonate na2co3 in 10 or 15 cc h2o in an ed and bring it to the boilingpoint then add to this a mixture of 1 or 2 g calcium hydrate caoh2 in 5 or 10cc h2o it will not dissolve boil the whole for five minutes then pour off the liquid which holds naoh in solution evaporate if desired this is the usual mode of preparing naoh the reaction is na2co3 caoh2 2naoh caco3 the residue is caoh2 and caco3 the solution contains naoh which can be solidified by evaporating the water sodium hydrate is an ingredient in the manufacture of hard soap and for this use thousands of tons are made annually mostly in europe it is an important laboratory reagent its use being similar to that of ammonium hydrate exposed to the air it takes up water and co2 forming a mixture of naoh and na2co3 it is one of the strongest alkalies and corrodes the skin experiment 62put 20 cc of h2o in a receiver with the forceps take a piece of na not larger than half a pea from the naphtha in which it is

small piece of k into a receiver of h2o as in experiment 62 the k must be very small and the experiment should not be watched at too close a range the receiver should not be covered with glass but with paper the h burns uniting with o of the air the purple color is imparted by the burning or oxidation of small particles of k write the equation for the combustion of each h2o might be considered the symbol of an acid since it is the union of h and a negative element or if written hoh it might be called a base since it has a positive element and the oh radical it is neutral to litmus and on this account might be called a salt it is better however to call it simply an oxide potassium hydrate caustic potash is employed for the manufacture of soft soap as a chemical reagent its action is almost precisely like that of caustic soda though it is usually considered a stronger base as k is a more electropositive element than na calcium hydrate 104 calcium hydrate the most common of the bases is nearly as important to them as h2so4 is to acids since it is used to make the other bases it might be called the strongest base as h2so4 is often called the strongest acid the strength of an acid or base howeverdepends on the substance to which it is applied as well as on itself and for most purposes this one is classified as a weaker base than the three previously described sulphuric acid the most useful of the acids is not made directly from its salts but has to be synthesized calcium hydrate is also made by an indirect process as follows caco3 ie limestone marble etc is burnt in kilns with c a process which separates the gas co2 according to the reaction caco3 cao co2 cao is unslaked lime or quicklime on treating this with water slaked lime caoh2 is formed with generation of great heat cao h2o caoh2 its affinity for h2o is so great that it takes the latter from the air if exposed experiment 65saturate some unslaked lime with water in an ed and look for the results stated above leaving it as long as may be necessary 105 resumefrom the experiments in the last few chapters on the three divisions of chemical compounds acids bases and salts we have seen 1 that acids and bases are the chemical opposites of each other 2 that salts are formed by the union of acids and bases 3 that some acids can be obtained from their salts by the action of a stronger acid 4 that some bases can be got from salts by the similar action of other bases 5 that the strongest acids and bases as well as others may be obtained in an indirect way by synthesis chapter xxii oxides of nitrogen

heated too fast some no is formed and this taking o from the air makes no2 which liquefies and gives an acid reaction and a red color some nh4no3 is also liable to be carried over 108 properties

volumewe have seen that water contains two parts of h by volume to one part of o or by weight two parts of h to sixteen of o these proportions are invariable or no symbol for water would be possible every compound in the same way has an unvarying proportion of elements 114 law of definite proportionin a given compound the proportion of any element by weight or if a gas by volume is always

weight is in each case a multiple of the first 16 also that the proportion by volume of o is a multiple of that in the first compound in this example the n remains the same if that had varied in the different compounds it would also havevaried by a multiple of the smallest proportion this is true in all compounds 115 law of multiple proportionwhenever one element combines with another in more than one proportion it always combines in some multiple one or more of its least combining weight or if a gas of its least combining volume the least combining weight of an element is its atomic weight and it is this fact of a least combining weight that leads us to believe the atom to be indivisible apply the law in the case of p2o p2o3 p2o5 in hclo hclo2 hclo3 hclo4 arranging the symbols

bottle fig 31 and collect the gas over water heat the flask slowly and avoid inhaling the gas 117 tests experiment 73remove a receiver of the gas and try to light the latter with a splinter is it combustible or a supporter of c combustion what is the color of the flame when the combustion ceases shake up a little lime water with the gas left in the receiver what gas has been formed by the combustion as shown by the test see page 80 give the reaction for the combustion we have seen that h2so4 has great affinity for h2o oxalic acid consists of h c o in the right proportion to form h2o co2 and co h2so4 withdraws h and o in the right proportion to form water unites them and then absorbs the water leaving the c and o to combine and form co2 and co naoh solution removes co2 from the mixture forming na2co3 and leaves co write both reactions 118 carbon protoxide called also carbon monoxide carbonic oxide etc is a gas having no color or taste butpossessing a faint odor it is very poisonous being the lesser oxide of c it is formed when c is burned in a limited supply of o whereas co2 is always produced when o is abundant the formation of each is well shown by tracing the combustion in a coal fire air enters at the bottom and co2 is first formed c 2o co2 as this gas passes up the whitehot coal removes one atom of o leaving co co2 c 2co at the top if the draft be open a blue flame shows the combustion of co co o co2 the same reduction of co2 takes place in the iron furnace and whenever there is not enough oxygen to form co2 the product is co great care should be taken that this gas does not escape into the room as one per cent has proved fatal not all of it is burned at the top of the coal and when the stove door is open the upper drafts should be open also it is the most poisonous of the gases from coal hence the danger from sleeping in a room having a coal fire 119 water gasco is one of the constituents of water gas which by reason of its cheapness is supplanting gas made from coal as an illuminator in some cities it is made by passing superheated steam over redhot charcoal or coke c unites with the o of h2o forming co and sets h free thus producing two inflammable gases c h2o as neither of these gives much light naphtha is distilled and mixed with them in small quantities to furnish illuminating power see page 183 chapter xxv carbon dioxide 120 preparation experiment 74put into a tt or a bottle with a dt and a thistletube 10 or 20 g caco3 marble in lumps add as many cubic centimeters of h2o and half as much hcl and collect the gas by downward displacement fig 39 add more acid as needed caco3 2 hcl cacl2 h2co3 h2co3 h2o co2 h2co3 is a very weak compound and at once breaks up by some its existence as a compound is doubted 121 tests experiment 751 put a burning and a glowing stick into the tt or bottle 2 hold the end of the dt directly against the flame of a small burning stick does the gas support combustion 3 pour a receiver of the gas over a candle flame what does this show of the weight of the gas 4 pass a little co2 into some h2o fig 32 and test it with litmus give the reaction for the solution of co2 in h2o experiment 76put into a tt 51 cc of clear caoh2 solution ie lime water insert in this the end of a dt from a co2 generator fig 32 notice any ppt formed it is caco3 let the action continue until the ppt disappears and the liquid is clear then remove the dt boil the clear liquid for a minute and notice whether the ppt reappears 122 explanation caoh2 co2 caco3 h2o the curious phenomena of this experiment are explained by the solubility of caco3 in water containing co2 and its insolubility in water having no co2 when all the caoh3 is combined or changed to caco3 the excess of co2 unites with h2o forming the weak acid h2co3 which dissolves the precipitate caco3 and gives a clear liquid on heating this h2co3 gives up its co2 and caco3 is reprecipitated not being soluble in pure water lime water caoh2 solution is therefore a test for the presence of co2 to show that carbon dioxide is formed in breathing and in the combustion of c and that it is present in the air perform the following experiment experiment 771 put a little lime water into a tt and blow into it through a piece of glass tubing any turbidity shows what 2 burn a candle for a few minutes in a receiver of air then take out the candle and shake up lime water with the gas 3 expose some lime water in an ed to the air for some time 133 oxidation in the human systemcarbon dioxide or carbonic anhydride carbonic acid etc co2 is a heavy gas without color or odor it has a sharp prickly taste and is commonly reckoned as poisonous if inhaled in large quantities though it does not chemically combine with the blood as co does ten per cent in the air will sometimes produce death and five per cent produces drowsiness it exists in minute portions in the atmosphere and often accumulates at the bottom of old wells and caverns owing to its slow diffusive power before going down into one of these the air should always be tested by lowering a lighted candle if this is extinguished there is danger co2 is the deadly choke damp after a mine explosion ch4 being converted into co2 and h2o a great deal is liberated during volcanic eruptions and it is formed in breathing by the union of o in the air with c in the system this union of c and o takes place in the lungs and in all the tissues of the body even on the surface oxygen is taken into the lungs passes through the thin membrane into the blood forms a weak chemical union with the red corpuscles and is conveyed by them to all parts of the system throughout the body wherever necessary c and h are supplied for the o and unite with it to form co2 and h2o these are taken up by the blood though they do not form a chemical union with it are carried to the lungs and pass out together with the unused n and surplus o the system is thus purified and the waste must be supplied by food the process also keeps up the heat of the body as really as the combustion of c or p in o produces heat the temperature of the body does not vary much from 99 degrees f any excess of heat passing off through perspiration and being changed into other forms of energy if as in some fevers the temperature rises above about 105 degrees f the blood corpuscles are killed and the person dies during violent exercise much material is consumed circulation is rapid and quick breathing ensues oxygen is necessary for life a healthy person inhales plentifully and this element is one of natures best remedies for disease deep and continued inhalations in cold weather are better than furnace fires to heat the system all animals breathe o and exhale co2 fishes and other aquatic animals obtain it not by decomposing h2o but from air dissolved in water being coldblooded they need relatively little but if no fresh water is supplied to those in captivity they soon die of o starvation 124 oxidation in waterswiftrunning streams are clear and comparatively pure because their organic impurities are constantly brought to the surface and oxidized whereas in stagnant pools these impurities accumulate reservoirs of water for city supply have sometimes been freed from impurities by aeration ie by forcing air into the water 125 deoxidation in plantssince co2 is so constantly poured into the atmosphere why does it not accumulate there in large quantity why is there not less free o in the air today than there was a thousand years ago the answer to these questions is found in the growth of vegetation in the leaf of every plant are thousands of little chemical laboratories co2 diffused in small quantities in the air passes together with a very little h2o into the leaf usually from its under side and is decomposed by the radiant energy of the sun the c is built into the woody fiber of the tree and the o is ready to be rebreathed or burned again co2 contributes to the growth of plants o to that of animals and the constituents of the atmosphere vary little from one age to another the compensation of nature is here well shown plants feed upon what animals discard transforming it into material for the sustenance of the latter while animals prepare food for plants all the c in plants is supposed to come from the co2 in the atmosphere animals obtain their supply from plants the utility of the small percentage of co2 in the air is thus seen 126 usesco2 is used in making sodawater and in chemical engines to put out fires in their early stages in either case it may be prepared by treating na2co3 or caco3 with h2so4 give the reactions on a small scale co2 is made from hnaco3 co2 has a very weak affinity for water but probably forms with it h2co3 much carbon dioxide can be forced into water under pressure this forms sodawater which really contains no soda the justification for the name is the material from which it is sometimes made salts from h2co3 called carbonates are numerous na2co3 and caco3 being the most important chapter xxvi ozone 127 preparation experiment 78scrape off the oxide from the surface of a piece of phosphorus 2 cm long put it into a widemouthed bottle half cover the p with water cover the bottle with a glass and leave it for half an hour or more 128 tests experiment 79remove the glass cover smell the gas and hold in it some wet iodostarch paper look for any blue color iodine has been set free according to the reaction 2 ki 03 k20 o2 i2 and has imparted a blue color to the starch and ordinary oxygen has been formed why will not oxygen set iodine free from ki what besides ozone will liberate it 129 ozone oxidized oxygen active oxygen etc is an allotropic form of o its molecule is 03 while that of ordinary oxygen is 02 three atoms of oxygen are condensed into the space of two atoms of ozone or three molecules of o are condensed into two molecules of ozone or three liters of o are condensed into two liters of ozone ozone is thus formed by oxidizing ordinary oxygen 02 o 03 this takes place during thunder storms and in artificial electrical discharges the quantity of ozone produced is small five per cent being the maximum and the usual quantity is far less than that ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent and will change s p and as into their ic acids cotton cloth was formerly bleached and linen is now bleached by spreading it on the grass and leaving it for weeks to be acted on by ozone which is usually present in the air in small quantities especially in the country ozone is a disinfectant like other bleaching agents and serves to clear the air of noxious gases and germs of infectious diseases so much ozone is reduced in this way that the air of cities contains less of it than country air a third is consumed in uniting with the substance which it oxidizes while twothirds are changed into oxygen as in experiment 79 it is unhealthful to breathe much ozone but a little in the air is desirable for disinfection ozone will cause the inert n of the air to unite with h to form ammonia no other agent capable of doing this is known so that all the nh3 in the air in fact all ammonium compounds taken up by plants from soils and fertilizers may have been made originally through the agency of ozone at a low temperature ozone has been liquefied it is then distinctly blue electrolysis of water is the best mode of preparing this substance in quantity when prepared from p it is mixed with p2o3 chapter xxvii chemistry of the atmosphere 130 constituentsthe four chief constituents of the atmosphere are n o h2o co2 in the order of their abundance what experiments show the presence of n o and co2 in the air set a pitcher of ice water in a warm room and the moisture that collects on the outside is deposited from the air this shows the presence of h2o rain clouds fog and dew prove the same h2so4 and cacl2 on exposure to air take up water experiment 18 shows that there is not far from four times as much n as o by volume in air hence if the atmosphere were a compound of n and o and the proportion of four to one were exact its symbol would be n4o 131 air not a compoundthe following facts show that air is not a compound but rather a mixture of these gases 1 the proportion of n and o in the air though it does not vary much is not always exactly the same this could not be true if it were a compound why 2 if n4o were dissolved in water the n would be four times the o in volume but when air is dissolved less than twice as much n as o is taken up 3 no heat or condensation takes place when four measures of n are brought in contact with one of o it cannot then be n4o for the vapor density of n4o would be 36ie 14 x 4 16 2 but that of air is 14 12 nearly ie 14 x 4 16 5 analysis shows about 79 parts of n to 21 parts of o by volume in air 132 waterthe volume of h2o watery vapor in the atmosphere is very variable warm air will hold more than cold and at any temperature air may be near saturation ie having all it will hold at that temperature or it may have little but some is always present though the hot desert winds of north africa are not more than 115 saturated a cubic meter of air at 25 degrees when saturated contains more than 22 g of water 133 carbon dioxidecarbon dioxide does not make up more than three or four parts in ten thousand of the air but in the whole of the atmosphere this gives a very large aggregate why does not co2 form a layer below the o and n 134 other ingredientsother substances are found in the air in minute portions eg nh3 constitutes nearly onemillionth air is also impregnated with living and dead germs dust particles unburned carbon etc but these for the most part are confined to the portion near the earths surface in pestilential regions the germs of disease are said sometimes to contaminate the air for miles around chapter xxviii the chemistry of water 135 pure waterreview the experiments for electrolysis and for burning h pure water is obtained by distillation experiment 80provide a glass tube 40 or 50 cm long and 3 or 4 cm in diameter fit to each end a cork with two perforations through one of which a long tube passes the entire length of the larger tube fig 32a connect one end of this with a flask of water arranged for heating pass the other end into an open receptacle for collecting the distilled water into the other perforations lead short tubes the one for water to flow into the large tube from a jet the other for the same to flow out this condenses the steam by circulating cold water around it the apparatus is called a liebigs condenser put water into the flask boil it and notice the condensed liquid it is comparatively pure water for most of the substances in solution have a higher boilingpoint than water and are left behind when it is vaporized fig 32a 136 test experiment 81test the purity of distilled water by slowly evaporating a few drops on pt foil in a room free from dust there should be no spot or residue left on the foil test in the same way undistilled water 137 water exists in three states solid liquid and vaporous it freezes at 0 degrees suddenly expanding considerably as it passes into the solid state it boils ie overcomes atmospheric pressure and is vaporized at 100 degrees 760 mm pressure if the pressure is greater the boilingpoint is raised ie it takes a higher temperature to overcome a greater pressure if there be less pressure as on a mountain the boilingpoint is lowered below 100 degrees salts dissolved in water raise its boilingpoint and lower its freezingpoint to an extent depending on the kind and quantity of the salt water however evaporates at all temperatures even from ice pure water has no taste or smell and in small quantities no color it is rarely if ever found on the earth what is taken up by the air in evaporation is nearly pure but when it falls as rain or snow impurities are absorbed from the atmosphere water falling after a long rain especially in the country is tolerably free from impurities some springs have also nearly pure water but to separate all foreign matter from it water must be distilled even then it is liable to contain traces of ammonia or some other substance which vaporizes at a lower temperature than water 138 seawaterthe ocean is the ultimate source of all water from it and from lakes rivers and soils water is taken into the atmosphere falls as rain or snow and sinks into the ground reappearing in springs or flowing off in brooks and rivers to the ocean or inland seas ocean water must naturally contain soluble salts and many salts which are not soluble in pure water are dissolved in seawater in fact there is a probability that all elements exist to some extent in seawater but many of them in extremely minute quantities sodium and magnesium salts are the two most abundant and the bitter taste is due to mgso4 and mgcl2 a liter of sea water nearly 1000 g holds over 37 g of various salts 29 of which are nacl see hard water 139 river waterriver water holds fewer salts but has a great deal of organic matter living and dead derived from the regions through which it flows to render this harmless for drinking such water should be boiled or filtered through unglazed porcelain carbon filters are now thought to possess but little virtue for separating harmful germs 140 spring waterthe water of springs varies as widely in composition as do the rocks whence it bubbles forth sulphur springs contain much h2s many geysers hold sio2 in solution chalybeate waters have compounds of fe others have na2so4 mgso4 nacl etc chapter xxix the chemistry of flame 141 candle flame experiment 82examine a candle flame holding a dark object behind it note three distinct portions 1 a colorless interior about the wick 2 a yellow lightgiving portion beyond that 3 a thin blue envelope outside of all and scarcely discernible hold a small stick across the flame so that it may lie in all three parts and observe that no combustion takes place in the inner portion 142 explanationa candle of paraffine or tallow is chiefly composed of compounds of c and h in the solid state the burning wick melts the solid the liquid is then drawn up by the wick till the heat vaporizes and decomposes it and o of the air comes in contact with the outer heated portion of gas and burns it completely air tends to penetrate the whole body of the flame but only n can pass through uncombined for the o that is left after combustion in the outer portion seizes upon the compounds of c and h in the next or yellow part there is not enough o here for complete combustion at this temperature h burns before c and the latter is set free in that state it is of course a solid now an incandescent solid or one glowing with heat gives light while the combustion of a gas gives scarcely any light though it may produce great heat while c in the middle flame is glowing during the moment of its dissociation from h it gives light in the outer flame the temperature is high enough to burn entirely the gaseous compounds of c and h together so that no solid c is set free and hence no light is given except the faint blue no combustion takes place in the inner blue cone because no o reaches there by packing a wick into a cylindrical tin cup 5 or 10 cm high and 4 cm in diameter containing alcohol and lighting it gunpowder can be held in the middle of the flame in a def spoon without burning this shows the low temperature of that portion burning p will also be extinguished thus showing the exclusion of o 143 bunsen flame experiment 83examine a bunsen burner unscrew the top and note the orifices for the admission of gas and of air make a drawing replace the parts then light the gas at the top opening the airholes at the base notice that the flame burns with very little color try to distinguish the three parts as in the candle flame these parts can best be seen by allowing direct sunlight to fall on the flame and observing its shadow on a white ground make a drawing of the flame hold across it a pt wire and note at what part the wire glows most also press down on the flame for an instant with a cardboard or piece of paper remove before it takes fire and notice the charred circle put the end of a match into the blue cone and note that it does not burn put the end of a pt wire into this blue cone and observe that it glows when near the top of the cone what do these experiments show ascertain whether this inner portion contains a combustible material by holding in it one end of a small dt and trying to ignite any gas escaping at the other end it should burn this shows that no combustion takes place in the interior of the flame because sufficient free o is not present next close the airholes and note that the flame is yellow and gives much light from this we infer the presence of solid particles in an incandescent state but these could not come from the air they must be c particles which have been set free from the c and h compounds of the gas just as in the candle flame the smoke that rises proves this hold an ed in the flame and collect some c try the same with the airholes open 144 light and heat of flamewhich of the two flames is hotter the one with the airholes open or that with them closed evidently the former for air is drawn in and mixes with the gas as it rises in the tube and on reaching the flame at the top the two are well mingled and the gaseous compounds of c and h burn at so high a temperature that solid c is not freed hence there is little light on closing the airholes no o can reach the flame except from the outside and the heat is much less intense fig 33 fig 34 the h burns first and sets the c free which while glowing gives the light this again illustrates the facts 1 that flame is caused by burning gas 2 that light is produced by incandescent solids charcoal coke and anthracite coal burn without flame or with very little because of the absence of gases 145 temperature of combustion experiment 84light a bunsen flame with the basal orifices open and hold over it a fine wire gauze notice that the flame does not rise above the gauze extinguish the light and try to ignite the gas above the gauze holding the latter within 5 or 6 cm of the burner tube notice that it does not burn below the gauze fig 33 gas and o are both present evidently then the only condition wanting for combustion is a sufficiently high temperature the gauze cools the gas below its kindling point this principle is made use of in the miners lamp of davy fig 34 in coal mines a very inflammable gas ch4 called firedamp issues from the coal if this collects in large quantities and mixes with o of the air a kindlingpoint is all that is needed to make a violent explosion an ordinary lamp would produce this but the gauze lamp prevents it for though the inside may be filled with burning gas ch4 the flame cannot communicate with the outside fig 35 fig 36 a reducing flame b oxidizing flame 146 oxidizing and reducing flamesthe hottest part of a bunsen flame is just above the inner blue cone b fig 36 evidently there is more o at that point if a reducing agent ie a substance which takes up o be put into this part of the flame the latter will remove the o and appropriate it forming an oxide cu heated there would become copper oxide this part is called the oxidizing flame the inner blue part of the bunsen flame is devoid of o it ought to remove o from an oxidizing agent ie a substance which supplies o if copper oxide be heated there a fig 36 by means of a mouth blowpipe fig 35 the flame will appropriate the o and leave the copper this is called the reducing flame only the upper part of this blue central cone has heat enough to act in this way by using a prepared piece of metal to make the flame thin and to shut off the air and then blowing the flame with a blowpipe greater strength can be obtained in both oxidizing and reducing flames fig 36 147 combustible and supporter interchangeable h was found to burn in o h was the combustible o the supporter would o itself burn in hie would the combustible become the supporter and the supporter the combustible as illuminating gas consists largely of h and as air is part o we may try the experiment with gas and air gas will burn in air will air burn in gas experiment 85fit a cork with two holes in it to the large end of a lamp chimney through each hole pass a short piece of tubing and connect one of these with a rubber tube leading to a gasjet pass a metallic tube long enough to reach the top of the chimney through the other so that it will move easily up and down turn on the gas and light it at the top of the chimney hold the end of the tube passing through the cork in the flame for a minute then draw it down to the middle of the chimney fig 37 a and finally slowly remove it b note that o from the air is burning in the gas which is the supporter and which the combustible in this case o will burn equally well in an atmosphere of h as can be shown by experiment 148 explosive mixture of gases experiment 86slowly turn down the burning gas of a bunsen lamp having the orifices open and notice that it suddenly explodes and goes out at the top but now burns at the base as the gas was gradually turned off more air became mixed with it until there was the right proportion of each gas for an explosion figure 38 shows the same thing light the gas at the top a when the tube c covers the jet b then gradually raise the tube c at a certain place there is the same explosion as with the lamp 149 generalizationsthese experiments show 1 that three conditions are necessary for combustiona combustible a supporter and a burning temperature which varies for different substances given these a fire always results the conditions for spontaneous combustion do not differ from those of any combustion see experiments 34 112 113 114 2 that combustible and supporter are interchangeable if h burns in o o will burn in h the product being the same in each case 3 for any combustion there must be a certain proportion of combustible and of supporter twenty per cent of co2 in the air dilutes the o to such an extent that c will not burn hence the utility of the chemical engine for putting out fires 4 when two gases a combustible and a supporter are mixed in the requisite proportion they form an explosive mixture needing only the kindling temperature to unite them chemical combination is always accompanied by disengagement of heat chemical dissociation is always accompanied by absorption of heat the disengagement or the absorption is not always evident to the senses combustion is the chemical combination of two or more substances with the selfevident disengagement of great heat and usually of light the temperature of ignition varies greatly with different substances ph3 burns spontaneously at the usual temperatures of the air p takes fire at 60 degrees but even at 10 degrees it oxidizes with rapidity enough to produce phosphorescence the vapor of cs2 may be set on fire by a glass rod heated to 150 degrees but a redhot iron will not ignite illuminating gas spontaneous combustion often takes place in woolen or cotton rags which have been saturated with oil the oil rapidly absorbs o and sets fire to the cloth this is thought to be the origin of some very destructive fires chapter xxx chlorine 150 preparation experiment 87put into a tt 5 g of fine granular mno2

not combine from these experiments state the chief properties of cl and what combustion it will support figure 41 156 sources and usesthe great source of cl is nacl though it is often made from hcl its chief use is in making bleaching powder one pound of which will bleach 300 to 500 pounds of cloth cl is very easily liberated from this powder by a dilute acid or slowly by taking moisture from the air hence its use as a disinfectant in destroying noxious gases and the germs of infectious diseases cl attacks organic matter and germs as it does the membrane of the throat or lungs owing to its affinity for h cl is the best bleaching agent for cotton goods it is not suitable for animal materials such as silk and wool as it attacks their fiber it does not discharge either mineral or carbon colors the chemistry of bleaching is obscure as dry material will not bleach cl seems to unite with h in h2o and to set o free the o then unites with some portion of the coloring matter oxidizing it

one except hg it quickly evaporates on exposure to air the chemistry of its manufacture is like that of cl its bleaching and disinfecting powers are similar to the latter though they are not quite so strong as those of cl its affinity for h and for metals is also strongly marked a drop of br on the skin produces a sore slow to heal bromine salts are mainly kbr nabr mgbr2 these in small quantities accompany nacl and are most common in brine springs the worlds supply of br comes chiefly from west virginia and ohio over 300000 pounds being produced from the salt nacl wells there in 1884 the water taken from these wells is nearly evaporated after which nacl crystallizes out leaving a thick liquidbittern or mother liquorwhich contains the salts of br the bittern is treated with h2so4 and mn02 as above for transportation in large quantities br has to be made into the salts nabr and kbr on account of the danger attending leakage or breakage of the receptacles for br 160 usesits chief uses are in photography page 167 medicine as kbr and analytical chemistry chapter xxxii iodine examine iodine potassium iodide 161 preparation of i experiment 98put into a tt 2 or 3 g of powdered ki mixed with an equal bulk of mno2 add h2so4 enough to cover well shake together complete the apparatus as for making br and heat notice the color of the vapor and any sublimate the direct product of the solidification of a vapor is called a sublimate the process is sublimation observe any crystals formed write the reaction and compare the process with that for making br and cl compare the vapor density of i with that of br and of cl with that of air what vapor is heavier than i what acid and what base are represented by ki 162 tests experiment 991 put a crystal of i in the palm of the hand and watch it for a minute 2 put 2 or 3 crystals into a tt and warm it meanwhile holding a stirringrod halfway down the tube notice the vapor also a sublimate on the sides of the tt and rod 3 add to 2 or 3 crystals in a tt 5 cc of alcohol c2h5oh warm it and see whether a solution is formed if so add 5 cc h2o and look for a ppt of i does this show that i is not at all soluble in h2o or not so soluble as in alcohol 163 starch solution and iodine test experiment 100pulverize a gram or two of starch put it into an evaporatingdish add 4 or 5 drops of water and mix then heat to the boilingpoint 10 cc h2o in a tt and pour it over the starch stirring it meanwhile 1 dip into this starch paste a piece of paper hold it in the vapor of i and look for a change of color 2 pour a drop of the starch paste into a clean tt and add a drop or two of the solution of i in alcohol add 5 cc h2o note the color then boil and finally cool 3 the presence of starch in a potato or apple can be shown by putting a drop of i solution in alcohol on a slice of either and observing the color 4 try to dissolve a few crystals of i in 5 cc h2o by boiling if it does not disappear see whether any has dissolved by touching a drop of the water to starch paste this should show that i is slightly soluble in water 164 iodostarch paper experiment 101add to some starch paste that contains no i 5 cc of a solution of ki and stir the mixture why is it not colored blue dip into this several strips of paper dry them and save for use this paper is called iodostarch paper and is used as a test for ozone chlorine etc bring a piece of it in contact with the vapor of chlorine bromine or ozone and notice the blue color experiment 102add a few drops of chlorine water to 2cc of the starch and ki solution in 10 cc h2o this should show the same effect as the previous experiment 165 explanationonly free i not compounds of it will color starch blue it must first be set free from ki ozone chlorine etc have a strong affinity for k and when brought in contact with ki they unite with k and set free i which then acts on the starch present com plete the equation ki cl 166 occurrencethe ultimate source of i is sea water of which it constitutes far too small a percentage to be separated artificially seaweeds or algae especially those growing in the deep sea absorb its saltsnai ki etcfrom the water it thus forms a part of the plant and from this much of the i of commerce is obtained algae are collected in the spring on the coasts of ireland scotland and normandy where rough weather throws them up they are dried and finally burned or distilled the ashes are leached to dissolve i salts the water is nearly evaporated and the residue is treated with h2so4 and mno2 as in the case of br and cl i also occurs in chili as nai and naio3 mixed with nano3 this is an important source of the i supply 167 usesi is much used in medicine and was formerly employed in taking daguerreotypes and photographs its

combining with every element except o until recently it has never been isolated for as soon as set free from one compound it attacks the nearest substance and seems to be as much averse to combining

or with powdered charcoal explode violently this is owing to the ease with which it gives up 0 notice why its molecule is broken up more readily than hc103 the higher the molecular tower or the more atoms it contains the greater its liability to fall some organic compounds contain hundreds of atoms and hence are easily broken down or as we say are unstable inorganic compounds are as a rule much more stable than organic ones it is not always true however that the compound with the least number of atoms is the most stable so2 is more stable than so3 but h2so3 is less so than h2so4 chapter xxxiv vapor density and molecular weight examine a liter measure in the form of a cubecubic decimeter and a cubic centimeter 171 gaseous weights and volumesa liter of h at 0 degrees and 760 mm weighs nearly 009 g this weight is called a crith find the weight of h in the following in criths and in grams 15 1 007 1 503 1 0035 1 06 1 it has been estimated that there are 10 24 molecules of h in a liter does the number vary for different gases the weight of a molecule of h in parts of a crith is 110 24 in parts of a gram 0910 24 if the h molecule is composed of 2 atoms what is the weight of its atom in fractions of a crith what in fractions of a gram the weight of the h atom is a microcrith what part of a crith is a microcrith 172 vapor densityvapor density or specific gravity referred to h as the standard physics is the ratio of the weight of a given volume of a gas or vapor to the weight of the same volume of h a liter of steam weighs nine times as much as a liter of h its vapor density is therefore nine for convenience a definite volume of h is usually taken as the standard viz the h atom the volume of the h atom and that of the halfmolecule of h2o or of any gas are identical each being represented by one square if then the standard of vapor density is the h atom half the molecular weight of a gas must be its vapor density since it is evident that we thus compare the weights of equal volumes the vapor density of h2o steam is found from the symbol as follows 2 16 2 9 to obtain the vapor density of any compound from the formula we have only to divide its molecular weight by two find the vapor density of hcl n2o no c12h22o11 cl co2 hf so2 explain each case the halfmolecule instead of the whole is taken because our standard is the hydrogen atom the smallest portion of matter by weight known to science how many criths in a liter of hcl how many grams compute the number of criths and of grams in one liter of the compounds whose symbols appear above problems 1 a certain volume of h weighs 036 g at standard temperature and pressure how many liters does it contain if one liter weighs 009 g to weigh 036 g it will take 036 009 4 liters 2 how many liters or criths of h in 63 g 27 g 1 g 5 g 250 g explain each 3 suppose the gas to be twice as heavy as h how many liters in 036 g a liter of the gas will weigh 018 g 009 x 2 in 036 g there will be 036 018 2 answer the question for 63 g 27 g etc 4 how many liters of cl in each of the above numbers of grams 5 how many of hcl h2o steam co2 explain fully every case vapor density is very easily determined from the formula by the method given above but in practice the formula is obtained from the vapor density and hence the method there given has to be reversed 173 vapor density of oxygensuppose we were to obtain the vapor density of o we should carefully seal and weigh a given volume say a liter at a noted temperature and barometric pressure which are reducedto 0 degrees and 760 mm and compare it with the weight of the same volume of h this has been done repeatedly and o has been found to weigh 16 times as much as h volume for volume or more exactly 1596 now a liter of each gas has the same number of molecules therefore the o molecule weighs 16 times the h molecule the halfmolecule of each has the same proportion and the vapor density of o is 16 atomic weight is obtained in a very different way problems 1 a liter of cl is found to weigh 3195 g compute its vapor density and explain fully 2 a liter of hg vapor under standard conditions weighs 9 g find its vapor density and explain the vapor density of only a few elements has been satisfactorily determined see page 12 some cannot be vaporized others can be but only under conditions which prevent weighing them the vapor density of very many compounds also is unknown 3 a liter of co2 weighs 198 g find the vapor density and from that the molecular weight remembering that the latter is twice the former see whether it corresponds to that obtained from the formula co2 this isin fact the way a formula is ascertained if the atomic weights of its elements are known 4 a liter of a compound gas weighs 288 g analysis shows that its weight is half s and half o as the atomic weight of s is 32 and that of o is 16 what is the symbol for the gas solution its molecular weight is 64 ie 288009 x 2 of which 32 is s and 32 o the atomic weight of s is 32 hence there is one atom of s while of o there are two atoms the formula is so2 5 a liter of a compound gas which is found to contain 1 c and 3 o by weight weighs 126 g what is its formula atomic weights are taken from page 12 prove your answer 6 a liter of a compound of n and o weighs 198 g the n is 711 and the o 411 what is the gas 7 a compound of n and h gas weighs 0765 g to the liter the n is 1417 of the whole the h 317 what gas is it chapter xxxv atomic weight 174 definitionwe have seen that the molecular weight of a compound as well as of most elements is obtained from the vapor density by doubling the latter it remains to explain how atomic weights are obtained the term is rather misleading the atomic weight of an element is its least combining weight the smallest portion that enters into chemical union which is of course the weight of an atom 175 atomic weight of oxygensuppose we wish to find the atomic weight of oxygen we must find the smallest proportion by weight in which it occurs in any compound this can only be done by analyzing all the compounds of o that can be vaporized as illustrative of these compounds take the six following wt of other names v d mol wt wt of o elem symbol carbon monoxide 14 28 16 12 carbon dioxide 22 44 32 12 hydrogen monoxide 9 18 16 2 nitrogen monoxide 22 44 16 28 nitrogen trioxide 38 76 48 28 nitrogen pentoxide 54 108 80 28 176 molecular symbolsfrom the vapor density of the gases column 2we obtain their molecular weight column 3 to find the proportion of o it must be separated by chemical means from its compounds and separately weighed these relative weights are given in column 4 now the smallest weight of o which unites in any case is its atomic weight if any compound of o should in future be found in which its combining weight is 8 or 4 that would be called its atomic weight by dividing the numbers in column 4 wt of o by 16 the atomic weight of o we obtain the number of o atoms in the molecule subtracting the weights of o from the molecular weights we have the parts of the other elements column 5 and dividing these by the atomic weight of the respective elements we have the number of atoms of those elements these last combined with the number of o atoms give the symbol in this way complete the last column show how to get the atomic weight of cl from these compounds arranging them in tabular form and completing as above hcl kcl nacl zncl2 mgcl2 the atomic weight of n in these n2o no nh3 177 molecular and atomic volumeswe thus see that vapor density and atomic weight are obtained in two quite different ways in the case of elements the two are usually identical ie with the few whose vapor density is known but this is not always true and it leads to interesting conclusions regarding atomic volume in o both vapor density and atomic weight are 16 this gives 2 atoms of o to the molecule ie the molecular weight the atomic weight the size of an o atom is therefore half the gaseous molecule and is represented by one square s has a vapor density and an atomic weight of 32 each compute the number of atoms in the molecule compute for i in which the two are identical 127 p has an atomic weight of 31 while its vapor density is 62 its molecule must consist of 4 atoms each half the size of the h atom the vapor density of as is 150 the atomic weight 75 compute the number of atoms in its molecule and represent their relative size hg has an atomic weight of 200 a vapor density of 100 compute as before and compare the results with those on page 12 ozone has an atomic weight of 16 a vapor density 24 compute chapter xxxvi diffusion and condensation of gases 178 diffusion of gasesoxygen is 16 times as heavy as h if the two gases were mixed without combining in a confined space it might be supposed that o would settle to the bottom and h rise to the top this would in fact take place at first but only for an instant for all gases tend to diffuse or become intimately mixed the lighter the gas the more quickly it diffuses 179 law of diffusion of gasesthe diffusibility of gases varies inversely as the square roots of their vapor densities compare the diffusibility of h with that of o dif hdif o sqrt16 sqrt1 or dif h dif o 4 1 that is to say if h and o be set free from separate receivers in a room the h will become intermingled with the atmosphere four times as quickly as the o compare the diffusibility of o and n of cl and h take the atomic weights of these since they are the same as the vapor densities in case of a compound gas half the molecular weight must be taken for the vapor density eg dif n20 dif o sqrt16 sqrt22 180 causediffusion is due to molecular motion the lighter the gas the more rapid the vibration of its molecules compare the diffusibility of co2 and that of cl of hcl and so2 of hf and i 181 liquefaction and solidification of gaseswater boils at 100 degrees under standard pressure though evaporating at all temperatures it vaporizes at a lower point if the pressure be less as on a mountain and at a higher temperature if the pressure be greater as at points below the sea level alcohol boils at 78 degrees standard pressure and every liquid has a point of temperature and pressure above which it must pass into the gaseous state likewise every gas has a critical temperature above which it cannot be liquefied at any pressure this condition was not recognized formerly and before 1877 o h n c4 co no etc had not been liquefied though put under a pressure of more than 2000 atmospheres they were called permanent gases in 1877 cailletet and pictet liquefied and solidified these and others the lowest temperature about 225 degrees was produced by suddenly releasing the pressure from solid n to 4mm which caused it rapidly to evaporate evaporation especially under diminished pressure always lowers the temperature by withdrawing heat these low degrees are indicated by a h thermometer or if too low for that by a thermoelectric couple of copper and german silver the pupil can easily liquefy so by passing it through a utube which is surrounded by a mixture of ice and salt in a large receiver at the meeting of the american association for the advancement of science in 1887 a solid brick of co2 was seen and handled by the members liquid h is steel blue a few results obtained under a pressure of one atmosphere are boiling points c2h4102 degrees ch4184 degrees o181 degrees n 194 degrees co190 degrees no154 degrees air 191 degrees solidifying points cl 102 degrees hcl 115 degrees ether 129 degrees alcohol 130 degrees chapter xxxvii sulphur examine brimstone flowers of sulphur pyrite chalcopyrite sphalerite galenite gypsum barite 182 separation experiment 103to a solution of 2 g of sodium sulphide na2s2 in 10 cc h2o add 3 or 4cc hcl and look for a ppt filter and examine the residue it is lac sulphur or milk of sulphur 183 crystals from fusion experiment 104in a beaker of 25 or 50 cc capacity put 20 g brimstone place this over a flame with asbestos paper interposed and melt it slowly note the color of the liquid then let it cool watching for crystals when partly solidified pour the liquid portion into an evapo ratingdish of water and observe the crystals of s forming in the beaker fig 42 the hard mass may be separated from the glass by a little hno3 and a thin knifeblade or by cs2 184 allotropy experiment 105place in a tt 15g of brimstone then heat slowly till it melts notice the thin ambercolored liquid the temperature is now a little above 100 degrees as the heat increases notice that it grows darker till it becomes black and so viscid that it cannot be poured out it is now above 200 degrees still heat and observe that it changes to a slightly lighter color and is again a thin liquid at this time it is above 300 degrees now pour a little into an evaporating dish containing water examine this noticing that it can be stretched like rubber leave it in the water till it becomes hard continue heating thebrimstone in the tt till it boils at about 450 degrees and note the color of the escaping vapor just above this point it takes fire cool the tt holding it in the light meantime and look for a sublimate of s on the sides 185 solution experiment 106place in an evaporatingdish a gram of powdered brimstone and add 5cc cs2 carbon disulphide stir and see whether s is dissolved put this in a draft of air and note the evaporation of the liquid cs2 and the deposit of s crystals these crystals are different in form from those resulting from cooling from fusion 186 theory of allotropythe last three experiments well illustrate allotropy we found s to crystallize in two different ways substances can crystallize in seven different systems and usually a given substance is found in one of these systems only eg galena is invariably cubical an element having two such forms is said to be dimorphous if it crystallizes in three systems it is trimorphous a crystal has a definite arrangement of its molecules if without crystalline form a substance is called amorphous an illustration of amorphism was s after it had been poured into water thus s has at least three allotropic forms and the gradations between these probably represent others allotropy seems to be due to varied molecular structure we know but little of the molecular condition of solids and liquids since we have no law to guide us like avogadros in gases but from the density of s vapor at different temperatures we infer that liquids and solids have their molecules very differently made up from those of gases the least combining weight of s is 32 its vapor density at 1000 degrees is 32 hence its molecular weight is 64 ie vapor density x 2 and there are 2 atoms in its molecule at that temperature molecular weight atomic weight at 500 degrees however the vapor density is 96and the molecular weight 192 at this degree the molecule must contain 6 atoms how many it has in the allotropic forms as a solid is beyond our knowledge but it seems quite likely that allotropy is due to some change of molecular structure the above experiments show two modes of obtaining crystals by fusion and by solution 187 occurrence and purificationsulphur occurs both free and combined and is a very common element it is found free in all volcanic regions but sicily furnishes most of it great quantities are thrown up from the interior of the earth during an eruption the heat of volcanic action probably separates it from its compound which may be caso4 vast quantities of the poisonous so2 gas are also liberated during an eruption this being in volume of gases evolved next to h2o s is crudely separated from its earthy impurities in sicily by piling it into heaps covering to prevent access of air and igniting when some of the s burns and the rest melts and is collected after removal from the island it is further purified by distilling in retorts connected with large chambers where it sublimes on the sides as flowers of sulphur fig 43 this is melted and run into molds forming roll brimstone s also occurs as a constituent of animal and vegetable compounds as in mustard hair eggs etc the tarnishing of silver spoons by eggs is due to the formation of silver sulphide ag2s the yellow color of eggs however is due to oils not to s the main compounds of s are sulphides and sulphates what acids do they respectively represent metallic sulphides are as common as oxides eg fes2 or pyrite pbs or galenite zns or sphalerite cufes2 or chalcopyrite etc the most abundant sulphate is caso4 or gypsum baso4 or barite and na2so4 or glaubers salt are others the only one of these compounds that is utilized for its s is fes2 in europe this furnishes a great deal of the s for h2so4 s is obtained by roasting fes2 3 fes2 fe3s4 2 s 188 uses the greatest use of s is in the manufacture of h2so4 a great deal is used in making gunpowder matches vulcanized rubber and the artificial sulphides like hgs h2s cs2 etc the last is a very volatile ill smelling liquid made by the combination of two solids s being passed over redhot charcoal it dissolves s p rubber gums and many other substances insoluble in h2o 189 sulphur dioxide so2 has been made in many experiments it is a bleaching agent a disinfectant and a very active compound having great affinity for water but it will not support combustion like most disinfectants it is very injurious to the system it is used to bleach silk and woolanimal substances and straw goods which cl would injure but the color can be restored as the coloring molecule seems not to be broken up but to combine with so2 which is again separated by reagents goods bleached with so2 often turn yellow after a time 190 so2 a bleacher experiment 107test its bleaching power by burning s under a receiver under which a wet rose or a green leaf is also placed chapter xxxviii hydrogen sulphide examine ferrous sulphide natural and artificial 191 preparation experiment 108put a gram of ferrous sulphide fes into a tt fitted with a dt as in figure 32 add 10cc h2o and 5cc h2so4 h2s is formed write the equation omitting h2o what is left in solution 192 tests experiment 1091 take the odor of the escaping gas 2 pour into a tt 5ccsolution agno3 and place the end of the dt from a h2s generator into the solution and note the color of the ppt what is the ppt write the equation 3 experiment in the same way with pbno32 solution write the equation 4 let some h2s bubble into a tt of clean water to see whether h2s is soluble in h2o put a few drops of the water on a silver coin ag2s is formed describe and write the equation do the same with a copper coin 5 put a drop of lead acetate solution pbc2h3o22 on a piece of unglazed paper and hold this before the dt from which h2s is escap ing pbs is formed write the equation this is the characteristic test of h2s 193 combustion of h2s experiment 110attach a philosophers lamp tube to the h2s generator and observing the same precautions as with h light the gas what two products must be formed state the reaction the color of the flame compute the molecular weight and the vapor density of h2s 194 uses hydrogen sulphide or sulphuretted hydrogen h2s is employed chiefly as a reagent in the chemical laboratory it forms sulphides with many of the metals as shown in the last experiment these are precipitated from solution and may be separated from other metals which are not so precipitated as was found in the case of hcl and nh4oh the subjoined experiment will illustrate this suppose we wished to separate pb from ba having salts of the two mixed together as pbno32 and bano32 195 h2s an analyzer of metals experiment 111pass some h2s gas in to 5ccsolution bano32 no ppt is formed do the same with pbno32 solution a ppt appears now mix 5ccof each of these solutions in a tt and pass the gas from a h2s generator into the liquid what is precipitated and what is unchanged when fully saturated with the gas as indicated by the smell filter which metal is on the filter and which is in the filtrate other reagents as na2co3 solution would precipitate the latter 196 occurrence and properties h2s is an illsmell ing poisonous gas formed in sewers rotten eggs and other decaying albuminous matter it is formed in the earth probably from the action of water on sulphides and issues with water from sulphur springs a characteristic property is the formation of metallic sulphides as above a skipper one night anchored his newly painted vessel near the boston gashouse where the refuse was deposited with its escaping h2s in the morning to his consternation the craft was found to be black h2s had come in contact with the lead in the white paint forming black pbs this gradually oxidized after reaching the open sea and the white color reappeared chapter xxxix phosphorus notephosphorus should be kept in water and handled with forceps never with the fingers except under water as it is liable to burn the flesh and produce ulcerating sores pieces not larger than half a pea should be used and every bit should finally be burned 197 solution and combustion experiment 112 put 1 or 2 pieces of p into an evaporating dish and pour over them 5 or 10cccs2 carbon disulphide this will be enough for a class when dissolved dip pieces of unglazed paper into it and hold these in the air looking for any combustion as they dry the p is finely divided in solution which accounts for its more ready combustion then notice that the paper is not destroyed this is an example of socalled spontaneous combustion the burning point of p the combustible in air the supporter is about 60 degrees 198 combustion under water experiment 113 put a piece of p in a tt which rests in a receiver add a few crystals kclo3 and 5cc h2o now pour in through a thistletube 1ccor more of h2so4 look for any flame h2so4 acts very strongly on kclo3 what is set free from this fact explain the combustion in water 199 occurrencep is very widely disseminated but not abundant and is found only in compounds the chief of which is calcium phosphate ca3po42 it occurs in granite and other rocks as the mineral apatite in soils in plants particularly in seeds and grains and in the bones brains etc of vertebrates from the human system it is excreted by the kidneys as microcosmic salt hnanh4po4 and when the brain is hard worked more than usual is excreted hence brainworkers have been said to burn phosphorus 200 sourcesrocks are the ultimate source of this element these by the action of heat rain and frost are disintegrated and go to make soils the rootlets of plants are sent through the soil and among other things soluble phosphates in the earth are absorbed circulated by the sap and selected by the various tissues animals feed on plants and the phosphates are circulated through the blood and deposited in the osseous tissue or wherever needed human bones contain nearly 60 per cent of ca3po42 those of some birds over 80 per cent the main sources of phosphates and p are the phosphate beds of south carolina the apatite beds of canada and the bones of animals 201 preparation of phosphates and phosphorusbone ash obtained by burning or distilling bones and grinding the residue is treated with h1so4 and forms soluble h4capo42 superphosphate of lime and insoluble caso4 ca3po42 2 h2so4 h4capo042 2 caso4 this completes the process for fertilizers if p is desired the above is filtered charcoal a reducing agent is added to the filtrate the substance is evaporated then very strongly heated and distilled in retorts the necks of which dip under water it is then purified from any uncombined c by melting in hot water and passing into molds in cold water the work is very dangerous and injurious on account of the low burningpoint of p and its poisonous properties while its compounds are necessary to human life p itself destroys the bones particularly the jaw bones of the workers in it between 1000 and 2000 tons are made yearly mostly for matches but almost all at two factories one in england and one in france 202 propertiesp is a colorless transparent solid when pure the impure article is yellowish translucent and waxy it is insoluble in water slightly soluble in alcohol and ether and it readily dissolves in cs2 oil of turpentine etc fumes having a garlic odor rise when it is exposed to the air and in the dark it is phosphorescent emitting a greenish light 203 uses the uses of this element and its compounds are for fertilizers matches vermin poisons and chemical operations 204 matchesthe use of p for matches depends on its low burningpoint prepared wood is dipped into melted s and the end is then pressed against a stone slab having on it a paste of p kclo3 and glue kno3 is often used instead of kclo3 in either case the object is to furnish o to burn p matches containing kclo3 snap on being scratched while those having kno3 burn quietly the friction from scratching a match generates heat enough to ignite the p that enough to set the s on fire and the s enough to burn the wood give the reaction for each paraffine is much used instead of s safety matches have no p and must be scratched on a surface of red p and sb2s3 or on glass 205 red phosphorustwo or three allotropic forms of p are known the principal one being red if heated between 230 degrees and 260 degrees away from air the yellow variety changes to red which can be kept at all temperatures below 260 degrees above that it changes back red p is not poisonous ignites only at a high temperature and is not phosphorescent like the yellow 206 spontaneous combustion of phosphene or hydrogen phosphide ph3 experiment 114put into a 20ccflask 1 g p and 50ccsaturated solution naoh or koh connect with the pt by a long dt as in figure 44 the end of which must be kept under water pour 3 or 4ccof ether into the flask to drive out the air it is necessary to exclude all air as a dangerously explosive mixture is formed with it heat the mixture and as the gas passes over and into the air it takes fire spontaneously and rings of smoke successively rise it will do no harm if on taking away the lamp the water is drawn back into the flask but in that case the flask should be slightly lifted to prevent breakage by the sudden rush of water on no account let the air be drawn over the experiment has no practical value but is an interesting illustration of the spontaneous combustion of ph3 and of vortex rings what are the products of the combustion an admixture of another compound of p and h causes the combustion chapter xl arsenic examine metallic arsenic realgar orpiment arsenopyrite arsenic trioxide copper arsenite the compounds of arsenic are very poisonous if taken into the system and must be handled with care 207 separation experiment 115draw out into two parts in the bunsen flame a piece of glass tubing 20cm long and 1 or 2cm in diameter into the end of one of the ignition tubes thus formed when it is cool put onefourth of a gram of arsenic trioxide as2o3 using paper to transfer it now put into the tube a

granulated zn water and hcl test the purity of the escaping gas experiment 23 and when pure light the jet of h h is now burning in air to be sure that there is no as in the ingredients used hold the inside of a porcelain evaporatingdish directly against the flame for a minute if no silverywhite mirror is found the chemicals are free from as then pour through the thistletube while the lamp is still burning 1ccsolution of as2o3 in hcl or h2o a bit of as2o3 not larger than a grain of wheat in 10 cc hcl see whether the color of the flame changes then hold the evaporatingdish once more in the flame and notice a metallic deposit of as set away the apparatus under the hood and leave the light burning this experiment must not be performed unless all the cautions are observed since the gas in the flask ash3 is the most poisonous known and a single bubble of it inhaled is said to have killed the discoverer by confining the gas inside the flask there is no danger instead of using as2o3 solution a little paris green wall paper suspected of containing arsenic green silk or green paper labels etc may be soaked in hcl and tested 209 explanationthe chemical changes are as follows the compounds of as in this case as2o3 in presence of nascent h are immediately converted into the deadly hydrogen arsenide arsine arseniuretted hydrogen ash3 as2o3 12 h 2 ash3 3 h2o the ash3 mixed with excess of h tends to escape and is burned to as2o3 and h2o and thus is rendered comparatively harmless as it passes into the air this is why the flame must be burning when the arsenic compound is introduced 2 ash3 6 o as2o3 3 h2o in the combustion of ash3 h burns at a lower point than as the introduction of a cold body like porcelain cools the flame below the kindlingpoint of as and this is deposited while h burns in exactly the same way as lamp black was collected in experiment 26 210 expert analysisa modification of this experiment is employed by experts to test for as2o3 poisoning the organs stomach or liverare cut into small pieces dissolved by nascent cl or hclo made from kc1o3 and hcl and the solution is introduced into a h generator as above as2o3 preserves the tissues it comes in contact with for a long time and the test can be made years after death all the chemicals must be pure since as is found in small quantities in most ores and the zn hcl and h2so4 of commerce are very likely to contain it the above is called marshs test and is so delicate that a mere trace of arsenic can be detected 211 properties and occurrenceas is a grayish white solid of metallic luster while a few of its characters are nonmetallic it is very widely distributed being sometimes found native and sometimes combined as ass realgar as2s8 orpiment and feass arsenopyrite its chief source is the last the fine powder of which is strongly heated when as separates and sublimes it has the odor of garlic as may be observed by heating a little on charcoal with the blowpipe 212 atomic volumeas

as must be onefourth of this size represented by half of one square of what other element is this true 213 uses of as2o3arsenic is used in shotmanufacture for hardening the metal its most important compound is as2o3 arsenic trioxide called also arsenious anhydride arsenious acid white arsenic etc so poisonous is this that enough could be piled on a onecent piece to kill a dozen persons taken in too large quantities it acts as an emetic the antidote is ferric hydrate fe2oh6 and a mustard emetic followed by oil or milk the vapor density of this compound shows that its symbol should be as4o6 but the improper one as2o3 is likely to remain in use another oxide as2o5 arsenic pentoxide exists but is less important show how the respective acid formulae are obtained from these anhydrides see page 50 as2o3 is used in making paris green in many green coloring materials in which it exists as copper arsenite in coloring wall papers and in fly and rat poisons it is employed for preserving skins etc fashionable women sometimes eat it for the purpose of beautifying the complexion to which it imparts a ghastly white unhealthy hue mountaineers in some parts of europe eat it for the greater power of endurance which it is supposed to give them by beginning with small doses these arseniceaters finally consume a considerable quantity of the poison with apparent impunity but as soon as the habit is stopped all the pangs of arsenicpoisoning set in wall paper containing arsenic is said to be injurious to some people while apparently harmless to others chapter xli silicon silica and silicates 214 comparison of si and cthe element si resembles carbon in valence and in allotropic forms it occurs in three forms like c a diamond form a graphite and an amorphous c forms the basis of the vegetable and animal world si of the mineral most soils and rocks except limestone are mainly compounds of o si and metals while o is estimated to make up nearly one half of the known crust of the earth si constitutes fully a third the two are usually combined as silica sio2 or silicates sio2 combined with metallic oxides this affinity for o is so strong that si is not found uncombined and is separated with great difficulty and only at the highest temperatures no special use has yet been found for it except as an alloy with al its compounds are very important 215 silicaexamine some specimens of quartz rock crystal white and colored sands agate jasper flint etc test their hardness with a knife blade and see whether they will scratch glass notice that quartz crystals are hexagonal or sixsided prisms terminated by hexagonal pyramids the coloring matters are impurities often fe and mn if red or brown when pure quartz is transparent as glass infusible except in the oxy hydrogen blow pipe and harder than glass rock crystal is massive si02 sand is generally either silica or silicates the common variety of si02 is not soluble in water or in acids except hf an amorphous variety is to some extent soluble in water most geysers deposit the latter in successive layers about their mouths agate chalcedony and opal have probably an origin similar to this a solution of this variety of sio2 forms a jellylike masscolloidwhich will not diffuse through a membrane of parchment dialyzerwhen suspended in water crystalloids will diffuse through such a membrane if they are in solution this principle forms the basis of dialysis all substances are supposed to be either crystalloids ie susceptible of crystallization or colloidsjellylike masses hcl is the most diffusible in liquids of all known substances caramel is one of the least so to separate the two they would be put into a dialyzer suspended in water when hcl will diffuse through into the water and caramel will remain as2o3

cassius gives purple mno2 is used to correct the green tint caused by feo which it is supposed to oxidize opacity or enamel as in lampshades is produced by adding as2o3 sb2o3 sno2 cryolite etc the glass worker dips his blowpipea hollow iron rod five or six feet longinto the fused mass of glass removes a small portion rolls it on a smooth surface swings it round in the air blowing meanwhile through the rod and thus fashions it as desired into bottles flasks etc for some wares eg common goblets the glass is run into molds and stamped for others it is blown and welded all glass must be annealed ie cooled slowly for several days the molecules thus arrange themselves naturally if not annealed it breaks very easily it may be greatly toughened by dipping when nearly redhot into hot oil cut glass is prepared at great expense by subsequent grinding glass may be rendered semiopaque by etching either with hf or with a blast of sand 220 importancefew manufactured articles have more importance than glass without it the sciences of chemistry physics astronomy microscopic anatomy zoology and botany not to mention its domestic uses would be almost impossible 221 porcelain and potterygenuine porcelain and chinaware are made of a fine clay kaolin which results from the disintegration of feldspathic rocks bricks are baked clay the feo in common clay is oxidized to fe2o3 on heating a process which gives their red color some clay having no fe is white this is used for firebricks and clay pipes that containing fe is too fusible for fireclay which must also have much sio2 the electric arc however will melt even this and the most refractory vessels are of calcium oxide or of graphite pottery is clay molded baked and either glazed like crockery or unglazed like flowerpots jugs and coarse earthenware are glazed by volatilizing nacl in an oven which holds the porous material this coats the ware with sodium silicate to glaze china it is dipped into a powder of feldspar and sio2 suspended in water and vinegar and then fused if the ware and glaze expand uniformly with heat the latter does not crack chapter xliii metals and their alloys 222 comparison of metals and nonmetalsthe majority of elements are metals only about a dozen being nonmetallic in their properties the division line between the two classes is not very well defined eg as has certain properties which ally it to metals it has other properties which are nonmetallic h occupies a place between the two classes the following are the more marked characteristics of each group metals 1 metals are solid at ordinary temperatures and usually of high specific gravity exceptions hg is liquid above 395 degees li is the lightest solid known na and k will float on water 2 metals reflect light in a way peculiar to themselves they have what is called a metallic luster 3 they are white or gray exceptions au ca sr are yellow cu is red 4 in general they conduct heat and electricity well nonmetals 1 nonmetals are either gaseous or solid at ordinary temperatures and of low specific gravity exceptions br is a liquid i has the heaviest known vapor 2 nonmetallic solids have different lusters as glassy resinous silky etc exceptions i b and c have metallic luster 3 nonmetals have no characteristic color 4 they are nonconductors of heat and electricity exceptions c and some others are conductors 5 they are usually malleable and ductile 6 they form alloys or chemical mixtures with one another similar to other solutions exceptions some as ph and zn will not alloy with one another 7 metals are electropositive elements and unite with o and h to form bases exceptions some of the less electropositive metals with a large quantity of o form acids as cr as etc numbers 2 6 and 7 are the most characteristic and important properties 5 they are deficient in malleability and ductility 6 they often form liquid solutions similar to alloys in metals 7 nonmetals are electronegative and with h or with h and o form acids examine brass bronze bellmetal pewter german silver solder typemetal 223 alloysan alloy is not usually a definite chemical compound but rather a mixture of two or more metals which are melted together one metal may be said to dissolve in the other as sugar dissolves in water the alloy has however different properties from those of its elements for example plumbers solder melts at a lower temperature than either ph or sn of which it is composed some metals can alloy in any proportions solder may have two parts of sn to one of pb two of pb to one of sn or equal parts of each or the two elements may alloy in other proportions not all metals can be thus fused together indefinitely eg zn and pb nickel and silver coins are alloyed with cu gold coins with cu and ag gunmetal bellmetal and speculummetal are each alloys of cu and sn speculummetal used for reflectors in telescopes has relatively more sn than either of the others gunmetal has the least an alloy of sb and pb is employed for typemetal as it expands at the instant of solidification pewter is composed of sn and pb brass of cu and zn german silver of brass and ni bronze of cu sn and zn aluminium bronze of cu and al 224 low fusibility is a feature of many alloys woods metal composed of pb eight parts bi fifteen sn four cd three melts at just above 60 degrees or far below the boilingpoint of water by varying the proportions different fusingpoints are obtained this principle is applied in automatic fire alarms and in safety plugs for boilers and fire extinguishers water pipes extend along the ceiling of a building and are fitted with plugs of some fusible alloy at short distances apart when in case of fire the heat becomes sufficiently intense these plugs melt and the water flows out 225 amalgamsan amalgam is an alloy of hg and another metal mirrors are silvered with an amalgam of sn tinfoil is spread on a smooth surface and covered with hg and the glass is pressed thereon various amalgams are employed for filling teeth a common one being composed of hg ag and sn au or ag with hg forms an amalgam used for plating articles of gold and silver should never be brought in contact with hg if a thin amalgam cover the surface of a gold ring or coin hg can be removed with hno3 as au is not attacked by it would this acid do in case of silver amalgam heat will also quickly cause hg to evaporate from au chapter xliv sodium and its compounds examine nacl na2so4 na2co3 na naoh hnaco3 nano3 226 order of derivationthough k is more metallic or electro positive than na the compounds of na are more important and will be considered first the only two compounds of na which occur extensively in nature are nacl and nano3 almost all others are obtained from nacl

preparation of naclnacl occurs in sea water of which it constitutes about three per cent in salt lakes whose waters sometimes hold thirty per cent or are nearly saturated and as rock salt in large masses underground poland has a salt area of 10000 square miles in some parts of which the pure transparent rock salt is a quarter of a mile thick in spain there is a mountain of salt five hundred feet high and three miles in circumference france obtains much salt from sea water at high tide it flows into shallow basins from which the sun evaporates the water leaving nacl to crystallize in norway it is separated by freezing water and in poland it is mined like coal in new york and michigan it is obtained by evaporating the brine of salt wells either by air and the suns heat or by fire slow evaporation gives large crystals rapid small ones 228 usesthe main uses are for domestic purposes and for making the na and cl compounds in the united states the consumption amounts to more than forty pounds per year for every person 229 sodium sulphatewhat acid and what base are represented by na2so4 which is the stronger acid hcl or h2so4 would the latter be apt to act on nacl why 230 manufacturethis comprises two stages shown by the following reactions in which the first needs moderate heat only the last much greater 1 2 nacl h2so4 hnaso4 nacl hcl 2 nacl hnaso4 na2s4 hcl the operation is carried on in large furnaces the gaseous hcl is passed into towers containing falling water in a fine spray for which it has great affinity the solution is drawn off at the base of the tower thus all commercial hcl is made as a by product in manufacturing na2so4 when crystalline sodium sulphate has ten molecules of water of crystallization na2so4 10 h2o it is then known as glaubers salt this salt readily effloresces ie loses its water of crystallization and is reduced to a powder compute the percentage of water 231 usesthe leading use of na2so4 is to make na2co3 it is also used to some extent in medicine and in glass manufacture 232 sodium carbonatenote the base and the acid which this salt represents test a solution of the salt with red and blue litmus and notice the alkaline reaction do you see any reason for this reaction in the strong base and the weak acid represented by the salt 233 manufacturena2co3 is not made by the union of an acid and a base nor is h2co3 strong enough to act on many salts the process must be indirect this consists in reducing na2so to na2s by taking away the o with c charcoal and then changing na2s to na2o3 by caco3 limestone the three substances na2so4 c caco3 are mixed together and strongly heated the reactions should be carefully studied as the process is one of much importance 1 na2so4 4 c na2s 4 co 2 na2s caco3 cas na2co3 observe that c is the reducing agent the gas co escapes the solid products na2co3 and cas form black ash the former being very soluble the latter only sparingly soluble in water na2co3 is dissolved out by water and the water is evaporated this gives commercial soda cas the waste compound in the process contains the s originally in the h2so4 used this can be partially separated and again made into acid describe the manufacture of naco3 in full starting with nacl this is called the le blanc process but is not the only one now employed to produce this important article 234 occurrencesodium carbonate is found native in small quantities it forms the chief surface deposit of the alkali belt in western united states where it often forms incrustations from an inch to a foot in thickness it was formerly obtained from seaweeds by leaching their ashes as by a like process k2co3 was obtained from land plants 235 usesna2co3 forms the basis of many alkalies as h2so4 does of acids of all chemical compounds it is one of the most important and its manufacture constitutes one of the greatest chemical industries its economical manufacture largely depends on the demand for hcl which is always formed as a byproduct as but little hcl is used in this country na2co3 is mostly manufactured in europe the chief uses are for glass and alkalies 236 sodiumna must always be kept under naphtha or some other liquid compound containing no o since it oxidizes at once on exposure to the air for this reason it never occurs in a free state 237 preparationby depriving na2co3 of c and o metallic

and plaster lime is the most useful of the bases 252 hard waterreview experiment 76 the solubility of caco3 in water that contains co2 leads to important results much dissolves in the waters of all limestone countries and the water though perfectly transparent is hard ie soap has little action on it see page 187 such water may be softened by boiling a deposit of caco3 being formed as a crust on the kettle such water is called water of temporary hardness mgco3 produces a similar effect and water containing it is softened in the same way permanently hard waters contain the sulphates of ca and mg which cannot be removed by boiling but may be by adding nh42co3 253 the formation of caves in limestone rocks is due also to the solubility of caco3 water collects on the mountains and trickles down through crevices dissolving if it contains co2 some of the caco3 and thus making a wider opening and forcing its way along fissures and lines of least resistance into the interior of the earth or out at the base of the mountain its channel widens as it dissolves the rock and the stream enlarges until in the course of ages an immense cavern may be formed with labyrinths extending for miles from the entrance of which a river often issues in the long ages which elapsed during the slow formation of mammoth cave its denizens lost many of the characters of their ancestors and eyeless fish and also eyeless insects now abound there 254 reverse actiondrops of water on the roofs of these caverns lose their co2 and deposit caco3 thus long pendant masses of limestone called stalactites are slowly formed on the roofs like icicles from these water charged with caco3 drops to the bottom loses co2 and deposits caco3 which forms an upward growing mass called stalagmite in time it may meet the stalactite and form a pillar notice that the same action which formed the cave is filling it up ie the solubility of caco3 in water charged with co2 255 famous marblesthe marble from carrara italy

water and is reduced to a powder plaster of paris this on being mixed with water again takes up 2 h2o and hardens or sets without crystallizing if once more heated to expel water it will not again absorb it when plaster of paris sets it expands slightly and on this account is admirable for taking casts 257 usesgypsum finds use as a fertilizer and as an adulterant in coloringmaterials etc caso4

the reducing action of strongly heated k or na al2cl6 6 na 6 nacl 2 al what is the chief use of na as it takes three pounds of na to make one pound of al the cost of the latter has been fifteen dollars or more per pound its use has thus been restricted to light apparatus and aluminium bronze an alloy of cu 90 al 10 which is not unlike gold in appearance al2o3 has lately been reduced by c

top of the furnace burning there to co2 only alloys of al have yet been obtained by this process this method has not been employed before simply because the highest temperatures of combustion 2000

occurs mostly in europe the reduction of these ores as well as of other metallic oxides consists in removing o by c at a high tempera ture as ordinarily classified there are three kinds of ironpig or

reduced in a blast furnace fig 47 in some cases eighty or one hundred feet high and having a capacity of about 12000 cubic feet the reducing agent is either charcoal anthracite coal or cokebituminous coal being too impure charcoal is the best agent and is used in preparing swedish iron but it is too expensive for general use fig 47 blast furnace f entrance of tuyeres or blastpipes e f hottest part

complete fe3o4 4 c fe3o4 2c much earthy materialganguecontaining silica and silicates is always found with iron ores these are infusible and something must be added to render them fusible cao forms with sio2 just the flux needed see page 132 ca0 si02 which of these is the basic and which the acidic compound cao results from heating caco3 hence the latter is employed instead of the former in what case would si02 be used as the flux into the blast furnace are put in alternate layers the fuel the flux and the ore the fire once kindled is kept burning for months or years hot air is driven in through the tuyeres tweers o unites with c of the fuel forming co2 and co the c also reduces the ore fe2o3 3 c co accomplishes the same thing 3 co fe2o3 the intense heat fuses cao and sio2 to a silicate which with other impurities forms a slag this rising to the surface of the molten mass is drawn off the iron is melted falls in drops to the bottom and is drawn off into sand molds see figure 47 this is pigiron it contains as impurities c si s p mn etc if too much s or p is present in an ore it is worthless this is why the abundant mineral fes2 cannot be used as a source of iron from the top of the furnace n co co2 h2o etc escape these gases are used to heat the air which is forced through the tuyeres and to make steam in boilers 267 steelthe manufacture of steel and wroughtiron consists in removing most of the impurities from pigiron it will be seen that the most common compounds of c s si and p are their oxides and these are for the most part gases hence these elements are removed by oxidation bessemer steel is prepared by melting pigiron and blowing hot air through it a converter fig 48 lined with siliceous sand and holding several tons is partially filled with the molten metal blasts of hot air are driven into it and the c and other impurities together with a little of the fe are oxidized the exact moment when the process has gone far enough and most of the impurities have been removed is indicated by the appearance of the escaping flame it usually takes from five to ten minutes the blast is then stopped and the metal has about the composition of wroughtiron it contains some uncombined o a white pigiron spiegeleisen which contains a known quantity of c and of mn is at once added mn removes part of the extra o and though it remains does not injure the metal the c is dissolved by the fe which is then run into molds ingots this process the bessemer invented in 1856 has revolutionized steel manufacture no less than ten tons of iron have been converted into steel in five minutes in a single converter 268 wroughtironthe chemical principle involved in making wroughtiron is the same as that in making steel but the process is different impurities are burned out from pigiron in an open reverberatory furnace by constantly stirring the metal in contact with air this is called puddling a reverberatory furnace is one in which the fuel is in one compartment and the heat is reflected downward into another that holds the substance to be acted upon fig 49 steel may also be made by carburizing wroughtiron iron and charcoal are packed together and heated for days without melting when it is found that in some unknown way solid c has penetrated solid fe the finer kinds of steel are made in this way but they are very expensive wroughtiron may also be made directly from the ore in an open hearth furnace with charcoal this was the original mode 269 propertiesthe varying properties of pigiron steel and wroughtiron are due in part to the proportion of c and of other elements present either as mixtures or as compounds and in part to other causes not well understood wroughtiron is fibrous as though composed of fine wires and hence is ductile malleable tough and soft and cannot be hardened or tempered but it is easily welded pigiron is crystalline and so is not ductile or malleable it is hard and brittle and cannot be welded on account of its low meltingpoint it is generally employed for castings steel is crystalline in structure and when suddenly cooled from red heat by plunging into cold water becomes hard and brittle the tempering can be varied by afterwards heating to any required degree indicated by the color of the oxide formed on the exterior the higher temperatures give the softer steel 270 salts of ironexamine feso4 fes fes2 fe has a valence of 2 or 4 this gives rise to two kinds of salts ferrous and ferric as in fecl2 and fe2cl6 the valence of fe in ferric salts is 4 ferrous sulphate is feso4 ferric sulphate fe2so43 write the symbols for ferrous and ferric hydrate for the oxides for the nitrates write the graphic symbols for each 271 colorsthe characteristic color of ferrous salts is green as in feso4 these salts give the green color to the chlorophyll in leaves and grass and bottle glass owes its green color to ferrous silicate ferric salts are a brownish red as shown in hematite and limonite and in some bottles red sandstone and most soils and earths are illustrations of this coloring action the blood of vertebrates owes its color to ferric salts bricks are made from a greenish blue clay in which iron exists in the ferrous state on being heated ferrous salts are oxidized to ferric and their color is changed to red iron rust is hydrated ferric oxide fe2o3 and fe2oh6 272 change of valence experiment 122dissolve 2 g of iron filings in diluted hcl filter or pour off the clear liquid divide it into two parts and add nh4oh to one part till a ppt occurs notice the greenish color of feoh2 oxidize the other part by adding a few drops of hno3 and boiling a minute now add nh4oh and observe the reddish color of the ppt fe2oh6 solutions of ferrous salts will gradually change to ferric if allowed to stand thus showing the greater stability of the latter in changing from fecl2 to fe2cl6 oxidation does not consist in adding o but in increasing the negative element or radical this is possible only by changing the valence of fe from 2 to 4 hence oxidation in its larger sense means increasing the valence of the positive element to oxidize feso4 is to make it fe2so43 changing the valence of fe as before reduction or deoxidation diminishes the valence of the positive element illustrate this by the same iron salts illustrate it by pbo and pb02 aucl and aucl3 sb2s3 and sb2s5

much employed in electroplating and somewhat in coloring glass chapter liii chemistry of rocks 288 classificationrocks may be divided according to their origin into three classes 1 aqueous rocks these have been formed by deposition of sedimentary material layer by layer on the bottoms of ancient oceans lakes and rivers from which they have gradually been raised to form dry land 2 eruptive or volcanic rocks these have been forced as hot fluids through rents and fissures from the interior of the earth 3 metamorphic rocks these by the combined action of heat pressure water and chemical agents have been crystallized and chemically altered the rocks of the first class such as chalk limestone shale and sandstone are distinguished by the existence of fossils in them or by the successive layers of the material which goes to make up their structure and to give them a stratified appearance the rocks of the second class are recognized by their resemblance to the products of modern volcanoes and their nonstratified appearance rocks of the third class are composed of crystals which though often very minute are minerals having a definite chemical composition examples of the third class are gneiss slate schist and marble the last two classes abound on the eastern seaboard while the interior of our continent is composed almost exclusively of stratified sedimentary rocks 289 compositionrocks are not definite compounds but variable mixtures of minerals some however are tolerably pure as limestone caco3 and sandstone granite is mainly made up of three mineralsquartz feldspar and mica quartz when pure is sio2 feldspar is a mixed silicate of k and al and often several other metals k2al2si6o16 k2o al2o3 6 sio2 symbolizing one variety while a variety of mica is h8mg5fe7al2si3o18 the pupil should learn to distinguish the different minerals in granite quartz is glassy mica is in scales usually white or black and feldspar is the opaque white or red mineral 290 importance of siliceous rocksslate and schist are also mixed silicates pure sandstone is sio2 the red variety being colored by iron igneous rocks are always siliceous obsidian is a glassy silicate a mountain of very pure glass obsidian two hundred feet high has lately been found in the yellowstone region we see how important si is in the compounds si02 and the silicates as a constituent of the terrestrial crust limestone is the only extensive rock from which it is absent always combined with o it is next to the latter the most abundant of elements silicates of al fe ca k na and mg are most common and these metals in the order given rank next in abundance 291 soilsbeds of sand clay etc are disintegrated rock sand is chiefly sio2 clay is decomposed feldspar slatestone etc soils are composed of these with an added portion of carbonaceous matter from decaying vegetation which imparts a dark color the reddish brown hue so often observed in soils and rocks results from ferric salts 292 minerals of which nearly 1000 varieties are now known may be simple substances as graphite and sulphur or compounds as galena and gypsum only seven systems of crystallizations are known but these are so modified as to give hundreds of forms of crystals see physics a given chemical substance usually occurs in one system only but we saw in the case of s that this was not always true crystals of some substances deliquesce or take water from the air and thus dissolve themselves some compounds cannot exist in the crystalline form without a certain percentage of water this is called water of crystallization if it passes into the air by evaporation the crystal crumbles to a powder and is then said to effloresce 293 the earths interiorwe are ignorant of the chemistry of the earths interior the deepest boring is but little more than a mile and volcanic ejections probably come from but a very few miles below the surface the specific gravity of the interior is known to be more than twice that of the surface rock from this it has been imagined that towards the center heavy metals like fe and au predominate but this is by no means certain since the greater pressure at the interior would cause the specific gravity of any substance to increase 294 percentage of elementscompute the percentage of o in the following rocks which compose a large proportion of the earths crust sio2 al2sio4 caco3 find the percentage of o in pure water in air taking cellulose c16h30o15 as the basis find the percentage of o in vegetation an estimate based on bunsens analysis of rocks of the chief elements in the earths crust is as follows o 46 per cent ca 3 per cent si 30 per cent na 2 per cent al 8 per cent k 2 per cent fe 6 per cent mg 1 per cent more than half the elements are known to exist in seawater and the rest are thought to be there though dissolved in such small quantity as to elude detection what four are found in the atmospherechapter liv organic chemistry 295 general considerationsinorganic chemistry is the chemistry of minerals or unorganized bodies organic chemistry was formerly defined as the chemistry of the compounds found in plants and animals but of late it has taken a much wider range and is now defined as the chemistry of the c compounds since c is the nucleus around which other elements centre and with which they combine to form the organic substances new organic compounds are constantly being discovered and synthesized so that nearly 100000 are now known the molecule of organic matter is often very complex sometimes containing hundreds of atoms in organic as in inorganic chemistry atoms are bound together by chemical affinity though it was formerly supposed that an additional or vital force was instrumental in forming organic compounds for this reason none of these substances it was thought could be built up in the laboratory although many had been analyzed in 1828 the first organic compound urea was artificially prepared and since then thousands have been synthesized they are not necessarily manufactured from organic products but can be made from mineral matter 296 molecular differencesmolecules may differ in three ways 1 in the kind of atoms they contain compare co2 and cs2 2 in the number of atoms compare co and co2 3 in the arrangement of atoms ie the molecular structure ethyl alcohol and methyl ether have the same number of the same elements c2h6o but their molecular structure is not the same and hence their properties differ qualitative analysis shows what elements enter into a compound quantitative analysis shows the proportion of these elements structural analysis exhibits molecular structure and is the branch to which organic chemists are now giving particular attention a specialist often works for years to synthesize a series of compounds in the laboratory 297 sourcessome organic products are now made in a purer and cheaper form than nature herself prepares them alizarine the coloring principle of madder was until lately obtained only from the root of the madder plant now it is almost wholly manufactured from coaltar and the manufactured article serves its purpose much better than the native product ten million dollars worth is annually made and holland the home of the plant is giving up madder culture artificial naphtholscarlet is abolishing the culture of the cochineal insect indigo has also been synthesized certain compounds have been predicted from a theoretical molecular structure then made and afterwards found to exist in plants others are made that have no known natural existence the source of a large number of artificial organic products is coaltar from bituminous coal saccharine a compound with two hundred and eighty times the sweetening power of sugar is one of its latest products wood bones and various fermentable liquids are other sources of organic compounds 298 marshgas seriesthe chemistry of the hydrocarbons depends on the valence of c which in most cases is a tetrad take successively 1 2 and 3 c atoms saturate with h and note the graphic symbols h h h h h h hch or ch4 hcch or hccch or h h h h h h write the graphic and common symbols for 4 5 and 6 c atoms saturated with h notice that the h atoms are found by doubling the c atoms and adding 2 hence the general formula for this series would be cnh2n2 write the common symbol for c and h with ten atoms of c twelve atoms thirteen this series is called the marshgas series the first member ch4 methane or marsh gas may be written ch3h methyl hydride ch3 being the methyl radical c2h6 ethane the second one is ethyl hydride c2h5h theoretically this series extends without limit practically it ends with c35h72 in each successive compound of the following list the c atoms increase by unity give the symbols and names of the compounds and commit the latter to memory boilingpoint 1 ch4 methane or ch3h methyl hydride gas 2 c2h6 ethane c2h5h ethyl hydride gas 3 c3h8 propane c3h7h propyl hydride

the compounds crude petroleum contains these hydrocarbons up to 10 petroleumissues from the earth and is separated into the different oils by fractional distillation and subsequent treatment with h2so4 etc rhigoline is mostly 5 and 6 gasoline 6 and 7 benzine 7 naphtha 7 and 8 kerosene 9 and 10 below 10 the compounds are solids none of those named however are pure compounds explosions of kerosene are caused by the presence of the lighter hydrocarbons as naphtha etc notice that in going down the list the proportion of c to h becomes much greater and the lower compounds are the heavy hydrocarbons to them belong vaseline paraffine asphaltum etc 299 alcoholsthe following replacements will show how the symbols for alcohols ethers etc are derived from those of the marshgas series notice that these symbols also exhibit the molecular structure of the compound in ch3h by replacing the last h with the radical oh we have ch3oh methyl hydrate by a like replacement c2h5h becomes c2h5oh ethyl hydrate these hydrates are alcohols and are known as methyl alcohol ethyl alcohol etc the common variety is c2h5oh how does this symbol differ from that for water hoh notice in the former the union of a positive and also of a negative radical complete the table below making a series of alcohols by substitutions as above from the previous table 1 ch3oh methyl hydrate or methyl alcohol 2

interesting class of compounds are the oxides of the marshgas series in this series o replaces h ch3h becomes ch32o and c2h5h becomes c2h52o why is a double radical taken these oxides are ethers common or sulphuric ether being c2h52o complete this table by substituting o in place of h in the table on page 176 1 ch32o methyl oxide or methyl ether 2 c2h52o ethyl oxide or ethyl ether 3 4 5 etc graphically represented the first two are h h h h h h 1 hcoch 2 hccocch h h h h h h 301 substitutionsa large number of other substitutions can be made in each symbol thus giving rise to as many different compounds in ch4 by substituting 3 cl for 3 h h cl hch becomes hcci or chcl3the symbol for chloroform h cl replace successively one two and four atoms with cl and write the common symbols make the same changes with br for each atom of h in ch4 substitute the radical ch3 giving the graphic and common formulae also substitute c2h5 are these radicals positive or negative from the above series of formulae of which ch4 is the basis are derived in addition to the alcohols and ethers the natural oils fatty acids etc 302 olefinesa second series of hydrocarbons is represented by the general formula cnh2n the first member of this series is c2h4 or graphically h h c c h h compare it with that for c2h6 in the first series noting the apparent molecular structure of each h h c c c h or c3h6 is the second member h h h write formulae for the third and fourth members write the common formulae for the first ten of this series this is the olefiantgas series and to it belong oxalic and tartaric acids glycerin and a vast number of other compounds many of which are derived by replacements 303 other seriesin addition to the two series of hydro carbons above given cnh2n2 and cnh2n other series are known with the general formulm cnh2n2 cnh2n4 cnh2n6 cnh2n8 etc as far as cnh2n32 or c26h2o each of these has a large number of representatives as was found in the marshgas series not far from two hundred direct compounds of c and h are known not to mention substitutions the formula cnh2n6 represents a large and interesting group of compounds called the benzine series this is the basis of the aniline dyes and of many perfumes and flavors chapter lv illuminating gas 304 sourcethe three main elements in combustion are o h c air supplies o the supporter c and h are usually united as hydrocarbons in luminants and combustibles h gives little light in burning c gives much the fibers of plants contain hydrocarbons and by destructive distillation these are separated as gases from wood and coal and used for illuminating purposes mineral coal is fossilized vegetable matter anthracite has had most of the volatile hydrocarbons removed by distillation in the earth bituminous and cannel coals retain them these latter coals are distilled and furnish us illuminating gas experiment 129put into a tt 20 g of cannel coal in fine pieces heat and collect the gas over h2o test its combustibility notice any impurities such as tar adhering to the sides of the tt or of the receiver after combustion try to ignite a piece of cannel coal by holding it in a bunsen flame is it the c which burns or the hydrocarbons distil some wood shavings in a small ignitiontube and light the escaping gas 305 preparation and purificationto make illuminating gas fireclay retorts filled with coal are heated to 1100 degrees or more over a fire of coke or coal tubes lead the distilled gas into a horizontal pipe called the hydraulic main partly filled with water into which the ends of the gaspipe dip the gas then passes through condensers consisting of several hundred feet of vertical pipe through high towers called washers in which a fine spray fig 60 gas works a furnace c retorts containing

other impurities in solution the condensers remove the rest of the tar and the h2o except what is necessary to saturate the gas at the main the condensers and the washers nh3 is abstracted co2 and h2s are much reduced and the other s compounds are diminished lime purification removes co2 and h2s and to some extent other s compounds iron purification removes h2s fe2o3 3 h2s 2 fes s 3 h2o the fes is

contains more of c02 2 impurities the heavy bydrocarbons cnh2n n etc 2 etc than the ordinary bituminous 100 coal ten per cent of the coal should be cannel naphtha is however often employed to subserve the same purpose one ton of ordinary bituminous coal requiring four gallons of oil in boston 7000000 cubic feet of gas have been burned in one day consuming 500 tons of coal the average is not more than half that quantity of the other products coke is employed for heating purposes gas carbon is used to some extent in electrical work and coaltar is the source of very many artificial products that were formerly only of natural origin nh3 is the main source of ammonium salts and s is made into h2so4 307 natural gas occurs near pittsburg pa and in many other places in immense quantities it is not only employed to light the streets and houses but is used for fires and in iron and glass manufactories it is estimated that 600000000 cubic feet are burned saving 10000 tons of coal daily in pittsburg only half a dozen factories now use coal more than half the gas is wasted through safety valves on account of the great pressure on the pipes as it issues from the earth these reservoirs of natural gas very frequently occur in sandstone usually in the vicinity of coalbeds but sometimes remote from them in all cases the origin of the gas is thought to be in the destructive distillation extending through long geological periods of coal or of other vegetable or animal matter in the earths interior natural gas varies in composition and even in the same well from day to day it consists chiefly of ch4 with some other hydrocarbons chapter lvi alcohol 308 fermented liquor experiment 130introduce 20 ccof molasses into a flask of 200 cc fill it with water to the neck and put in half a cake of yeast fit to this a dt and pass the end of it into a tt holding a clear solution of lime water leave in a warm place for two or three days then look for a turbidity in the lime water and account for it see whether the liquid in the flask is sweet the sugar should be changed to alcohol and co2 this is fermented liquor it contains a small percentage of alcohol 309 distilled liquor experiment 131attach the flask used in the last experiment to the apparatus for distilling water fig 32 and distil not more than onefifth of the liquid leaving the rest in the flask the greater part of the alcohol will pass over to obtain it all at least half of the liquid must be distilled what passes over towards the last is mostly water taste and smell the distillate put some into an ed and touch a lighted match to it if it does not burn redistil half of the distillate and try to ignite the product try the combustibility of commercial alcohol of jamaica ginger or of any other liquid known to contain alcohol 310 effect on the system experiment 132put a little of the white of egg into an ed or a beaker cover it with strong alcohol and note the effect strong alcohol has the same coagulating action on the brain and on the tissues generally when taken into the system absorbing water from them hardening them and contracting them in bulk 311 affinity for water experiment 133to show the contraction in mixing alcohol and water measure exactly 5ccof alcohol and 5ccof water pour them together and presently measure the mixture the volume is diminished a strip of parchment soaked in water till it is limp then dipped into strong alcohol becomes again stiff owing to the attraction of alcohol for water 312 puritythe most important alcohols are methyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol the former wood spirit is obtained in an impure state by distilling wood it is used to dissolve resins fats oils etc and to make aniline it is poisonous as are the others ethyl alcohol spirit of wine is the commercial article it is prepared by fermenting glucose and distilling the product it boils at 78 degrees vaporizing 22 degrees lower than water from which it can be separated by fractional distillation by successive distillations of alcohol ninetyfour per cent can be obtained which is the best commercial article though most grades fall far below this five per cent more can be removed by distilling with cao which has a strong affinity for water the last one per cent is removed by bao one hundred per cent constitutes absolute alcohol which is a deadly poison diluted it increases the circulation stimulates the system hardens the tissues by withdrawing water and is the intoxicating principle in all liquorsit is very inflammable giving little light and much heat and readily evaporates beer has usually three to six per cent of alcohol wines eight to twenty per cent the courts now regard all liquors having three per cent or less of alcohol as not intoxicating in massachusetts it is one per cent chapter lvii oils fats and soaps 313 sources and kinds of oils and fatsoils and fats are insoluble in water the former are liquid the latter solid most fats are obtained from animals oils from both plants and animals oils are classified as fixed and essential castor oil is an example of the former and oil of cloves of the latter fixed oils include drying and nondrying oils they leave a stain on paper while essential or volatile oils leave no trace but evaporate readily essential oils dissolved in alcohol furnish essences they are obtained by distilling with water the leaves petals etc of plants drying oils as linseed absorb o from the air and thus solidify nondrying ones as olive do not solidify but develop acids and become rancid after some time oils and fats are salts of fatty acids and the base glycerin the three most common of these salts are olein found in olive oil palmitin in palm oil and human fat and stearin in lard the first is liquid the second semisolid the last solid most fats are mixtures of these and other salts olefin glyceryl oleic oleate pahnitin glycerylsalts from palmiticacid and glyceryl hydrate palmitate stearin glyceryl stearic stearate 314 saponification consists in separating these salts into their acids and the base glycerin soapmaking is the best illustration to effect this separation a strong soluble base is used koh for soft and naoh for hard soap study this reaction glyceryl oleate sodium oleate glyceryl palmitate hydrate sodium palmitate glyceryl glyceryl stearate stearate hydrate soaps are thus salts of fatty acids and of k or na 315 soap is soluble in soft water but the sodium stearate probably unites with water to form hydrogen sodium stearate and naoh the grease which exudes from the skin or appears in fabrics to be washed is attacked by this naoh and removed together with the suspended dirt and a new soap is formed and dissolved in the water hard water contains salts of ca and mg and when soap is used with it the na is at once replaced by these metals and insoluble ca or mg soaps are formed hence in hard water soap will not cleanse till all the ca and mg compounds have combined 316 glycerin c3h5oh3 is a sweet thick colorless unctuous liquid used in cosmetics unguents pomades etc it is prepared in quantity by passing superheated steam over fats when under pressure 317 dynamitetreated with hno3 and h2so4 glycerin forms the very explosive and poisonous liquid nitroglycerin in this process the c3h5oh3 becomes c3h5no33 c3h5oh3 3hno3 c3h5no333 h2o h2so4 is used to absorb the h2o which is formed nitroglycerin absorbed by gunpowder diatomaceous earth sawdust etc forms dynamite for obvious reasons the pupil should not experiment with these substances 318 butter and oleomargarinemilk contains minute particles of fat about 1500 of an inch in diameter which give it the whitecolor these particles are lighter than the containing liquid and rise to the top as cream churning unites the particles more closely and separates them from the buttermilk the flavor of butter is due to the presence of five or ten per cent of butyric and other acids of the same series it was found that cows gave milk after they ceased to have food hence it was inferred that the milk was produced at the expense of the cows fat why could not butter be artificially made from the same fat it was but a step from fat to milk as it was from milk to butter oleomargarine or butterine was the result beef fat suet is washed in water ground to a pulp and partially melted and strained the stearin is separated from the filtered liquid and made into soap and an oily liquid is left this is salted colored with annotto mixed with a certain portion of milk and churned the product is scarcely distinguishable from butter and is chemically nearly identical with it though less likely to become rancid from the absence of certain fatty acids its cost is perhaps onethird as much as that of butter chapter lviii carbohydrates 319 carbon and watersome very important organic compounds have h and o in the proper proportion to form water united with c the three leading ones are sugar c12h22o11 or c12h2o11 starch c6h10o6 or and cellulose c18h30o15 or note the significance of the name carbohydrates as applied to them 320 sugars may be divided into two classesthe sucroses c12h22o11 and the glucoses c6h12o6 sucrose the principal member of the first class is obtained from the juice of the maple the palm the beet and the sugarcane in europe largely from the beet in america from cane granulated sugar is that which has been refined brown sugar is the unrefined from the sap evaporated by boiling brown sugar crystallizes leaving molasses which contains glucose and other substances good molasses has but a small percentage of glucose to refine brown sugar it is dissolved in water a small quantity of blood is added to remove certain vegetable substances after which it is filtered through animal charcoal ie boneblack a process which takes out the coloringmatter the water is then evaporated in vacuumpans so as to boil at about 74 degrees and to prevent conversion into grape sugar by this process much glucose or syrup is formed which is separated from the crystalline sucrose by rapidly revolving centrifugal machines great quantities of sucrose are used for food by all civilized nations a single refinery in new york purifies 2000000 pounds per day 321 glucose or invert sugar the principal member of the second class consists of two distinct kinds of sugar dextrose and levulose these differ in certain properties but have the same symbol both are found in equal parts in ripe fruits while sucrose occurs in the unripe honey contains these three kinds of sugar sucrose by the action of heat weak acids or ferments may be resolved into the other two varieties c12h22o11 h2o c6h12o6 c6h12o6 no mode of reversing this process or of transforming glucose into sucrose is known glucose is easily made from starch or from the cellulose in cotton rags sawdust etc if boiled with dilute h2so4 starch takes up water and becomes glucose c6h10o5 h2o c6h12o6 caco3 is added to precipitate the h2so4 which remains unchanged state the reaction the product is filtered and the filtrate is evaporated much glucose is made from the starch of corn and potatoes 322 starch is found in all plants especially in grains seeds and tubers green plantsthose containing chlorophyll manufacture their own starch from co2 and h2o these chlorophyll grains are the plants chemical laboratories and hundreds of thousands of them exist in every leaf co2 and a very little h2o enter the leaf from the air h2o being also drawn up through the root and stem from the earth in some unknown way in the leaf light has the power of synthesizing these into starch and setting free o which is returned to the atmosphere6 co2 5 h2o c6h10o5 12 o as no such change takes place in darkness all green plants must have light parasitic plants which are usually colorless obtain starch readymade from those on which they feed 323 usesglucose is used in the manufacture of alcohol and cheap confectionery and in adulterating sucrose it is only two thirds as sweet as the latter the seeds of all plants contain starch for the germinating sprout to feed upon but starch is insoluble and hence useless until it is converted into glucose this is effected by the action of warmth moisture and a ferment in the seed glucose is soluble and is at first the plants main food commercial starch is made in the united states chiefly from corn in europe from potatoes differences in the size of starch granules enable microscopists to determine the plant to which they belong 324 cellulose or woody fiber is the basis of all vegetable cell walls cotton fiber represents almost pure cellulose from it are made paper and woven tissues in paper manufacture woody fiber is made into a pulp washed bleached filtered hot pressed and sometimes glazed parchment paper vegetable parchment is made by dipping unglazed paper for half a minute into cold dilute h2so4 1 part h2o 2 12 parts h2so4 and then washing the fiber by chemical change is thus toughened the cell walls of wood are impure cellulose hence the inferior quality of paper made from woodpulp paper is now employed for a large number of purposes for which wood has heretofore been used such as for barrels pails and other hollow ware wheels etc 325 guncotton is made by treating cotton fiber with h2so4 and hno3 washing and drying to all appearances no change has taken place but the substance has become an explosive compound 326 dextrin a gummy substance used for the backs of postage stamps is a carbohydrate as in fact are gums in general dextrin is made by heating starch with h2so4 at a lower temperature than for dextrose 327 zylonite and celluloid these two similar substances embody the latest use of cellulose in manufactured articles for zylonite linen paper is cut into strips two feet by one inch soaked ten minutes in a mixture of h2so4 and hno3 a process called nitration washed for several hours then ground to a fine pulp and thoroughly dried it is then similar to pyroxiline aniline coloringmatter of any desired shade is added after which it is dissolved by soaking some hours in alcohol and camphor the liquid is evaporated and the substance is kneaded between steamheated iron rollers dried with hot air and finally subjected to great pressure to harden it and cut into sheets zylonite is combustible at a low temperature and when in the pyroxiline stage explosively so ivory coral amber bone tortoise shell malachite etc are so closely imitated that the imitation can only be detected by analysis collars combs canes pianokeys and jewelry are manufactured from it and it can be made transparent enough for windows chapter lix chemistry of fermentation 328 fermentsa large number of chemical changes are brought about through the direct agency of bodies called ferments their action is called fermentation ferments are sometimes lifeless chemical products found in living bodies but in other cases they are humble plants 329 yeast is one of the most common of living ferments wild yeast being a microscopic plant found on the ground near apple trees and grapevines and often in the air the cultivated variety is sold by grocers the temperature best suited to the rapid multiplication of the germs forming the ferment plant is 25 degrees to 35 degrees 330 alcoholic and acetic fermentationthe changes which the juice of the apple undergoes in forming cider and vinegar are a good illustration of fermentation by a living plant applejuice contains sucrose yeast germs from the air getting into this unfermented liquor cause it to work this process changes sucrose to glucose and glucose to alcohol and co2 and is known as alcoholic fermentation the latter reaction c6h12o6 2 c2h6o 2 co is only partially correct as other products are formed the juice has now become cider the sugar alcohol after a time if left exposed another organism finds its way to the alcohol and transforms it into acetic acid hc2h8o2 and h2o this process is called acetic fermentation c2h6o o2 hc2h3o2 h2o for this fermentation a liquor should not have over ten per cent of alcohol mother of vinegar consists of the germs that caused the fermentation still a third species of ferment may cause another action changing acetic acid to h2o and co2 the vinegar then tastes flat hc2h3o2 4 o 2h2o 2 co2 some mineral acids as h2so4 and hcl and some organic acids are regarded as lifeless ferments to this class are thought to belong the diastase of malt and the pepsin of the stomach this variety of ferments exists in the seeds of all plants and changes starch to glucose 331 bread which is raised by yeast is fermented the object being to produce co2 bubbles of which with the alcohol cause the dough to rise and make the bread light grapes and other fruits ferment and produce wines etc from which distilled liquors are obtained 332 lactic fermentation changes the sugar of milk lactose to lactic acid ie sour milk in canning fruit any germs present are killed by heating and those from the air are excluded by sealing the can milk has been kept sweet for years by boiling and tightly covering the receptacle with two or three folds of cotton cloth 333 putrefaction is fermentation in which the products of decay are illsmelling saprophytes attack the dead matter feed on it and cause it to putrefy this action as well as that of ordinary fermentation used to be attributed solely to oxygen germs bring back organic matter to a more elementary state and so have a very important function by some scientists digestion is regarded as a species of fermentation probably due to the action of lifeless ferments eg sucrose cannot be taken into the system but is first fermented to glucose 334 most infectious diseases are now thought to be due to parasites of various kinds such as bacteria microbes etc with which the victim often swarms and which feed on his tissues multiplying with enormous rapidity such diseases are smallpox intermittent and yellow fevers etc consumption or tuberculosis is believed to be caused by a microbe which destroys the lungs in some diseases not less than fifteen billions of the organisms are estimated to exist in a cubic inch these multiply so rapidly that from a single germ in fortyeight hours may be produced nearly three hundred billions these germs do not spring into life spontaneously from inorganic matter but come from preexistent similar forms parasites are not so rare in the system even of a healthy person as is generally supposed they are found on our teeth and in many of the tissues of the body several infectious diseases are now warded off or rendered less virulent by vaccination the philosophy of which is that the organisms are rendered less dangerous by domestication several crops or generations are grown in a prepared liquid each less injurious than its parent some of the more domesticated ones are introduced into the system and the person has only a modified form of the disease often scarcely any at all and is for a more or less limited time insured against further danger dust particles and motes floating in the air are in part germs living or dead often requiring only moisture and mild temperature for resuscitation most of these are harmless chapter lx chemistry of life 335 growththe chemistry of organic life is very complex and not well understood a few of the principal points of distinction between the two great classes of living organisms plants and animals are all that can be noted here minerals grow by accretion ie by the external addition of molecules of the same material as their interior a crystal of quartz grows by the addition of successive molecules of sio2 arranged in a symmetrical manner around its axis the growth of crystals can be seen by suspending a string in a saturated solution of cuso4 or of sugar in plants and animals the growth is very much more complex but is from the interior and is produced by the multiplication of cells to produce this cellgrowth and multiplication foodmaterials must be furnished and assimilated in plants sap serves to carry the foodmaterials to the parts where they are needed in the higher animals vari ous fluids the most important of which is the blood serve the same purpose 336 chemistry of plantsin ultimate analysis plants consist mainly of c h o n p k in proximate analysis as it is called they are found to contain these elements combined to form substances like starch sugar etc water is the leading compound in both animals and plants one of the most important differences between animals and plants is that all plants except parasitic ones are capable of building up such compounds as starch from mineral foodstuffs while animals have not that power but must have the products of proximate analysis ready prepared as it were by the plant hence plants thrive on minerals whereas animals feed on plants or on other animals the power which plants have of transforming mineral matter is largely due to sunlight the action of which in separating co was described the reaction in the synthesis of starch from co2 and h2o in the leaf is thought to be as follows 6 co2 5 h2o c6h10o5 12 o c6h10o5 is taken into the tree as starch 12 o is given back to the air all the constituents except co2 and a very small quantity of h2o are absorbed by the roots from the soil from which they are soon withdrawn by vegetation to renew the supply fertilizers or manures are applied to the soil these must contain compounds of n p and k n is usually applied in the form

higher animals the object is not so much to increase the size as to supply the waste of the system the principal elements in mans body are c h o n s p an illustration of the transformation of mineral foods by plants before they can be used by animals is found in the ca3po42 of bones this is rendered soluble plants absorb and transform it animals eat the plants and obtain the phosphates thus man is said to eat his own bones the food of mankind may be divided into four classes 1 proteids which contain c h o n and often s and p 2 fats and 3 amyloids both of which contain c h o 4 minerals examples of the first class are the gluten of flour the albumen of the white of egg and the casein of cheese to the second class belong fats and oils to the third starch sugar and gums to the fourth h2o nacl and other salts since only proteids contain all the requisite elements they are essential to human food and are the only absolutely essential ones except minerals but since they do not contain all the elements in the proportion needed by the system a mixed diet is indispensable milk better than any other single food supplies the needs of the system the digestion and assimilation of these foodstuffs and the composition of the various tissues is too complicated to be taken up here for their discussion the reader is referred to works on physiological chemistry 338 conservationplants in growing decompose co2 and thereby store up energy the energy derived from the light and heat of the sun when they decay or are burned or are eaten by animals exactly the same amount of energy is liberated or changed from potential to kinetic and the same amount of co2 is restored to the air the tree that took a hundred years to complete its growth may be burned in an hour or be many years in decaying but in either case it gives back to its mother nature all the matter and energy that it originally borrowed the ash from burning plants represents the earthy matter or salts which the plant assimilated during its growth the rest is volatile in the growth and destruction of plants or of animals both energy and matter have undergone transformation animals in feeding on plants transform the energy of sunlight into the energy of vitality thus we are children of the sun chapter lxi theories 339 the la place theorythis theory supposes that at one time the earth and the other planets together with the sun constituted a single mass of vapor extending billions of miles in space that it rotated around its center that it gradually shrank in volume by the transformation of potential into kinetic energy that portions of its outer rim were thrown off and finally condensed into planets that our sun is only the remainder of that central mass which still rotates and carries the planets around with it that the earth is a cooling globe that the other planets are going through the same phases as the earth and finally that the sun itself is destined like them to become a cold body 340 a cooling earththe suns temperature is variously estimated at many thousands or even millions o degrees many metals which exist on the earth as solids eg iron are gases in the dense atmosphere of the sun thus the earth in its early existence must have been composed of gases only which in after ages condensed into liquids and solids so intense was the heat at that time that substances probably existed as elements instead of compounds ie the temperature was above the point of dissociation we have seen that al2o3 cao sio2 etc are dissociated at the highest temperatures only if the temperature were above that of combination compounds could not exist as such but matter would exist in its elemental state on slowly cooling these elements would combine it is then a fair inference that such compounds as need the highest temperatures to separate them as silica silicates and some oxides were formed from their elements at a much earlier stage of the earths history than were those compounds that are more easily separable such as water lead sulphide etc and that the most infusible substances were solidified first 341 evolutionas the earth slowly cooled elements united to form compounds gases condensed to liquids and these to solids at one time the entire surface of our planet may have been liquid when the cooling surface reached a point somewhat below that of boiling water the lowest forms of life appeared in the ocean this was many millions of years ago most scientists believe that all vegetable and animal life has developed from the lowest forms of life there is also a theory that all chemical elements are derivatives of hydrogen or of some other element and that all the socalled elements are really compounds which a sufficiently high temperature would dissociate as evidence of this it is said that less than half as many elements have been discovered in the sun as in the earth and that comets and nebula which are less developed forms of matter than the sun have a few simple substances only it is easy to fancy that all living bodies both animal and vegetable are only natural growths from the lowest forms of life that these lowest forms are a development with new manifestations of energy from inorganic matter that compounds are derived from elements and that the last are derivatives of some one element but it must be borne in mind that this is only a theory 342 new theory of chemistry we have seen that heat lies at the basis of chemical as well as of physical changes by the loss of heat or perhaps by the change of potential into kinetic energy in a nebulous parent mass planets were formed capable of supporting living organisms heat changes solids to liquids and liquids to gases it resolves compounds or it aids chemical union in every chemical combination heat is developed in every case of dissociation heat is absorbed properly written every equation should be a b c heat eg 2 h 0 h2o heat or c a b heat eg h2o 2 h 0 heat another illustration is the combination of c and o and the dissociation of co2 as given on page 82 c o2 co2 energy co2 o2 c energy in fact there are indications that the present theory of atoms and molecules of matter as the foundation of chemistry will at no distant day give place to a theory of chemistry based on the forms of energy of which heat is a manifestation chapter lxii gas volumes and weights 343 oxygen experiment 134weigh accurately using delicate balances 5 g kclo3 and mix with the crystals 1 or 2 g of pure powdered mno2 put the mixture into a tt with a tightfitting cork and deliverytube and invert over the waterpan to collect the gas a flask of at least one and a half liters capacity filled with water apply heat and without rejecting any of the gas collect it as long as any will separate then press the flask down into the water till the level in the flask is the same as that outside and remove the flask leaving in the bottom all the water that is not displaced weigh the flask with the water it contains then completely fill it with water and weigh again subtract the first weight from the second and the result will evidently be the weight of water that occupies the same volume as the o collected this weight if expressed in grams represents approximately the number of cubic centimeters of watersince 1 cc of water weighs lgor the number of cubic centimeters of o at the time the experiment is performed the temperature should be noted with a centigrade thermometer and the atmospheric pressure with a barometer graduated to millimeters suppose that we have obtained 1450 cc of o that the temperature is 27 degrees and the pressure 758 mm we wish to find the volume and the weight of the gas at 0 degrees and 760 mm according to the law of charlesthe volume of a given quantity of gas at constant pressure varies directly as the absolute temperature to reduce from the centigrade to the absolute scale we have only to add 273 degrees adding the observed temperature we have 273 degrees 27 degrees 300 degrees applying the above law to o obtained at 300 degrees a we have the proportion below since the volume of o at 273 degrees will be less than it will at 300 degrees the fourth term or answer will be less than the third and the second term must be less than the first 300 273 1450 x this would give the result dependent upon temperature alone by the law of mariotte physics the volume of a given quantity of gas at a constant temperature varies inversely as the pressure applying this law to the o obtained at 758mm we have the following proportion the volume at 760mm will be less than at 758mm or the fourth term will be less than the third hence the second must be less than the first 760 758 1450 x this would give the result dependent on pressure alone combining the two proportions in one 300 273 1450 x 1316cc 760 758 1316cc1316 liters it remains to find the weight of this gas a liter of h weighs 00896g the vapor density of o is 16 hence 1316 liters of o will weigh 1316 x 16 x 00896 189g kclo3 kcl o3 from the equation 1225 48 we make a proportion 5 x 1225 5 48 x 195 and obtain as the weight of o contained in 5g of kclo3 195g the weight we actuallyobtained was 189g this leaves an error of 006g or a little over 4 per cent of error 006 195 003 the percentage of error in performing this experiment should fall within 10 some of the liabilities to error are as follows 1 impure mno2 which sometimes contains c co2 is soluble m h2o 2 solubility of o in water 3 escape of gas by leakage 4 moisture taken up by the gas 5 difference between the temperature of the gas and that of the air in the room 6 errors in weighing 7 want of accuracy in the weights and scales 344 hydrogen experiment 135weigh 5g or less of sheet or granulated zn and put it into a small flask provided with a thistletube and a deliverytube cover the zn with water and introduce through the thistletube measured quantities of hcl a few cubic centimeters at a time collect the h over water in large flasks observing the same directions as in removing o weigh the water compute the volume of the gas reduce it to the standard and obtain the weight as before should any zn or other solid substance be left pour off the water or filter it weigh the dry residue and deduct its weight from that of the zn originally taken suppose the residue to weigh 05g make and solve the proportion from the equation zn 2hcl zncl2 2h 65 2 45 x compute the percentage of errcr as in the case of o if the purity of the hcl be known ie the weight of hcl gas in one cubic centimeter of the liquid a proportion can be made between hcl and h provided no free hcl is left in the flask state any liabilities to error in this experiment problems 1 a gas occupies 2000ccwhen the barometer stands 750mm what volume will it fill at 760mm 2 at 750mm my volume of o is 4 12 liters what will it be at 730mm 3 at 825mm 4 at 200mm 5 compute the volume of a gas at 70 degrees which at 30 degrees is 150cc 6 at 0 degrees i have 3000ccof o what volume will it occupy at 100 degrees 7 i fill a flask holding 2 litres with h the thermometer indicates 26 degrees the barometer 762mm what is the volume of the gas at 0 degrees and 760mm if the volumes of gases vary as above it is evident that their vapor densities must vary inversely a liter of h at 0 degrees weighs 00896 what will a liter of h weigh at 273 degrees at 273 degrees the one liter has be come two liters one of which weighs 00448 00896 2 the vapor density of a gas is inversely proportional to the temperature also the vapor density is directly proportional to the pressure since a liter of any gas under a pressure of one atmosphere is reduced to half a liter under two atmospheres problems 1 find the weight of a liter of o at 0 degrees then compute the weight of a liter at 27 degrees 2 find the weight of 500ccof n2o at 60 degrees 3 of 200 cc of co at 5 degrees 4 a given volume of o weighs 025g at a pressure of 750mm

mailing price 60 cents for introduction 50 cents this book is for the use of students in the chemical laboratory it contains more than one hundred sets of the choicest illustrative experiments about half of which belong to general chemistry the rest to metal and acid analysis great care has been taken to describe accurately and minutely the methods of performing experiments and in directing pupils to observe phenomena and to explain what is seen the work is amply illustrated and is replete with questions and suggestions blank pages are inserted for pupils to make a record of their work for which careful directions are given with a model laboratory rules tables of solubilities etc a new feature is the supplementary and original work vhich is given at the end of each set of experiments for such pupils as complete the prescribed work ahead of others in the class and a list of terms to be looked up in some textbook this gives an elasticity to the book and fits it for use in schools where much time is devoted to chemistry as well as in the most elementary classes in labortttory work another original feature which it is believed will be heartily welcomed by teachers is

introduction 120 the revised edition of this book has been prepared for schools that desire a brief course free from mathematics it is based upon the authors elements of astronomy but many changes of arrangement have been made in fact everything has been carefully worked over and rewritten to adapt it to the special requirements great pains has been taken not to sacrifice accuracy and truth to brevity and no less to bring everything thoroughly down to date the latest results of astronomical investigation will be found here the author has endeavored too while discarding mathematics to give the student a clear understanding and a good grasp of the subject as a body of information and as a means of discipline this book will be found it is believed of notable value the most important change in the arrangement of the book has been in bringing the uranography or constellation tracing into the body of the text and placing it near the beginning a change in harmony with the accepted principle that those whose minds are not mature succeed best in the study of a new subject by beginning with what is concrete and appeals to the senses rather than with the abstract principles brief
