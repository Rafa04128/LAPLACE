titchfield street oxford street w respectfully dedicated to dr eleanor maxwell 1911 preface this sketch of the iconography of the dance does not pretend to be a history of the subject except in the most elementary way it may be taken as a summary of the history of posture a complete dance cannot be easily rendered in illustration the text is of the most elementary description to go into the subject thoroughly would involve years and volumes the descriptions of the various historic dances or music are enormous subjects two authors alone have given 800 dances in four volumesfootnote

idea of the orchesography of the egyptians and greeks could have been given this art of describing dances much in the manner that music is written is lost and the attempts to revive it have been ineffective the increasing speed of the action since the days of lulli would now render it almost impossible it is hoped that this work may be of some use as illustrating the costume position and accessories of the dance in various periods to those producing entertainments to the reader desirous of thoroughly studying the subject a bibliography is given at the end contents chapter i egyptian

necessary to worry the reader with speculations as to the origin of dancing there are other authorities easily accessible who have written upon this theme dancing is probably one of the oldest arts as soon as man was man he without doubt began to gesticulate with face body and limbs how long it took to develop bodily gesticulation into an art no one can guessperhaps a millennium in writing of dancing one will therefore include those gesticulations or movements of the body suggesting an idea whether it be the slow movement of marching or the rapid gallop even some of the movements that we commonly call acrobatic it is not intended here to include the more sensual movements of the east and the debased antique generally the antique dances were connected with a religious ritual conceived to be acceptable to the gods this connection between dancing and religious rites was common up to the 16th century it still continues in some countries in some of the earliest designs which have come down to us the dancers moved as stars hand in hand round an altar or person representing the sun either in a slow or stately method or with rapid trained gestures according to the ritual performed dancing music and poetry were inseparable dancing is the poetry of motion and its connection with music as the poetry of sound occurs at all times in our own day musical themes are marked by forms originally dance times as waltz time gavotte time minuet time etc illustration fig 2greek figures in a solemn dance from a vase at berlin amongst the earliest representations that are comprehensible we have certain egyptian paintings and some of these exhibit postures that evidently had even then a settled meaning and were a phrase in the sentences of the art not only were they settled at such an early period bc 3000 fig 1 but they appear to have been accepted and handed down to succeeding generations fig 2 and what is remarkable in some countries even to our own times the accompanying illustrations from egypt and greece exhibit what was evidently a traditional attitude the handinhand dance is another of these the earliest accompaniments to dancing appear to have been the clapping of hands the pipesfootnote egyptian music appears to have been of a complicated character and the double pipe or flutes were probably reeded as with our clarionet the left pipe had few stops and served as a sort of hautboy the right had many stops and was higher the single pipe a the recorder in the british museum is a treble of 1012 in and is pentaphonic like the scotch scale the tenor b is 834 in long and its present pitchillustration a illustration b the guitar the tambourine the castanets the cymbals the tambour and sometimes in the street the drum the following account of egyptian dancing is from sir gardiner wilkinsons ancient egypt footnote vol i p 5038 the dance consisted mostly of a succession of figures in which the performers endeavoured to exhibit a great variety of gesture men and women danced at the same time or in separate parties but the latter were generally preferred for their superior grace and elegance some danced to slow airs adapted to the style of their movement the attitudes they assumed frequently partook of a grace not unworthy of the greeks and some credit is due to the skill of the artist who represented the subject which excites additional interest from its being in one of the oldest tombs of thebes bc 1450 amenophis ii others preferred a lively step regulated by an appropriate tune and men sometimes danced with great spirit bounding from the ground more in the manner of europeans than of eastern people on these occasions the music was not always composed of many instruments and here we find only the cylindrical maces and a woman snapping her fingers in the time in lieu of cymbals or castanets graceful attitudes and gesticulations were the general style of their dance but as in all other countries the taste of the performance varied according to the rank of the person by whom they were employed or their own skill and the dance at the house of a priest differed from that among the uncouth peasantry etc it was not customary for the upper orders of egyptians to indulge in this amusement either in public or private assemblies and none appear to have practised it but the lower ranks of society and those who gained their livelihood by attending festive meetings fearing lest it should corrupt the manners of a people naturally lively and fond of gaiety and deeming it neither a necessary part of education nor becoming a person of sober habits the egyptians forbade those of the higher classes to learn it as an amusement many of these postures resembled those of the modern ballet and the pirouette delighted an egyptian party 3500 years ago the dresses of the females were light and of the finest texture a loose flowing robe reaching to the ankles sometimes with a girdle in later times it appears more transparent and folded in narrow pleatsfootnote there is a picture of an egyptian gauffering machine in wilkinson vol i p 185 some danced in pairs holding each others hand others went through a succession of steps alone both men and women sometimes a man performed a solo to the sound of music or the clapping of hands a favourite figure dance was universally adopted throughout the country in which two partners who were usually men advanced toward each other or stood face to face upon one leg and having performed a series of movements retired again in opposite directions continuing to hold by one hand and concluding by turning each other round see fig 3 that the attitude was very common is proved by its having been adopted by the hieroglyphic fig 4 as the mode of describing dance illustration fig 3the hieroglyphics describe the dance illustration fig 4egyptian hieroglyphic for dance many of the positions of the dance illustrated in gardner wilkinson are used at the present day the assyrians probably danced as much as the other nations but amongst the many monuments that have been discovered there is little dancing shown and they were evidently more proud of their campaigns and their hunting than of their dancing a stern and strong people although they undoubtedly had this amusement we know little about it of the phoenicians their neighbours we have some illustrations of their dance which was apparently of a serious nature judging by the examples which we possess such as that fig 5 from cyprus representing three figures in hooded cowls dancing around a piper it is a dance around a centre as is also fig 6 that from idalium in cyprus the latter is engraved around a bronze bowl and is evidently a planet and sun dance before a goddess in a temple the sun being the central object around which they dance accompanied by the double pipes the harp and tabour the egyptian origin of the devotion is apparent in the details especially in the lotussmelling goddess marked a on fig 6 who holds the flower in the manner shown in an egyptian painting in the british museum fig 7 illustration fig 5cyprian limestone group of phoenician dancers about 612 in high there is a somewhat similar group also from cyprus in the british museum the dress a hooded cowl appears to be of great antiquity from the phoenicians we have illustrated examples but no record whereas from their neighbours the hebrews we have ample records in the scriptures but no illustrations it is however most probable that the dance with them had the traditional character of the nations around them or who had held them captive and the philistine dance fig 6 may have been of the same kind as that around the golden calf apis of the desert exodus xxxii v 19 illustration fig 6phoenician patera from idalium showing a religious ritual dance before a goddess in a temple round a sun emblem when they passed the red sea miriam and the maidens danced in chorus with singing and the beating of the timbrel tambour exodus xv v 1 illustration fig 7female figure smelling a lotus from a painting in the british museum king david not only danced before the ark 2 samuel vi v 16 but mentions dancing in the 149th and 150th psalm certain historians also tell us that they had dancing in their ritual of the seasons their dancing seems to have been associated with joy as we read of a time to mourn and a time to dance we find eccles iii v 4 they had also the pipes we have piped to you and you have not danced matthew xi v 17 these dances were evidently executed by the peoples themselves and not by public performers illustration fig 8dance of bacchantes painted by the ceramic painter hieron british museum chapter ii dancing with the greeks with the greeks dancing certainly was primarily part of a religious rite with music it formed the lyric art the term however with them included all those actions of the body and limbs and all expressions and actions of the features and head which suggest ideas marching acrobatic performances and mimetic action all came into the term according to the historians the greeks attributed dancing to their deities homer makes apollo orchestes or the dancer and amongst the early dances is that in his honour called the hyporchema their dances may be divided into sections somewhat thus 1 those of a religious species 2 those of a gymnastic nature 3 those of a mimetic character 4 those of the theatre such as the chorus 5 those partly social partly religious dances such as the hymeneal and 6 chamber dances grown up men and women did not dance together but the youth of both sexes joined in the hormos or chain dance and the geranos or crane see fig 11 illustration fig 9dancing bacchante from a vase in the british museum illustration fig 10greek terra cotta dancing girl about 350 bc british museum according to some authorities one of the most primitive of the first class attributed to phrygian origin was the aloenes danced to the phrygian flute by the priests of cybele in honour of her daughter ceres the dances ultimately celebrated in her cult were numerous such as the anthema the bookolos the epicredros and many others some rustic for labourers others of shepherds etc every locality seems to have had a dance of its own dances in honour of venus were common she was the patroness of proper and decent dancing on the contrary those in honour of dionysius or bacchus degenerated into revelry and obscenity the epilenios danced when the grapes were pressed and imitated the gathering and pressing the anteisterios danced when the wine was vatted figs 8 9 10 and the bahilicos danced to the sistrus cymbals and tambour often degenerated into orgies illustration fig 11the geranos from a vase in the museo borbonico naples illustration fig 12panathenaeac dance about the 4th century bc illustration fig 13a military dance supposed to be the corybantum from a greek basrelief in the vatican museum the geranos originally from delos is said to have been originated by theseus in memory of his escape from the labyrinth of crete fig 12 it was a handinhand dance alternately of males and females the dance was led by the representative of theseus playing the lyre illustration fig 14greek dancer with castanets british museum see also castanet dance by myron fig 63a of the second class the gymnastic the most important were military dances the invention of which was attributed to minerva of these the corybantum was the most remarkable it was of phrygian origin and of a mixed religious military and mimetic character the performers were armed and bounded about springing and clashing their arms and shields to imitate the corybantes endeavouring to stifle the cries of the infant zeus in crete the pyrrhic fig 13 a war dance of doric origin was a rapid dance to the double flute and made to resemble an action in battle the hoplites of homer is thought to have been of this kind the dorians were very partial to this dance and considered their success in battle due to the celerity and training of the dance in subsequent periods it was imitated by female dancers and as a pas seul it was also performed in the panathenaea by ephebi at the expense of the choragus but this was probably only a mimetic performance and not warlike illustration fig 15cymbals about 4 in and double flute british museum there were many other heroic military dances in honour of hercules theseus etc the chorus composed of singers and dancers formed part of the drama which included the recitation of some poetic composition and included gesticulative and mimetic action as well as dancing and singing the dorians were especially fond of this their poetry was generally choral and the doric forms were preserved by the athenians in the choral compositions of their drama the tragic dance emmelia was solemn whilst that in comedy cordax was frivolous and the siccinis or dance of satyrs was often obscene they danced to the music of the pipes the tambour the harp castanets cymbals etc figs 14 15 16 illustration fig 16greek dancers from a vase in the hamilton collection illustration fig 17bacchanalian dancer vase from nocera museum naples in the rites of dionysius the chorus was fifty and the cithara was used instead of the flute from the time of sophocles it was fifteen and always had a professed trainer the choric question is however a subject in itself and cannot be fairly dealt with here the social dances and those in honour of the seasons fire and water were numerous and generally local whilst the chamber dances professional dancing the throwing of the kotabos and suchlike must be left to the readers further study of the authors mentioned in the bibliography at the end of the work illustration fig 18greek dancers and tumblers it may astonish the reader to know that the funambulist or ropedancer was very expert with the greeks as also was the acrobat between knives and swords animals were also taught to dance on ropes even elephants the important religious and other dances were not generally composed of professionals the greatest men were not above showing their sentiments by dancing sophocles danced after salamis and epaminondas was an expert dancer there were dancers of all grades from the distinguished to the moderate distinguished persons even married into excellent positions if they did not already occupy them by birth philip of macedon married larissa a dancer and the dancer aristodemus was ambassador to his court these dancers must not be confounded with those hired to dance at feasts etc figs 9 14 and 18 illustration fig 19etruscan bronze dancer with eyes of diamonds found at verona now in the british museum chapter iii etruscansouth italian roman dancing etc one of the most important nations of antiquity was the etruscan inhabiting according to some authorities a dominion from lombardy to the alps and from the mediterranean to the adriatic etruria gave a dynasty to rome in servius tullius who originally was masterna an etruscan illustration fig 20etruscan dancer from a painting in the grotta dei vasi dipinticorneto it is however with the dancing that we are dealing there is little doubt that they were dancers in every sense there are many ancient sepulchres in etruria with dancing painted on their walls other description than that of the pictures we do not possess for as yet the language is a dead letter there is no doubt as gerhardt footnote ann institut 1831 p 321 suggests that they considered dancing as one of the emblems of joy in a future state and that the dead were received with dancing and music in their new home they danced to the music of the pipes the lyre the castanets of wood steel or brass as is shown in the illustrations taken from the monuments illustration fig 21etruscan dancing and performances from paintings in the grotta della scimia corneto about 500 bc that the phoenicians and greeks had at certain times immense influence on the etruscans is evident from their relics which we possess fig 20 a characteristic illustration of the dancer is from a painting in the tomb of the vasi dipinti corneto which according to mr dennis footnote etruria vol i p 380 belongs to the archaic period and is perhaps as early as 600 bc it exhibits a stronger greek influence than some of the paintings fig 21 showing a military dance to pipes with other sports comes from the grotta della scimia also at corneto these show a more purely etruscan character illustration fig 22etruscan dancing from the grotta del tricliniocorneto the pretty dancing scene from the grotta del triclinio at corneto is taken from a fullsized copy in the british museum and is of the greatest interest it is considered to be of the grecoetruscan period and later than the previous examples fig 22 there is a peculiarity in the attitude of the hands and of the fingers being kept flat and close together it is not a little curious that the modern japanese dance as exhibited by mme sadi yacca has this peculiarity whether the result of ancient tradition or of modern revival the writer cannot say almost as interesting as the etruscan are the illustrations of dancing found in the painted tombs of the campagna and southern italy once part of magna grecia the figure of a funeral dance with the double pipe accompaniments from a painted tomb near albanella fig 23 may be as late as 300 bc and those in figs 24 25 from a tomb near capua are probably of about the same period these samnite dances appear essentially different from the etruscan although both greek and etruscan influence are very evident they are more solemn and stately this may however arise from a different national custom that the etruscan sabellian oscan samnite and other national dances of the country had some influence on the art in rome is highly probable but the paucity of early roman examples renders the evidence difficult illustration fig 23funeral dance in the obsequies of a female from a painted tomb near albanella rome as a conquering imperial power represented nearly the whole world of its day and its dances accordingly were most numerous amongst the illustrations already given we have many that were preserved in rome in the beginning of its existence as a power only religious dances were practised and many of these were of etruscan origin such as the lupercalia the ambarvalia c in the former the dancers were deminude and probably originally shepherds the latter was a serious dancing procession through fields and villages illustration fig 24funeral dance from capua a great dance of a severe kind was executed by the salii priests of mars an ecclesiastical corporation of twelve chosen patricians in their procession and dance on march 1 and succeeding days carrying the ancilia they sang songs and hymns and afterwards retired to a great banquet in the temple of mars that the practice was originally etruscan may be gathered from the circumstance that on a gem showing the armed priests carrying the shields there are etruscan letters there were also an order of female salii another military dance was the saltatio bellicrepa said to have been instituted by romulus in commemoration of the rape of the sabines the pyrrhic dance fig 13 was also introduced into rome by julius caesar and was danced by the children of the leading men of asia and bithynia as however the state increased in power by conquest it absorbed with other countries other habits and the art degenerated often like that of greece and etruria into a vehicle for orgies when they brought to rome with their asiatic captives even more licentious practices and dances illustration fig 25funeral dance from the same tomb as rome which never rose to the intellectual and imaginative state of greece in her best period represented wealth commerce and conquest in a greater degree so were her arts and with these the lyric in her best state her nobles danced appius claudius excelled and sallust tells us that sempronia psaltere saltare elegantius so that in those days ladies played and danced but no roman citizen danced except in the religious dances they carried mimetic dances to a very perfect character in the time of augustus under the term of musica muta after the second punic war as greek habits made their way into italy it became a fashion for the young to learn to dance the education in dancing and gesture were important in the actor as masks prevented any display of feature the position of the actor was never recognized professionally and was considered infamia but the change came which caused cicero to say no one danced when sober eventually the performers of lower class occupied the dancing platform and herculaneum and pompeii have shown us the results illustration fig 26bacchante leading the dionysian bull to the altar basrelief in the vatican in the theatre the method of the roman chorus differed from that of the greeks in the latter the orchestra or place for the dancing and chorus was about 12 ft below the stage with steps to ascend when these were required in the former the chorus was not used in comedy and having no orchestra was in tragedies placed upon the stage the getting together of the chorus was a public service or liturgia and in the early days of grecian prosperity was provided by the choregus tiberius by a decree abolished the saturnalia and exiled the dancing teachers but the many acts of the senate to secure a better standard were useless against the foreign inhabitants of the empire accustomed to sensuality and licence illustration fig 27bacchante from a fresco pompeii 1st century bc illustration fig 28dancer from a fresco in the baths of constantine 4th century ad perhaps the encouragement of the more brutal combats of the coliseum did something to suppress the more delicate arts but historians have told us and it is common knowledge what became of the great empire and the lyric with other arts were destroyed by licentious preferences chapter iv the early english and mediaeval dance to the fourteenth century the last illustration from the baths of constantine brought us into the christian era although that example was not of christian sentiment or art it is possible that the dance of salome with its diabolical reward may have prejudiced the apostolic era for we find no example of dancing as exhibiting joy in christian art of that period the dance before herod is historical proof that the higher classes of hebrews danced for amusement as soon however as christianity became enthroned and a settled society we read of religious dances as exhibiting joy even in the churches tertullian tells us that they danced to the singing of hymns and canticles these dances were solemn and graceful to the old tones and continued notwithstanding many prohibitions such as those of pope zacharias a syrian in ad 744 the dancing at easter in the cathedral at paris was prohibited by archbishop odo in the 12th century but notwithstanding the antagonism of the fathers the dances were only partially suppressed they were common on religious festivals in spain and portugal up to the seventeenth century and in some localities continue even to our own time when s charles borromeo was canonized in 1610 the portuguese who had him as patron made a procession of four chariots of dancers one to renown another to the city of milan one to represent portugal and a fourth to represent the church in seville at certain periods and in the balearic isles they still dance in religious ceremonies we know that religious dancing has continually been performed as an accessory to prayer and is still so used by the mahommedans the american indians and the bedos of india who dance into an ecstasy illustration fig 29gleemens dance 9th century from cleopatra cotton ms c viii british museum it is probable that this sort of mania marked the dancing in europe which was suppressed by pope and bishop this choreomania marked a flemish sect in 1374 who danced in honour of st john and it was so furious that the disease called st vitus dance takes its name from this performance christmas carols were originally choric the performers danced and sang in a circle the illustration fig 43 of a dance of angels and religious shows us that fra angelico thought the practice joyful this dance is almost a counterpart of that amongst the greeks fig 11 the other dance by sandro botticelli fig 44 is taken from his celebrated nativity in the national gallery although we have records of performances in churches no illustrations of an early date have come to the knowledge of the writer illustration fig 30dancing to horn and pipe from an anglosaxon ms that the original inhabitants of britain dancedthat the picts danes saxons and romans danced may be taken for granted but there seems little doubt that our earliest illustrations of dancing were of the roman tradition we find the attitude the instruments and the clapping of hands all of the same undoubted classic character tacitus informs us that the teutonic youths danced with swords and spears and olaus magnus that the goths c had military dances still the military dances in english mss figs 31 32 seem more like those of a pyrrhic character which julius caesar the conqueror of england introduced into rome the illustration fig 29 of what is probably a saxon gleemens dance shows us the kind of amusement they afforded and how they followed classic usages illustration fig 31anglosaxon sword dance from the ms cleopatra c

illustrated in fig 30 where the figures dance to the sound of the horn in much the same attitudes as in the modern hornpipe with a curious resemblance to the position in some muscovite dances illustration fig 32sword dance to bagpipes 14th century from 2 b vii royal ms british museum the norman minstrel successor of the gleeman used the doublepipe the harp the viol trumpets the horn and a

to have become common before the time of chaucers tomblesteres illustration fig 33herodias tumbling from a ms end of 13th century addl 18719 f 253b british museum that this tumbling and dancing was

been formulated as an accomplishment until late in the thirteenth century and at a later date was cultivated as a means of teaching what we call deportment until it became almost a necessity with the classes as is shown by the literature of that period the various social dances such as the volte the jig and the galliard although in early periods not so numerous required a certain training and agility these however soon became complicated with many social and local variations the characteristics of which are a study in themselves the dances figs 37 and 38 in a field of sports from an italian engraving of the fifteenth century show us nothing new indeed with different costumes it is very like what we have from egypt fig 3 only a different phase of the action and the attitude of this old dance is repeated even to our own time illustration fig 38italian dancing the end of the 15th century in the chamber dance by martin zasinger fig 39 of the fifteenth century no figures are in

of langres in 1588 from which comes the illustration of the galliarde fig 49 and to which i would refer the reader for all the information he desires concerning this period in this work much stress is laid on the value of learning to dance from many points of viewdevelopment of strength manner habits and courtesy etc alas we know now that all these external habits can be acquired and leave the natural man beneath illustration fig 49la galliarde from the orchsographie of thoinot arbeau jean tabourot langres 1588 desirable therefore as good manners and such like are they do not fulfil all the requirements that the worthy canon wished to be involved by them footnote the advice which he gives is valuable from its bearing on the customs of the 16th century it even has great historical value indicating the influence dancing has had on good manners that the history of dancing is the history of manners may be too much insisted upon for these reasons we insert these little known passages the first has reference to the right way of proceeding at a ball having entered the place where the company is gathered for the dance choose a good young lady honneste damoiselle and raising your hat or bonnet with your right hand you will conduct her to the ball with your left she wise and well trained will tender her left and rise to follow you then in the sight of all you conduct her to the end of the room and you will request the players of instruments to strike up a basse danse because otherwise through inadvertance they might strike up some other kind of dance and when they commence to play you must commence to dance and be careful that they understand in your asking for a basse danse you desire a regular and usual one nevertheless if the air of one song on which the basse danse is formed pleases you more than another you can give the beginning of the strain to them capriolif the lady refuses i shall feel very ashamed arbeaua welltrained lady never refuses him who so honours her as to lead her to the dance caprioli think so too but in the meantime the shame of the refusal remains with me arbeauif you feel sure of another ladys graciousness take her and leave aside this graceless one asking her to excuse you for having been importunate nevertheless there are those who would not bear it so patiently but it is better to speak thus than with bitterness because in so doing you acquire a reputation for being gentle and humane and to her will fall the character of a glorieuse unworthy of the attention paid her when the instrument player has ceased continues our good canon make a deep bow by way of taking leave of the young lady and conduct her gently to the place whence you took her whilst thanking her for the honour she has done you another extract is not wanting in flavour hold the head and body straight have a countenance of assurance spit and cough little and if necessity compels you turn your face the other side and use a beautiful white handkerchief talk graciously in gentle and honest speech neither letting your hands hang as if dead or too full of gesticulation be dressed cleanly and neatly avec la chausse bien tire et pescarpin propre and bear in mind these particulars we have have seen from the fourteenth century figs 35 c 36 a 46 how common the bagpipe was in outofdoor dances in the illustrations from drer fig 46 and in fig 53 from holtzer it has developed and has two accessory pipes besides that played by the mouth and the player is accompanied by a sort of clarionet this also appears to be the only accompaniment of

of a dancing master hogarth we have now arrived at the modern style of ball so beloved by many of the french monarchs henry iv and napoleon were fond of giving these in grand style and in some sort of grand style they persist even as a great social function to our own time the court balls of louis xiii and xiv at versailles were really gorgeous ballets and their grandeur was astonishing this custom was continued under the succeeding monarchs an illustration of one in the eighteenth century by august de laubin fig 54 sufficiently shows their character there is nothing new in the postures illustrated which may have originated thousands of years ago as illustrating the popular ball of the period the design by hogarth fig 55 is an excellent contrast the contredanse represented was originally the old country dance exported to france and returned with certain arrangements added this is a topic we need not pursue farther as almost every reader knows what social dancing now is

illustration fig 59dancing close of the 18th century from derby ware illustration fig 60spanish dance in the hall of saragoza 19th century chapter vi the modern theatre dance although the theatrical ballet dance is comparatively modern the elements of its formation are of the greatest antiquity the chorus of dancers and the performances of the men in the egyptian chapters represent without much doubt public dancing performances we get singing dancing mimicry and pantomime in the early stages of greek art and the development of the dance rhythm in music is equally ancient the alexandrine pantomime introduced into rome about 30 bc by bathillus and pylades appears to have been an entertainment approaching the ballet in the middle ages there were the mysteries and masks the latter were frequent in england and are introduced by shakespere in henry viii in italy there appears to have been a kind of ballet in the 14th century and from italy under the influence of catharine de medici came the ballet balthasar di beaujoyeulx produced the first recorded ballet in france in the italian style in 1582 this was however essentially a court ballet the theatre ballet apparently arose out of these court ballets henry iii and henry iv the latter especially were very fond of these entertainments and many italians were brought to france to assist in them pompeo diabono a savoyard was brought to paris in 1554 to regulate the court ballets at a later date came rinuccini the poet a florentine as was probably caccini the musician they had composed and produced the little operetta of daphne which had been performed in florence in 1597 under these lastmentioned masters the ballet in france took somewhat of its present form this passion for court ballets continued under louis xiii and louis xiv illustration fig 61mlle de camargo after a painting by lancret about 1740 ad louis xiii as a youth danced in one of the ballets at st germain it is said at the desire of richelieu who was an expert in spectacle it appears that he was encouraged in these amusements to remedy fits of melancholy louis xiv at seven danced in a masquerade and afterwards not only danced in the ballet of cassandra in 1651 but did all he could to raise the condition of the dance and encourage dancing and music his influence combined with that of cardinal richelieu raised the ballet from gross and trivial styles to a dignity worthy of music poetry and dancing his uncle gaston of orleans still patronized the grosser style but it became eclipsed by the better lulli composed music to the words of molire and other celebrities amongst notable works then produced was the andromeda of corneille a tragedy with hymns and dances executed in 1650 at the petit bourbon illustration fig 62pauline duvernay at covent garden 18331838 the foundation of the theatrical ballet was however at the instigation of mazarin to prevent a lowering of tone in the establishment of the acadmie de danse under thirteen academicians in 1661 this appears to have been merged into the acadmie royale de musique et de danse in 1669 which provided a proper training for dbutants under mm perrin and cambert whilst beauchamp the master of the court ballets had charge of the dancing the first operaballet the pomona of perrin and cambert was produced in 1671 to this succeeded many works of lulli to whom is attributed the increased speed in dance music and dancing that of the court ballets having been slow and stately illustration fig 63mlle fanny ellsler from a lithograph by a lacaucbie the great production of the period appears to have been the triumph of love in 1681 with twenty scenes and seven hundred performers amongst these were many of the nobility and some excellent ballerine such as pesaut carr leclerc and lafontaine a detailed history of the ballet is however impossible here and we must proceed to touch only on salient points it passed from the court to the theatre about 1680 and had two characteristics one with feminine dancers the other without illustration fig 63adancing satyr playing castanets by myron in the vatican museum the action is entirely suggestive of that of fanny ellsler and might be evidence of the antiquity of the spanish tradition it is not a little curious that wearing the mask a revival of the antique was practised in some of these ballets the history of the operaballet of those days gives to us many celebrated names of musicians such as destouches who gave new verve to ballet music and rameau jean georges noverre abolished the singing and established the fiveact ballet on its own footing in 1776 in this it appears he had partly the advice of garrick whom he met in london the names of the celebrated dancers are numerous such as pcourt blaudy who taught mlle camargo laval vestris germain prevost lafontaine and camargo fig 61 of the 18th century taglioni grisi duvernay cerito ellsler etc of the 19th century to those of our own day a fair notice of all of these would be a work in itself illustration fig 64mlle taglioni from a lithograph of the period the introduction of the ballet into england was as late as 1734 when the french dancers mlle sall the rival of mlle camargo and mlle de subligny made a great success at covent garden in ariadne and galatea and mlle salle danced in her own choregraphic invention of pygmalion since which time it has been popular in england when those of the first class can be obtained there are however some interesting and romantic circumstances connected with the ballet in london in the last century which it will not be out of place to record here amongst the dancers of the last century of considerable celebrity were two already mentioned mlles duvernay fig 62 and taglioni fig 64 whose names are recorded in the classic verse of ingoldsby malibrans dead duvernays fled taglioni has not yet arrived in her stead illustration fig 65pas de trois by mlles ferraris taglioni and carlotta grisi mlle duvernay was a parisian and commenced her study under barrez but subsequently was under vestris and taglioni the father of the celebrity mentioned in the verse illustration fig 66mlle adeline gene 1906 photo ellis and walery duran hangs over the mantelpiece of the refectory of the presbytery illustration fig 67mlle anna pavlova 1910 from a photo by foulsham and banfield having made a great parisian reputation she came to london in 1833 and from that date until 1837 held the town when she married mr stephens lyne stephens mp a gentleman of considerable wealth but was left a childless widow in 1861 and retired to her estate at lyneford hall norfolk living in retirement and spending her time in good works she is said to have spent 100000 in charities and churches and that at cambridge dedicated to the english martyrs was founded completed and endowed by her she led a blameless and worthy life and died in 1894 her portrait by mlle taglioni fig 64 her cocelebrity married count gilbert de voisins a french nobleman in 1847 and with her marriage came an ample fortune unfortunately the bulk of this fortune was lost in the francogerman war with the courage of her character the countess returned to london and gave lessons in dancing etc in which she was sufficiently successful to obtain a fair living she died in 1884 at 80 years of age of the other celebrities of the periodcarlotta grisi ferraris fig 65 and fanny ellsler fig 63some illustrations are given besides these were fanny cerito lucile grahn a dane and some others of lesser notoriety performing in london at this great period of the ballet illustration fig 68mlle sophie fdorova the recent encouragement of the classic ballet has introduced us to some exquisite dancers amongst these are mlle adeline gene fig 66 and mlle anna pavlova fig 67 the latter with m mordkin and a corps of splendid dancers are from russia from whence also comes the important troupe now at the alhambra with mlle geltzer and other excellent dancers the celebrated company at covent garden and lydia kyasht at the empire are also russian it is not surprising that we get excellent dancing from russia the school formed by peter the great about 1698 has been under state patronage ever since notices of all the important dancers from italy spain paris or elsewhere performing in england in recent years would occupy considerable space and the reader can easily obtain information concerning them elsewhere that the technique and speed of the classic dance has considerably increased is historically certain and we must hope that this speed will not sacrifice graceful movement moreover technique alone will not make the complete fineartist some invention is involved unfortunately some modern attempts at invention seem crude and sensational whilst lacking the exquisite technique desirable in all exhibitions of finished art before concluding it is almost imperative to say something about the naked foot dancers followers of isidora duncan some critics and a certain public have welcomed them but is it not sham antique it does not remind one of the really classic moreover the naked foot should be of antique beauty which in most of these cases it is not advertisements tell us that these dance are interpretations of classic musicchopin weber brahms etc they are not really interpretations but distractions we can hardly imagine that these composers intended their work for actual dancing one can listen and be entranced one sees the dancers interpretations or translations and the music is degraded to a series of sham classic postures the idea that running about the stage in diaphanous costumes with conventional mimicry and arm action is classic or beautiful is a mistake the term aesthetic may cover but not redeem it there is not even the art of the ordinary balletdancer discernible in these proceedings on another plane are such as the ballets in don giovanni and faust mozart and gounod wrote these with a full knowledge of the method of interpretation and the persons who had been trained for that purposethe performers fit the music and it fits them this operaballet is also more in accordance with tradition before the time of noverre neither do the popular and curious exhibitions of loie fuller strike one as having a classic character or future of any consideration pretty as they may be the operetta or musical comedy has given us some excellent art especially at the end of the 19th century when sylvia gray kate vaughan letty lind topsy sinden and others of like mtier gave us skirt and drapery dancing this introduces us to the question of costume that commonly used by the prima ballerina is certainly not graceful it was apparently introduced about 1830 presumably to show the action and finished method of the lower extremities if fanny ellsler and duvernay could excel without this ugly contrivance why is it necessary for others at the same time it is better than indifferent imitations of the greek or a return to the debased characteristics of pompeiian art in which the effect of the classic and fine character of the material are rendered in a sort of transparent muslin with these notices the authors object in this sketch is completed of the balmasqu garden dances public balls and suchlike he has no intention to treat they are not classic dancing nor art with the exception perhaps of the scottish reels nor is he interested in the dancing of savage tribes nor in that of the east although some few illustrations are given to illustrate traditions for example the use of the pipe and tabor in patagonia the dancer from japan winged like that in the roman de la rose fig 40 and the religious dance of tibet showing the survival of the religious
