published in two volumes instead of as heretofore in one the first volume deals almost exclusively with the laws and phenomena of matter the second trenches upon questions in which the phenomena of matter interlace more or less with those of mind new essays have been added while old ones have been revised and in part recast to be clear without being superficial has been my aim throughout in neither volume have i aspired to sit in the seat of the scornful but rather to treat the questions touched upon with a tolerance if not a reverence befitting their difficulty and weight holding as i do the nebular hypothesis i am logically bound to deduce the life of the world from forces inherent in the nebula with this view which is set forth in the second volume it seemed but fair to associate the reasons which cause me to conclude that every attempt made in our day to generate life independently of antecedent life has utterly broken down a discourse on the electric light winds up the second volume the incongruity of its position is to be referred to the lateness of its delivery vol i inorganic nature i the constitution of nature footnote fortnightly review 1865 vol iii p 129 we cannot think of space as finite for wherever in imagination we erect a boundary we are compelled to think of space as existing beyond it thus by the incessant dissolution of limits we arrive at a more or less adequate idea of the infinity of space but though compelled to think of space as unbounded there is no mental necessity compelling us to think of it either as filled or empty whether it is so or not must be decided by experiment and observation that it is not entirely void the starry heavens declare but the question still remains are the stars themselves hung in vacuo are the vast regions which surround them and across which their light is propagated absolutely empty a century ago the answer to this question founded on the newtonian theory would have been no for particles of light are incessantly shot through space the reply of modern science is also negative but on different grounds it has the best possible reasons for rejecting the idea of luminiferous particles but in support of the conclusion that the celestial spaces are occupied by matter it is able to offer proofs almost as cogent as those which can be adduced of the existence of an atmosphere round the earth mens minds indeed rose to a conception of the celestial and universal atmosphere through the study of the terrestrial and local one from the phenomena of sound as displayed in the air they ascended to the phenomena of light as displayed in the aether which is the name given to the interstellar medium the notion of this medium must not be considered as a vague or fanciful conception on the part of scientific men of its reality most of them are as convinced as they are of the existence of the sun and moon the luminiferous aether has definite mechanical properties it is almost infinitely more attenuated than any known gas but its properties are those of a solid rather than of a gas it resembles jelly rather than air this was not the first conception of the aether but it is that forced upon us by a more complete knowledge of its phenomena a body thus constituted may have its boundaries but although the aether may not be coextensive with space it must at all events extend as far as the most distant visible stars in fact it is the vehicle of their light and without it they could not be seen this allpervading substance takes up their molecular tremors and conveys them with inconceivable rapidity to our organs of vision it is the transported shiver of bodies countless millions of miles distant which translates itself in human consciousness into the splendour of the firmament at night if the aether have a boundary masses of ponderable matter might be conceived to exist beyond it but they could emit no light beyond the aether dark suns might burn there under proper conditions combustion might be carried on fuel might consume unseen and metals be fused in invisible fires a body moreover once heated there would continue for ever heated a sun or planet once molten would continue for ever molten for the loss of heat being simply the abstraction of molecular motion by the aether where this medium is absent no cooling could occur a sentient being on approaching a heated body in this region would be conscious of no augmentation of temperature the gradations of warmth dependent on the laws of radiation would not exist and actual contact would first reveal the heat of an extra ethereal sun imagine a paddlewheel placed in water and caused to rotate from it as a centre waves would issue in all directions and a wader as he approached the place of disturbance would be met by stronger and stronger waves this gradual augmentation of the impression made upon the wader is exactly analogous to the augmentation of light when we approach a luminous source in the one case however the coarse common nerves of the body suffice for the other we must have the finer optic nerve but suppose the water withdrawn the action at a distance would then cease and as far as the sense of touch is concerned the wader would be first rendered conscious of the motion of the wheel by the blow of the paddles the transference of motion from the paddles to the water is mechanically similar to the transference of molecular motion from the heated body to the aether and the propagation of waves through the liquid is mechanically similar to the propagation of light and radiant heat as far as our knowledge of space extends we are to conceive it as the holder of the luminiferous aether through which are interspersed at enormous distances apart the ponderous nuclei of the stars associated with the star that most concerns us we have a group of dark planetary masses revolving at various distances round it each again rotating on its own axis and finally associated with some of these planets we have dark bodies of minor notethe moons whether the other fixed stars have similar planetary companions or not is to us a matter of pure conjecture which may or may not enter into our conception of the universe but probably every thoughtful person believes with regard to those distant suns that there is in space something besides our system on which they shine from this general view of the present condition of space and of the bodies contained in it we pass to the enquiry whether things were so created at the beginning was space furnished at once by the fiat of omnipotence with these burning orbs in presence of the revelations of science this view is fading more and more behind the orbs we now discern the nebulae from which they have been condensed and without going so far back as the nebulae the man of science can prove that out of common nonluminous matter this whole pomp of stars might have been evolved the law of gravitation enunciated by newton is that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force which diminishes as the square of the distance increases thus the sun and the earth mutually pull each other thus the earth and the moon are kept in company the force which holds every respective pair of masses together being the integrated force of their component parts under the operation of this force a stone falls to the ground and is warmed by the shock under its operation meteors plunge into our atmosphere and rise to incandescence showers of such meteors doubtless fall incessantly upon the sun acted on by this force the earth were it stopped in its orbit tomorrow would rush towards and finally combine with the sun heat would also be developed by this collision mayer first and helmholtz and thomson afterwards have calculated its amount it would equal that produced by the combustion of more than 5000 worlds of solid coal all this heat being generated at the instant of collision in the attraction of gravity therefore acting upon nonluminous matter we have a source of heat more powerful than could be derived from any terrestrial combustion and were the matter of the universe thrown in cold detached fragments into space and there abandoned to the mutual gravitation of its own parts the collision of the fragments would in the end produce the fires of the stars the action of gravity upon matter originally cold may in fact be the origin of all light and heat and also the proximate source of such other powers as are generated by light and heat but we have now to enquire what is the light and what is the heat thus produced this question has already been answered in a general way both light and heat are modes of motion two planets clash and come to rest their motion considered as that of masses is destroyed but it is in great part continued as a motion of their ultimate particles it is this latter motion taken up by the aether and propagated through it with a velocity of 186000 miles a second that comes to us as the light and heat of suns and stars the atoms of a hot body swing with inconceivable rapiditybillions of times in a secondbut this power of vibration necessarily implies the operation of forces between the atoms themselves it reveals to us that while they are held together by one force they are kept asunder by another their position at any moment depending on the equilibrium of attraction and repulsion the atoms behave as if connected by elastic springs which oppose at the same time their approach and their retreat but which tolerate the vibration called heat the molecular vibration once set up is instantly shared with the aether and diffused by it throughout space we on the earths surface live night and day in the midst of aethereal commotion the medium is never still the cloud canopy above us may be thick enough to shut out the light of the stars but this canopy is itself a warm body which radiates its thermal motion through the aether the earth also is warm and sends its heatpulses incessantly forth it is the waste of its molecular motion in space that chills the earth upon a clear night it is the return of thermal motion from the clouds which prevents the earths temperature on a cloudy night from falling so low to the conception of space being filled we must therefore add the conception of its being in a state of incessant tremor the sources of this vibration are the ponderable masses of the universe let us take a sample of these and examine it in detail when we look to our planet we find it to be an aggregate of solids liquids and gases subjected to a sufficiently low temperature the two last would also assume the solid form when we look at any one of these we generally find it composed of still more elementary parts we learn for example that the water of our rivers is formed by the union in definite proportions of two gases oxygen and hydrogen we know how to bring these constituents together so as to form water we also know how to analyse the water and recover from it its two constituents so likewise as regards the solid portions of the earth our chalk hills for example are formed by a combination of carbon oxygen and calcium these are the socalled elements the union of which in definite proportions has resulted in the formation of chalk the flints within the chalk we know to be a compound of oxygen and silicium called silica and our ordinary clay is for the most part formed by the union of silicium oxygen and the wellknown light metal aluminium by far the greater portion of the earths crust is compounded of the elementary substances mentioned in these few lines the principle of gravitation has been already described as an attraction which every particle of matter however small exerts on every other particle with gravity there is no selection no particular atoms choose by preference other particular atoms as objects of attraction the attraction of gravitation is proportional simply to the quantity of the attracting matter regardless of its quality but in the molecular world which we have now entered matters are otherwise arranged here we have atoms between which a strong attraction is exercised and also atoms between which a weak attraction is exercised one atom can jostle another out of its place in virtue of a superior force of attraction but though the amount of force exerted varies thus from atom to atom it is still an attraction of the same mechanical quality if i may use the term as that of gravity itself its intensity might be measured in the same way namely by the amount of motion which it can generate in a certain time thus the attraction of gravity at the earths surface is expressed by the number 32 because when acting freely on a body for a second of time gravity imparts to the body a velocity of thirtytwo feet a second in like manner the mutual attraction of oxygen and hydrogen might be measured by the velocity imparted to the atoms in their rushing together of course such a unit of time as a second is not here to be thought of the whole interval required by the atoms to cross the minute spaces which separate them amounting only to an inconceivably small fraction of a second it has been stated that when a body falls to the earth it is warmed by the shock here to use the terminology of mayer we have a mechanical combination of the earth and the body let us suffer the falling body and the earth to dwindle in imagination to the size of atoms and for the attraction of gravity let us substitute that of chemical affinity we have then what is called a chemical combination the effect of the union in this case also is the development of heat and from the amount of heat generated we can infer the intensity of the atomic pull measured by ordinary mechanical standards this is enormous mix eight pounds of oxygen with one of hydrogen and pass a spark through the mixture the gases instantly combine their atoms rushing over the little distances which separate them take a weight of 47000 pounds to an elevation of 1000 feet above the earths surface and let it fall the energy with which it will strike the earth will not exceed that of the eight pounds of oxygen atoms as they dash against one pound of hydrogen atoms to form water it is sometimes stated that gravity is distinguished from all other forces by the fact of its resisting conversion into other forms of force chemical affinity it is said can be converted into heat and light and these again into magnetism and electricity but gravity refuses to be so converted being a force maintaining itself under all circumstances and not capable of disappearing to give place to another the statement arises from vagueness of thought if by it be meant that a particle of matter can never be deprived of its weight the assertion is correct but the law which affirms the convertibility of natural forces was never intended in the minds of those who understood it to affirm that such a conversion as that here implied occurs in any case whatever as regards convertibility into heat gravity and chemical affinity stand on precisely the same footing the attraction in the one case is as indestructible as in the other nobody affirms that when a stone rests upon the surface of the earth the mutual attraction of the earth and stone is abolished nobody means to affirm that the mutual attraction of oxygen for hydrogen ceases after the atoms have combined to form water what is meant in the case of chemical affinity is that the pull of that affinity acting through a certain space imparts a motion of translation of the one atom towards the other this motion is not heat nor is the force that produces it heat but when the atoms strike and recoil the motion of translation is converted into a motion of vibration which is heat the vibration however so far from causing the extinction of the original attraction is in part carried on by that attraction the atoms recoil in virtue of the elastic force which opposes actual contact and in the recoil they are driven too far back the original attraction then triumphs over the force of recoil and urges the atoms once more together thus like a pendulum they oscillate until their motion is imparted to the surrounding aether or in other words until their heat becomes radiant heat in this sense and in this sense only is chemical affinity converted into heat there is first of all the attraction between the atoms there is secondly space between them across this space the attraction urges them they collide they recoil they oscillate there is here a change in the form of the motion but there is no real loss it is so with the attraction of gravity to produce motion by gravity space must also intervene between the attracting bodies when they strike together motion is apparently destroyed but in reality there is no destruction their atoms are suddenly urged together by the shock by their own perfect elasticity these atoms recoil and thus is set up the molecular oscillation which when communicated to the proper nerves announces itself as heat it was formerly universally supposed that by the collision of unelastic bodies force was destroyed men saw for example that when two spheres of clay painters putty or lead for example were urged together the motion possessed by the masses prior to impact was more or less annihilated they believed in an absolute destruction of the force of impact until recent times indeed no difficulty was experienced in believing this whereas at present the ideas of force and its destruction refuse to be united in most philosophic minds in the collision of elastic bodies on the contrary it was observed that the motion with which they clashed together was in great part restored by the resiliency of the masses the more perfect the elasticity the more complete being the restitution this led to the idea of perfectly elastic bodiesbodies competent to restore by their recoil the whole of the motion which they possessed before impactand this again to the idea of the conservation of force as opposed to that destruction of force which was supposed to occur when unelastic bodies met in collision we now know that the principle of conservation holds equally good with elastic and unelastic bodies perfectly elastic bodies would develop no heat on collision they would retain their motion afterwards though its direction might be changed and it is only when sensible motion is wholly or partly destroyed that heat is generated this always occurs in unelastic collision the heat developed being the exact equivalent of the sensible motion extinguished this heat virtually declares that the property of elasticity denied to the masses exists among their atoms by the recoil and oscillation of which the principle of conservation is vindicated but ambiguity in the use of the term force makes itself more and more felt as we proceed we have called the attraction of gravity a force without any reference to motion a body resting on a shelf is as much pulled by gravity as when after having been pushed off the shelf it falls towards the earth we applied the term force also to that molecular attraction which we called chemical affinity when however we spoke of the conservation of force in the case of elastic collision we meant neither a pull nor a push which as just indicated might be exerted upon inert matter but we meant force invested in motionthe vis viva as it is called of the colliding masses force in this form has a definite mechanical measure in the amount of work that it can perform the simplest form of work is the raising of a weight a man walking uphill or upstairs with a pound weight in his hand to an elevation say of sixteen feet performs a certain amount of work over and above the lifting of his own body if he carries the pound to a height of thirtytwo feet he does twice the work if to a height of fortyeight feet he does three times the work if to sixtyfour feet he does four times the work and so on if moreover he carries up two pounds instead of one other things being equal he does twice the work if three four or five pounds he does three four or five times the work in fact it is plain that the work performed depends on two factors the weight raised and the height to which it is raised it is expressed by the product of these two factors but a body may be caused to reach a certain elevation in opposition to the force of gravity without being actually carried up if a hodman for example wished to land a brick at an elevation of sixteen feet above the place where he stood he would probably pitch it up to the bricklayer he would thus impart by a sudden effort a velocity to the brick sufficient to raise it to the required height the work accomplished by that effort being precisely the same as if he had slowly carried up the brick the initial velocity to be imparted in this case is well known to reach a height of sixteen feet the brick must quit the mans hand with a velocity of thirtytwo feet a second it is needless to say that a body starting with any velocity would if wholly unopposed or unaided continue to move for ever with the same velocity but when as in the case before us the body is thrown upwards it moves in opposition to gravity which incessantly retards its motion and finally brings it to rest at an elevation of sixteen feet if not here caught by the bricklayer it would return to the hodman with an accelerated motion and reach his hand with the precise velocity it possessed on quitting it an important relation between velocity and work is here to be pointed out supposing the hodman competent to impart to the brick at starting a velocity of sixtyfour feet a second or twice its former velocity would the amount of work performed be twice what it was in the first instance no it would be four times that quantity for a body starting with twice the velocity of another will rise to four times the height in like manner a threefold velocity will give a ninefold elevation a fourfold velocity will give a sixteenfold elevation and so on the height attained then is not proportional to the initial velocity but to the square of the velocity as before the work is also proportional to the weight elevated hence the work which any moving mass whatever is competent to perform in virtue of the motion which it at any moment possesses is jointly proportional to its weight and the square of its velocity here then we have a second measure of work in which we simply translate the idea of height into its equivalent idea of motion in mechanics the product of the mass of a moving body into the square of its velocity expresses what is called the vis viva or living force it is also sometimes called the mechanical effect if for example a cannon pointed to the zenith urge a ball upwards with twice the velocity imparted to a second ball the former will rise to four times the height attained by the latter if directed against a target it will also do four times the execution hence the importance of imparting a high velocity to projectiles in war having thus cleared our way to a perfectly definite conception of the vis viva of moving masses we are prepared for the announcement that the heat generated by the shock of a falling body against the earth is proportional to the vis viva annihilated the heat is proportional to the square of the velocity in the case therefore of two cannonballs of equal weight if one strike a target with twice the velocity of the other it will generate four times the heat if with three times the velocity it will generate nine times the heat and so on mr joule has shown that a pound weight falling from a height of 772 feet or 772 pounds falling through one foot will generate by its collision with the earth an amount of heat sufficient to raise a pound of water one degree fahrenheit in temperature 772 footpounds constitute the mechanical equivalent of heat now a body falling from a height of 772 feet has upon striking the earth a velocity of 223 feet a second and if this velocity were imparted to the body by any other means the quantity of heat generated by the stoppage of its motion would be that stated above six times that velocity or 1338 feet would not be an inordinate one for a cannonball as it quits the gun hence a cannonball moving with a velocity of 1338 feet a second would by collision generate an amount of heat competent to raise its own weight of water 36 degrees fahrenheit in temperature if composed of iron and if all the heat generated were concentrated in the ball itself its temperature would be raised about 360 degrees fahrenheit because one degree in the case of water is equivalent to about ten degrees in the case of iron in artillery practice the heat generated is usually concentrated upon the front of the bolt and on the portion of the target first struck by this concentration the heat developed becomes sufficiently intense to raise the dust of the metal to incandescence a flash of light often accompanying collision with the target let us now fix our attention for a moment on the gunpowder which urges the cannonball this is composed of combustible matter which if burnt in the open air would yield a certain amount of heat it will not yield this amount if it perform the work of urging a ball the heat then generated by the gunpowder will fall short of that produced in the open air by an amount equivalent to the vis viva of the ball and this exact amount is restored by the ball on its collision with the target in this perfect way are heat and mechanical motion connected broadly enunciated the principle of the conservation of force asserts that the quantity of force in the universe is as unalterable as the quantity of matter that it is alike impossible to create force and to annihilate it but in what sense are we to understand this assertion it would be manifestly inapplicable to the force of gravity as defined by newton for this is a force varying inversely as the square of the distance and to affirm the constancy of a varying force would be selfcontradictory yet when the question is properly understood gravity forms no exception to the law of conservation following the method pursued by helmholtz i will here attempt an elementary exposition of this law though destined in its applications to produce momentous changes in human thought it is not difficult of comprehension for the sake of simplicity we will consider a particle of matter which we may call f to be perfectly fixed and a second movable particle d placed at a distance from f we will assume that these two particles attract each other according to the newtonian law at a certain distance the attraction is of a certain definite amount which might be determined by means of a spring balance at half this distance the attraction would be augmented four times at a third of the distance nine times at onefourth of the distance sixteen times and so on in every case the attraction might be measured by determining with the spring balance the amount of tension just sufficient to prevent d from moving towards f thus far we have nothing whatever to do with motion we deal with statics not with dynamics we simply take into account the distance of d from f and the pull exerted by gravity at that distance it is customary in mechanics to represent the magnitude of a force by a line of a certain length a force of double magnitude being represented by a line of double length and so on placing then the particle d at a distance from f we can in imagination draw a straight line from d to f and at d erect a perpendicular to this line which shall represent the amount of the attraction exerted on d if d be at a very great distance from f the attraction will be very small and the perpendicular consequently very short if the distance be practically infinite the attraction is practically nil let us now suppose at every point in the line joining f and d a perpendicular to be erected proportional in length to the attraction exerted at that point we thus obtain an infinite number of perpendiculars of gradually increasing length as d approaches f uniting the ends of all these perpendiculars we obtain a curve and between this curve and the straight line joining f and d we have an area containing all the perpendiculars placed side by side each one of this infinite series of perpendiculars representing an attraction or tension as it is sometimes called the area just referred to represents the sum of the tensions exerted upon the particle d during its passage from its first position to f up to the present point we have been dealing with tensions not with motion thus far vis viva has been entirely foreign to our contemplation of d and f let us now suppose d placed at a practically infinite distance from f here as stated the pull of gravity would be infinitely small and the perpendicular representing it would dwindle almost to a point in this position the sum of the tensions capable of being exerted on d would be a maximum let d now begin to move in obedience to the infinitesimal attraction exerted upon it motion being once set up the idea of vis viva arises in moving towards f the particle d consumes as it were the tensions let us fix our attention on d at any point of the path over which it is moving between that point and f there is a quantity of unused tensions beyond that point the tensions have been all consumed but we have in their place an equivalent quantity of vis viva after d has passed any point the tension previously in store at that point disappears but not without having added during the infinitely small duration of its action a due amount of motion to that previously possessed by d the nearer d approaches to f the smaller is the sum of the tensions remaining but the greater is the vis viva the farther d is from f the greater is the sum of the unconsumed tensions and the less is the living force now the principle of conservation affirms not the constancy of the value of the tensions of gravity nor yet the constancy of the vis viva taken separately but the absolute constancy of the value of both taken together at the beginning the vis viva was zero and the tension area was a maximum close to f the vis viva is a maximum while the tension area is zero at every other point the workproducing power of the particle d consists in part of vis viva and in part of tensions if gravity instead of being attraction were repulsion then with the particles in contact the sum of the tensions between d and f would be a maximum and the vis viva zero if in obedience to the repulsion d moved away from f vis viva would be generated and the farther d retreated from f the greater would be its vis viva and the less the amount of tension still available for producing motion taking repulsion as well as attraction into account the principle of the conservation of force affirms that the mechanical value of the tensions and vires vivae of the material universe so far as we know it is a constant quantity the universe in short possesses two kinds of property which are mutually convertible the diminution of either carries with it the enhancement of the other the total value of the property remaining unchanged the considerations here applied to gravity apply equally to chemical affinity in a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen the atoms exist apart but by the application of proper means they may be caused to rush together across that space that separates them while this space exists and as long as the atoms have not begun to move towards each other we have tensions and nothing else during their motion towards each other the tensions as in the case of gravity are converted into vis viva after they clash we have still vis viva but in another form it was translation it is vibration it was molecular transfer it is heat it is possible to reverse these processes to unlock the combined atoms and replace them in their first positions but to accomplish this as much heat would be required as was generated by their union such reversals occur daily and hourly in nature by the solar waves the oxygen of water is divorced from its hydrogen in the leaves of plants as molecular vis viva the waves disappear but in so doing they reendow the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen with tension the atoms are thus enabled to recombine and when they do so they restore the precise amount of heat consumed in their separation the same remarks apply to the compound of carbon and oxygen called carbonic acid which is exhaled from our lungs produced by our fires and found sparingly diffused everywhere throughout the air in the leaves of plants the sunbeams also wrench the atoms of carbonic acid asunder and sacrifice themselves in the act but when the plants are burnt the amount of heat consumed in their production is restored this then is the rhythmic play of nature as regards her forces throughout all her regions she oscillates from tension to vis viva from vis viva to tension we have the same play in the planetary system the earths orbit is an ellipse one of the foci of which is occupied by the sun imagine the earth at the most distant part of the orbit her motion and consequently her vis viva is then a minimum the planet rounds the curve and begins its approach to the sun in front it has a store of tensions which are gradually consumed an equivalent amount of vis viva being generated when nearest to the sun the motion and consequently the vis viva reach a maximum but here the available tensions have been used up the earth rounds this portion of the curve and retreats from the sun tensions are now stored up but vis viva is lost to be again restored at the expense of the complementary force on the opposite side of the curve thus beats the heart of the universe but without increase or diminution of its total stock of force i have thus far tried to steer clear amid confusion by fixing the mind of the reader upon things rather than upon names but good names are essential and here as yet we are not provided with such we have had the force of gravity and living forcetwo utterly distinct things we have had pulls and tensions and we might have had the force of heat the force of light the force of magnetism or the force of electricityall of which terms have been employed more or less loosely by writers on physics this confusion is happily avoided by the introduction of the term energy which embraces both tension and vis viva energy is possessed by bodies already in motion it is then actual and we agree to call it actual or dynamic energy it is our old vis viva on the other hand energy is possible to bodies not in motion but which in virtue of attraction or repulsion possess a power of motion which would realise itself if all hindrances were removed looking for example at gravity a body on the earths surface in a position from which it cannot fall to a lower one possesses no energy it has neither motion nor power of motion but the same body suspended at a height above the earth has a power of motion though it may not have exercised it energy is possible to such a body and we agree to call this potential energy it consists of our old tensions we moreover speak of the conservation of energy instead of the conservation of force and say that the sum of the potential and dynamic energies of the material universe is a constant quantity a body cast upwards consumes the actual energy of projection and lays up potential energy when it reaches its utmost height all its actual energy is consumed its potential energy being then a maximum when it returns there is a reconversion of the potential into the actual a pendulum at the limit of its swing possesses potential energy at the lowest point of its arc its energy is all actual a patch of snow resting on a mountain slope has potential energy loosened and shooting down as an avalanche it possesses dynamic energy the pinetrees growing on the alps have potential energy but rushing down the holzrinne of the woodcutters they possess actual energy the same is true of the mountains themselves as long as the rocks which compose them can fall to a lower level they possess potential energy which is converted into actual when the frost ruptures their cohesion and hands them over to the action of gravity the stone avalanches of the matterhorn and weisshorn are illustrations in point the hammer of the great bell of westminster when raised before striking possesses potential energy when it falls the energy becomes dynamic and after the stroke we have the rhythmic play of potential and dynamic in the vibrations of the bell the same holds good for the molecular oscillations of a heated body an atom is driven against its neighbour and recoils the ultimate amplitude of the recoil being attained the motion of the atom in that direction is checked and for an instant its energy is all potential it is then drawn towards its neighbour with accelerated speed thus by attraction converting its potential into dynamic energy its motion in this direction is also finally checked and again for an instant its energy is all potential it once more retreats converting by repulsion its potential into dynamic energy till the latter attains a maximum after which it is again changed into potential energy thus what is true of the earth as she swings to and fro in her yearly journey round the sun is also true of her minutest atom we have wheels within wheels and rhythm within rhythm when a body is heated a change of molecular arrangement always occurs and to produce this change heat is consumed hence a portion only of the heat communicated to the body remains as dynamic energy looking back on some of the statements made at the beginning of this article now that our knowledge is more extensive we see the necessity of qualifying them when for example two bodies clash heat is generated but the heat or molecular dynamic energy developed at the moment of collision is not the exact equivalent of the sensible dynamic energy destroyed the true equivalent is this heat plus the potential energy conferred upon the molecules by the placing of greater distances between them this molecular potential energy is afterwards on the cooling of the body converted into heat wherever two atoms capable of uniting together by their mutual attractions exist separately they form a store of potential energy thus our woods forests and coalfields on the one hand and our atmospheric oxygen on the other constitute a vast store of energy of this kindvast but far from infinite we have besides our coalfields metallic bodies more or less sparsely distributed through the earths crust these bodies can be oxydised and hence they are so far as they go stores of energy but the attractions of the great mass of the earths crust are already satisfied and from them no further energy can possibly be obtained ages ago the elementary constituents of our rocks clashed together and produced the motion of heat which was taken up by the aether and carried away through stellar space it is lost for ever as far as we are concerned in those ages the hot conflict of carbon oxygen and calcium produced the chalk and limestone hills which are now cold and from this carbon oxygen and calcium no further energy can be derived so it is with almost all the other constituents of the earths crust they took their present form in obedience to molecular force they turned their potential energy into dynamic and yielded it as radiant heat to the universe ages before man appeared upon this planet for him a residue of potential energy remains vast truly in relation to the life and wants of an individual but exceedingly minute in comparison with the earths primitive store to sum up the whole stock of energy or workingpower in the world consists of attractions repulsions and motions if the attractions and repulsions be so circumstanced as to be able to produce motion they are sources of workingpower but not otherwise as stated a moment ago the attraction exerted between the earth and a body at a distance from the earths surface is a source of workingpower because the body can be moved by the attraction and in falling can perform work when it rests at its lowest level it is not a source of power or energy because it can fall no farther but though it has ceased to be a source of energy the attraction of gravity still acts as a force which holds the earth and weight together the same remarks apply to attracting atoms and molecules as long as distance separates them they can move across it in obedience to the attraction and the motion thus produced may by proper appliances be caused to perform mechanical work when for example two atoms of hydrogen unite with one of oxygen to form water the atoms are first drawn towards each otherthey move they clash and then by virtue of their resiliency they recoil and quiver to this quivering motion we give the name of heat this atomic vibration is merely the redistribution of the motion produced by the chemical affinity and this is the only sense in which chemical affinity can be said to be converted into heat we must not imagine the chemical attraction destroyed or converted into anything else for the atoms when mutually clasped to form a molecule of water are held together by the very attraction which first drew them towards each other that which has really been expended is the pull exerted through the space by which the distance between the atoms has been diminished if this be understood it will be at once seen that gravity as before insisted on may in this sense be said to be convertible into heat that it is in reality no more an outstanding and inconvertible agent as it is sometimes stated to be than is chemical affinity by the exertion of a certain pull through a certain space a body is caused to clash with a certain definite velocity against the earth heat is thereby developed and this is the only sense in which gravity can be said to be converted into heat in no case is the force which produces the motion annihilated or changed into anything else the mutual attraction of the earth and weight exists when they are in contact as when they were separate but the ability of that attraction to employ itself in the production of motion does not exist the transformation in this case is easily followed by the minds eye first the weight as a whole is set in motion by the attraction of gravity this motion of the mass is arrested by collision with the earth being broken up into molecular tremors to which we give the name of heat and when we reverse the process and employ those tremors of heat to raise a weightwhich is done through the intermediation of an elastic fluid in the steamenginea certain definite portion of the molecular motion is consumed in this sense and in this sense only can the heat be said to be converted into gravity or more correctly into potential energy of gravity here the destruction of the heat has created no new attraction but the old attraction has conferred upon it a power of exerting a certain definite pull between the startingpoint of the falling weight and the earth when therefore writers on the conservation of energy speak of tensions being consumed and generated they do not mean thereby that old attractions have been annihilated and new ones brought into existence but that in the one case the power of the attraction to produce motion has been diminished by the shortening of the distance between the attracting bodies while in the other case the power of producing motion has been augmented by the increase of the distance these remarks apply to all bodies whether they be sensible masses or molecules of the inner quality that enables matter to attract matter we know nothing and the law of conservation makes no statement regarding that quality it takes the facts of attraction as they stand and affirms only the constancy of workingpower that power may exist in the form of motion or it may exist in the form of force with distance to act through the former is dynamic energy the latter is potential energy the constancy of the sum of both being affirmed by the law of conservation the convertibility of natural forces consists solely in transformations of dynamic into potential and of potential into dynamic energy in no other sense has the convertibility of force any scientific meaning grave errors have been entertained as to what is really intended to be conserved by the doctrine of conservation this exposition i hope will tend to remove them ii radiation footnote the rede lecture delivered in the senate house before the university of cambridge may 16 1865 1 visible and invisible radiation between the mind of man and the outer world are interposed the nerves of the human body which translate or enable the mind to translate the impressions of that world into facts of consciousness and thought different nerves are suited to the perception of different impressions we do not see with the ear nor hear with the eye nor are we rendered sensible of sound by the nerves of the tongue out of the general assemblage of physical actions each nerve or group of nerves selects and responds to those for the perception of which it is specially organised the optic nerve passes from the brain to the back of the eyeball and there spreads out to form the retina a web of nerve filaments on which the images of external objects are projected by the optical portion of the eye this nerve is limited to the apprehension of the phenomena of radiation and notwithstanding its marvellous sensibility to certain impressions of this class it is singularly obtuse to other impressions nor does the optic nerve embrace the entire range even of radiation some rays when they reach it are incompetent to evoke its power while others never reach it at all being absorbed by the humours of the eye to all rays which whether they reach the retina or not fail to excite vision we give the name of invisible or obscure rays all nonluminous bodies emit such rays there is no body in nature absolutely cold and every body not absolutely cold emits rays of heat but to render radiant heat fit to affect the optic nerve a certain temperature is necessary a cool poker thrust into a fire remains dark for a time but when its temperature has become equal to that of the surrounding coals it glows like them in like manner if a current of electricity of gradually increasing strength be sent through a wire of the refractory metal platinum the wire first becomes sensibly warm to the touch for a time its heat augments still however remaining obscure at length we can no longer touch the metal with impunity and at a certain definite temperature it emits a feeble red light as the current augments in power the light augments in brilliancy until finally the wire appears of a dazzling white the light which it now emits is similar to that of the sun by means of a prism sir isaac newton unravelled the texture of solar light and by the same simple instrument we can investigate the luminous changes of our platinum wire in passing through the prism all its rays and they are infinite in variety are bent or refracted from their straight course and as different rays are differently refracted by the prism we are by it enabled to separate one class of rays from another by such prismatic analysis dr draper has shown that when the platinum wire first begins to glow the light emitted is sensibly red as the glow augments the red becomes more brilliant but at the same time orange rays are added to the emission augmenting the temperature still further yellow rays appear beside the orange after the yellow green rays are emitted and after the green come in succession blue indigo and violet rays to display all these colours at the same time the platinum wire must be whitehot the impression of whiteness being in fact produced by the simultaneous action of all these colours on the optic nerve in the experiment just described we began with a platinum wire at an ordinary temperature and gradually raised it to a white heat at the beginning and even before the electric current had acted at all upon the wire it emitted invisible rays for some time after the action of the current had commenced and even for a time after the wire had become intolerable to the touch its radiation was still invisible the question now arises what becomes of these invisible rays when the visible ones make their appearance it will be proved in the sequel that they maintain themselves in the radiation that a ray once emitted continues to be emitted when the temperature is increased and hence the emission from our platinum wire even when it has attained its maximum brilliancy consists of a mixture of visible and invisible rays if instead of the platinum wire the earth itself were raised to incandescence the obscure radiation which it now emits would continue to be emitted to reach incandescence the planet would have to pass through all the stages of nonluminous radiation and the final emission would embrace the rays of all these stages there can hardly be a doubt that from the sun itself rays proceed similar in kind to those which the dark earth pours nightly into space in fact the various kind of obscure rays emitted by all the planets of our system are included in the present radiation of the sun the great pioneer in this domain of science was sir william herschel causing a beam of solar light to pass through a prism he resolved it into its coloured constituents he formed what is technically called the solar spectrum exposing thermometers to the successive colours he determined their heating power and found it to augment from the violet or most refracted end to the red or least refracted end of the spectrum but he did not stop here pushing his thermometers into the dark space beyond the red he found that though the light had disappeared the radiant heat falling on the instruments was more intense than that at any visible part of the spectrum in fact sir william herschel showed and his results have been verified by various philosophers since his time that besides its luminous rays the sun pours forth a multitude of other rays more powerfully calorific than the luminous ones but entirely unsuited to the purposes of vision at the less refrangible end of the solar spectrum then the range of the suns radiation is not limited by that of the eye the same statement applies to the more refrangible end ritter discovered the extension of the spectrum into the invisible region beyond the violet and in recent times this ultraviolet emission has had peculiar interest conferred upon it by the admirable researches of professor stokes the complete spectrum of the sun consists therefore of three distinct parts first of ultrared rays of high heating power but unsuited to the purposes of vision secondly of luminous rays which display the succession of colours red orange yellow green blue indigo violet thirdly of ultraviolet rays which like the ultrared ones are incompetent to excite vision but which unlike the ultrared rays possess a very feeble heating power in consequence however of their chemical energy these ultraviolet rays are of the utmost importance to the organic world 2 origin and character of radiation the aether when we see a platinum wire raised gradually to a white heat and emitting in succession all the colours of the spectrum we are simply conscious of a series of changes in the condition of our own eyes we do not see the actions in which these successive colours originate but the mind irresistibly infers that the appearance of the colours corresponds to certain contemporaneous changes in the wire what is the nature of these changes in virtue of what condition does the wire radiate at all we must now look from the wire as a whole to its constituent atoms could we see those atoms even before the electric current has begun to act upon them we should find them in a state of vibration in this vibration indeed consists such warmth as the wire then possesses locke enunciated this idea with great precision and it has been placed beyond the pale of doubt by the excellent quantitative researches of mr joule heat says locke is a very brisk agitation of the insensible parts of the object which produce in us that sensation from which we denominate the object hot so what in our sensations is heat in the object is nothing but motion when the electric current still feeble begins to pass through the wire its first act is to intensify the vibrations already existing by causing the atoms to swing through wider ranges technically speaking the amplitudes of the oscillations are increased the current does this however without altering the periods of the old vibrations or the times in which they were executed but besides intensifying the old vibrations the current generates new and more rapid ones and when a certain definite rapidity has been attained the wire begins to glow the colour first exhibited is red which corresponds to the lowest rate of vibration of which the eye is able to take cognisance by augmenting the strength of the electric current more rapid vibrations are introduced and orange rays appear a quicker rate of vibration produces yellow a still quicker green and by further augmenting the rapidity we pass through blue indigo and violet to the extreme ultraviolet rays such are the changes recognised by the mind in the wire itself as concurrent with the visual changes taking place in the eye but what connects the wire with this organ by what means does it send such intelligence of its varying condition to the optic nerve heat being as defined by locke a very brisk agitation of the insensible parts of an object it is readily conceivable that on touching a heated body the agitation may communicate itself to the adjacent nerves and announce itself to them as light or heat but the optic nerve does not touch the hot platinum and hence the pertinence of the question by what agency are the vibrations of the wire transmitted to the eye the answer to this question involves one of the most important physical conceptions that the mind of man has yet achieved the conception of a medium filling space and fitted mechanically for the transmission of the vibrations of light and heat as air is fitted for the transmission of sound this medium is called the luminiferous aether every vibration of every atom of our platinum wire raises in this aether a wave which speeds through it at the rate of 186000 miles a second the aether suffers no rupture of continuity at the surface of the eye the intermolecular spaces of the various humours are filled with it hence the waves generated by the glowing platinum can cross these humours and impinge on the optic nerve at the back of the eye footnote the action here described is analogous to the passage of soundwaves through thick felt whose interstices are occupied by air thus the sensation of light reduces itself to the acceptance of motion up to this point we deal with pure mechanics but the subsequent translation of the shock of the aethereal waves into consciousness eludes mechanical science as an oar dipping into the cam generates systems of waves which speeding from the centre of disturbance finally stir the sedges on the rivers bank so do the vibrating atoms generate in the surrounding aether undulations which finally stir the filaments of the retina the motion thus imparted is transmitted with measurable and not very great velocity to the brain where by a process which the science of mechanics does not even tend to unravel the tremor of the nervous matter is converted into the conscious impression of light darkness might then be defined as aether at rest light as aether in motion but in reality the aether is never at rest for in the absence of lightwaves we have heatwaves always speeding through it in the spaces of the universe both classes of undulations incessantly commingle here the waves issuing from uncounted centres cross coincide oppose and pass through each other without confusion or ultimate extinction every star is seen across the entanglement of wavemotions produced by all other stars it is the ceaseless thrill caused by those distant orbs collectively in the aether that constitutes what we call the temperature of space as the air of a room accommodates itself to the requirements of an orchestra transmitting each vibration of every pipe and string so does the interstellar aether accommodate itself to the requirements of light and heat its waves mingle in space without disorder each being endowed with an individuality as indestructible as if it alone had disturbed the universal repose all vagueness with regard to the use of the terms radiation and absorption will now disappear radiation is the communication of vibratory motion to the aether and when a body is said to be chilled by radiation as for example the grass of a meadow on a starlight night the meaning is that the molecules of the grass have lost a portion of their motion by imparting it to the medium in which they vibrate on the other hand the waves of aether may so strike against the molecules of a body exposed to their action as to yield up their motion to the latter and in this transfer of the motion from the aether to the molecules consists the absorption of radiant heat all the phenomena of heat are in this way reducible to interchanges of motion and it is purely as the recipients or the donors of this motion that we ourselves become conscious of the action of heat and cold 3 the atomic theory in reference to the aether the word atoms has been more than once employed in this discourse chemists have taught us that all matter is reducible to certain elementary forms to which they give this name these atoms are endowed with powers of mutual attraction and under suitable circumstances they coalesce to form compounds thus oxygen and hydrogen are elements when separate or merely mixed but they may be made to combine so as to form molecules each consisting of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen in this condition they constitute water so also chlorine and sodium are elements the former a pungent gas the latter a soft metal and they unite together to form chloride of sodium or common salt in the same way the element nitrogen combines with hydrogen in the proportion of one atom of the former to three of the latter to form ammonia picturing in imagination the atoms of elementary bodies as little spheres the molecules of compound bodies must be pictured as groups of such spheres this is the atomic theory as dalton conceived it now if this theory have any foundation in fact and if the theory of an aether pervading space and constituting the vehicle of atomic motion be founded in fact it is surely of interest to examine whether the vibrations of elementary bodies are modified by the act of combinationwhether as regards radiation and absorption or in other words whether as regards the communication of motion to the aether and the acceptance of motion from it the deportment of the uncombined atoms will be different from that of the combined 4 absorption of radiant heat by gases we have now to submit these considerations to the only test by which they can be tried namely that of experiment an experiment is well defined as a question put to nature but to avoid the risk of asking amiss we ought to purify the question from all adjuncts which do not necessarily belong to it matter has been shown to be composed of elementary constituents by the compounding of which all its varieties are produced but besides the chemical unions which they form both elementary and compound bodies can unite in another and less intimate way gases and vapours aggregate to liquids and solids without any change of their chemical nature we do not yet know how the transmission of radiant heat may be affected by the entanglement due to cohesion and as our object now is to examine the influence of chemical union alone we shall render our experiments more pure by liberating the atoms and molecules entirely from the bonds of cohesion and employing them in the gaseous or vaporous form let us endeavour to obtain a perfectly clear mental image of the problem now before us limiting in the first place our enquiries to the phenomena of absorption we have to picture a succession of waves issuing from a radiant source and passing through a gas some of them striking against the gaseous molecules and yielding up their motion to the latter others gliding round the molecules or passing through the intermolecular spaces without apparent hindrance the problem before us is to determine whether such free molecules have any power whatever to stop the waves of heat and if so whether different molecules possess this power in different degrees in examining the problem let us fall back upon an actual piece of work choosing as the source of our heatwaves a plate of copper against the back of which a steady sheet of flame is permitted to play on emerging from the copper the waves in the first instance pass through a space devoid of air and then enter a hollow glass cylinder three feet long and three inches wide the two ends of this cylinder are stopped by two plates of rocksalt a solid substance which offers a scarcely sensible obstacle to the passage of the calorific waves after passing through the tube the radiant heat falls upon the anterior face of a thermoelectric pile footnote in the appendix to the first chapter of heat as a mode of motion the construction of the thermoelectric pile is fully explained which instantly converts the heat into an electric current this current conducted round a magnetic needle deflects it and the magnitude of the deflection is a measure of the heat falling upon the pile this famous instrument and not an ordinary thermometer is what we shall use in these enquiries but we shall use it in a somewhat novel way as long as the two opposite faces of the thermoelectric pile are kept at the same temperature no matter how high that may be there is no current generated the current is a consequence of a difference of temperature between the two opposite faces of the pile hence if after the anterior face has received the heat from our radiating source a second source which we may call the compensating source be permitted to radiate against the posterior face this latter radiation will tend to neutralise the former when the neutralisation is perfect the magnetic needle connected with the pile is no longer deflected but points to the zero of the graduated circle over which it hangs and now let us suppose the glass tube through which the waves from the heated plate of copper are passing to be exhausted by an airpump the two sources of heat acting at the same time on the two opposite faces of the pile when by means of an adjusting screen perfectly equal quantities of heat are imparted to the two faces the needle points to zero let any gas be now permitted to enter the exhausted tube if its molecules possess any power of intercepting the calorific waves the equilibrium previously existing will be destroyed the compensating source will triumph and a deflection of the magnetic needle will be the immediate consequence from the deflections thus produced by different gases we can readily deduce the relative amounts of wavemotion which their molecules intercept in this way the substances mentioned in the following table were examined a small portion only of each being admitted into the glass tube the quantity admitted in each case was just sufficient to depress a column of mercury associated with the tube one inch in other words the gases were examined at a pressure of onethirtieth of an atmosphere the numbers in the table express the relative amounts of wavemotion absorbed by the respective gases the quantity intercepted by air being taken as unity radiation through gases name of gas relative absorption air 1 oxygen 1 nitrogen 1 hydrogen 1 carbonic oxide 750 carbonic acid 972 hydrochloric acid 1005 nitric oxide 1590 nitrous oxide 1860 sulphide of hydrogen 2100 ammonia 5460 olefiant gas 6030 sulphurous acid 6480 every gas in this table is perfectly transparent to light that is to say all waves within the limits of the visible spectrum pass through it without obstruction but for the waves of slower period emanating from our heated plate of copper enormous differences of absorptive power are manifested these differences illustrate in the most unexpected manner the influence of chemical combination thus the elementary gases oxygen hydrogen and nitrogen and the mixture atmospheric air prove to be practical vacua to the rays of heat for every ray or more strictly speaking for every unit of wavemotion which any one of them intercepts perfectly transparent ammonia intercepts 5460 units olefiant gas 6030 units while sulphurous acid gas absorbs 6480 units what becomes of the wavemotion thus intercepted it is applied to the heating of the absorbing gas through air oxygen hydrogen and nitrogen the waves of aether pass without absorption and these gases are not sensibly changed in temperature by the most powerful calorific rays the position of nitrous oxide in the foregoing table is worthy of particular notice in this gas we have the same atoms in a state of chemical union that exist uncombined in the atmosphere but the absorption of the compound is 1800 times that of air 5 formation of invisible foci this extraordinary deportment of the elementary gases naturally directed attention to elementary bodies in other states of aggregation some of mellonis results now attained a new significance this celebrated experimenter had found crystals of sulphur to be highly pervious to radiant heat he had also proved that lampblack and black glass which owes its blackness to the element carbon were to a considerable extent transparent to calorific rays of low refrangibility these facts harmonising so strikingly with the deportment of the simple gases suggested further enquiry sulphur dissolved in bisulphide of carbon was found almost perfectly diathermic the dense and deeplycoloured element bromine was examined and found competent to cut off the light of our most brilliant flames while it transmitted the invisible calorific rays with extreme freedom iodine the companion element of bromine was next thought of but it was found impracticable to examine the substance in its usual solid condition it however dissolves freely in bisulphide of carbon there is no chemical union between the liquid and the iodine it is simply a case of solution in which the uncombined atoms of the element can act upon the radiant heat when permitted to do so it was found that a layer of dissolved iodine sufficiently opaque to cut off the light of the midday sun was almost absolutely transparent to the invisible calorific rays footnote professor dewar has recently succeeded in producing a medium highly opaque to light and highly transparent to obscure heat by fusing together sulphur and iodine by prismatic analysis sir william herschel separated the luminous from the nonluminous rays of the sun and he also sought to render the obscure rays visible by concentration intercepting the luminous portion of his spectrum he brought by a converging lens the ultrared rays to a focus but by this condensation he obtained no light the solution of iodine offers a means of filtering the solar beam or failing it the beam of the electric lamp which renders attainable far more powerful foci of invisible rays than could possibly be obtained by the method of sir william herschel for to form his spectrum he was obliged to operate upon solar light which had passed through a narrow slit or through a small aperture the amount of the obscure heat being limited by this circumstance but with our opaque solution we may employ the entire surface of the largest lens and having thus converged the rays luminous and nonluminous we can intercept the former by the iodine and do what we please with the latter experiments of this character not only with the iodine solution but also with black glass and layers of lampblack were publicly performed at the royal institution in the early part of 1862 and the effects at the foci of invisible rays then obtained were such as had never been witnessed previously in the experiments here referred to glass lenses were employed to concentrate the rays but glass though highly transparent to the luminous is in a high degree opaque to the invisible heatrays of the electric lamp and hence a large portion of those rays was intercepted by the glass the obvious remedy here is to employ rocksalt lenses instead of glass ones or to abandon the use of lenses wholly and to concentrate the rays by a metallic mirror both of these improvements have been introduced and as anticipated the invisible foci have been thereby rendered more intense the mode of operating remains however the same in principle as that made known in 1862 it was then found that an instants exposure of the face of the thermoelectric pile to the focus of invisible rays dashed the needles of a coarse galvanometer violently aside it is now found that on substituting for the face of the thermoelectric pile a combustible body the invisible rays are competent to set that body on fire 6 visible and invisible rays of the electric light we have next to examine what proportion the nonluminous rays of the electric light bear to the luminous ones this the opaque solution of iodine enables us to do with an extremely close approximation to the truth the pure bisulphide of carbon which is the solvent of the iodine is perfectly transparent to the luminous and almost perfectly transparent to the dark rays of the electric lamp supposing the total radiation of the lamp to pass through the transparent bisulphide while through the solution of iodine only the dark rays are transmitted if we determine by means of a thermoelectric pile the total radiation and deduct from it the purely obscure we obtain the value of the purely luminous emission experiments performed in this way prove that if all the visible rays of the electric light were converged to a focus of dazzling brilliancy its heat would only be oneeighth of that produced at the unseen focus of the invisible rays exposing his thermometers to the successive colours of the solar spectrum sir william herschel determined the heating power of each and also that of the region beyond the extreme red then drawing a straight line to represent the length of the spectrum he erected at various points perpendiculars to represent the calorific intensity existing at those points uniting the ends of all his perpendiculars he obtained a curve which showed at a glance the manner in which the heat was distributed in the solar spectrum professor mller of freiburg with improved instruments afterwards made similar experiments and constructed a more accurate diagram of the same kind we have now to examine the distribution of heat in the spectrum of the electric light and for this purpose we shall employ a particular form of the thermoelectric pile devised by melloni its face is a rectangle which by means of movable sidepieces can be rendered as narrow as desired we can for example have the face of the pile the tenth the hundredth or even the thousandth of an inch in breadth by means of an endless screw this linear thermoelectric pile may be moved through the entire spectrum from the violet to the red the amount of heat falling upon the pile at every point of its march being declared by a magnetic needle associated with the pile when this instrument is brought up to the violet end of the spectrum of the electric light the heat is found to be insensible as the pile is gradually moved from the violet end towards the red heat soon manifests itself augmenting as we approach the red of all the colours of the visible spectrum the red possesses the highest heating power on pushing the pile into the dark region beyond the red the heat instead of vanishing rises suddenly and enormously in intensity until at some distance beyond the red it attains a maximum moving the pile still forward the thermal power falls somewhat more rapidly than it rose it then gradually shades away but for a distance beyond the red greater than the length of the whole visible spectrum signs of heat may be detected drawing a datum line and erecting along it perpendiculars proportional in length to the thermal intensity at the respective points we obtain the extraordinary curve shown on the opposite page which exhibits the distribution of heat in the spectrum of the electric light in the region of dark rays beyond the red the curve shoots up to b in a steep and massive peaka kind of matterhorn of heat which dwarfs the portion of the diagram c d e representing the luminous radiation indeed the idea forced upon the mind by this diagram is that the light rays are a mere insignificant appendage to the heatrays represented by the area a b c d thrown in as it were by nature for the purpose of vision figure 1 spectrum of electric light the diagram drawn by professor mller to represent the distribution of heat in the solar spectrum is not by any means so striking as that just described and the reason doubtless is that prior to reaching the earth the solar rays have to traverse our atmosphere by the aqueous vapour there diffused the summit of the peak representing the suns invisible radiation is cut off a similar lowering of the mountain of invisible heat is observed when the rays from the electric light are permitted to pass through a film of water which acts upon them as the atmospheric vapour acts upon the rays of the sun 7 combustion by invisible rays the suns invisible rays far transcend the visible ones in heating power so that if the alleged performances of archimedes during the siege of syracuse had any foundation in fact the dark solar rays would have been the philosophers chief agents of combustion on a small scale we can readily produce with the purely invisible rays of the electric light all that archimedes is said to have performed with the suns total radiation placing behind the electric light a small concave mirror the rays are converged the cone of reflected rays and their point of convergence being rendered clearly visible by the dust always floating in the air placing between the luminous focus and the source of rays our solution of iodine the light of the cone is entirely cut away but the intolerable heat experienced when the band is placed even for a moment at the dark focus shows that the calorific rays pass unimpeded through the opaque solution almost anything that ordinary fire can effect may be accomplished at the focus of invisible rays the air at the focus remaining at the same time perfectly cold on account of its transparency to the heatrays an air thermometer with a hollow racksalt bulb would be unaffected by the heat of the focus there would be no expansion and in the open air there is no convection the aether at the focus and not the air is the substance in which the heat is embodied a block of wood placed at the focus absorbs the heat and dense volumes of smoke rise swiftly upwards showing the manner in which the air itself would rise if the invisible rays were competent to heat it at the perfectly dark focus dry paper is instantly inflamed chips of wood are speedily burnt up lead tin and zinc are fused and disks of charred paper are raised to vivid incandescence it might be supposed that the obscure rays would show no preference for black over white but they do show a preference and to obtain rapid combustion the body if not already black ought to be blackened when metals are to be burned it is necessary to blacken or otherwise tarnish them so as to diminish their reflective power blackened zinc foil when brought into the focus of invisible rays is instantly caused to blaze and burns with its peculiar purple light magnesium wire flattened or tarnished magnesium ribbon also bursts into flame pieces of charcoal suspended in a receiver full of oxygen are also set on fire when the invisible focus falls upon them the dark rays after having passed through the receiver still possessing sufficient power to ignite the charcoal and thus initiate the attack of the oxygen if instead of being plunged in oxygen the charcoal be suspended in vacuo it immediately glows at the place where the focus falls 8 transmutation of rays calorescence footnote i borrow this term from professor challis philosophical magazine vol xii p 521 eminent experimenters were long occupied in demonstrating the substantial identity of light and radiant heat and we have now the means of offering a new and striking proof of this identity a concave mirror produces beyond the object which it reflects an inverted and magnified image of the object withdrawing for example our iodine solution an intensely luminous inverted image of the carbon points of the electric light is formed at the focus of the mirror employed in the foregoing experiments when the solution is interposed and the light is cut away what becomes of this image it disappears from sight but an invisible thermograph remains and it is only the peculiar constitution of our eyes that disqualifies us from seeing the picture formed by the calorific rays falling on white paper the image chars itself out falling on black paper two holes are pierced in it corresponding to the images of the two coke points but falling on a thin plate of carbon in vacuo or upon a thin sheet of platinised platinum either in vacuo or in air radiant heat is converted into light and the image stamps itself in vivid incandescence upon both the carbon and the metal results similar to those obtained with the electric light have also been obtained with the invisible rays of the limelight and of the sun before a cambridge audience it is hardly necessary to refer to the excellent researches of professor stokes at the opposite end of the spectrum the above results constitute a kind of complement to his discoveries professor stokes named the phenomena which he has discovered and investigated fluorescence for the new phenomena here described i have proposed the term calorescence he by the interposition of a proper medium so lowered the refrangibility of the ultraviolet rays of the spectrum as to render them visible here by the interposition of the platinum foil the refrangibility of the ultrared rays is so exalted as to render them visible looking through a prism at the incandescent image of the carbon points the light of the image is decomposed and a complete spectrum is obtained the invisible rays of the electric light remoulded by the atoms of the platinum shine thus visibly forth ultrared rays being converted into red orange yellow green blue indigo violet and ultraviolet ones could we moreover raise the original source of rays to a sufficiently high temperature we might not only obtain from the dark rays of such a source a single incandescent image but from the dark rays of this image we might obtain a second one from the dark rays of the second a third and so ona series of complete images and spectra being thus extracted from the invisible emission of the primitive source footnote on investigating the calorescence produced by rays transmitted through glasses of various colours it was found that in the case of certain specimens of blue glass the platinum foil glowed with a pink or purplish light the effect was not subjective and considerations of obvious interest are suggested by it different kinds of black glass differ notably as to their power of transmitting radiant heat when thin some descriptions tint the sun with a greenish hue others make it appear a glowing red without any trace of green the latter are far more diathermic than the former in fact carbon when perfectly dissolved and incorporated with a good white glass is highly transparent to the calorific rays and by employing it as an absorbent the phenomena of calorescence may be obtained though in a less striking form than with the iodine the black glass chosen for thermometers and intended to absorb completely the solar heat may entirely fail in this object if the glass in which the carbon is incorporated be colourless to render the bulb of a thermometer a perfect absorbent the glass ought in the first instance to be green soon after the discovery of fluorescence the late dr william allen miller pointed to the limelight as an illustration of exalted refrangibility direct experiments have since entirely confirmed the view expressed at page 210 of his work on chemistry published in 1855 9 deadness of the optic nerve to the calorific rays the layer of iodine used in the foregoing experiments intercepted the rays of the noonday sun no trace of light from the electric lamp was visible in the darkest room even when a white screen was placed at the focus of the mirror employed to concentrate the light it was thought however that if the retina itself were brought into the focus the sensation of light might be experienced the danger of this experiment was twofold if the dark rays were absorbed in a high degree by the humours of the eye the albumen of the humours might coagulate along the line of the rays if on the contrary no such high absorption took place the rays might reach the retina with a force sufficient to destroy it to test the likelihood of these results experiments were made on water and on a solution of alum and they showed it to be very improbable that in the brief time requisite for an experiment any serious damage could be done the eye was therefore caused to approach the dark focus no defence in the first instance being provided but the heat acting upon the parts surrounding the pupil could not be borne an aperture was therefore pierced in a plate of metal and the eye placed behind the aperture was caused to approach the point of convergence of invisible rays the focus was attained first by the pupil and afterwards by the retina removing the eye but permitting the plate of metal to remain a sheet of platinum foil was placed in the position occupied by the retina a moment before the platinum became redhot no sensible damage was done to the eye by this experiment no impression of light was produced the optic nerve was not even conscious of heat but the humours of the eye are known to be highly impervious to the invisible calorific rays and the question therefore arises did the radiation in the foregoing experiment reach the retina at all the answer is that the rays were in part transmitted to the retina and in part absorbed by the humours experiments on the eye of an ox showed that the proportion of obscure rays which reached the retina amounted to 18 per cent of the total radiation while the luminous emission from the electric light amounts to no more than 10 per cent of the same total were the purely luminous rays of the electric lamp converged by our mirror to a focus there can be no doubt as to the fate of a retina placed there its ruin would be inevitable and yet this would be accomplished by an amount of wavemotion but little more than half of that which the retina without exciting consciousness bears at the focus of invisible rays this subject will repay a moments further attention at a common distance of a foot the visible radiation of the electric light employed in these experiments is 800 times the light of a candle at the same distance the portion of the radiation of the electric light which reaches the retina but fails to excite vision is about 1500 times the luminous radiation of the candle footnote it will be borne in mind that the heat which any ray luminous or nonluminous is competent to generate is the true measure of the energy of the ray but a candle on a clear night can readily be seen at a distance of a mile its light at this distance being less than 120000000 of its light at the distance of a foot hence to make the candlelight a mile off equal in power to the nonluminous radiation received from the electric light at a foot distance its intensity would have to be multiplied by 1500 x 20000000 or by thirty thousand millions thus the thirty thousand millionth part of the invisible radiation from the electric light received by the retina at the distance of a foot would if slightly changed in character be amply sufficient to provoke vision nothing could more forcibly illustrate that special relationship supposed by melloni and others to subsist between the optic nerve and the oscillating periods of luminous bodies the optic nerve responds as it were to the waves with which it is in consonance while it refuses to be excited by others of almost infinitely greater energy whose periods of recurrence are not in unison with its own 10 persistence of rays at an early part of this lecture it was affirmed that when a platinum wire was gradually raised to a state of high incandescence new rays were constantly added while the intensity of the old ones was increased thus in dr drapers experiments the rise of temperature that generated the orange yellow green and blue augmented the intensity of the red what is true of the red is true of every other ray of the spectrum visible and invisible we cannot indeed see the augmentation of intensity in the region beyond the red but we can measure it and express it numerically with this view the following experiment was performed a spiral of platinum wire was surrounded by a small glass globe to protect it from currents of air through an orifice in the globe the rays could pass from the spiral and fall afterwards upon a thermoelectric pile placing in front of the orifice an opaque solution of iodine the platinum was gradually raised from a low dark heat to the fullest incandescence with the following results appearance of spiral energy of obscure radiation dark 1 dark but hotter 3 dark but still hotter 5 dark but still hotter 10 feeble red 19 dull red 25 red 37 full red 62 orange 89 bright orange 144 yellow 202 white 276 intense white 440 thus the augmentation of the electric current which raises the wire from its primitive dark condition to an intense white heat exalts at the same time the energy of the obscure radiation until at the end it is fully 440 times what it was at the beginning what has been here proved true of the totality of the ultrared rays is true for each of them singly placing our linear thermoelectric pile in any part of the ultrared spectrum it may be proved that a ray once emitted continues to be emitted with increased energy as the temperature is augmented the platinum spiral so often referred to being raised to whiteness by an electric current a brilliant spectrum was formed from its light a linear thermoelectric pile was placed in the region of obscure rays beyond the red and by diminishing the current the spiral was reduced to a low temperature it was then caused to pass through various degrees of darkness and incandescence with the following results appearance of spiral energy of obscure rays dark 1 dark 6 faint red 10 dull red 13 red 18 full red 27 orange 60 yellow 93 white 122 here as in the former case the dark and bright radiations reached their maximum together as the one augmented the other augmented until at last the energy of the obscure rays of the particular refrangibility here chosen became 122 times what it was at first to reach a white heat the wire has to pass through all the stages of invisible radiation but in its most brilliant condition it embraces in an intensified form the rays of all those stages and thus it is with all other kinds of matter as far as they have hitherto been examined coke whether brought to a white heat by the electric current or by the oxyhydrogen jet pours out invisible rays with augmented energy as its light is increased the same is true of lime bricks and other substances it is true of all metals which are capable of being heated to incandescence it also holds good for phosphorus burning in oxygen every gush of dazzling light has associated with it a gush of invisible radiant heat which far transcends the light in energy this condition of things applies to all bodies capable of being raised to a white heat either in the solid or the molten condition it would doubtless also apply to the luminous fogs formed by the condensation of incandescent vapours in such cases when the curve representing the radiant energy of the body is constructed the obscure radiation towers upwards like a mountain the luminous radiation resembling a mere spur at its base from the very brightness of the light of some of the fixed stars we may infer the intensity of that dark radiation which is the precursor and inseparable associate of their luminous rays we thus find the luminous radiation appearing when the radiant body has attained a certain temperature or in other words when the vibrating atoms of the body have attained a certain width of swing in solid and molten bodies a certain amplitude cannot be surpassed without the introduction of periods of vibration which provoke the sense of vision how are we to figure this if permitted to speculate we might ask are not these more rapid vibrations the progeny of the slower is it not really the mutual action of the atoms when they swing through very wide spaces and thus encroach upon each other that causes them to tremble in quicker periods if so whatever be the agency by which the large swinging space is obtained we shall have lightgiving vibrations associated with it it matters not whether the large amplitudes be produced by the strokes of a hammer or by the blows of the molecules of a nonluminous gas like air at some height above a gasflame or by the shock of the aether particles when transmitting radiant heat the result in all cases will be incandescence thus the invisible waves of our filtered electric beam may be regarded as generating synchronous vibrations among the atoms of the platinum on which they impinge but once these vibrations have attained a certain amplitude the mutual jostling of the atoms produces quicker tremors and the lightgiving waves follow as the necessary product of the heatgiving ones 11 absorption of radiant heat by vapours and odours we commenced the demonstrations brought forward in this lecture by experiments on permanent gases and we have now to turn our attention to the vapours of volatile liquids here as in the case of the gases vast differences have been proved to exist between various kinds of molecules as regards their power of intercepting the calorific waves while some vapours allow the waves a comparatively free passage the faintest mixture of other vapours causes a deflection of the magnetic needle assuming the absorption effected by air at a pressure of one atmosphere to be unity the following are the absorptions effected by a series of vapours at a pressure of 160th of an atmosphere name of vapour absorption bisulphide of carbon 47 iodide of methyl 115 benzol 136 amylene 321 sulphuric ether 440 formic ether 548 acetic ether 612 bisulphide of carbon is the most transparent vapour in this list and acetic ether the most opaque 160th of an atmosphere of the former however produces 47 times the effect of a whole atmosphere of air while 160th of an atmosphere of the latter produces 612 times the effect of a whole atmosphere of air reducing dry air to the pressure of the acetic ether here employed and comparing them then together the quantity of wavemotion intercepted by the ether would be many thousand times that intercepted by the air any one of these vapours discharged into the free atmosphere in front of a body emitting obscure rays intercepts more or less of the radiation a similar effect is produced by perfumes diffused in the air though their attenuation is known to be almost infinite carrying for example a current of dry air over bibulous paper moistened by patchouli the scent taken up by the current absorbs 30 times the quantity of heat intercepted by the air which carries it and yet patchouli acts more feebly on radiant heat than any other perfume yet examined here follow the results obtained with various essential oils the odour in each case being carried by a current of dry air into the tube already employed for gases and vapours name of perfume absorption patchouli 30 sandal wood 32 geranium 33 oil of cloves 34 otto of roses 37 bergamot 44 neroli 47 lavender 60 lemon 65 portugal 67 thyme 68 rosemary 74 oil of laurel 80 camomile flowers 87 cassia 109 spikenard 355 aniseed 372 thus the absorption by a tube full of dry air being 1 that of the odour of patchouli diffused in it is 30 at of lavender 60 that of rosemary 74 whilst that of aniseed amounts to 372 it would be idle to speculate the quantities of matter concerned in these actions 12 aqueous vapour in relation to the terrestrial temperatures we are now fully prepared for a result which without such preparation might appear incredible water is to some extent a volatile body and our atmosphere resting as it does upon the surface of the ocean receives from it a continual supply of aqueous vapour it would be an error to confound clouds or fog or any visible mist with the vapour of water which is a perfectly impalpable gas diffused even on the clearest days throughout the atmosphere compared with the great body of the air the aqueous vapour it contains is of almost infinitesimal amount 995 out of every 100 parts of the atmosphere being composed of oxygen and nitrogen in the absence of experiment we should never think of ascribing to this scant and varying constituent any important influence on terrestrial radiation and yet its influence is far more potent than that of the great body of the air to say that on a day of average humidity in england the atmospheric vapour exerts 100 times the action of the air itself would certainly be an understatement of the fact comparing a single molecule of aqueous vapour with an atom of either of the main constituents of our atmosphere i am not prepared to say how many thousand times the action of the former exceeds that of the latter but it must be borne in mind that these large numbers depend in part on the extreme feebleness of the air the power of aqueous vapour seems vast because that of the air with which it is compared is infinitesimal absolutely considered however this substance notwithstanding its small specific gravity exercises a very potent action probably from 10 to 15 per cent of the heat radiated from the earth is absorbed within 10 or 20 feet of the earths surface this must evidently be of the utmost consequence to the life of the world imagine the superficial molecules of the earth agitated with the motion of heat and imparting it to the surrounding aether this motion would be carried rapidly away and lost for ever to our planet if the waves of aether had nothing but the air to contend with in their outward course but the aqueous vapour takes up the motion and becomes hereby heated thus wrapping the earth like a warm garment and protecting its surface from the deadly chill which it would otherwise sustain various philosophers have speculated on the influence of an atmospheric envelope de saussure fourier m pouillet and mr hopkins have one and all enriched scientific literature with contributions on this subject but the considerations which these eminent men have applied to atmospheric air have if my experiments be correct to be transferred to the aqueous vapour the observations of meteorologists furnish important though hitherto unconscious evidence of the influence of this agent wherever the air is dry we are liable to daily extremes of temperature by day such places the suns heat reaches the earth unimpeded and renders the maximum high by night on the other hand the earths heat escapes unhindered to space and renders the minimum low hence the difference between the maximum and minimum is greatest where the air is driest in the plains of india the heights of the himalaya in central asia in australiawherever drought reigns we have the heat of day forcibly contrasted with the chill of night in the sahara itself when the suns rays cease to impinge on the burning soil the temperature runs rapidly down to freezing because there is no vapour overhead to check the calorific drain and here another instance might be added to the numbers already known in which nature tends as it were to check her own excess by nocturnal refrigeration the aqueous vapour of the air is condensed to water on the surface of the earth and as only the superficial portions radiate the act of condensation makes water the radiating body now experiment proves that to the rays emitted by water aqueous vapour is especially opaque hence the very act of condensation consequent on terrestrial cooling becomes a safeguard to the earth imparting to its radiation that particular character which renders it most liable to be prevented from escaping into space it might however be urged that inasmuch as we derive all our heat from the sun the selfsame covering which protects the earth from chill must also shut out the solar radiation this is partially true but only partially the suns rays are different in quality from the earths rays and it does not at all follow that the substance which absorbs the one must necessarily absorb the other through a layer of water for example one tenth of an inch in thickness the suns rays are transmitted with comparative freedom but through a layer half this thickness as melloni has proved no single ray from the warmed earth could pass in like manner the suns rays pass with comparative freedom through the aqueous vapour of the air the absorbing power of this substance being mainly exerted upon the invisible heat that endeavours to escape from the earth in consequence of this differential action upon solar and terrestrial heat the mean temperature of our planet is higher than is due to its distance from the sun 13 liquids and their vapours in relation to radiant heat the deportment here assigned to atmospheric vapour has been established by direct experiments on it taken from the streets and parks of london from the downs of epsom from the hills and seabeach of the isle of wight and also by experiments on air in the first instance dried and afterwards rendered artificially humid by pure distilled water it has also been established in the following way ten volatile liquids were taken at random and the power of these liquids at a common thickness to intercept the waves of heat was carefully determined the vapours of the liquids were next taken in quantities proportional to the quantities of liquid and the power of the vapours intercept the waves of heat was also determined commencing with the substance which exerted the least absorptive power and proceeding onwards to the most energetic the following order of absorption was observed liquids vapours bisulphide of carbon bisulphide of carbon chloroform chloroform iodide of methyl iodide of methyl iodide of ethyl iodide of ethyl benzol benzol amylene amylene sulphuric aether sulphuric aether acetic aether acetic aether formic aether formic aether alcohol alcohol water we here find the order of absorption in both cases be the same we have liberated the molecules from the bonds which trammel them more or less in a liquid condition but this change in their state of aggregation does not change their relative powers of absorption nothing could more clearly prove that the act of absorption depends upon the individual molecule which equally asserts its power in the liquid and the gaseous state we may safely conclude from the above table that the position of a vapour is determined by that of its liquid now at the very foot of the list of liquids stands water signalising itself above all others by its enormous power of absorption and from this fact even if no direct experiment on the vapour of water had ever been made we should be entitled to rank that vapour as our most powerful absorber of radiant heat its attenuation however diminishes its action i have proved that a shell of air two inches in thickness surrounding our planet and saturated with the vapour of sulphuric aether would intercept 35 per cent of the earths radiation and though the quantity of aqueous vapour necessary to saturate air is much less than the amount of sulphuric aether vapour which it can sustain it is still extremely probable that the estimate already made of the action of atmospheric vapour within 10 feet of the earths surface is under the mark and that we are indebted to this wonderful substance to an extent not accurately determined but certainly far beyond what has hitherto been imagined for the temperature now existing at the surface of the globe 14 reciprocity of radiation and absorption throughout the reflections which have hitherto occupied us the image before the mind has been that of a radiant source sending forth calorific waves which on passing among the molecules of a gas or vapour were intercepted by those molecules in various degrees in all cases it was the transference of motion from the aether to the comparatively quiescent molecules of the gas or vapour that occupied our thoughts we have now to change the form of our conception and to figure these molecules not as absorbers but as radiators not as the recipients but as the originators of wavemotion that is to say we must figure them vibrating and generating in the surrounding aether undulations which speed through it with the velocity of light our object now is to enquire whether the act of chemical combination which proves so potent as regards the phenomena of absorption does not also manifest its power in the phenomena of radiation for the examination of this question it is necessary in the first place to heat our gases and vapours to the same temperature and then examine their power of discharging the motion thus imparted to them upon the aether in which they swing a heated copper ball was placed above a ring gasburner possessing a great number of small apertures the burner being connected by a tube with vessels containing the various gases to be examined by gentle pressure the gases were forced through the orifices of the burner against the copper ball where each of them being heated rose in an ascending column a thermoelectric pile entirely screened from the hot ball was exposed to the radiation of the warm gas while the deflection of a magnetic needle connected with the pile declared the energy of the radiation by this mode of experiment it was proved that the selfsame molecular arrangement which renders a gas a powerful absorber renders it a powerful radiatorthat the atom or molecule which is competent to intercept the calorific waves is in the same degree competent to send them forth thus while the atoms of elementary gases proved themselves unable to emit any sensible amount of radiant heat the molecules of compound gases were shown to be capable of powerfully disturbing the surrounding aether by special modes of experiment the same was proved to hold good for the vapours of volatile liquids the radiative power of every vapour being found proportional to its absorptive power the method of experiment here pursued though not of the simplest character is still easy to grasp when air is permitted to rush into an exhausted tube the temperature of the air is raised to a degree equivalent to the vis viva extinguished footnote see above for a definition of vis viva such air is said to be dynamically heated and if pure it shows itself incompetent to radiate even when a rocksalt window is provided for the passage of its rays but if instead of being empty the tube contain a small quantity of vapour the warmed air communicates its heat by contact to the vapour the molecules of which convert into the radiant form the heat imparted to them by the atoms of the air by this process also which i have called dynamic radiation the reciprocity of radiation and absorption has been conclusively proved footnote when heated air imparts its motion to another gas or vapour the transference of heat is accompanied by a change of vibrating period the dynamic radiation of vapours is rendered possible by this transmutation of vibrations in the excellent researches of leslie de la provostaye and detains and balfour stewart the same reciprocity as regards solid bodies has been variously illustrated while the labours theoretical and experimental of kirchhoff have given this subject a wonderful expansion and enriched it by applications of the highest kind to their results are now to be added the foregoing whereby gases and vapours which have been hitherto thought inaccessible to experiments with the thermoelectric pile are proved by it to exhibit the indissoluble duality of radiation and absorption the influence of chemical combination on both being exhibited in the most decisive and extraordinary way 15 influence of vibrating period and molecular form physical analysis of the human breath in the foregoing experiments with gases and vapours have employed throughout invisible rays and found some of these bodies so impervious to radiant heat that lengths of a few feet they intercept every ray as actually as a layer of pitch the substances however which show themselves thus opaque to radiant heat perfectly transparent to light now the rays of light differ from those of invisible heat merely in point of period the former failing to affect the retina because their periods of recurrence are too slow hence in one way or other the transparency of our gases and vapours depends upon the periods of the waves which impinge upon them what is the nature of this dependence the admirable researches of kirchhoff help us an answer the atoms and molecules of every gas have certain definite rates of oscillation and those waves aether are most copiously absorbed whose periods recurrence synchronise with those of the atomic groups amongst which they pass thus when we find invisible rays absorbed and the visible ones transmitted by a layer of gas we conclude that the oscillating periods of the atoms constituting the gaseous molecules coincide with those of the invisible and not with those of the visible spectrum it requires some discipline of the imagination to form a clear picture of this process such a picture is however possible and ought to be obtained when the waves of aether impinge upon molecules whose periods of vibration coincide with the recurrence of the undulations the timed strokes of the waves augment the vibration of the molecules as a heavy pendulum is set in motion by welltimed puffs of breath millions of millions of shocks are received every second from the calorific waves and it is not difficult to see that as every wave arrives just in time to repeat the action of its predecessor the molecules must finally be caused to swing through wider spaces than if the arrivals were not so timed in fact it is not difficult to see that an assemblage of molecules operated upon by contending waves might remain practically quiescent this is actually the case when the waves of the visible spectrum pass through a transparent gas or vapour there is here no sensible transference of motion from the aether to the molecules in other words there is no sensible absorption of heat one striking example of the influence of period may be here recorded carbonic acid gas is one of the feeblest absorbers of the radiant heat emitted by solid bodies it is for example to a great extent transparent to the rays emitted by the heated copper plate already referred to there are however certain rays comparatively few in number emitted by the copper to which the carbonic acid is impervious and could we obtain a source of heat emitting such rays only we should find carbonic acid more opaque to the radiation from that source than any other gas such a source is actually found in the flame of carbonic oxide where hot carbonic acid constitutes the main radiating body of the rays emitted by our heated plate of copper olefiant gas absorbs ten times the quantity absorbed by carbonic acid of the rays emitted by a carbonic oxide flame carbonic acid absorbs twice as much as olefiant gas this wonderful change in the power of the former as an absorber is simply due to the fact that the periods of the hot and cold carbonic acid are identical and that the waves from the flame freely transfer their motion to the molecules which synchronise with them thus it is that the tenth an atmosphere of carbonic acid enclosed in a tube four feet long absorbs 60 per cent of the radiation from carbonic oxide flame while onethirtieth of an atmosphere absorbs 48 per cent of the heat from the same source in fact the presence of the minutest quantity of carbonic acid may be detected by its action on the rays from the carbonic oxide flame carrying for example the dried human breath into a tube four feet long the absorption there effected by the carbonic acid of the breath amounts to 50 per cent of the entire radiation radiant heat may indeed be employed as a means of determining practically the amount of carbonic acid expired from the lungs my late assistant mr barrett while under my direction made this determination the absorption produced by the breath freed from its moisture but retaining its carbonic acid was first determined carbonic acid artificially prepared was then mixed with dry air in such proportions that the action of the mixture upon the rays of heat was the same as that of the dried breath the percentage of the former being known immediately gave that of the latter the same breath analysed chemically by dr frankland and physically by mr barrett gave the following results percentage of carbonic acid in the human breath chemical analysis physical analysis 466 456 533 522 it is thus proved that in the quantity of aethereal motion which it is competent to take up we have a practical measure of the carbonic acid of the breath and hence of the combustion going on in the human lungs still this question of period though of the utmost importance is not competent to account for the whole of the observed facts the aether as far as we know accepts vibrations of all periods with the same readiness to it the oscillations of an atom of free oxygen are just as acceptable as those of the atoms in a molecule of olefiant gas that the vibrating oxygen then stands so far below the olefiant gas in radiant power must be referred not to period but to some other peculiarity the atomic group which constitutes the molecule of olefiant gas produces many thousand times the disturbance caused by the oxygen it may be because the group is able to lay a vastly more powerful hold upon the aether than single atoms can another and probably very potent cause of the difference may be that the vibrations being those of the constituent atoms of the molecule footnote see physical considerations art iv are generated in highly condensed aether which acts like condensed air upon sound but whatever may be the fate of these attempts to visualise the physics of the process it will still remain true that to account for the phenomena of radiation and absorption we must take into consideration the shape size and condition of the aether within the molecules by which the external aether is disturbed 16 summary and conclusion let us now cast a momentary glance over the ground that we have left behind the general nature of light and heat was first briefly described the compounding of matter from elementary atoms and the influence of the act of combination on radiation and absorption were considered and experimentally illustrated through the transparent elementary gases radiant heat was found to pass as through a vacuum while many of the compound gases presented almost impassable obstacles to the calorificwaves this deportment of the simple gases directed our attention to other elementary bodies the examination of which led to the discovery that the element iodine dissolved in bisulphide of carbon possesses the power of detaching with extraordinary sharpness the light of the spectrum from its heat intercepting all luminous rays up to the extreme red and permitting the calorific rays beyond the red to pass freely through it this substance was then employed to filter the beams of the electric light and to form foci of invisible rays so intense as to produce almost all the effects obtainable in ordinary fire combustible bodies were burnt and refractory ones were raised to a white heat by the concentrated invisible rays thus by exalting their refrangibility the invisible rays of the electric light were rendered visible and all the colours of the solar spectrum were extracted from utter darkness the extreme richness of the electric light in invisible rays of low refrangibility was demonstrated oneeighth only of its radiation consisting of luminous rays the deadness of the optic nerve to those invisible rays was proved and experiments were then added to show that the bright and the dark rays of a solid body raised gradually to incandescence are strengthened together intense dark heat being an invariable accompaniment of intense white heat a sun could not be formed or a meteorite rendered luminous on any other condition the lightgiving rays constituting only a small fraction of the total radiation their unspeakable importance to us is due to the fact that their periods are attuned to the special requirements of the eye among the vapours of volatile liquids vast differences were also found to exist as regards their powers of absorption we followed various molecules from a state of liquid to a state of gas and found in both states of aggregation the power of the individual molecules equally asserted the position of a vapour as an absorber of radiant heat was shown to be determined by that of the liquid from which it is derived reversing our conceptions and regarding the molecules of gases and vapours not as the recipients but as the originators of wavemotion not as absorbers but as radiators it was proved that the powers of absorption and radiation went hand in hand the selfsame chemical act which rendered a body competent to intercept the waves of aether rendering it competent in the same degree to generate them perfumes were next subjected to examination and notwithstanding their extraordinary tenuity they were found vastly superior in point of absorptive power to the body of the air in which they were diffused we were led thus slowly up to the examination of the most widely diffused and most important of all vapoursthe aqueous vapour of our atmosphere and we found in it a potent absorber of the purely calorific rays the power of this substance to influence climate and its general influence on the temperature of the earth were then briefly dwelt upon a cobweb spread above a blossom is sufficient to protect it from nightly chill and thus the aqueous vapour of our air attenuated as it is checks the drain of terrestrial heat and saves the surface of our planet from the refrigeration which would assuredly accrue were no such substance interposed between it and the voids of space we considered the influence of vibrating period and molecular form on absorption and radiation and finally deduced from its action upon radiant heat the exact amount of carbonic acid expired by the human lungs thus in brief outline were placed before you some of the results of recent enquiries in the domain of radiation and my aim throughout has been to raise in your minds distinct physical images of the various processes involved in our researches it is thought by some that natural science has a deadening influence on the imagination and a doubt might fairly be raised as to the value of any study which would necessarily have this effect but the experience of the last hour must i think have convinced you that the study of natural science goes hand in hand with the culture of the imagination throughout the greater part of this discourse we have been sustained by this faculty we have been picturing atoms and molecules and vibrations and waves which eye has never seen nor ear heard and which can only be discerned by the exercise of imagination this in fact is the faculty which enables us transcend the boundaries of sense and connect the phenomena of our visible world with those of an invisible one without imagination we never could have risen to the conceptions which have occupied us here today and in proportion to your power of exercising this faculty aright and of associating definite mental images with the terms employed will be the pleasure and the profit which you will derive from this lecture the outward facts of nature are insufficient to satisfy the mind we cannot be content with knowing that the light and heat of the sun illuminate and warm the world we are led irresistibly to enquire what is light and what is heat and this question leads us at once out of the region of sense into that of imagination footnote this line of thought was pursued further five years subsequently see scientific use of the imagination in vol ii thus pondering and questioning and striving to supplement that which is felt and seen but which is incomplete by something unfelt and unseen which is necessary to its completeness men of genius have in part discerned not only the nature of light and heat but also through them the general relationship of natural phenomena the working power of nature consists of actual or potential motion of which all its phenomena are but special forms this motion manifests itself in tangible and in intangible matter being incessantly transferred from the one to the other and incessantly transformed by the change it is as real in the waves of the aether as in the waves of the sea the latterderived as they are from winds which in their turn are derived from the sunare indeed nothing more than the heapedup motion of the aether waves it is the calorific waves emitted by the sun which heat our air produce our winds and hence agitate our ocean and whether they break in foam upon the shore or rub silently against the oceans bed or subside by the mutual friction of their own parts the sea waves which cannot subside without producing heat finally resolve themselves into waves of aether thus regenerating the motion from which their temporary existence was derived this connection is typical nature is not an aggregate of independent parts but an organic whole if you open a piano and sing into it a certain string will respond change the pitch of our voice the first string ceases to vibrate but another replies change again the pitch the first two strings are silent while another resounds thus is sentient man acted on by nature the optic the auditory and other nerves of the human body being so many strings differently tuned and responsive to different forms of the universal power iii on radiant heat in relation to the colour and chemical constitution of bodies footnote a discourse delivered in the royal institution of great britain jan 19 1866 one of the most important functions of physical science considered as a discipline of the mind is to enable us by means of the sensible processes of nature to apprehend the insensible the sensible processes give direction to the line of thought but this once given the length of the line is not limited by the boundaries of the senses indeed the domain of the senses in nature is almost infinitely small in comparison with the vast region accessible to thought which lies beyond them from a few observations of a comet when it comes within the range of his telescope an astronomer can calculate its path in regions which no telescope can reach and in like manner by means of data furnished in the narrow world of the senses we make ourselves at home in other and wider worlds which are traversed by the intellect alone from the earliest ages the questions what is light and what is heat have occurred to the minds of men but these questions never would have been answered had they not been preceded by the question what is sound amid the grosser phenomena of acoustics the mind was first disciplined conceptions being thus obtained from direct observation which were afterwards applied to phenomena of a character far too subtle to be observed directly sound we know to be due to vibratory motion a vibrating tuningfork for example moulds the air around it into undulations or waves which speed away on all sides with a certain measured velocity impinge upon the drum of the ear shake the auditory nerve and awake in the brain the sensation of sound when sufficiently near a sounding body we can feel the vibrations of the air a deaf man for example plunging his hand into a bell when it is sounded feels through the common nerves of his body those tremors which when imparted to the nerves of healthy ears are translated into sound there are various ways of rendering those sonorous vibrations not only tangible but visible and it was not until numberless experiments of this kind had been executed that the scientific investigator abandoned himself wholly and without a shadow of misgiving to the conviction that what is sound within us is outside of us a motion of the air but once having established this factonce having proved beyond all doubt that the sensation of sound is produced by an agitation of the auditory nervethe thought soon suggested itself that light might be due to an agitation of the optic nerve this was a great step in advance of that ancient notion which regarded light as something emitted by the eye and not as anything imparted to it but if light be produced by an agitation of the retina what is it that produces the agitation newton you know supposed minute particles to be shot through the humours of the eye against the retina which he supposed to hang like a target at the back of the eye the impact of these particles against the target newton believed to be the cause of light but newtons notion has not held its ground being entirely driven from the field by the more wonderful and far more philosophical notion that light like sound is a product of wavemotion the domain in which this motion of light is carried on lies entirely beyond the reach of our senses the waves of light require a medium for their formation and propagation but we cannot see or feel or taste or smell this medium how then has its existence been established by showing that by the assumption of this wonderful intangible aether all the phenomena of optics are accounted for with a fulness and clearness and conclusiveness which leave no desire of the intellect unsatisfied when the law of gravitation first suggested itself to the mind of newton what did he do he set himself to examine whether it accounted for all the facts he determined the courses of the planets he calculated the rapidity of the moons fall towards the earth he considered the precession of the equinoxes the ebb and flow of the tides and found all explained by the law of gravitation he therefore regarded this law as established and the verdict of science subsequently confirmed his conclusion on similar and if possible on stronger grounds we found our belief in the existence of the universal aether it explains facts far more various and complicated than those on which newton based his law if a single phenomenon could be pointed out which the aether is proved incompetent to explain we should have to give it up but no such phenomenon has ever been pointed out it is therefore at least as certain that space is filled with a medium by means of which suns and stars diffuse their radiant power as that it is traversed by that force which holds in its grasp not only our planetary system but the immeasurable heavens themselves there is no more wonderful instance than this of the production of a line of thought from the world of the senses into the region of pure imagination i mean by imagination here not that play of fancy which can give to airy nothings a local habitation and a name but that power which enables the mind to conceive realities which lie beyond the range of the sensesto present to itself distinct images of processes which though mighty in the aggregate beyond all conception are so minute individually as to elude all observation it is the waves of air excited by a tuningfork which render its vibrations audible it is the waves of aether sent forth from those lamps overhead which render them luminous to us but so minute are these waves that it would take from 30000 to 60000 of them placed end to end to cover a single inch their number however compensates for their minuteness trillions of them have entered your eyes and hit the retina at the backs of your eyes in the time consumed in the utterance of the shortest sentence of this discourse this is the steadfast result of modern research but we never could have reached it without previous discipline we never could have measured the waves of light nor even imagined them to exist had we not previously exercised ourselves among the waves of sound sound and light are now mutually helpful the conceptions of each being expanded strengthened and defined by the conceptions of the other the aether which conveys the pulses of light and heat not only fills celestial space swathing suns and planets and moons but it also encircles the atoms of which these bodies are composed it is the motion of these atoms and not that of any sensible parts of bodies that the aether conveys this motion is the objective cause of what in our sensations are light and heat an atom then sending its pulses through the aether resembles a tuningfork sending its pulses through the air let us look for a moment at this thrilling medium and briefly consider its relation to the bodies whose vibrations it conveys different bodies when heated to the same temperature possess very different powers of agitating the aether some are good radiators others are bad radiators which means that some are so constituted as to communicate their atomic motion freely to the aether producing therein powerful undulations while the atoms of others are unable thus to communicate their motions but glide through the medium without materially disturbing its repose recent experiments have proved that elementary bodies except under certain anomalous conditions belong to the class of bad radiators an atom vibrating in the aether resembles a naked tuningfork vibrating in the air the amount of motion communicated to the air by the thin prongs is too small to evoke at any distance the sensation of sound but if we permit the atoms to combine chemically and form molecules the result in many cases is an enormous change in the power of radiation the amount of aethereal disturbance produced by the combined atoms of a body may be many thousand times that produced by the same atoms when uncombined the pitch of a musical note depends upon the rapidity of its vibrations or in other words on the length of its waves now the pitch of a note answers to the colour of light taking a slice of white light from the sun or from an electric lamp and causing the light to pass through an arrangement of prisms it is decomposed we have the effect obtained by newton who first unrolled the solar beam into the splendours of the solar spectrum at one end of this spectrum we have red light at the other violet and between those extremes lie the other prismatic colours as we advance along the spectrum from the red to the violet the pitch of the lightif i may use the expressionheightens the sensation of violet being produced by a more rapid succession of impulses than that which produces the impression of red the vibrations of the violet are about twice as rapid as those of the red in other words the range of the visible spectrum is about an octave there is no solution of continuity in this spectrum one colour changes into another by insensible gradations it is as if an infinite number of tuningforks of gradually augmenting pitch were vibrating at the same time but turning to another spectrumthat namely obtained from the incandescent vapour of silveryou observe that it consists of two narrow and intensely luminous green bands here it is as if two forks only of slightly different pitch were vibrating the length of the waves which produce this first band is such that 47460 of them placed end to end would fill an inch the waves which produce the second band are a little shorter it would take of these 47920 to fill an inch in the case of the first band the number of impulses imparted in one second to every eye which sees it is 677 millions of millions while the number of impulses imparted in the same time by the second band is 600 millions of millions we may project upon a white screen the beautiful stream of green light from which these bands were derived this luminous stream is the incandescent vapour of silver the rates of vibration of the atoms of that vapour are as rigidly fixed as those of two tuningforks and to whatever height the temperature of the vapour may be raised the rapidity of its vibrations and consequently its colour which wholly depends upon that rapidity remain unchanged the vapour of water as well as the vapour of silver has its definite periods of vibration and these are such as to disqualify the vapour when acting freely as such from being raised to a white heat the oxyhydrogen flame for example consists of hot aqueous vapour it is scarcely visible in the air of this room and it would be still less visible if we could burn the gas in a clean atmosphere but the atmosphere even at the summit of mont blanc is dirty in london it is more than dirty and the burning dirt gives to this flame the greater portion of its present light but the heat of the flame is enormous cast iron fuses at a temperature of 2000 fahr while the temperature of the oxyhydrogen flame is 6000 fahr a piece of platinum is heated to vivid redness at a distance of two inches beyond the visible termination of the flame the vapour which produces incandescence is here absolutely dark in the flame itself the platinum is raised to dazzling whiteness and is even pierced by the flame when this flame impinges on a piece of lime we have the dazzling drummond light but the light is here due to the fact that when it impinges upon the solid body the vibrations excited in that body by the flame are of periods different from its own thus far we have fixed our attention on atoms and molecules in a state of vibration and surrounded by a medium which accepts their vibrations and transmits them through space but suppose the waves generated by one system of molecules to impinge upon another system how will the waves be affected will they be stopped or will they be permitted to pass will they transfer their motion to the molecules on which they impinge or will they glide round the molecules through the intermolecular spaces and thus escape the answer to this question depends upon a condition which may be beautifully exemplified by an experiment on sound these two tuningforks are tuned absolutely alike they vibrate with the same rapidity and mounted thus upon their resonant cases you hear them loudly sounding the same musical note stopping one of the forks i throw the other into strong vibration and bring that other near the silent fork but not into contact with it allowing them to continue in this position for four or five seconds and then stopping the vibrating fork the sound does not cease the second fork has taken up the vibrations of its neighbour and is now sounding in its turn dismounting one of the forks and permitting the other to remain upon its stand i throw the dismounted fork into strong vibration you cannot hear it sound detached from its case the amount of motion which it can communicate to the air is too small to be sensible at any distance when the dismounted fork is brought close to the mounted one but not into actual contact with it out of the silence rises a mellow sound whence comes it from the vibrations which have been transferred from the dismounted fork to the mounted one that the motion should thus transfer itself through the air it is necessary that the two forks should be in perfect unison if a morsel of wax not larger than a pea be placed on one of the forks it is rendered thereby powerless to affect or to be affected by the other it is easy to understand this experiment the pulses of the one fork can affect the other because they are perfectly timed a single pulse causes the prong of the silent fork to vibrate through an infinitesimal space but just as it has completed this small vibration another pulse is ready to strike it thus the impulses add themselves together in the five seconds during which the forks were held near each other the vibrating fork sent 1280 waves against its neighbour and those 1280 shocks all delivered at the proper moment all as i have said perfectly timed have given such strength to the vibrations of the mounted fork as to render them audible to all another curious illustration of the influence of synchronism on musical vibrations is this three small gasflames are inserted into three glass tubes of different lengths each of these flames can be caused to emit a musical note the pitch of which is determined by the length of the tube surrounding the flame the shorter the tube the higher is the pitch the flames are now silent within their respective tubes but each of them can be caused to respond to a proper note sounded anywhere in this room with an instrument called a syren a powerful musical note of gradually increasing pitch can be produced beginning with a low note and ascending gradually to a higher one we finally attain the pitch of the flame in the longest tube the moment it is reached the flame bursts into song the other flames are still silent within their tubes but by urging the instrument on to higher notes the second flame is started and the third alone remains a still higher note starts it also thus as the sound of the syren rises gradually in pitch it awakens every flame in passing by striking it with a series of waves whose periods of recurrence are similar to its own now the wavemotion from the syren is in part taken up by the flame which synchronises with the waves and were these waves to impinge upon a multitude of flames instead of upon one flame only the transference might be so great as to absorb the whole of the original wave motion let us apply these facts to radiant heat this blue flame is the flame of carbonic oxide this transparent gas is carbonic acid gas in the blue flame we have carbonic acid intensely heated or in other words in a state of intense vibration it thus resembles the sounding fork while this cold carbonic acid resembles the silent one what is the consequence through the synchronism of the hot and cold gas the waves emitted by the former are intercepted by the latter the transmission of the radiant heat being thus prevented the cold gas is intensely opaque to the radiation from this particular flame though highly transparent to heat of every other kind we are here manifestly dealing with that great principle which lies at the basis of spectrum analysis and which has enabled scientific men to determine the substances of which the sun the stars and even the nebulae are composed the principle namely that a body which is competent to emit any ray whether of heat or light is competent in the same degree to absorb that ray the absorption depends on the synchronism existing between the vibrations of the atoms from which the rays or more correctly the waves issue and those of the atoms on which they impinge to its almost total incompetence to emit white light aqueous vapour adds a similar incompetence to absorb white light it cannot for example absorb the luminous rays of the sun though it can absorb the nonluminous rays of the earth this incompetence of the vapour to absorb luminous rays is shared by water and icein fact by all really transparent substances their transparency is due to their inability to absorb luminous rays the molecules of such substances are in dissonance with luminous waves and hence such waves pass through transparent bodies without disturbing the molecular rest a purely luminous beam however intense may be its heat is sensibly incompetent to melt ice we can for example converge a powerful luminous beam upon a surface covered with hoar frost without melting a single spicula of the crystals how then it may be asked are the snows of the alps swept away by the sunshine of summer i answer they are not swept away by sunshine at all but by rays which have no sunshine whatever in them the luminous rays of the sun fall upon the snowfields and are flashed in echoes from crystal to crystal but they find next to no lodgment within the crystals they are hardly at all absorbed and hence they cannot produce fusion but a body of powerful dark rays is emitted by the sun and it is these that cause the glaciers to shrink and the snows to disappear it is they that fill the banks of the arve and arveyron and liberate from their frozen captivity the rhone and the rhine placing a concave silvered mirror behind the electric light its rays are converged to a focus of dazzling brilliancy placing in the path of the rays between the light and the focus a vessel of water and introducing at the focus a piece of ice the ice is not melted by the concentrated beam matches at the same place are ignited and wood is set on fire the powerful heat then of this luminous beam is incompetent to melt the ice on withdrawing the cell of water the ice immediately liquefies and the water trickles from it in drops reintroducing the cell of water the fusion is arrested and the drops cease to fall the transparent water of the cell exerts no sensible absorption on the luminous rays still it withdraws something from the beam which when permitted to act is competent to melt the ice this something is the dark radiation of the electric light again i place a slab of pure ice in front of the electric lamp send a luminous beam first through our cell of water and then through the ice by means of a lens an image of the slab is cast upon a white screen the beam sifted by the water has little power upon the ice but observe what occurs when the water is removed we have here a star and there a star each star resembling a flower of six petals and growing visibly larger before our eyes as the leaves enlarge their edges become serrated but there is no deviation from the sixrayed type we have here in fact the crystallisation of the ice reversed by the invisible rays of the electric beam they take the molecules down in this wonderful way and reveal to us the exquisite atomic structure of the substance with which nature every winter roofs our ponds and lakes numberless effects apparently anomalous might be adduced in illustration of the action of these lightless rays these two powders for example are both white and undistinguishable from each other by the eye the luminous rays of the sun are unabsorbed by bothfrom such rays these powders acquire no heat still one of them sugar is heated so highly by the concentrated beam of the electric lamp that it first smokes and then violently inflames while the other substance salt is barely warmed at the focus placing two perfectly transparent liquids in testtubes at the focus one of them boils in a couple of seconds while the other in a similar position is hardly warmed the boilingpoint of the first liquid is 78c which is speedily reached that of the second liquid is only 48c which is never reached at all these anomalies are entirely due to the unseen element which mingles with the luminous rays of the electric beam and indeed constitutes 90 per cent of its calorific power a substance as many of you know has been discovered by which these dark rays may be detached from the total emission of the electric lamp this rayfilter is a liquid black as pitch to the luminous but bright as a diamond to the nonluminous radiation it mercilessly cuts off the former but allows the latter free transmission when these invisible rays are brought to a focus at a distance of several feet from the electric lamp the dark rays form an invisible image of their source by proper means this image may be transformed into a visible one of dazzling brightness it might moreover be shown if time permitted how out of those perfectly dark rays could be extracted by a process of transmutation all the colours of the solar spectrum it might also be proved that those rays powerful as they are and sufficient to fuse many metals can be permitted to enter the eye and to break upon the retina without producing the least luminous impression the dark rays being thus collected you see nothing at their place of convergence with a proper thermometer it could be proved that even the air at the focus is just as cold as the surrounding air and mark the conclusion to which this leads it proves the aether at the focus to be practically detached from the airthat the most violent aethereal motion may there exist without the least aerial motion but though you see it not there is sufficient heat at that focus to set london on fire the heat there is competent to raise iron to a temperature at which it throws off brilliant scintillations it can heat platinum to whiteness and almost fuse that refractory metal it actually can fuse gold silver copper and aluminium the moment moreover that wood is placed at the focus it bursts into a blaze it has been already affirmed that whether as regards radiation or absorption the elementary atoms possess but little power this might be illustrated by a long array of facts and one of the most singular of these is furnished by the deportment of that extremely combustible substance phosphorus when placed at the dark focus it is impossible to ignite there a fragment of amorphous phosphorus but ordinary phosphorus is a far quicker combustible and its deportment towards radiant heat is still more impressive it may be exposed to the intense radiation of an ordinary fire without bursting into flame it may also be exposed for twenty or thirty seconds at an obscure focus of sufficient power to raise platinum to a red heat without ignition notwithstanding the energy of the aethereal waves here concentrated notwithstanding the extremely inflammable character of the elementary body exposed to their action the atoms of that body refuse to partake of the motion of the powerful waves of low refrangibility and consequently cannot be affected by their heat the knowledge we now possess will enable us to analyse with profit a practical question white dresses are worn in summer because they are found to be cooler than dark ones the celebrated benjamin franklin placed bits of cloth of various colours upon snow exposed them to direct sunshine and found that they sank to different depths in the snow the black cloth sank deepest the white did not sink at all franklin inferred from this experiment that blackbodies are the best absorbers and white ones the worst absorbers of radiant heat let us test the generality of this conclusion one of these two cards is coated with a very dark powder and the other with a perfectly white one i place the powdered surfaces before a fire and leave them there until they have acquired as high a temperature as they can attain in this position which of the cards is then most highly heated it requires no thermometer to answer this question simply pressing the back of the card on which the white powder is strewn against the cheek or forehead it is found intolerably hot placing the dark card in the same position it is found cool the white powder has absorbed far more heat than the dark one this simple result abolishes a hundred conclusions which have been hastily drawn from the experiments of franklin again here are suspended two delicate mercurial thermometers at the same distance from a gasflame the bulb of one of them is covered by a dark substance the bulb of the other by a white one both bulbs have received the radiation from the flame but the white bulb has absorbed most and its mercury stands much higher than that of the other thermometer this experiment might be varied in a hundred ways it proves that from the darkness of a body you can draw no certain conclusion regarding its power of absorption the reason of this simply is that colour gives us intelligence of only one portion and that the smallest one of the rays impinging on the coloured body were the rays all luminous we might with certainty infer from the colour of a body its power of absorption but the great mass of the radiation from our fire our gasflame and even from the sun itself consists of invisible calorific rays regarding which colour teaches us nothing a body may be highly transparent to the one class of rays and highly opaque to the other thus the white powder which has shown itself so powerful an absorber has been specially selected on account of its extreme perviousness to the visible rays and its extreme imperviousness to the invisible ones while the dark powder was chosen on account of its extreme transparency to the invisible and its extreme opacity to the visible rays in the case of the radiation from our fire about 98 per cent of the whole emission consists of invisible rays the body therefore which was most opaque to these triumphed as an absorber though that body was a white one and here it is worth while to consider the manner in which we obtain from natural facts what may be called their intellectual value throughout the processes of nature we have interdependence and harmony and the main value of physics considered as a mental discipline consists in the tracing out of this interdependence and the demonstration of this harmony the outward and visible phenomena are the counters of the intellect and our science would not be worthy of its name and fame if it halted at facts however practically useful and neglected the laws which accompany and rule the phenomena let us endeavour then to extract from the experiment of franklin all that it can yield calling to our aid the knowledge which our predecessors have already stored let us imagine two pieces of cloth of the same texture the one black and the other white placed upon sunned snow fixing our attention on the white piece let us enquire whether there is any reason to expect that it will sink in the snow at all there is knowledge at hand which enables us to reply at once in the negative there is on the contrary reason to expect that after a sufficient exposure the bit of cloth will be found on an eminence instead of in a hollow that instead of a depression we shall have a relative elevation of the bit of cloth for as regards the luminous rays of the sun the cloth and the snow are alike powerless the one cannot be warmed nor the other melted by such rays the cloth is white and the snow is white because their confusedly mingled fibres and particles are incompetent to absorb the luminous rays whether then the cloth will sink or not depends entirely upon the dark rays of the sun now the substance which absorbs these dark rays with the greatest avidity is iceor snow which is merely ice in powder hence a less amounts of heat will be lodged in the cloth than in the surrounding snow the cloth must therefore act as a shield to the snow on which it rests and in consequence of the more rapid fusion of the exposed snow its shield must in due time be left behind perched upon an eminence like a glaciertable but though the snow transcends the cloth both as a radiator and absorber it does not much transcend it cloth is very powerful in both these respects let us now turn our attention to the piece of black cloth the texture and fabric of which i assume to be the same as that of the white for our object being to compare the effects of colour we must in order to study this effect in its purity preserve all the other conditions constant let us then suppose the black cloth to be obtained from the dyeing of the white the cloth itself without reference to the dye is nearly as good an absorber of heat as the snow around it but to the absorption of the dark solar rays by the undyed cloth is now added the absorption of the whole of the luminous rays and this great additional influx of heat is far more than sufficient to turn the balance in favour of the black cloth the sum of its actions on the dark and luminous rays exceeds the action of the snow on the dark rays alone hence the cloth will sink in the snow and this is the complete analysis of franklins experiments throughout this discourse the main stress has been laid on chemical constitution as influencing most powerfully the phenomena of radiation and absorption with regard to gases and vapours and to the liquids from which these vapours are derived it has been proved by the most varied and conclusive experiments that the acts of radiation and absorption are molecularthat they depend upon chemical and not upon mechanical condition in attempting to extend this principle to solids i was met by a multitude of facts obtained by celebrated experimenters which seemed flatly to forbid such an extension mellon for example had found the same radiant and absorbent power for chalk and lampblack mm masson and courtpe had performed a most elaborate series of experiments on chemical precipitates of various kinds and found that they one and all manifested the same power of radiation they concluded from their researches that when bodies are reduced to an extremely fine state of division the influence of this state is so powerful as entirely to mask and override whatever influence may be due to chemical constitution but it appears to me that through the whole of these researches an oversight has run the mere mention of which will show what caution is essential in the operations of experimental philosophy while an experiments or two will make clear wherein the oversight consists filling a brightly polished metal cube with boiling water i determine the quantity of heat emitted by two of the bright surfaces as a radiator of heat one of them far transcends the other both surfaces appear to be metallic what then is the cause of the observed difference in their radiative power simply this one of the surfaces is coated with transparent gum through which of course is seen the metallic lustre behind and this varnish though so perfectly transparent to luminous rays is as opaque as pitch or lampblack to nonluminous ones it is a powerful emitter of dark rays it is also a powerful absorber while therefore at the present moment it is copiously pouring forth radiant heat itself it does not allow a single ray from the metal behind to pass through it the varnish then and not the metal is the real radiator now melloni and masson and courtpe experimented thus they mixed their powders and precipitates with gumwater and laid them by means of a brush upon the surfaces of a cube like this true they saw their red powders red their white ones white and their black ones black but they saw these colours through the coat of varnish which surrounded every particle when therefore it was concluded that colour had no influence on radiation no chance had been given to it of asserting its influence when it was found that all chemical precipitates radiated alike it was the radiation from a varnish common to them all which showed the observed constancy hundreds perhaps thousands of experiments on radiant heat have been performed in this way by various enquirers but the work will i fear have to be done over again i am not indeed acquainted with an instance in which an oversight of so trivial a character has been committed by so many able men in succession vitiating so large an amounts of otherwise excellent work basing our reasonings thus on demonstrated facts we arrive at the extremely probable conclusion that the envelope of the particles and not the particles themselves was the real radiator in the experiments just referred to to reason thus and deduce their more or less probable consequences from experimental facts is an incessant exercise of the student of physical science but having thus followed for a time the light of reason alone through a series of phenomena and emerged from them with a purely intellectual conclusion our duty is to bring that conclusion to an experimental test in this way we fortify our science for the purpose of testing our conclusion regarding the influence of the gum i take two powders presenting the same physical appearance one of them is a compound of mercury and the other a compound of lead on two surfaces of a cube are spread these bright red powders without varnish of any kind filling the cube with boiling water and determining the radiation from the two surfaces one of them is found to emit thirtynine units of heat while the other emits seventyfour this surely is a great difference here however is a second cube having two of its surfaces coated with the same powders the only difference being that the powders are laid on by means of a transparent gum both surfaces are now absolutely alike in radiative power both of them emit somewhat more than was emitted by either of the unvarnished powders simply because the gum employed is a better radiator than either of them excluding all varnish and comparing white with white vast differences are found comparing black with black they are also different and when black and white are compared in some cases the black radiates far more than the white while in other cases the white radiates far more than the black determining moreover the absorptive power of those powders it is found to go handinhand with their radiative power the good radiator is a good absorber and the bad radiator is a bad absorber from all this it is evident that as regards the radiation and absorption of nonluminous heat colour teaches us nothing and that even as regards the radiation of the sun consisting as it does mainly of nonluminous rays conclusions as to the influence of colour may be altogether delusive this is the strict scientific upshot of our researches but it is not the less true that in the case of wearing appareland this for reasons which i have given in analysing the experiments of franklinblack dresses are more potent than white ones as absorbers of solar heat thus in brief outline have been brought before you a few of the results of recent enquiry if you ask me what is the use of them i can hardly answer you unless you define the term use if you meant to ask whether those dark rays which clear away the alpine snows will ever be applied to the roasting of turkeys or the driving of steamengineswhile affirming their power to do both i would frankly confess that they are not at present capable of competing profitably with coal in these particulars still they may have great uses unknown to me and when our coalfields are exhausted it is possible that a more aethereal race than we are may cook their victuals and perform their work in this transcendental way but is it necessary that the student of science should have his labours tested by their possible practical applications what is the practical value of homers iliad you smile and possibly think that homers iliad is good as a means of culture theres the rub the people who demand of science practical uses forget or do not know that it also is great as a means of culturethat the knowledge of this wonderful universe is a thing profitable in itself and requiring no practical application to justify its pursuit but while the student of nature distinctly refuses to have his labours judged by their practical issues unless the term practical be made to include mental as well as material good he knows full well that the greatest practical triumphs have been episodes in the search after pure natural truth the electric telegraph is the standing wonder of this age and the men whose scientific knowledge and mechanical skill have made the telegraph what it is are deserving of all honour in fact they have had their reward both in reputation and in those more substantial benefits which the direct service of the public always carries in its train but who i would ask put the soul into this telegraphic body who snatched from heaven the fire that flashes along the line this i am bound to say was done by two men the one a dweller in italy footnote volta the other a dweller in england footnote faraday who never in their enquiries consciously set a practical object before themwhose only stimulus was the fascination which draws the climber to a nevertrodden peak and would have made caesar quit his victories for the sources of the nile that the knowledge brought to us by those prophets priests and kings of science is what the world calls useful knowledge the triumphant application of their discoveries proves but science has another function to fulfil in the storing and the training of the human mind and i would base my appeal to you on the specimen which has this evening been brought before you whether any system of education at the present day can be deemed even approximately complete in which the knowledge of nature is neglected or ignored iv new chemical reactions produced by light 186869 1 decomposition by light measured by their power not to excite vision but to produce heatin other words measured by their absolute energythe ultrared waves of the sun and of the electric light as shown in the preceding articles far transcend the visible in the domain of chemistry however there are numerous cases in which the more powerful waves are ineffectual while the more minute waves through what may be called their timeliness of application are able to produce great effects a series of these of a novel and beautiful character discovered in 1868 and further illustrated in subsequent years may be exhibited by subjecting the vapours of volatile liquids to the action of concentrated sunlight or to the concentrated beam of the electric light their investigation led up to the discourse on dust and disease which follows in this volume and for this reason some account of them is introduced here a glass tube 3 feet long and 3 inches wide which had been frequently employed in my researches on radiant heat was supported horizontally on two stands at one end of the tube was placed an electric lamp the height and position of both being so arranged that the axis of the tube and that of the beam issuing from the lamp were coincident in the first experiments the two ends of the tube were closed by plates of rocksalt and subsequently by plates of glass for the sake of distinction i call this tube the experimental tube it was connected with an airpump and also with a series of drying and other tubes used for the purification of the air a number of testtubes like f fig 2 i have used at least fifty of them were converted into woulfs flasks each of them was stopped by a cork through which passed two glass tubes one of these tubes a ended immediately below the cork while the other b descended to the bottom of the flask being drawn out at its lower end to an orifice about 003 of an inch in diameter it was found necessary to coat the cork carefully with cement in the later experiments corks of vulcanised indiarubber were invariably employed the little flask thus formed being partially filled with the liquid whose vapour was to be examined was introduced into the path of the purified current of air the experimental tube being exhausted and the cock which cut off the supply of purified air being cautiously turned on the air entered the flask through the tube b and escaped by the small orifice at the lower end of b into the liquid through this it bubbled loading itself with vapour after which the mixed air and vapour passing from the flask by the tube a entered the experimental tube where they were subjected to the action of light the whole arrangement is shown in fig 3 where l represents the electric lamp ss the experimental tube pp the pipe leading to the airpump and f the testtube containing the volatile liquid the tube tt is plugged with cottonwool intended to intercept the floating matter of the air the bent tube t contains caustic potash the tube t sulphuric acid the one intended to remove the carbonic acid and the other the aqueous vapour of the air the power of the electric beam to reveal the existence of anything within the experimental tube or the impurities of the tube itself is extraordinary when the experiments is made in a darkened room a tube which in ordinary daylight appears absolutely clean is often shown by the present mode of examination to be exceedingly filthy the following are some of the results obtained with this arrangement nitrite of amyl the vapour of this liquid was in the first instance permitted to enter the experimental tube while the beam from the electric lamp was passing through it curious clouds the cause of which was then unknown were observed to form near the place of entry being afterwards whirled through the tube the tube being again exhausted the mixed air and vapour were allowed to enter it in the dark the slightly convergent beam of the electric light was then sent through the mixture for a moment the tube was optically empty nothing whatever being seen within it but before a second had elapsed a shower of particles was precipitated on the beam the cloud thus generated became denser as the light continued to act slowing at some places vivid iridescence the lens of the electric lamp was now placed so as to form within the tube a strongly convergent cone of rays the tube was cleansed and again filled in darkness when the light was sent through it the precipitation upon the beam was so rapid and intense that the cone which a moment before was invisible flashed suddenly forth like a solid luminous spear the effect was the same when the air and vapour were allowed to enter the tube in diffuse daylight the cloud however which shone with such extraordinary radiance under the electric beam was invisible in the ordinary light of the laboratory the quantity of mixed air and vapour within the experimental tube could of course be regulated at pleasure the rapidity of the action diminished with the attenuation of the vapour when for example the mercurial column associated with the experimental tube was depressed only five inches the action was not nearly so rapid as when the tube was full in such cases however it was exceedingly interesting to observe after some seconds of waiting a thin streamer of delicate bluishwhite cloud slowly forming along the axis of the tube and finally swelling so as to fill it fig 2 fig 3 when dry oxygen was employed to carry in the vapour the effect was the same as that obtained with air when dry hydrogen was used as a vehicle the effect was also the same the effect therefore is not due to any interaction between the vapour of the nitrite and its vehicle this was further demonstrated by the deportment of the vapour itself when it was permitted to enter the experimental tube unmixed with air or any other gas the effect was substantially the same hence the seat of the observed action is the vapour this action is not to be ascribed to heat as regards the glass of the experimental tube and the air within the tube the beam employed in these experiments was perfectly cold it had been sifted by passing it through a solution of alum and through the thick doubleconvex lens of the lamp when the unsifted beam of the lamp was employed the effect was still the same the obscure calorific rays did not appear to interfere with the result my object here being simply to point out to chemists a method of experiments which reveals a new and beautiful series of reactions i left to them the examination of the products of decomposition the group of atoms forming the molecule of nitrite of amyl is obviously shaken asunder by certain specific waves of the electric beam nitric oxide and other products of which the nitrate of amyl is probably one being the result of the decomposition the brown fumes of nitrous acid were seen mingling with the cloud within the experimental tube the nitrate of amyl being less volatile than the nitrite and not being able to maintain itself in the condition of vapour would be precipitated as a visible cloud along the track of the beam in the anterior portions of the tube a powerful sifting of the beam by the vapour occurs which diminishes the chemical action in the posterior portions in some experiments the precipitated cloud only extended halfway down the tube when under these circumstances the lamp was shifted so as to send the beam through the other end of the tube copious precipitation occurred there also solar light also effects the decomposition of the nitriteofamyl vapour on october 10 1868 i partially darkened a small room in the royal institution into which the sun shone permitting the light to enter through an open portion of the windowshutter in the track of the beam was placed a large planoconvex lens which formed a fine convergent cone in the dust of the room behind it the experimental tube was filled in the laboratory covered with a black cloth and carried into the partially darkened room on thrusting one end of the tube into the cone of rays behind the lens precipitation within the cone was copious and immediate the vapour at the distant end of the tube was in part shielded by that in front and was also more feebly acted on through the divergence of the rays on reversing the tube a second and similar cone was precipitated physical considerations i sought to determine the particular portion of the light which produced the foregoing effects when previous to entering the experimental tube the beam was caused to pass through a red glass the effect was greatly weakened but not extinguished this was also the case with various samples of yellow glass a blue glass being introduced before the removal of the yellow or the red on taking the latter away prompt precipitation occurred along the track of the blue beam hence in this case the more refrangible rays are the most chemically active the colour of the liquid nitrite of amyl indicates that this must be the case it is a feeble but distinct yellow in other words the yellow portion of the beam is most freely transmitted it is not however the transmitted portion of any beam which produces chemical action but the absorbed portion blue as the complementary colour to yellow is here absorbed and hence the more energetic action of the blue rays this reasoning however assumes that the same rays are absorbed by the liquid and its vapour the assumption is worth testing a solution of the yellow chromate of potash the colour of which may be made almost if not altogether identical with that of the liquid nitrite of amyl was found far more effective in stopping the chemical rays than either the red or the yellow glass but of all substances the liquid nitrite itself is most potent in arresting the rays which act upon its vapour a layer oneeighth of an inch in thickness which scarcely perceptibly affected the luminous intensity absorbed the entire chemical energy of the concentrated beam of the electric light the close relation subsisting between a liquid and its vapour as regards their action upon radiant heat has been already amply demonstrated footnote phil trans 1864 heat a mode of motion chap xii and p 61 of this volume as regards the nitrite of amyl this relation is more specific than in the cases hitherto adduced for here the special constituent of the beam which provokes the decomposition of the vapour is shown to be arrested by the liquid a question of extreme importance in molecular physics here arises what is the real mechanism of this absorption and where is its seat footnote my attention was very forcibly directed to this subject some years ago by a conversation with my excellent friend professor clausius i figure as others do a molecule as a group of atoms held together by their mutual forces but still capable of motion among themselves the vapour of the nitrite of amyl is to be regarded as an assemblage of such molecules the question now before us is this in the act of absorption is it the molecules that are effective or is it their constituent atoms is the vis viva of the intercepted lightwaves transferred to the molecule as a whole or to its constituent parts the molecule as a whole can only vibrate in virtue of the forces exerted between it and its neighbour molecules the intensity of these forces and consequently the rate of vibration would in this case be a function of the distance between the molecules now the identical absorption of the liquid and of the vaporous nitrite of amyl indicates an identical vibrating period on the part of liquid and vapour and this to my mind amounts to an experimental proof that the absorption occurs in the main within the molecule for it can hardly be supposed if the absorption were the act of the molecule as a whole that it could continue to affect waves of the same period after the substance had passed from the vaporous to the liquid state in point of fact the decomposition of the nitrite of amyl is itself to some extent an illustration of this internal molecular absorption for were the absorption the act of the molecule as a whole the relative motions of its constituent atoms would remain unchanged and there would be no mechanical cause for their separation it is probably the synchronism of the vibrations of one portion of the molecule with the incident waves that enables the amplitude of those vibrations to augment until the chain which binds the parts of the molecule together is snapped asunder i anticipate wide if not entire generality for the fact that a liquid and its vapour absorb the same rays a cell of liquid chlorine would i imagine deprive light more effectually of its power of causing chlorine and hydrogen to combine than any other filter of the luminous rays the rays which give chlorine its colour have nothing to do with this combination those that are absorbed by the chlorine being really effective rays a highly sensitive bulb containing chlorine and hydrogen in the exact proportions necessary for the formation of hydrochloric acid was placed at one end of an experimental tube the beam of the electric lamp being sent through it from the other the bulb did not explode when the tube was filled with chlorine while the explosion was violent and immediate when the tube was filled with air i anticipate for the liquid chlorine an action similar to but still more energetic than that exhibited by the gas if this should prove to be the case it will favour the view that chlorine itself is molecular and not monatomic production of skyblue by the decomposition of nitrite of amyl when the quantity of nitrite vapour is considerable and the light intense the chemical action is exceedingly rapid the particles precipitated being so large as to whiten the luminous beam not so however when a wellmixed and highly attenuated vapour fills the experimental tube the effect now to be described was first obtained when the vapour of the nitrite was derived from a portion of its liquid which had been accidentally introduced into the passage through which the dry air flowed into the experimental tube in this case the electric beam traversed the tube for several seconds before any action was visible decomposition then visibly commenced and advanced slowly when the light was very strong the cloud appeared of a milky blue when on the contrary the intensity was moderate the blue was pure and deep in brckes important experiments on the blue of the sky and the morning and evening red pure mastic is dissolved in alcohol and then dropped into water well stirred when the proportion of mastic to alcohol is correct the resin is precipitated so finely as to elude the highest microscopic power by reflected light such a medium appears bluish by transmitted light yellowish which latter colour by augmenting the quantity of the precipitate can be caused to pass into orange or red but the development of colour in the attenuated nitriteofamyl vapour is doubtless more similar to what takes place in our atmosphere the blue moreover is far purer and more skylike than that obtained from brueckes turbid medium never even in the skies of the alps have i seen a richer or a purer blue than that attainable by a suitable disposition of the light falling upon the precipitated vapour iodide of allylamong the liquids hitherto subjected to the concentrated electric light iodide of allyl in point of rapidity and intensity of action comes next to the nitrite of amyl with the iodide i have employed both oxygen and hydrogen as well as air as a vehicle and found the effect in all cases substantially the same the cloudcolumn here was exquisitely beautiful it revolved round the axis of the decomposing beam it was nipped at certain places like an hourglass and round the two bells of the glass delicate cloudfilaments twisted themselves in spirals it also folded itself into convolutions resembling those of shells in certain conditions of the atmosphere in the alps i have often observed clouds of a special pearly lustre when hydrogen was made the vehicle of the iodideof allyl vapour a similar lustre was most exquisitely shown with a suitable disposition of the light the purple hue of iodinevapour came out very strongly in the tube the remark already made as to the bearing of the decomposition of nitrite of amyl by light on the question of molecular absorption applies here also for were the absorption the work of the molecule as a whole the iodine would not be dislodged from the allyl with which it is combined the nonsynchronism of iodine with the waves of obscure heat is illustrated by its marvellous transparency to such heat may not its synchronism with the waves of light in the present instance be the cause of its divorce from the allyl iodide of isopropylthe action of light upon the vapour of this liquid is at first more languid than upon iodide of allyl indeed many beautiful reactions may be overlooked in consequence of this languor at the commencement after some minutes exposure however clouds begin to form which grow in density and in beauty as the light continues to act in every experiment hitherto made with this substance the column of cloud filling the experimental tube was divided into two distinct parts near the middle of the tube in one experiments a globe of cloud formed at the centre from which right and left issued an axis uniting the globe with two adjacent cylinders both globe and cylinders were animated by a common motion of rotation as the action continued paroxysms of motion were manifested the various parts of the cloud would rush through each other with sudden violence during these motions beautiful and grotesque cloudforms were developed at some places the nebulous mass would become ribbed so as to resemble the graining of wood a longitudinal motion would at times generate in it a series of curved transverse bands the retarding influence of the sides the tube causing an appearance resembling on a small scale the dirtbands of the mer de glace in the anterior portion of the tube those sudden commotion were most intense here buds of cloud would sprout forth and grow in a few seconds into perfect flowerlike forms the cloud of iodide of isopropyl had a character of its own and differed materially from all others that i had seen a gorgeous mauve colour was observed in the last twelve inches of the tube the vapour of iodine was present and it may have been the skyblue scattered by the precipitated particles which mingling with the purple of the iodine produced the mauve as in all other cases here adduced the effects were proved to be due to the light they never occurred in darkness the forms assumed by some of those actinic clouds as i propose to call them in consequence of rotations and other motions due to differences of temperature are perfectly astounding i content myself here with a meagre description of one more of them the tube being filled with the sensitive mixture the beam was sent through it the lens at the same time being so placed as to produce a cone of very intense light two minutes elapsed before anything was visible but at the end of this time a faint bluish cloud appeared to hang itself on the most concentrated portion of the beam soon afterwards a second cloud was formed five inches farther down the experimental tube both clouds were united by a slender cord of the same bluish tint as themselves as the action of the light continued the first cloud gradually resolved itself into a series of parallel disks of exquisite delicacy which rotated round an axis perpendicular to their surfaces and finally blended to a screw surface with an inclined generatrix this gradually changed into a filmy funnel from the narrow end of which the cord extended to the cloud in advance the latter also underwent slow but incessant modification it first resolved itself into a series of strata resembling those of the electric discharge after a little time and through changes which it was difficult to follow both clouds presented the appearance of a series of concentric funnels set one within the other the interior ones being seen through the outer ones those of the distant cloud resembled claretglasses in shape as many as six funnels were thus concentrically set together the two series being united by the delicate cord of cloud already referred to other cords and blender tubes were afterwards formed which coiled themselves in delicate spirals around the funnels rendering the light along the connectingcord more intense it diminished in thickness and became whiter this was a consequence of the enlargement of its particles the cord finally disappeared while the funnels melted into two ghostlike films shaped like parasols they were barely visible being of an exceedingly delicate blue tint they seemed woven of blue air to compare them with cobweb or with gauze would be to liken them to something infinitely grosser than themselves in all cases a distant candleflame when looked at through the cloud was sensibly undimmed 2 on the blue colour of the sky and the polarisation of skylight footnote in my lectures on light longman the polarisation of light will be found briefly but i trust clearly explained 1869 after the communication to the royal society of the foregoing brief account of a new series of chemical reactions produced by light the experiments upon this subject were continued the number of substances thus acted on being considerably increased i now however beg to direct attention to two questions glanced at incidentally in the preceding pagesthe blue colour of the sky and the polarisation of skylight reserving the historic treatment of the subject for a more fitting occasion i would merely mention now that these questions constitute in the opinion of our most eminent authorities the two great standing enigmas of meteorology indeed it was the interest manifested in them by sir john herschel in a letter of singular speculative power addressed to myself that caused me to enter upon the consideration of these questions so soon the apparatus with which i work consists as already stated of a glass tube about a yard in length and from 25 to 3 inches internal diameter the vapour to be examined is introduced into this tube in the manner already described and upon it the condensed beam of the electric lamp is permitted to act until the neutrality or the activity of the substance has been declared it has hitherto been my aim to render the chemical action of light upon vapours visible for this purpose substances have been chosen one at least of whose products of decomposition under light shall have a boilingpoint so high that as soon as the substance is formed it shall be precipitated by graduating the quantity of the vapour this precipitation may be rendered of any degree of fineness forming particles distinguishable by the naked eye or far beyond the reach of our highest microscopic powers i have no reason to doubt that particles may be thus obtained whose diameters constitute but a small fraction of the length of a wave of violet light in all cases when the vapours of the liquids employed are sufficiently attenuated no matter what the liquid may be the visible action commences with the formation of a blue cloud but here i must guard myself against all misconception as to the use of this term the cloud here referred to is totally invisible in ordinary daylight to be seen it requires to be surrounded by darkness it only being illuminated by a powerful beam of light this blue cloud differs in many important particulars from the finest ordinary clouds and might justly have assigned to it an intermediate position between such clouds and true vapour with this explanation the term cloud or incipient cloud or actinic cloud as i propose to employ it cannot i think be misunderstood i had been endeavouring to decompose carbonic acid gas by light a faint bluish cloud due it may be or it may not be to the residue of some vapour previously employed was formed in the experimental tube on looking across this cloud through a nicols prism the line of vision being horizontal it was found that when the short diagonal of the prism was vertical the quantity of light reaching the eye was greater than when the long diagonal was vertical when a plate of tourmaline was held between the eye and the bluish cloud the quantity of light reaching the eye when the axis of the prism was perpendicular to the axis of the illuminating beam was greater than when the axes of the crystal and of the beam were parallel to each other this was the result all round the experimental tube causing the crystal of tourmaline to revolve round the tube with its axis perpendicular to the illuminating beam the quantity of light that reached the eye was in all its positions a maximum when the crystallographic axis was parallel to the axis of the beam the quantity of light transmitted by the crystal was a minimum from the illuminated bluish cloud therefore polarised light was discharged the direction of maximum polarisation being at right angles to the illuminating beam the plane of vibration of the polarised light was perpendicular to the beam footnote this is still an undecided point but the probabilities are so much in its favour and it is in my opinion so much preferable to have a physical image on which the mind can rest that i do not hesitate to employ the phraseology in the text thin plates of selenite or of quartz placed between the nicol and the actinic cloud displayed the colours of polarised light these colours being most vivid when the line of vision was at right angles to the experimental tube the plate of selenite usually employed was a circle thinnest at the centre and augmenting uniformly in thickness from the centre outwards when placed in its proper position between the nicol and the cloud it exhibited a system of splendidlycoloured rings the cloud here referred to was the first operated upon in the manner described it may however be greatly improved upon by the choice of proper substances and by the application in proper quantities of the substances chosen benzol bisulphide of carbon nitrite of amyl nitrite of butyl iodide of allyl iodide of isopropyl and many other substances may be employed i will take the nitrite of butyl as illustrative of the means adopted to secure the best result with reference to the present question and here it may be mentioned that a vapour which when alone or mixed with air in the experimental tube resists the action of light or shows but a feeble result of this action may when placed in proximity with another gas or vapour exhibit vigorous if not violent action the case is similar to that of carbonic acid gas which diffused in the atmosphere resists the decomposing action of solar light but when placed in contiguity with chlorophyl in the leaves of plants has its molecules shaken asunder dry air was permitted to bubble through the liquid nitrite of butyl until the experimental tube which had been previously exhausted was filled with the mixed air and vapour the visible action of light upon the mixture after fifteen minutes exposure was slight the tube was afterwards filled with half an atmosphere of the mixed air and vapour and a second halfatmosphere of air which had been permitted to bubble through fresh commercial hydrochloric acid on sending the beam through this mixture the tube for a moment was optically empty but the pause amounted only to a small fraction of a second a dense cloud being immediately precipitated upon the beam this cloud began blue but the advance to whiteness was so rapid as almost to justify the application of the term instantaneous the dense cloud looked at perpendicularly to its axis showed scarcely any signs of polarisation looked at obliquely the polarisation was strong the experimental tube being again cleansed and exhausted the mixed air and nitriteofbutyl vapour was permitted to enter it until the associated mercury column was depressed 110 of an inch in other words the air and vapour united exercised a pressure not exceeding 1300th of an atmosphere air passed through a solution of hydrochloric acid was then added till the mercury column was depressed three inches the condensed beam of the electric light was passed for some time through this mixture without revealing anything within the tube competent to scatter the light soon however a superbly blue cloud was formed along the track of the beam and it continued blue sufficiently long to permit of its thorough examination the light discharged from the cloud at right angles to its own length was at first perfectly polarised it could be totally quenched by the nicol by degrees the cloud became of whitish blue and for a time the selenite colours obtained by looking at it normally were exceedingly brilliant the direction of maximum polarisation was distinctly at right angles to the illuminating beam this continued to be the case as long as the cloud maintained a decided blue colour and even for some time after the blue had changed to whitish blue but as the light continued to act the cloud became coarser and whiter particularly at its centre where it at length ceased to discharge polarised light in the direction of the perpendicular while it continued to do so at both ends but the cloud which had thus ceased to polarise the light emitted normally showed vivid selenite colours when looked at obliquely proving that the direction of maximum polarisation changed with the texture of the cloud this point shall receive further illustration subsequently a blue equally rich and more durable was obtained by employing the nitriteofbutyl vapour in a still more attenuated condition the instance here cited is representative in all cases and with all substances the cloud formed at the commencement when the precipitated particles are sufficiently fine is blue and it can be made to display a colour rivalling that of the purest italian sky in all cases moreover this fine blue cloud polarises perfectly the beam which illuminates it the direction of polarisation enclosing an angle of 90 with the axis of the illuminating beam it is exceedingly interesting to observe both the perfection and the decay of this polarisation for ten or fifteen minutes after its first appearance the light from a vividly illuminated actinic cloud looked at perpendicularly is absolutely quenched by a nicols prism with its longer diagonal vertical but as the skyblue is gradually rendered impure by the growth of the particlesin other words as real clouds begin to be formedthe polarisation begins to decay a portion of the light passing through the prism in all its positions it is worthy of note that for some time after the cessation of perfect polarisation the residual light which passes when the nicol is in its position of minimum transmission is of a gorgeous blue the whiter light of the cloud being extinguished footnote this shows that particles too large to polarise the blue polarise perfectly light of lower refrangibility when the cloud texture has become sufficiently coarse to approximate to that of ordinary clouds the rotation of the nicol ceases to have any sensible effect on the quantity of light discharged normally the perfection of the polarisation in a direction perpendicular to the illuminating beam is also illustrated by the following experiments a nicols prism large enough to embrace the entire beam of the electric lamp was placed between the lamp and the experimental tube a few bubbles of air carried through the liquid nitrite of butyl were introduced into the tube and they were followed by about three inches measured by the mercurial gauge of air which had passed through aqueous hydrochloric acid sending the polarised beam through the tube i placed myself in front of it my eye being on a level with its axis my assistant occupying a similar position behind the tube the short diagonal of the large nicol was in the first instance vertical the plane of vibration of the emergent beam being therefore also vertical as the light continued to act a superb blue cloud visible to both my assistant and myself was slowly formed but this cloud so deep and rich when looked at from the positions mentioned utterly disappeared when looked at vertically downwards or vertically upwards reflection from the cloud was not possible in these directions when the large nicol was slowly turned round its axis the eye of the observer being on the level of the beam and the line of vision perpendicular to it entire extinction of the light emitted horizontally occurred when the longer diagonal of the large nicol was vertical but now a vivid blue cloud was seen when looked at downwards or upwards this truly fine experiments which i contemplated making on my own account was first definitely suggested by a remark in a letter addressed to me by professor stokes as regards the polarisation of skylight the greatest stumblingblock has hitherto been that in accordance with the law of brewster which makes the index of refraction the tangent of the polarising angle the reflection which produces perfect polarisation would require to be made in air upon air and indeed this led many of our most eminent men brewster himself among the number to entertain the idea of aerial molecular reflection footnote the cause of the polarisation is evidently a reflection of the suns light upon something the question is on what were the angle of maximum polarisation 76 we should look to water or ice as the reflecting body however inconceivable the existence in a cloudless atmosphere and a hot summers day of unevaporated molecules particles of water but though we were once of this opinion careful observation has satisfied us that 90 or thereabouts is the correct angle and that therefore whatever be the body on which the light has been reflected if polarised by a single reflection the polarising angle must be 45 and the index of refraction which is the tangent of that angle unity in other words the reflection would require to be made in air upon air sir john herschel meteorology par 233 any particles if small enough will produce both the colour and the polarisation of the sky but is the existence of small waterparticles on a hot summers day in the higher regions of our atmosphere inconceivable it is to be remembered that the oxygen and nitrogen of the air behave as a vacuum to radiant heat the exceedingly attenuated vapour of the higher atmosphere being therefore in practical contact with the cold of space i have however operated upon substances of widely different refractive indices and therefore of very different polarising angles as ordinarily defined but the polarisation of the beam by the incipient cloud has thus far proved itself to be absolutely independent of the polarising angle the law of brewster does not apply to matter in this condition and it rests with the undulatory theory to explain why whenever the precipitated particles are sufficiently fine no matter what the substance forming the particles may be the direction of maximum polarisation is at right angles to the illuminating beam the polarising angle for matter in this condition being invariably 45 suppose our atmosphere surrounded by an envelope impervious to light but with an aperture on the sunward side through which a parallel beam of solar light could enter and traverse the atmosphere surrounded by air not directly illuminated the track of such a beam would resemble that of the parallel beam of the electric lamp through an incipient cloud the sunbeam would be blue and it would discharge laterally light in precisely the same condition as that discharged by the incipient cloud in fact the azure revealed by such a beam would be to all intents and purposes that which i have called a blue cloud conversely our blue cloud is to all intents and purposes an artificial sky footnote the opinion of sir john herschel connecting the polarisation and the blue colour of the sky is verified by the foregoing results the more the subject the polarisation of skylight is considered writes this eminent philosopher the more it will be found beset with difficulties and its explanation when arrived at will probably be found to carry with it that of the blue colour of the sky itself and of the great quantity of light it actually does send down to us we may observe too he adds that it is only where the purity of the sky is most absolute that the polarisation is developed in its highest degree and that where there is the slightest perceptible tendency to cirrus it is materially impaired this applies word for word to our incipient clouds but as regards the polarisation of the sky we know that not only is the direction of maximum polarisation at right angles to the track of the solar beams but that at certain angular distances probably variable ones from the sun neutral points or points of no polarisation exist on both sides of which the planes of atmospheric polarisation are at right angles to each other i have made various observations upon this subject which are reserved for the present but pending the more complete examination of the question the following facts bearing upon it may be submitted the parallel beam employed in these experiments tracked its way through the laboratory air exactly as sunbeams are seen to do in the dusty air of london i have reason to believe that a great portion of the matter thus floating in the laboratory air consists of organic particles which are capable of imparting a perceptibly bluish tint to the air these also showed though far less vividly all the effects of polarisation obtained with the incipient clouds the light discharged laterally from the track of the illuminating beam was polarised though not perfectly the direction of maximum polarisation being at right angles to the beam at all points of the beam moreover throughout its entire length the light emitted normally was in the same state of polarisation keeping the positions of the nicol and the selenite constant the same colours were observed throughout the entire beam when the line of vision was perpendicular to its length the horizontal column of air thus illuminated was 18 feet long and could therefore be looked at very obliquely i placed myself near the end of the beam as it issued from the electric lamp and looking through the nicol and selenite more and more obliquely at the beam observed the colours fading until they disappeared augmenting the obliquity the colours appeared once more but they were now complementary to the former ones hence this beam like the sky exhibited a neutral point on opposite sides of which the light was polarised in planes at right angles to each other thinking that the action observed in the laboratory might be caused in some way by the vaporous fumes diffused in its air i had the light removed to a room at the top of the royal institution the track of the beam was seen very finely in the air of this room a length of 14 or 15 feet being attainable this beam exhibited all the effects observed with the beam in the laboratory even the uncondensed electric light falling on the floating matter showed though faintly the effects of polarisation when the air was so sifted as to entirely remove the visible floating matter it no longer exerted any sensible action upon the light but behaved like a vacuum the light is scattered and polarised by particles not by molecules or atoms by operating upon the fumes of chloride of ammonium the smoke of brown paper and tobaccosmoke i had varied and confirmed in many ways those experiments on neutral points when my attention was drawn by sir charles wheatstone to an important observation communicated to the paris academy in 1860 by professor govi of turin footnote comptes rendus tome li pp 360 and 669 m govi had been led to examine a beam of light sent through a room in which were successively diffused the smoke of incense and tobaccosmoke his first brief communication stated the fact of polarisation by such smoke but in his second communication he announced the discovery of a neutral point in the beam at the opposite sides of which the light was polarised in planes at right angles to each other but unlike my observations on the laboratory air and unlike the action of the sky the direction of maximum polarisation in m govis experiments enclosed a very small angle with the axis of the illuminating beam the question was left in this condition and i am not aware that m govi or any other investigator has pursued it further i had noticed as before stated that as the clouds formed in the experimental tube became denser the polarisation of the light discharged at right angles to the beam became weaker the direction of maximum polarisation becoming oblique to the beam experiments on the fumes of chloride of ammonium gave me also reason to suspect that the position of the neutral point was not constant but that it varied with the density of the illuminated fumes the examination of these questions led to the following new and remarkable results the laboratory being well filled with the fumes of incense and sufficient time being allowed for their uniform diffusion the electric beam was sent through the smoke from the track of the beam polarised light was discharged but the direction of maximum polarisation instead of being perpendicular now enclosed an angle of only 12 or 13 with the axis of the beam a neutral point with complementary effects at opposite sides of it was also exhibited by the beam the angle enclosed by the axis of the beam and a line drawn from the neutral point to the observers eye measured in the first instance 66 the windows of the laboratory were now opened for some minutes a portion of the incensesmoke being permitted to escape on again darkening the room and turning on the light the line of vision to the neutral point was found to enclose with the axis of the beam an angle of 63 the windows were again opened for a few minutes more of the smoke being permitted to escape measured as before the angle referred to was found to be 54 this process was repeated three additional times the neutral point was found to recede lower and lower down the beam the angle between a line drawn from the eye to the neutral point and the axis of the beam falling successively from 54 to 49 43 and 33 the distances roughly measured of the neutral point from the lamp corresponding to the foregoing series of observations were these 1st observation 2 feet 2 inches 2nd observation 2 feet 6 inches 3rd observation 2 feet 10 inches 4th observation 3 feet 2 inches 5th observation 3 feet 7 inches 6th observation 4 feet 6 inches at the end of this series of experiments the direction of maximum polarisation had again become normal to the beam the laboratory was next filled with the fumes of gunpowder in five successive experiments corresponding to five different densities of the gunpowdersmoke the angles enclosed between the line of vision to the neutral point and the axis of the beam were 63 degrees 50 47 42 and 38 respectively after the clouds of gunpowder had cleared away the laboratory was filled with the fumes of common resin rendered so dense as to be very irritating to the lungs the direction of maximum polarisation enclosed in this case an angle of 12 or thereabouts with the axis of the beam looked at as in the former instances from a position near the electric lamp no neutral point was observed throughout the entire extent of the beam when this beam was looked at normally through the selenite and nicol the ringsystem though not brilliant was distinct keeping the eye upon the plate of selenite and the line of vision perpendicular the windows were opened the blinds remaining undrawn the resinous fumes slowly diminished and as they did so the ringsystem became paler it finally disappeared continuing to look in the same direction the rings revived but now the colours were complementary to the former ones the neutral point had passed me in its motion down the beam consequent upon the attenuation of the fumes of resin with the fumes of chloride of ammonium substantially the same results were obtained sufficient however has been here stated to illustrate the variability of the position of the neutral point footnote brewster has proved the variability of the position of the neutral point for skylight with the suns altitude a result obviously connected with the foregoing experiments by a puff of tobaccosmoke or of condensed steam blown into the illuminated beam the brilliancy of the selenite colours may be greatly enhanced but with different clouds two different effects are produced let the ringsystem observed in the common air be brought to its maximum strength and then let an attenuated cloud of chloride of ammonium be thrown into the beam at the point looked at the ring system flashes out with augmented brilliancy but the character of the polarisation remains unchanged this is also the case when phosphorus or sulphur is burned underneath the beam so as to cause the fine particles of phosphorus or of sulphur to rise into the light with the sulphurfumes the brilliancy of the colours is exceedingly intensified but in none of these cases is there any change in the character of the polarisation but when a puff of the fumes of hydrochloric acid hydriodic acid or nitric acid is thrown into the beam there is a complete reversal of the selenite tints each of these clouds twists the plane of polarisation 90 causing the centre of the ringsystem to change from black to white and the rings themselves to emit their complementary colours footnote sir john herschel suggested to me that this change of the polarisation from positive to negative may indicate a change from polarisation by reflection to polarisation by refraction this thought repeatedly occurred to me while looking at the effects but it will require much following up before it emerges into clearness almost all liquids have motes in them sufficiently numerous to polarise sensibly the light and very beautiful effects may be obtained by simple artificial devices when for example a cell of distilled water is placed in front of the electric lamp and a thin slice of the beam is permitted to pass through it scarcely any polarised light is discharged and scarcely any colour produced with a plate of selenite but if a bit of soap be agitated in the water above the beam the moment the infinitesimal particles reach the light the liquid sends forth laterally almost perfectly polarised light and if the selenite be employed vivid colours flash into existence a still more brilliant result is obtained with mastic dissolved in a great excess of alcohol the selenite rings in fact constitute an extremely delicate test as to the collective quantity of individually invisible particles in a liquid commencing with distilled water for example a thick slice of light is necessary to make the polarisation of its suspended particles sensible a much thinner slice suffices for common water while with brueckes precipitated mastic a slice too thin to produce any sensible effect with most other liquids suffices to bring out vividly the selenite colours 3 the sky of the alps the vision of an object always implies a differential action on the retina of the observer the object is distinguished from surrounding space by its excess or defect of light in relation to that space by altering the illumination either of the object itself or of its environment we alter the appearance of the object take the case of clouds floating in the atmosphere with patches of blue between them anything that changes the illumination of either alters the appearance of both that appearance depending as stated upon differential action now the light of the sky being polarised may as the reader of the foregoing pages knows be in great part quenched by a nicols prism while the light of a common cloud being unpolarised cannot be thus extinguished hence the possibility of very remarkable variations not only in the aspect of the firmament which is really changed but also in the aspect of the clouds which have that firmament as a background it is possible for example to choose clouds of such a depth of shade that when the nicol quenches the light behind them they shall vanish being undistinguishable from the residual dull tint which outlives the extinction of the brilliancy of the sky a cloud less deeply shaded but still deep enough when viewed with the naked eye to appear dark on a bright ground is suddenly changed to a white cloud on a dark ground by the quenching of the light behind it when a reddish cloud at sunset chances to float in the region of maximum polarisation the quenching of the surrounding light causes it to flash with a brighter crimson last easter eve the dartmoor sky which had just been cleansed by a snowstorm wore a very wild appearance round the horizon it was of steely brilliancy while reddish cumuli and cirri floated southwards when the sky was quenched behind them these floating masses seemed like dull embers suddenly blown upon they brightened like a fire in the alps we have the most magnificent examples of crimson clouds and snows so that the effects just referred to may be here studied under the best possible conditions on august 23 1869 the evening alpenglow was very fine though it did not reach its maximum depth and splendour the side of the weisshorn seen from the bel alp being turned from the sun was tinted mauve but i wished to observe one of the rosecoloured buttresses of the mountain such a one was visible from a point a few hundred feet above the hotel the matterhorn also though for the most part in shade had a crimson projection while a deep ruddy red lingered along its western shoulder four distinct peaks and buttresses of the dom in addition to its dominant headall covered with pure snowwere reddened by the light of sunset the shoulder of the alphubel was similarly coloured while the great mass of the fletschorn was all aglow and so was the snowy spine of the monte leone looking at the weisshorn through the nicol the glow of its protuberance was strong or weak according to the position of the prism the summit also underwent striking changes in one position of the prism it exhibited a pale white against a dark background in the rectangular position it was a dark mauve against a light background the red of the matterhorn changed in a similar manner but the whole mountain also passed through wonderful changes of definition the air at the time was filled with a silvery haze in which the matterhorn almost disappeared this could be wholly quenched by the nicol and then the mountain sprang forth with astonishing solidity and detachment from the surrounding air the changes of the dom were still more wonderful a vast amounts of light could be removed from the sky behind it for it occupied the position of maximum polarisation by a little practice with the nicol it was easy to render the extinction of the light or its restoration almost instantaneous when the sky was quenched the four minor peaks and buttresses and the summit of the dom together with the shoulder of the alphubel glowed as if set suddenly on fire this was immediately dimmed by turning the nicol through an angle of 90 it was not the stoppage of the light of the sky behind the mountains alone which produced this startling effect the air between them and me was highly opalescent and the quenching of this intermediate glare augmented remarkably the distinctness of the mountains on the morning of august 24 similar effects were finely shown at 10 am all three mountains the dom the matterhorn and the weisshorn were powerfully affected by the nicol but in this instance also the line drawn to the dom being very nearly perpendicular to the solar beams the effects on this mountain were most striking the grey summit of the matterhorn at the same time could scarcely be distinguished from the opalescent haze around it but when the nicol quenched the haze the summit became instantly isolated and stood out in bold definition it is to be remembered that in the production of these effects the only things changed are the sky behind and the luminous haze in front of the mountains that these are changed because the light emitted from the sky and from the haze is plane polarised light and that the light from the snows and from the mountains being sensibly unpolarised is not directly affected by the nicol it will also be understood that it is not the interposition of the haze as an opaque body that renders the mountains indistinct but that it is the light of the haze which dims and bewilders the eye and thus weakens the definition of objects seen through it these results have a direct bearing upon what artists call aerial perspective as we look from the summit of mont blanc or from a lower elevation at the serried crowd of peaks especially if the mountains be darkly colouredcovered with pines for exampleevery peak and ridge is separated from the mountains behind it by a thin blue haze which renders the relations of the mountains as to distance unmistakable when this haze is regarded through the nicol perpendicular to the suns rays it is in many cases wholly quenched because the light which it emits in this direction is wholly polarised when this happens aerial perspective is abolished and mountains very differently distant appear to rise in the same vertical plane close to the bel alp for instance is the gorge of the massa and beyond the gorge is a high ridge darkened by pines this ridge may be projected upon the dark slopes at the opposite side of the rhone valley and between both we have the blue haze referred to throwing the distant mountains far away but at certain hours of the day the haze may be quenched and then the massa ridge and the mountains beyond the rhone seem almost equally distant from the eye the one appears as it were a vertical continuation of the other the haze varies with the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere at certain times and places it is almost as blue as the sky itself but to see its colour the attention must be withdrawn from the mountains and from the trees which cover them in point of fact the haze is a piece of more or less perfect sky it is produced in the same manner and is subject to the same laws as the firmament itself we live in the sky not under it these points were further elucidated by the deportment of the selenite plate with which the readers of the foregoing pages are so well acquainted on some of the sunny days of august the haze in the valley of the rhone as looked at from the bel alp was very remarkable towards evening the sky above the mountains opposite to my place of observation yielded a series of the most splendidlycoloured irisrings but on lowering the selenite until it had the darkness of the pines at the opposite side of the rhone valley instead of the darkness of space as a background the colours were not much diminished in brilliancy i should estimate the distance across the valley as the crow flies to the opposite mountain at nine miles so that a body of air of this thickness can under favourable circumstances produce chromatic effects of polarisation almost as vivid as those produced by the sky itself again the light of a landscape as of most other things consists of two parts the one coming purely from superficial reflection is always of the same colour as the light which falls upon the landscape the other part reaches us from a certain depth within the objects which compose the landscape and it is this portion of the total light which gives these objects their distinctive colours the white light of the sun enters all substances to a certain depth and is partly ejected by internal reflection each distinct substance absorbing and reflecting the light in accordance with the laws of its own molecular constitution thus the solar light is sifted by the landscape which appears in such colours and variations of colour as after the sifting process reach the observers eye thus the bright green of grass or the darker colour of the pine never comes to us alone but is always mingled with an amounts of light derived from superficial reflection a certain hard brilliancy is conferred upon the woods and meadows by this superficiallyreflected light under certain circumstances it may be quenched by a nicols prism and we then obtain the true colour of the grass and foliage trees and meadows thus regarded exhibit a richness and softness of tint which they never show as long as the superficial light is permitted to mingle with the true interior emission the needles of the pines show this effect very well largeleaved trees still better while a glimmering field of maize exhibits the most extraordinary variations when looked at through the rotating nicol thoughts and questions like those here referred to took me in august 1869 to the top of the aletschhorn the effects described in the foregoing paragraphs were for the most part reproduced on the summit of the mountain i scanned the whole of the sky with my nicol both alone and in conjunction with the selenite it pronounced the perpendicular to the solar beams to be the direction of maximum polarisation but at no portion of the firmament was the polarisation complete the artificial sky produced in the experiments recorded in the preceding pages could in this respect be rendered far more perfect than the natural one while the gorgeous residual blue which makes its appearance when the polarisation of the artificial sky ceases to be perfect was strongly contrasted with the lacklustre hue which in the case of the firmament outlived the extinction of the brilliancy with certain substances however artificially treated this dull residue may also be obtained all along the arc from the matterhorn to mont blanc the light of the sky immediately above the mountains was powerfully acted upon by the nicol in some cases the variations of intensity were astonishing i have already said that a little practice enables the observer to shift the nicol from one position to another so rapidly as to render the alternative extinction and restoration of the light immediate when this was done along the arc to which i have referred the alternations of light and darkness resembled the play of sheet lightning behind the mountains there was an element of awe connected with the suddenness with which the mighty masses ranged along the line referred to changed their aspect and definition under the operation of the prism the physical reason of the blueness of both natural and artificial skies is i trust correctly given in the essay on the scientific use of the imagination published in the second volume of these fragments v on dust and disease footnote a discourse delivered before the royal institution of great britain january 21 1870 experiments on dusty air solar light in passing through a dark room reveals its track by illuminating the dust floating in the air the sun says daniel culverwell discovers atomes though they be invisible by candlelight and makes them dance naked in his beams in my researches on the decomposition of vapours by light i was compelled to remove these atoms and this dust it was essential that the space containing the vapours should embrace no visible thingthat no substance capable of scattering light in the slightest sensible degree should at the outset of an experiments be found in the wide experimental tube in which the vapour was enclosed for a long time i was troubled by the appearance there of floating matter which though invisible in diffuse daylight was at once revealed by a powerfully condensed beam two utubes were placed in succession in the path of the air before it entered the liquid whose vapour was to be carried into the experimental tube one of the utubes contained fragments of marble wetted with a strong solution of caustic potash the other fragments of glass wetted with concentrated sulphuric acid which while yielding no vapour of its own powerfully absorbs the aqueous vapour of the air footnote the apparatus is figured in fig 3 to my astonishment the air of the royal institution sent through these tubes at a rate sufficiently slow to dry it and to remove its carbonic acid carried into the experimental tube a considerable amounts of mechanically suspended matter which was illuminated when the beam passed through the tube the effect was substantially the same when the air was permitted to bubble through the liquid acid and through the solution of potash i tried to intercept this floating matter in various ways and on october 5 1868 prior to sending the air through the drying apparatus it was carefully permitted to pass over the tip of a spiritlamp flame the floating matter no longer appeared having been burnt up by the flame it was therefore organic matter i was by no means prepared for this result having previously thought that the dust of our air was in great part inorganic and noncombustible footnote according to an analysis kindly furnished to me by dr percy the dust collected from the walls of the british museum contains fully 50 per cent of inorganic matter i have every confidence in the results of this distinguished chemist they show that the floating dust of our rooms is as it were winnowed from the heavier matter as bearing directly upon this point i may quote the following passage from pasteur mais ici se prsente une remarque la poussire que pon trouve la surface de tous les corps est soumise constamment des courants dair qui doivent soulever des particules les plus lgres au nombre desquelles se trouvent sans doute de prfrence les corpuscules organiss oeufs ou spores moins lourds gnralement que les particules minrales i had constructed a small gasfurnace now much employed by chemists containing a platinum tube which could be heated to vivid redness footnote pasteur was i believe the first to employ such a tube the tube contained a roll of platinum gauze which while it permitted the air to pass through it ensured the practical contact of the dust with the incandescent metal the air of the laboratory was permitted to enter the experimental tube sometimes through the cold and sometimes through the heated tube of platinum in the first column of the following fragment of a long table the quantity of air operated on is expressed by the depression of the mercury gauge of the airpump in the second column the condition of the platinum tube is mentioned and in the third the state of the air in the experimental tube quantity of air state of platinum tube state of experimental tube 15 inches cold full of particles 30 inches redhot optically empty the phrase optically empty shows that when the conditions of perfect combustion were present the floating matter totally disappeared in a cylindrical beam which strongly illuminated the dust of the laboratory i placed an ignited spiritlamp mingling with the flame and round its rim were seen curious wreaths of darkness resembling an intensely black smoke on placing the flame at some distance below the beam the same dark masses stormed upwards they were blacker than the blackest smoke ever seen issuing from the funnel of a steamer and their resemblance to smoke was so perfect as to lead the most practised observer to conclude that the apparently pure flame of the alcohol lamp required but a beam of sufficient intensity to reveal its clouds of liberated carbon but is the blackness smoke this question presented itself in a moment and was thus answered a redhot poker was placed underneath the beam from it the black wreaths also ascended a large hydrogen flame was next employed and it produced those whirling masses of darkness far more copiously than either the spiritflame or poker smoke was therefore out of the question footnote in none of the public rooms of the united states where i had the honour to lecture was this experiment made the organic dust was too scanty certain rooms in englandthe brighton pavilion for examplealso lack the necessary conditions what then was the blackness it was simply that of stellar space that is to say blackness resulting from the absence from the track of the beam of all matter competent to scatter its light when the flame was placed below the beam the floating matter was destroyed in situ and the air freed from this matter rose into the beam jostled aside the illuminated particles and substituted for their light the darkness due to its own perfect transparency nothing could more forcibly illustrate the invisibility of the agent which renders all things visible the beam crossed unseen the black chasm formed by the transparent air while at both sides of the gap the thickstrewn particles shone out like a luminous solid under the powerful illumination it is not however necessary to burn the particles to produce a stream of darkness without actual combustion currents may be generated which shall displace the floating matter and appear dark amid the surrounding brightness i noticed this effect first on placing a redhot copper ball below the beam and permitting it to remain there until its temperature had fallen below that of boiling water the dark currents though much enfeebled were still produced they may also be produced by a flask filled with hot water to study this effect a platinum wire was stretched across the beam the two ends of the wire being connected with the two poles of a voltaic battery to regulate the strength of the current a rheostat was placed in the circuit beginning with a feeble current the temperature of the wire was gradually augmented but long before it reached the heat of ignition a flat stream of air rose from it which when looked at edgeways appeared darker and sharper than one of the blackest lines of fraunhofer in the purified spectrum right and left of this dark vertical band the floating matter rose upwards bounding definitely the nonluminous stream of air what is the explanation simply this the hot wire rarefied the air in contact with it but it did not equally lighten the floating matter the convection current of pure air therefore passed upwards among the inert particles dragging them after it right and left but forming between them an impassable black partition this elementary experiments enables us to render an account of the dark currents produced by bodies at a temperature below that of combustion but when the platinum wire is intensely heated the floating matter is not only displaced but destroyed i stretched a wire about 4 inches long through the air of an ordinary glass shade resting on cottonwool which also surrounded the rim the wire being raised to a white heat by an electric current the air expanded and some of it was forced through the cottonwool when the current was interrupted and the air within the shade cooled the returning air did not carry motes along with it being filtered by the wool at the beginning of this experiments the shade was charged with floating matter at the end of half an hour it was optically empty on the wooden base of a cubical glass shade a cubic foot in volume upright supports were fixed and from one support to the other 38 inches of platinum wire were stretched in four parallel lines the ends of the platinum wire were soldered to two stout copper wires which passed through the base of the shade and could be connected with a battery as in the last experiments the shade rested upon cottonwool a beam sent through the shade revealed the suspended matter the platinum wire was then raised to whiteness in five minutes there was a sensible diminution of the matter and in ten minutes it was totally consumed oxygen hydrogen nitrogen carbonic acid so prepared as to exclude all floating particles produce when poured or blown into the beam the darkness of stellar space coalgas does the same an ordinary glass shade placed in the air with its mouth downwards permits the track of the beam to be seen crossing it when coalgas or hydrogen is allowed to enter the shade by a tube reaching to its top the gas gradually fills the shade from above downwards as soon as it occupies the space crossed by the beam the luminous track is abolished lifting the shade so as to bring the common boundary of gas and air above the beam the track flashes forth after the shade is full if it be inverted the pure gas passes upwards like a black smoke among the illuminated particles the germ theory of contagious disease there is no respite to our contact with the floating matter of the air and the wonder is not that we should suffer occasionally from its presence but that so small a portion of it and even that but rarely diffused over large areas should appear to be deadly to man and what is this portion it was some time ago the current belief that epidemic diseases generally were propagated by a kind of malaria which consisted of organic matter in a state of motordecay that when such matter was taken into the body through the lungs skin or stomach it had the power of spreading there the destroying process by which itself had been assailed such a power was visibly exerted in the case of yeast a little leaven was seen to leaven the whole lumpa mere speck of matter in this supposed state of decomposition being apparently competent to propagate indefinitely its own decay why should not a bit of rotten malaria act in a similar manner within the human frame in 1836 a very wonderful reply was given to this question in that year cagniard de la tour discovered the yeastplanta living organism which when placed in a proper medium feeds grows and reproduces itself and in this way carries on the process which we name fermentation by this striking discovery fermentation was connected with organic growth schwann of berlin discovered the yeastplant independently about the same time and in february 1837 he also announced the important result that when a decoction of meat is effectually screened from ordinary air and supplied solely with calcined air putrefaction never sets in putrefaction therefore he affirmed to be caused not by the air but by something which could be destroyed by a sufficiently high temperature the results of schwann were confirmed by the independent experiments of helmholtz ure and pasteur while other methods pursued by schultze and by schroeder and dusch led to the same result but as regards fermentation the minds of chemists influenced probably by the great authority of gaylussac fell back upon the old notion of matter in a state of decay it was not the living yeastplant but the dead or dying parts of it which assailed by oxygen produced the fermentation pasteur however proved the real ferments mediate or immediate to be organised beings which find in the reputed ferments their necessary food side by side with these researches and discoveries and fortified by them and others has run the germ theory of epidemic disease the notion was expressed by kircher and favoured by linnaeus that epidemic diseases may be due to germs which float in the atmosphere enter the body and produce disturbance by the development within the body of parasitic life the strength of this theory consists in the perfect parallelism of the phenomena of contagious disease with those of life as a planted acorn gives birth to an oak competent to produce a whole crop of acorns each gifted with the power of reproducing its parent tree and as thus from a single seedling a whole forest may spring so it is contended these epidemic diseases literally plant their seeds grow and shake abroad new germs which meeting in the human body their proper food and temperature finally take possession of whole populations there is nothing to my knowledge in pure chemistry which resembles the power of propagation and selfmultiplication possessed by the matter which produces epidemic disease if you sow wheat you do not get barley if you sow smallpox you do not get scarletfever but smallpox indefinitely multiplied and nothing else the matter of each contagious disease reproduces itself as rigidly as if it were as miss nightingale puts it dog or cat parasitic diseases of silkworms pasteurs researches it is admitted on all hands that some diseases are the product of parasitic growth both in man and in lower creatures the existence of such diseases has been demonstrated i am enabled to lay before you an account of an epidemic of this kind thoroughly investigated and successfully combated by m pasteur for fifteen years a plague had raged among the silkworms of france they had sickened and died in multitudes while those that succeeded in spinning their cocoons furnished only a fraction of the normal quantity of silk in 1853 the silk culture of france produced a revenue of one hundred and thirty millions of francs during the twenty previous years the revenue had doubled itself and no doubt was entertained as to its further augmentation the weight of the cocoons produced in 1853 was 26000000 kilogrammes in 1865 it had fallen to 4000000 the fall entailing in a single year a loss of 100000000 francs the country chiefly smitten by this calamity happened to be that of the celebrated chemist dumas now perpetual secretary of the french academy of sciences he turned to his friend colleague and pupil pasteur and besought him with an earnestness which the circumstances rendered almost personal to undertake the investigation of the malady pasteur at this time had never seen a silkworm and he urged his inexperience in reply to his friend but dumas knew too well the qualities needed for such an enquiry to accept pasteurs reason for declining it je mets said he un prix extrme voir votre attention fixe sur la question qui intresse mon pauvre pays la misre surpasse tout ce que vous pouvez imaginer pamphlets about the plague had been showered upon the public the monotony of waste paper being broken at rare intervals by a more or less useful publication the pharmacopoeia of the silkworm wrote m cornalia in 1860 is now as complicated as that of man gases liquids and solids have been laid under contribution from chlorine to sulphurous acid from nitric acid to rum from sugar to sulphate of quinineall has been invoked in behalf of this unhappy insect the helpless cultivators moreover welcomed with ready trustfulness every new remedy if only pressed upon them with sufficient hardihood it seemed impossible to diminish their blind confidence in their blind guides in 1863 the french minister of agriculture signed an agreement to pay 500000 francs for the use of a remedy which its promoter declared to be infallible it was tried in twelve different departments of france and found perfectly useless in no single instance was it successful it was under these circumstances that m pasteur yielding to the entreaties of his friend betook himself to alais in the beginning of june 1865 as regards silk husbandry this was the most important department in france and it was the most sorely smitten by the plague the silkworm had been previously attacked by muscardine a disease proved by bassi to be caused by a vegetable parasite this malady was propagated annually by the parasitic spores wafted by winds they often sowed the disease in places far removed from the centre of infection muscardine is now said to be very rare a deadlier malady having taken its place this new disease is characterised by the black spots which cover the silkworms hence the name pbrine first applied to the plague by m de quatrefages and adopted by pasteur pbrine declares itself in the stunted and unequal growth of the worms in the languor of their movements in their fastidiousness as regards food and in their premature death the course of discovery as regards the epidemic is this in 1849 gurin mneville noticed in the blood of silkworms vibratory corpuscles which he supposed from their motions to be endowed with independent life filippi however showed that the motion of the corpuscles was the wellknown brownian motion but he committed the error of supposing the corpuscles to be normal to the life of the insect possessing the power of indefinite selfmultiplication they are really the cause of its mortalitythe form and substance of its disease this was well described by cornalia while lebert and frey subsequently found the corpuscles not only in the blood but in all the tissues of the insect osimo in 1857 discovered them in the eggs and on this observation vittadiani founded in 1859 a practical method of distinguishing healthy from diseased eggs the test often proved fallacious and it was never extensively applied these living corpuscles take possession of the intestinal canal and spread thence throughout the body of the worm they fill the silk cavities the stricken insect often going automatically through the motions of spinning without any material to work upon its organs instead of being filled with the clear viscous liquid of the silk are packed to distension by the corpuscles on this feature of the plague pasteur fixed his entire attention the cycle of the silkworms life is briefly this from the fertile egg comes the little worm which grows and casts its skin this process of moulting is repeated two or three times at intervals during the life of the insect after the last moulting the worm climbs the brambles placed to receive it and spins among them its cocoon it passes thus into a chrysalis the chrysalis becomes a moth and the moth when liberated lays the eggs which form the startingpoint of a new cycle now pasteur proved that the plaguecorpuscles might be incipient in the egg and escape detection they might also be germinal in the worm and still baffle the microscope but as the worm grows the corpuscles grow also becoming larger and more defined in the aged chrysalis they are more pronounced than in the worm while in the moth if either the egg or the worm from which it comes should have been at all stricken the corpuscles infallibly appear offering no difficulty of detection this was the first great point made out in 1865 by pasteur the italian naturalists as aforesaid recommended the examination of the eggs before risking their incubation pasteur showed that both eggs and worms might be smitten and still pass muster the culture of such eggs or such worms being sure to entail disaster he made the moth his startingpoint in seeking to regenerate the race pasteur made his first communication on this subject to the academy of sciences in september 1865 it raised a cloud of criticism here forsooth was a chemist rashly quitting his proper mtier and presuming to lay down the law for the physician and biologist on a subject which was eminently theirs on trouva trange que je fusse si peu au courant de la question on mopposa des travaux qui avaient paru depuis longtemps en italie dont les rsultats montraient linutilit de mes efforts et limpossibilit darriver un rsultat pratique dans la direction que je mtais engag que mon ignorance fut grande au sujet des recherches sans nombre qui avaient paru depuis quinze annes pasteur heard the buzz but he continued his work in choosing the eggs intended for incubation the cultivators selected those produced in the successful educations of the year but they could not understand the frequent and often disastrous failures of their selected eggs for they did not know and nobody prior to pasteur was competent to tell them that the finest cocoons may envelope doomed corpusculous moths it was not however easy to make the cultivators accept new guidance to strike their imagination and if possible determine their practice pasteur hit upon the expedient of prophecy in 1866 he inspected at st hippolytedufort fourteen different parcels of eggs intended for incubation having examined a sufficient number of the moths which produced these eggs he wrote out the prediction of what would occur in 1867 and placed the prophecy as a sealed letter in the hands of the mayor of st hippolyte in 1867 the cultivators communicated to the mayor their results the letter of pasteur was then opened and read and it was found that in twelve out of fourteen cases there was absolute conformity between his prediction and the observed facts many of the groups had perished totally the others had perished almost totally and this was the prediction of pasteur in two out of the fourteen cases instead of the prophesied destruction half an average crop was obtained now the parcels of eggs here referred to were considered healthy by their owners they had been hatched and tended in the firm hope that the labour expended on them would prove remunerative the application of the mothtest for a few minutes in 1866 would have saved the labour and averted the disappointment two additional parcels of eggs were at the same time submitted to pasteur he pronounced them healthy and his words were verified by the production of an excellent crop other cases of prophecy still more remarkable because more circumstantial are recorded in pasteurs work pasteur subjected the development of the corpuscles to a searching investigation and followed out with admirable skill and completeness the various modes by which the plague was propagated from moths perfectly free from corpuscles he obtained healthy worms and selecting 10 20 30 50 as the case might be he introduced into the worms the corpusculous matter it was first permitted to accompany the food let its take a single example out of many rubbing up a small corpusculous worm in water he smeared the mixture over the mulberryleaves assuring himself that the leaves had been eaten he watched the consequences from day to day side by side with the infected worms he reared their fellows keeping them as much as possible out of the way of infection these constituted his lot tmoinhis standard of comparison on april 16 1868 he thus infected thirty worms up to the 23rd they remained quite well on the 25th they seemed well but on that day corpuscles were found in the intestines of two of them on the 27th or eleven days after the infected repast two fresh worms were examined and not only was the intestinal canal found in each case invaded but the silk organ itself was charged with corpuscles on the 28th the twentysix remaining worms were covered by the black spots of pbrine on the 30th the difference of size between the infected and noninfected worms was very striking the sick worms being not more than twothirds of the bulk of the healthy ones on may 2 a worm which had just finished its fourth moulting was examined its whole body was so filled with the parasite as to excite astonishment that it could live the disease advanced the worms died and were examined and on may 11 only six out of the thirty remained they were the strongest of the lot but on being searched they also were found charged with corpuscles not one of the thirty worms had escaped a single meal had poisoned them all the standard lot on the contrary spun their fine cocoons two only of their moths being proved to contain any trace of the parasite which had doubtless been introduced during the rearing of the worms as his acquaintance with the subject increased pasteurs desire for precision augmented and he finally counted the growing number of corpuscles seen in the field of his microscope from day to day after a contagious repast the number of worms containing the parasite gradually augmented until finally it became cent per cent the number of corpuscles would at the same time rise from 0 to 1 to 10 to 100 and sometimes even to 1000 or 1500 in the field of his microscope he then varied the mode of infection he inoculated healthy worms with the corpusculous matter and watched the consequent growth of the disease he proved that the worms inoculate each other by the infliction of visible wounds with their claws in various cases he washed the claws and found corpuscles in the water he demonstrated the spread of infection by the simple association of healthy and diseased worms by their claws and their dejections the diseased worms spread infection it was no hypothetical infected mediumno problematical pythogenic gasthat killed the worms but a definite organism the question of infection at a distance was also examined and its existence demonstrated as might be expected from pasteurs antecedents the investigation was exhaustive the skill and beauty of his manipulation finding fitting correlatives in the strength and clearness of his thought the following quotation from pasteurs work clearly shows the relation in which his researches stand to the important question on which he was engaged place he says the most skilful educator even the most expert microscopist in presence of large educations which present the symptoms described in our experiments his judgment will necessarily be erroneous if he confines himself to the knowledge which preceded my researches the worms will not present to him the slightest spot of pbrine the microscope will not reveal the existence of corpuscles the mortality of the worms will be null or insignificant and the cocoons leave nothing to be desired our observer would therefore conclude without hesitation that the eggs produced will be good for incubation the truth is on the contrary that all the worms of these fine crops have been poisoned that from the beginning they carried in them the germ of the malady ready to multiply itself beyond measure in the chrysalides and the moths thence to pass into the eggs and smite with sterility the next generation and what is the first cause of the evil concealed under so deceitful an exterior in our experiments we can so to speak touch it with our fingers it is entirely the effect of a single corpusculous repast an effect more or less prompt according to the epoch of life of the worm that has eaten the poisoned food pasteur describes in detail his method of securing healthy eggs it is nothing less than a mode of restoring to france her ancient silk husbandry the justification of his work is to be found in the reports which reached him of the application and the unparalleled success of his method while editing his researches for final publication in both france and italy his method has been pursued with the most surprising results but it was an uphill fight which led to this triumph ever he says since the commencement of these researches i have been exposed to the most obstinate and unjust contradictions but i have made it a duty to leave no trace of these conflicts in this book and in reference to parasitic diseases generally he uses the following weighty words il est au pouvoir de lhomme de faire disparaitre de la surface du globe les maladies parasitaires si comme cest ma conviction la doctrine des gnrations spontanes est une chimre pasteur dwells upon the ease with which an island like corsica might be absolutely isolated from the silkworm epidemic and with regard to other epidemics mr simon describes an extraordinary case of insular exemption for the ten years extending from 1851 to 1860 of the 627 registration districts of england one only had an entire escape from diseases which in whole or in part were prevalent in all the others in all the ten years it had not a single death by measles nor a single death by smallpox nor a single death by scarletfever and why not because of its general sanitary merits for it had an average amounts of other evidence of unhealthiness doubtless the reason of its escape was that it was insular it was the district of the scilly isles to which it was most improbable that any febrile contagion should come from without and its escape is an approximative proof that at least for those ten years no contagium of measles nor any contagium of scarletfever nor any contagium of smallpox had arisen spontaneously within its limits it may be added that there were only seven districts in england in which no death from diphtheria occurred and that of those seven districts the district of the scilly isles was one a second parasitic disease of silkworms called in france la flacherie coexistent with pbrine but quite distinct from it has also been investigated by pasteur enough however has been said to send the reader interested in these questions to the original volumes for further information to one important practical point m pasteur in a letter to myself directs attention permettezmoi de terminer ces quelques lignes que je dois dicter vaincu que je suis par la maladie

outre de donner aux rcoltes de la soie une prosprit quelles nont jamais eue origin and propagation of contagious matter prior to pasteur the most diverse and contradictory opinions were entertained as to the contagious character of pbrine some stoutly affirmed it others as stoutly denied it but on one point all were agreed i they believed in the existence of a deleterious medium rendered epidemic by some occult and mysterious influence to which was attributed the cause of the disease those acquainted with our medical literature will not fail to observe an instructive analogy here we have on the one side accomplished writers ascribing epidemic diseases to deleterious media which arise spontaneously in crowded hospitals and illsmelling drains according to them the contagia of epidemic disease are formed de novo in a putrescent atmosphere on the other side we have writers clear vigorous with welldefined ideas and methods of research contending that the matter which produces epidemic disease comes always from a parent stock it behaves as germinal matter and they do not hesitate to regard it as such they no more believe in the spontaneous generation of such diseases than they do in the spontaneous generation of mice pasteur for example found that pbrine had been known for an indefinite time as a disease among silkworms the development of it which he combated was merely the expansion of an already existing powerthe bursting into open conflagration of a previously smouldering fire there is nothing surprising in this for though epidemic disease requires a special contagium to produce it surrounding conditions must have a potent influence on its development common seeds may be duly sown but the conditions of temperature and moisture may be such as to restrict or altogether prevent the subsequent growth looked at therefore from the point of view of the germ theory the exceptional energy which epidemic disease from time to time exhibits is in harmony with the method of nature we sometimes hear diphtheria spoken of as if it were a new disease of the last twenty years but mr simon tells me that about three centuries ago tremendous epidemics of it began to rage in spain where it was named garrotillo and soon afterwards in italy and that since that time the disease has been well known to all successive generations of doctors in or about 1758 for instance dr starr of liskeard in a communication to the royal society particularly described the disease with all the characters which have recently again become familiar but under the name of morbus strangulatorius as then severely epidemic in cornwall this fact is the more interesting as diphtheria in its more modern reappearance again showed predilection for that remote county many also believe that the black death of five centuries ago has disappeared as mysteriously as it came but mr simon finds that it is believed to be prevalent at this hour in some of the northwestern parts of india let me here state an item of my own experience when i was at the bel alp in 1869 the english chaplain received letters informing him of the breaking out of scarletfever among his children he lived if i remember rightly on the healthful eminence of dartmoor and it was difficult to imagine how scarletfever could have been wafted to the place a drain ran close to his house and on it his suspicions were manifestly fixed some of our medical writers would fortify him in this notion and thus deflect him from the truth while those of another and in my opinion a wiser school would deny to a drain however foul the power of generating de novo a specific disease after close enquiry he recollected that a hobbyhorse had been used both by his boy and another who a short time previously had passed through scarletfever drains and cesspools indeed are by no means in such evil odour as they used to be a fetid thames and a low deathrate occur from time to time together in london for if the special matter or germs of epidemic disorder be not present a corrupt atmosphere however obnoxious otherwise will not produce the disorder but if the germs be present defective drains and cesspools become the potent distributors of disease and death corrupted air may promote an epidemic but cannot produce it on the other hand through the transport of the special germ or virus disease may develop itself in regions where the drainage is good and the atmosphere pure if you see a new thistle growing in your field you feel sure that its seed has been wafted thither just as sure does it seem that the contagious matter of epidemic disease has been transplanted to the place where it newly appears with a clearness and conclusiveness s not to be surpassed dr william budd has traced such diseases from place to place showing how they plant themselves at distinct foci among populations subjected to the same atmospheric influences just as grains of corn might be carried in the pocket and sown hildebrand to whose remarkable work du typhus contagieux dr de mussy has directed my attention gives the following striking case both of the durability and the transport of the virus of scarlatina un habit noir que javais en visitant une malade attaque de scarlatina et que je portai de vienne en podolie sans lavoir mis depuis plus dun an et demi me communiqua ds que je fus arriv cette maladie contagieuse que je rpandis ensuite dans cette province o elle tait jusqualors presque inconnue some years ago dr de mussy himself was summoned to a country house in surrey to see a young lady who was suffering from a dropsy evidently the consequence of scarlatina the original disease being of a very mild character had been quite overlooked but circumstances were recorded which could leave no doubt upon the mind as to the nature and cause of the complaint but then the question arose how did the young lady catch the scarlatina she had come there on a visit two months previously and it was only after she had been a month in the house that she was taken ill the housekeeper at length cleared up the mystery the young lady on her arrival had expressed a wish to occupy a room in an isolated tower her desire was granted and in that room six months previously a visitor had been confined with an attack of scarlatina the room had been swept and whitewashed but the carpets had been permitted to remain thousands of cases could probably be cited in which the disease has shown itself in this mysterious way but where a strict examination has revealed its true parentage and extraction is it then philosophical to take refuge in the fortuitous concourse of atoms as a cause of specific disease merely because in special cases the parentage may be indistinct those best acquainted with atomic nature and who are most ready to admit as regards even higher things than this the potentialities of matter will be the last to accept these rash hypotheses the germ theory applied to surgery not only medical but still more especially surgical science is now seeking light and guidance from this germ theory upon it the antiseptic system of professor lister of edinburgh is founded as already stated the germ theory of putrefaction was started by schwann but the illustrations of this theory adduced by professor lister are of such public moment as not only to justify but to render imperative their introduction here schwanns observations says professor lister did not receive the attention which they appeared to me to have deserved the fermentation of sugar was generally allowed to be occasioned by the torula cerevisiae but it was not admitted that putrefaction was due to an analogous agency and yet the two cases present a very striking parallel in each a stable chemical compound sugar in the one case albumen in the other undergoes extraordinary chemical changes under the influence of an excessively minute quantity of a substance which regarded chemically we should suppose inert as an example of this in the case of putrefaction let us take a circumstance often witnessed in the treatment of large chronic abscesses in order to guard against the access of atmospheric air we used to draw off the matter by means of a canula and trocar such as you see here consisting of a silver tube with a sharppointed steel rod fitted into it and projecting beyond it the instrument dipped in oil was thrust into the cavity of the abscess the trocar was withdrawn and the pus flowed out through the canula care being taken by gentle pressure over the part to prevent the possibility of regurgitation the canula was then drawn out with due precaution against the reflux of air this method was frequently successful as to its immediate object the patient being relieved from the mass of the accumulated fluid and experiencing no inconvenience from the operation but the pus was pretty certain to reaccumulate in course of time and it became necessary again and again to repeat the process and unhappily there was no absolute security of immunity from bad consequences however carefully the procedure was conducted it sometimes happened even though the puncture seemed healing by first intention that feverish symptoms declared themselves in the course of the first or second day and on inspecting the seat of the abscess the skin was perhaps seen to be red implying the presence of some cause of irritation while a rapid reaccumulation of the fluid was found to have occurred under these circumstances it became necessary to open the abscess by free incision when a quantity large in proportion to the size of the abscess say for example a quart of pus escaped fetid from putrefaction now how had this change been brought about without the germ theory i venture to say no rational explanation of it could have been given it must have been caused by the introduction of something from without inflammation of the punctured wound even supposing it to have occurred would not explain the phenomenon for mere inflammation whether acute or chronic though it occasions the formation of pus does not induce putrefaction the pus originally evacuated was perfectly sweet and we know of nothing to account for the alteration in its quality but the influence of something derived from the external world and what could that something be the dipping of the instrument in oil and the subsequent precautions prevented the entrance of oxygen or even if you allowed that a few atoms of the gas did enter it would be an extraordinary assumption to make that these could in so short a time effect such changes in so large a mass of albuminous material besides the pyogenic membrane is abundantly supplied with capillary vessels through which arterial blood rich in oxygen is perpetually flowing and there can be little doubt that the pus before it was evacuated at all was liable to any action which the element might be disposed to exert upon it on the oxygen theory then the occurrence of putrefaction under these circumstances is quite inexplicable but if you admit the germ theory the difficulty vanishes at once the canula and trocar having been lying exposed to the air dust will have been deposited upon them and will be present in the angle between the trocar and the silver tube and in that protected situation will fail to be wiped off when the instrument is thrust through the tissues then when the trocar is withdrawn some portions of this dust will naturally remain upon the margin of the canula which is left projecting into the abscess and nothing is more likely than that some particles may fail to be washed off by the stream of outflowing pus but may be dislodged when the tube is taken out and left behind in the cavity the germ theory tells us that these particles of dust will be pretty sure to contain the germs of putrefactive organisms and if one such is left in the albuminous liquid it will rapidly develop at the high temperature of the body and account for all the phenomena but striking as is the parallel between putrefaction in this instance and the vinous fermentation as regards the greatness of the effect produced compared with the minuteness and the inertness chemically speaking of the cause you will naturally desire further evidence of the similarity of the two processes you can see with the microscope the torula of fermenting must or beer is there you may ask any organism to be detected in the putrefying pus yes gentlemen there is if any drop of the putrid matter is examined with a good glass it is found to be teeming with myriads of minute jointed bodies called vibrios which indubitably proclaim their vitality by the energy of their movements it is not an affair of probability but a fact that the entire mass of that quart of pus has become peopled with living organisms as the result of the introduction of the canula and trocar for the matter first let out was as free from vibrios as it was from putrefaction if this be so the greatness of the chemical changes that have taken place in the pus ceases to be surprising we know that it is one of the chief peculiarities of living structures that they possess extraordinary powers of effecting chemical changes in materials in their vicinity out of all proportion to their energy as mere chemical compounds and we can hardly doubt that the animalcules which have been developed in the albuminous liquid and have grown at its expense must have altered its constitution just as we ourselves alter that of the materials on which we feed footnote introductory lecture before the university of edinburgh in the operations of professor lister care is taken that every portion of tissue laid bare by the knife shall be defended from germs that if they fall upon the wound they should be killed as they fall with this in view he showers upon his exposed surfaces the spray of dilute carbolic acid which is particularly deadly to the germs and he surrounds the wound in the most careful manner with antiseptic bandages to those accustomed to strict experiment it is manifest that we have a strict experimenter herea man with a perfectly distinct object in view which he pursues with nevertiring patience and unwavering faith and the result in his hospital practice as described by himself has been that even in the midst of abominations too shocking to be mentioned here and in the neighbourhood of wards where death was rampant from pyaemia erysipelas and hospital gangrene he was able to keep his patients absolutely free from these terrible scourges let me here recommend to your attention professor listers introductory lecture before the university of edinburgh which i have already quoted his paper on the effect of the antiseptic system of treatment on the salubrity of a surgical hospital and the article in the british medical journal of january 14 1871 if instead of using carbolic acid spray he could surround his wounds with properly filtered air the result would he contends be the same in a room where the germs not only float but cling to clothes and walls this would be difficult if not impossible but surgery is acquainted with a class of wounds in which the blood is freely mixed with air that has passed through the lungs and it is a most remarkable fact that such air does not produce putrefaction professor lister as far as i know was the first to give a philosophical interpretation of this fact which he describes and comments upon thus i have explained to my own mind the remarkable fact that in simple fracture of the ribs if the lung be punctured by a fragment the blood effused into the pleural cavity though freely mixed with air undergoes no decomposition the air is sometimes pumped into the pleural cavity in such abundance that making its way through the wound in the pleura costalis it inflates the cellular tissue of the whole body yet this occasions no alarm to the surgeon although if the blood in the pleura were to putrefy it would infallibly occasion dangerous suppurative pleurisy why air introduced into the pleural cavity through a wounded lung should have such wholly different effects from that entering directly through a wound in the chest was to me a complete mystery until i heard of the germ theory of putrefaction when it at once occurred to me that it was only natural that air should be filtered of germs by the airpassages one of whose offices is to arrest inhaled particles of dust and prevent them from entering the aircells i shall have occasion to refer to this remarkable hypothesis farther on the advocates of the germ theory both of putrefaction and epidemic disease hold that both arise not from the air but from something contained in the air they hold moreover that this something is not a vapour nor a gas nor indeed a molecule of any kind but a particle footnote as regards size there is probably no sharp line of division between molecules and particles the one gradually shades into the other but the distinction that i would draw is this the atom or the molecule if free is always part of a gas the particle is never so a particle is a bit of liquid or solid matter formed by the aggregation of atoms or molecules the term particulate has been used in the reports of the medical department of the privy council to describe this supposed constitution of contagious matter and dr sandersons experiments render it in the highest degree probable if they do not actually demonstrate that the virus of smallpox is particulate definite knowledge upon this point is of exceeding importance because in the treatment of particles methods are available which it would be futile to apply to molecules the luminous beam as a means of research my own interference with this great question while sanctioned by eminent names has been also an object of varied and ingenious attack on this point i will only say that when angry feeling escapes from behind the intellect where it may be useful as an urging force and places itself athwart the intellect it is liable to produce all manner of delusions thus my censors for the most part have levelled their remarks against positions which were never assumed and against claims which were never made the simple history of the matter is this during the autumn of 1868 i was much occupied with the observations referred to at the beginning of this discourse and in part described in the preceding article for fifteen years it had been my habit to make use of floating dust to reveal the paths of luminous beams through the air but until 1868 i did not intentionally reverse the process and employ a luminous beam to reveal and examine the dust in a paper presented to the royal society in december 1869 the observations which induced me to give more special attention to the question of spontaneous generation and the germ theory of epidemic disease are thus described the floating matter of the air prior to the discovery of the foregoing action the chemical action of light upon vapours fragment iv and also during the experiments just referred to the nature of my work compelled me to aim at obtaining experimental tubes absolutely clean upon the surface and absolutely free within from suspended matter neither condition is however easily attained for however well the tubes might be washed and polished and however bright and pure they might appear in ordinary daylight the electric beam infallibly revealed signs and tokens of dirt the air was always present and it was sure to deposit some impurity all chemical processes not conducted in a vacuum are open to this disturbance when the experimental tube was exhausted it exhibited no trace of floating matter but on admitting the air through the utubes containing caustic potash and sulphuric acid a dustcone more or less distinct was always revealed by the powerfully condensed electric beam the floating motes resembled minute particles of liquid which had been carried mechanically from the utubes into the experimental tube precautions were therefore taken to prevent any such transfer they produced little or no mitigation i did not imagine at the time that the dust of the external air could find such free passage through the caustic potash and sulphuric acid this however was the case the motes really came from without they also passed with freedom through a variety of aethers and alcohols in fact it requires longcontinued action on the part of an acid first to wet the motes and afterwards to destroy them by carefully passing the air through the flame of a spirit lamp or through a platinum tube heated to bright redness the floating matter was sensibly destroyed it was therefore combustible in other words organic matter i tried to intercept it by a large respirator of cottonwool close pressure was necessary to render the wool effective a plug of the wool rammed pretty tightly into the tube through which the air passed was finally found competent to hold back the motes they appeared from time to time afterwards and gave me much trouble but they were invariably traced in the end to some defect in the purifying apparatusto some crack or flaw in the sealingwax employed to render the tubes airtight thus through proper care but not without a great deal of searching out of disturbances the experimental tube even when filled with air or vapour contains nothing competent to scatter the light the space within it has the aspect of an absolute vacuum an experimental tube in this condition i call optically empty the simple apparatus employed in these experiments will be at once understood by reference to a figure printed in the last article fig 3 s s is the glass experimental tube which has varied in length from 1 to 5 feet and which may be from 2 to 3 inches in diameter from the end s the pipe pp passes to an airpump connected with the other end s we have the flask f containing the liquid whose vapour is to be examined then follows a utube t filled with fragments of clean glass wetted with sulphuric acid then a second utube t containing fragments of marble wetted with caustic potash and finally a narrow straight tube t t containing a tolerably tightly fitting plug of cottonwool to save the airpump gauge from the attack of such vapours as act on mercury as also to facilitate observation a separate barometer tube was employed through the cork which stops the flask f two glass tubes a and b pass airtight the tube a ends immediately under the cork the tube b on the contrary descends to the bottom of the flask and dips into the liquid the end of the tube b is drawn out so as to render very small the orifice through which the air escapes into the liquid the experimental tube s s being exhausted a cock at the end s is turned carefully on the air passes slowly through the cottonwool the caustic potash and the sulphuric acid in succession thus purified it enters the flask f and bubbles through the liquid charged with vapour it finally passes into the experimental tube where it is submitted to examination the electric lamp l placed at the end of the experimental tube furnishes the necessary beam the facts here forced upon my attention had a bearing too evident to be overlooked the inability of air which had been filtered through cottonwool to generate animalcular life had been demonstrated by schroeder and pasteur here the cause of its impotence was rendered evident to the eye the experiment proved that no sensible amount of light was scattered by the molecules of the air that the scattered light always arose from suspended particles and the fact that the removal of these abolished simultaneously the power of scattering light and of originating life obviously detached the lifeoriginating power from the air and fixed it on something suspended in the air gases of all kinds passed with freedom through the plug of cottonwool hence the thing whose removal by the cottonwool rendered the gas impotent could not itself have been matter in the gaseous condition it at once occurred to me that the retina protected as it was in these experiments from all extraneous light might be converted into a new and powerful instrument of demonstration in relation to the germ theory but the observations also revealed the danger incurred in experiments of this nature showing that without an amount of care far beyond that hitherto bestowed upon them such experiments left the door open to errors of the gravest description it was especially manifest that the chemical method employed by schultze in his experiments and so often resorted to since might lead to the most erroneous consequences that neither acids nor alkalies had the power of rapid destruction hitherto ascribed to them in short the employment of the luminous beam rendered evident the cause of success in experiments rigidly conducted like those of pasteur while it made equally evident the certainty of failure in experiments less severely carried out dr bennetts experiments but i do not wish to leave an assertion of this kind without illustration take then the wellconceived experiments of dr hughes bennett described before the royal society of surgeons in edinburgh on january 17 1868 footnote british medical journal 13 pt ii 1868 into flasks containing decoctions of liquoriceroot hay or tea dr bennett by an ingenious method forced air the air was driven through two utubes the one containing a solution of caustic potash the other sulphuric acid all the bent tubes were filled with fragments of pumicestone to break up the air so as to prevent the possibility of any germs passing through in the centre of bubbles the air also passed through a liebigs bulb containing sulphuric acid and also through a bulb containing guncotton it was only natural for dr bennett to believe that his bent tubes entirely cut off the germs previous to the observations just referred to i also believed in their efficacy but these observations destroy any such notion the guncotton moreover will fail to arrest the whole of the floating matter unless it is tightly packed and there is no indication in dr bennetts memoir that it was so packed on the whole i should infer from the mere inspection of dr bennetts apparatus the very results which he has describeda retardation of the development of life a total absence of it in some cases and its presence in others in his first series of experiments eight flasks were fed with sifted air and five with common air in ten or twelve days all the five had fungi in them whilst it required from four to nine months to develop fungi in the others in one of the eight moreover even after this interval no fungi appeared in a second series of experiments there was a similar exception in a third series the cork stoppers used in the first and second series were abandoned and glass stoppers employed flasks containing decoctions of tea beef and hay were filled with common air and other flasks with sifted air in every one of the former fungi appeared and in not one of the latter these experiments simply ruin the doctrine that dr bennett finally espouses in all these negative cases the prepared air was forced into the infusion when it was boiling hot dr bennett made a fourth series of experiments in which previous to forcing in the air he permitted the flasks to cool into four bottles thus treated he forced prepared air and after a time found fungi in all of them what is his conclusion not that the boiling hot liquid employed in his first experiments had destroyed such germs as had run the gauntlet of his apparatus but that air which previous to being sealed up had been exposed to a temperature of 212 is too rare to support life this conclusion is so remarkable that it ought to be stated in dr bennetts own words it may be easily conceived that air subjected to a boiling temperature is so expanded as scarcely to merit the name of air and that it is more or less unfit for the purpose of sustaining animal or vegetable life now numerical data are attainable here and as a matter of fact i live and flourish for a considerable portion of each year in a medium of less density than that which dr bennett describes as scarcely meriting the name of air the inhabitants of the higher alpine chalets with their flocks and herds and the grasses which support these do the same while the chamois rears its kids in air rarer still insect life moreover is sometimes exhibited with monstrous prodigality at alpine heights in a fifth series of experiments sixteen bottles were filled with infusions into four of them while cold ordinary unheated and unsifted air was pumped in these four bottles fungi were developed into four other bottles containing a boiling infusion ordinary air was also pumpedno fungi were here developed into four other bottles containing an infusion which had been boiled and permitted to cool sifted air was pumpedno fungi were developed finally into four bottles containing a boiling infusion sifted air was pumped no fungi were developed only therefore in the four cases where the infusions were cold infusions and the air ordinary air did fungi appear dr bennett does not draw from his experiments the conclusion to which they so obviously point on them on the contrary he founds a defence of the doctrine of spontaneous generation and a general theory of spontaneous development so strongly was he impressed with the idea that the germs could not possibly pass through his potash and sulphuric acid tubes that the appearance of fungi even in a small minority of cases where the air had been sent through these tubes was to him conclusive evidence of the spontaneous origin of such fungi and he accounts for the absence of life in many of his experiments by an hypothesis which will not bear a moments examination but knowing that organic particles may pass unscathed through alkalies and acids the results of dr bennett are precisely what ought wider the circumstances to be expected indeed their harmony with the conditions now revealed is a proof of the honesty and accuracy with which they were executed the caution exercised by pasteur both in the execution of his experiments and in the reasoning based upon them is perfectly evident to those who through the practice of severe experimental enquiry have rendered themselves competent to judge of good experimental work he found germs in the mercury used to isolate his air he was never sure that they did not cling to the instruments he employed or to his own person thus when he opened his hermetically sealed flasks upon the mer de glace he had his eye upon the file used to detach the drawnout necks of his bottles and he was careful to stand to leeward when each flask was opened using these precautions he found the glacier air incompetent in nineteen cases out of twenty to generate life while similar flasks opened amid the vegetation of the lowlands were soon crowded with living things m pouchet repeated pasteurs experiments in the pyrenees adopting the precaution of holding his flasks above his head and obtaining a different result now great care would be needed to render this procedure a real precaution the luminous beam at once shows us its possible effect let smoking brown paper be placed at the open mouth of a glass shade so that the smoke shall ascend and fill the shade a beam sent through the shade forms a bright track through the smoke when the closed fist is placed underneath the shade a vertical wind of surprising violence considering the small elevation of temperature rises from the band displacing by comparatively dark air the illuminated smoke unless special care were taken such a wind would rise from m pouchets body as he held his flasks above his head and thus the precaution of pasteur of not coming between the wind and the flask would be annulled let me now direct attention to another result of pasteur the cause and significance of which are at once revealed by the luminous beam he prepared twenty one flasks each containing a decoction of yeast filtered and clear he boiled the decoction so as to destroy whatever germs it might contain and while the space above the liquid was filled with pure steam he sealed his flasks with a blowpipe he opened ten of them in the deep damp caves of the paris observatory and eleven of them in the courtyard of the establishment of the former one only showed signs of life subsequently in nine out of the ten flasks no organisms of any kind were developed in all the others organisms speedily appeared now here is an experiment conducted in paris on which we can throw obvious light in london causing our luminous beam to pass through a large flask filled with the air of this room and charged with its germs and its dust the beam is seen crossing the flask from side to side but here is another similar flask which cuts a clear gap out of the beam it is filled with unfiltered air and still no trace of the beam is visible why by pure accident i stumbled on this flask in our apparatus room where it had remained quiet for some time acting upon this obvious suggestion i set aside three other flasks filled in the first instance with moteladen air they are now optically empty our former experiments proved that the lifeproducing particles attach themselves to the fibres of cottonwool in the present experiment the motes have been brought by gentle aircurrents established by slight differences of temperature within our closed vessels into contact with the interior surface to which they adhere the air of these flasks has deposited its dust germs and all and is practically free from suspended matter i had a chamber erected the lower half of which is of wood its upper half being enclosed by four glazed windowframes it tapers to a truncated cone at the top it measures in plan 3 ft by 2 ft 6 in and its height is 5 ft 10 in on february 6 it was closed every crevice that could admit dust or cause displacement of the air being carefully pasted over with paper the electric beam at first revealed the dust within the chamber as it did in the air of the laboratory the chamber was examined almost daily a perceptible diminution of the floating matter being noticed as time advanced at the end of a week the chamber was optically empty exhibiting no trace of matter competent to scatter the light such must have been the case in the stagnant caves of the paris observatory were our electric beam sent through the air of these caves its track would be invisible thus showing the indissoluble association of the scattering of light by air and its power to generate life i will now turn to what seems to me a more interesting application of the luminous beam than any hitherto described my reference to professor listers interpretation of the fact that air which has passed through the lungs cannot produce putrefaction is fresh in your memories why air said he introduced into the pleural cavity through a wounded lung should have such wholly different effects from that entering through a permanently open wound penetrating from without was to me a complete mystery till i heard of the germ theory of putrefaction when it at once occurred to me that it was only natural that the air should be filtered of germs by the air passages one of whose offices is to arrest inhaled particles of dust and prevent them from entering the aircells here is a surmise which bears the stamp of genius but which needs verification if for the words it is only natural we were authorised to write it is perfectly certain the demonstration would be complete such demonstration is furnished by experiments with a beam of light one evening towards the close of 1869 while pouring various pure gases across the dusty track of a luminous beam the thought occurred to me of using my breath instead of the gases i then noticed for the first time the extraordinary darkness produced by the expired air towards the end of the expiration permit me to repeat the experiment in your presence i fill my lungs with ordinary air and breathe through a glass tube across the beam the condensation of the aqueous vapour of the breath is shown by the formation of a luminous white cloud of delicate texture we abolish this cloud by drying the breath previous to its entering the beam or still more simply by warming the glass tube the luminous track of the beam is for a time uninterrupted by the breath because the dust returning from the lungs makes good in great part the particles displaced after a time however an obscure disk appears in the beam the darkness of which increases until finally towards the end of the expiration the beam is as it were pierced by an intensely black hole in which no particles whatever can be discerned the deeper air of the lungs is thus proved to be absolutely free from suspended matter it is therefore in the precise condition required by professor listers explanation this experiment may be repeated any number of times with the same result i think it must be regarded as a crowning piece of evidence both of the correctness of professor listers views and of the impotence as regards vital development of optically pure air footnote dr burden sanderson draws attention to the important observation of brauell which shows that the contagium of a pregnant animal suffering from splenic fever is not found in the blood of the foetus the placental apparatus acting as a filter and holding back the infective particles application of luminous beams to water the method of examination here pursued is also applicable to water it is in some sense complementary to that of the microscope and may i think materially aid enquiries conducted with that instrument in microscopic examination attention is directed to a small portion of the liquid and the aim is to detect the individual particles by the present method a large portion of the liquid is illuminated the collective action of the particles being revealed by the scattered light care is taken to defend the eye from the access of all other light and thus defended it becomes an organ of inconceivable delicacy indeed an amount of impurity so infinitesimal as to be scarcely expressible in numbers and the individual particles of which are so small as wholly to elude the microscope may when examined by the method alluded to produce not only sensible but striking effects upon the eye we will apply the method in the first place to an experiment of m pouchet intended to prove conclusively that animalcular life is developed in cases where no antecedent germs could possibly exist he produced water from the combustion of hydrogen in air justly arguing that no germ could survive the heat of a hydrogen flame but he overlooked the fact that his aqueous vapour was condensed in the air and was allowed as water to trickle through the air indeed the experiment is one of a number by which workers like m pouchet are differentiated from workers like pasteur i will show you some water produced by allowing a hydrogen flame to play upon a polished silver condenser formed by the bottom of a silver basin containing ice the collected liquid is pellucid in the common light but in the condensed electric beam it is seen to be laden with particles so thickstrewn and minute as to produce a continuous luminous cone in passing through the air the water loaded itself with this matter and the deportment of such water could obviously have no influence in deciding this great question we are invaded with dirt not only in the air we breathe but in the water we drink to prove this i take the bottle of water intended to quench your lecturers thirst which in the track of the beam simply reveals itself as dirty water and this water is no worse than the other london waters thanks to the kindness of professor frankland i have been furnished with specimens of the water of eight london companies they are all laden with impurities mechanically suspended but you will ask whether filtering will not remove the suspended matter the grosser matter undoubtedly but not the more finely divided matter water may be passed any number of times through bibulous paper it will continue laden with fine matter water passed through lipscombs charcoal filter or through the filters of the silicated carbon company has its grosser matter removed but it is thick with fine matter ninetenths of the light scattered by these suspended particles is perfectly polarised in a direction at right angles to the beam and this release of the particles from the ordinary law of polarisation is a demonstration of their smallness i should say by far the greater number of the particles concerned in this scattering are wholly beyond the range of the microscope and no ordinary filter can intercept such particles it is next to impossible by artificial means to produce a pure water mr hartley for example some time ago distilled water while surrounded by hydrogen but the water was not free from floating matter it is so hard to be clean in the midst of dirt in water from the lake of geneva which has remained long without being stirred we have an approach to the pure liquid i have a bottle of it here which was carefully filled for me by my distinguished friend soret the track of the beam through it is of a delicate skyblue there is scarcely a trace of grosser matter the purest water that i have seenprobably the purest which has been seen hithertohas been obtained from the fusion of selected specimens of ice but extraordinary precautions are required to obtain this degree of purity the following apparatus has been constructed for this purpose through the plate of an airpump passes the shank of a large funnel attached to which below the plate is a clean glass bulb in the funnel is placed a block of the most transparent ice and over the funnel a glass receiver this is first exhausted and refilled several times with air filtered by its passage through cottonwool the ice being thus surrounded by pure moteless air but the ice has previously been in contact with motefilled air it is therefore necessary to let it wash its own surface and also to wash the bulb which is to receive the water of liquefaction the ice is permitted to melt the bulb is filled and emptied several times until finally the large block dwindles to a small one we may be sure that all impurity has been thus removed from the surface of the ice the water obtained in this way is the purest hitherto obtained still i should hesitate to call it absolutely pure when condensed light is sent through it the track of the beam is not invisible but of the most exquisitely delicate blue this blue is purer than that of the sky so that the matter which produces it must be finer than that of the sky it may be and indeed has been contended that this blue is scattered by the very molecules of the water and not by matter suspended in the water but when we remember that this perfection of blue is approached gradually through stages of less perfect blue and when we consider that a blue in all respects similar is demonstrably obtainable from particles mechanically suspended we should hesitate i think to conclude that we have arrived here at the last stage of purification the evidence i think points distinctly to the conclusion that could we push the process of purification still farther even this last delicate trace of blue would disappear chalkwater clarks softening process but is it not possible to match the water of the lake of geneva here in england undoubtedly it is we have in england a kind of rock which constitutes at once an exceedingly clean recipient and a natural filter and from which we can obtain water extremely free from mechanical impurities i refer to the chalk formation in which large quantities of water are held in store our chalk hills are in most cases covered with thin layers of soil and with very scanty vegetation neither opposes much obstacle to the entry of the rain into the chalk where any organic impurity which the water may carry in is soon oxidised and rendered harmless those who have scampered like myself over the downs of hants and wilts will remember the scarcity of water in these regions in fact the rainfall instead of washing the surface and collecting in streams sinks into the fissured chalk and percolates through it when this formation is suitably tapped we obtain water of exceeding briskness and purity a large glass globe filled with the water of a well near tring shows itself to be wonderfully free from mechanical impurity indeed it stands to reason that water wholly withdrawn from surface contamination and percolating through so clean a substance should be pure it has been a subject much debated whether the supply of excellent water which the chalk holds in store could not be rendered available for london many of the most eminent engineers and chemists have ardently recommended this source and have sought to show not only that its purity is unrivalled but that its quantity is practically inexhaustible data sufficient to test this are now i believe in existence the number of wells sunk in the chalk being so considerable and the quantity of water which they yield so well known but this water so admirable as regards freedom from mechanical impurity labours under the disadvantage of being rendered very hard by the carbonate of lime which it holds in solution the chalkwater in the neighbourhood of watford contains about seventeen grains of carbonate of lime per gallon this in the old terminology used to be called seventeen degrees of hardness this hard water is bad for tea bad for washing and it furs our boilers because the lime held in solution is precipitated by boiling if the water be used cold its hardness must be neutralised at the expense of soap before it will give a lather these are serious objections to the use of chalkwater in london but they are successfully met by the fact that such water can be softened inexpensively and on a grand scale i had long known the method of softening water called clarks process but not until recently under the guidance of mr homersham did i see proof of its larger applications the chalkwater is softened for the supply of the city of canterbury and at the chiltern hills it is softened for the supply of tring and aylesbury caterham also enjoys the luxury i have visited all these places and made myself acquainted with the works at canterbury there are three reservoirs covered in and protected by a concrete roof and layers of pebbles both from the summers heat and the winters cold each reservoir holds 120000 gallons of water adjacent to these reservoirs are others containing pure slaked limethe socalled cream of lime these being filled with water the lime and water are thoroughly mixed by air forced by an engine through apertures in the bottom of the reservoir the water soon dissolves all the lime it is capable of dissolving the mechanically suspended lime is then allowed to subside to the bottom leaving a perfectly transparent limewater behind the softening process is this into one of the empty reservoirs is introduced a certain quantity of the clear limewater and after this about nine times the quantity of the chalkwater the transparency immediately disappearsthe mixture of the two clear liquids becoming thickly turbid through the precipitation of carbonate of lime the precipitate is crystalline and heavy and in about twelve hours a layer of pure white carbonate of lime is formed at the bottom of the reservoir with a water of extraordinary beauty and purity overhead a few days ago i pitched some halfpence into a reservoir sixteen feet deep at the chiltern hills this depth hardly dimmed the coin had i cast in a pin it could have been seen at the bottom by this process of softening the water is reduced from about seventeen degrees of hardness to three degrees of hardness it yields a lather immediately its temperature is constant throughout the year in the hottest summer it is cool its temperature being twenty degrees above the freezing point and it does not freeze in winter if conveyed in proper pipes the reservoirs are covered a leaf cannot blow into them and no surface contamination can reach the water it passes direct from the main into the house tap no cisterns are employed and the supply is always fresh and pure this is the kind of water which is supplied to the fortunate people of tring caterham and canterbury the foregoing article as far as it relates to the theory which ascribes epidemic disease to the development of low parasitic life within the human life was embodied in a discourse delivered before the royal institution in january 1870 in june 1871 after a brief reference to the polarisation of light by cloudy matter i ventured to recur to the subject in these terms what is the practical use of these curiosities if we exclude the interest attached to the observation of new facts and the enhancement of that interest through the knowledge that facts often become the exponents of laws these curiosities are in themselves worth little they will not enable us to add to our stock of food or drink or clothes or jewellery but though thus shorn of all usefulness in themselves they may by carrying thought into places which it would not otherwise have entered become the antecedents of practical consequences in looking for example at our illuminated dust we may ask ourselves what it is how does it act not upon a beam of light but upon our own bodies the question then assumes a practical character we find on examination that this dust is mainly organic matterin part living in part dead there are among it particles of ground straw torn rags smoke the pollen of flowers the spores of fungi and the germs of other things but what have they to do with the animal economy let me give you an illustration to which my attention has been lately drawn by mr george henry lewes who writes to me thus i wish to direct your attention to the experiments of von recklingshausen should you happen not to know them they are striking confirmations of what you say of dust and disease last spring when i was at his laboratory in wuerzburg i examined with him blood that had been three weeks a month and five weeks out of the body preserved in little porcelain cups under glass shades this blood was living and growing not only were the amoebalike movements of the white corpuscles present but there were abundant evidences of the growth and development of the corpuscles i also saw a frogs heart still pulsating which had been removed from the body i forget how many days but certainly more than a week there were other examples of the same persistent vitality or absence of putrefaction von recklingshausen did not attribute this to the absence of germsgerms were not mentioned by him but when i asked him how he represented the thing to himself he said the whole mystery of his operation consisted in keeping the blood free from dirt the instruments employed were raised to a red heat just before use the thread was silver thread and was similarly treated and the porcelain cups though not kept free from air were kept free from currents he said he often had failures and these he attributed to particles of dust having escaped his precautions professor lister who has founded upon the removal or destruction of this dirt momentous improvements in surgery tells us the effect of its introduction into the blood of wounds the blood would putrefy and become fetid and when you examine more closely what putrefaction means you find the putrefying substance swarming with infusorial life the germs of which have been derived from the atmospheric dust we are now assuredly in the midst of practical matters and with your permission i will refer once more to a question which has recently occupied a good deal of public attention as regards the lowest forms of life the world is divided and has for a long time been divided into two parties the one affirming that we have only to submit absolutely dead matter to certain physical conditions to evolve from it living things the other without wishing to set bounds to the power of matter affirming that in our day life has never been found to arise independently of preexisting life i belong to the party which claims life as a derivative of life the question has two factorsthe evidence and the mind that judges of the evidence and it may be purely a mental set or bias on my part that causes me throughout this long discussion to see on the one side dubious facts and defective logic and on the other side firm reasoning and a knowledge of what rigid experimental enquiry demands but judged of practically what again has the question of spontaneous generation to do with us let us see there are numerous diseases of men and animals that are demonstrably the products of parasitic life and such diseases may take the most terrible epidemic forms as in the case of the silkworms of france referred to at an earlier part of this article now it is in the highest degree important to know whether the parasites in question are spontaneously developed or whether they have been wafted from without to those afflicted with the disease the means of prevention if not of cure would be widely different in the two cases but this is not all besides these universally admitted cases there is the broad theory now broached and daily growing in strength and clearnessdaily indeed gaining more and more of assent from the most successful workers and profound thinkers of the medical profession itselfthe theory namely that contagious disease generally is of this parasitic character had i any cause to regret having introduced this theory to your notice more than a year ago that regret should now be expressed i would certainly renounce in your presence whatever leaning towards the germ theory my words might then have betrayed but since the time referred to nothing has occurred to shake my conviction of the truth of the theory let me briefly state the grounds on which its supporters rely from their respective viruses you may plant typhoid fever scarlatina or smallpox what is the crop that arises from this husbandry as surely as a thistle rises from a thistle seed as surely as the fig comes from the fig the grape from the grape the thorn from the thorn so surely does the typhoid virus increase and multiply into typhoid fever the scarlatina virus into scarlatina the smallpox virus into smallpox what is the conclusion that suggests itself here it is this that the thing which we vaguely call a virus is to all intents and purposes a seed excluding the notion of vitality in the whole range of chemical science you cannot point to an action which illustrates this perfect parallelism with the phenomena of lifethis demonstrated power of selfmultiplication and reproduction the germ theory alone accounts for the phenomena in cases of epidemic disease it is not on bad air or foul drains that the attention of the physician of the future will primarily be fixed but upon disease germs which no bad air or foul drains can create but which may be pushed by foul air into virulent energy of reproduction you may think i am treading on dangerous ground that i am putting forth views that may interfere with salutary practice no such thing if you wish to learn the impotence of medical practice in dealing with contagious diseases you have only to refer to the harveian oration for 1871 by sir william gull such diseases defy the physician they must run their course and the utmost that can be done for them is careful nursing and this though i do not specially insist upon it would favour the idea of their vital origin for if the seeds of contagious disease be themselves living things it may be difficult to destroy either them or their progeny without involving their living habitat in the same destruction it has been said and it is sure to be repeated that i am quitting my own mtier in speaking of these things not so i am dealing with a question on which minds accustomed to weigh the value of experimental evidence are alone competent to decide and regarding which in its present condition minds so trained are as capable of forming an opinion as regarding the phenomena of magnetism or radiant heat the germ theory of disease it has been said appertains to the biologist and the physician where i would ask in reply is the biologist or physician whose researches in connection with this subject could for one instant be compared to those of the chemist pasteur it is not the philosophic members of the medical profession who are dull to the reception of truth not originated within the pale of the profession itself i cannot better conclude this portion of my story than by reading to you an extract from a letter addressed to me some time ago by dr william budd of clifton to whose insight and energy the town of bristol owes so much in the way of sanitary improvement as to the germ theory itself writes dr budd that is a matter on which i have long since made up my mind from the day when i first began to think of these subjects i have never had a doubt that the specific cause of contagious fevers must be living organisms it is impossible in fact to make any statement bearing upon the essence or distinctive characters of these fevers without using terms which are of all others the most distinctive of life take up the writings of the most violent opponent of the germ theory and ten to one you will find them full of such terms as propagation selfpropagation reproduction selfmultiplication and so on try as he mayif he has anything to say of those diseases which is characteristic of themhe cannot evade the use of these terms or the exact equivalents to them while perfectly applicable to living things these terms express qualities which are not only inapplicable to common chemical agents but as far as i can see actually inconceivable of them cottonwool respirator once then established within the body this evil form of life if you will allow me to call it so must run its course medicine as yet is powerless to arrest its progress and the great point to be aimed at is to prevent its access to the body it was with this thought in my mind that i ventured to recommend more than a year ago the use of cottonwool respirators in infectious places i would here repeat my belief in their efficacy if properly constructed but i do not wish to prejudice the use of these respirators by connecting them indissolubly with the germ theory there are too many trades in england where life is shortened and rendered miserable by the introduction of matters into the lungs which might be kept out of them dr greenhow has shown the stony grit deposited in the lungs of stonecutters the black lungs of colliers is another case in point in fact a hundred obvious cases might be cited and others that are not obvious might be added to them we should not for example think that printing implied labour where the use of cottonwool respirators might come into play but the fact is that the dust arising from the sorting of the type is very destructive of health i went some time ago into a manufactory in one of our large towns where iron vessels are enamelled by coating them with a mineral powder and subjecting them to a heat sufficient to fuse the powder the organisation of the establishment was excellent and one thing only was needed to make it faultless in a large room a number of women were engaged covering the vessels the air was laden with the fine dust and their faces appeared as white and bloodless as the powder with which they worked by the use of cottonwool respirators these women might be caused to breathe air as free from suspended matter as that of the open street over a year ago a lancashire seedsman wrote to me stating that during the seed season his men suffered horribly from irritation and fever so that many of them left his service he asked for help and i gave him my advice at the conclusion of the season this year he wrote to inform me that he had folded a little cottonwool in muslin and tied it in front of the mouth and that with this simple defence he had passed through the season in comfort and without a single complaint from his men against the use of such a respirator the obvious objection arises that it becomes wet and heated by the breath while casting about for a remedy for this a friend forwarded to me from newcastle a form of respirator invented by mr carrick a hotelkeeper at glasgow which by a slight modification may be caused to meet the case perfectly the respirator with its back in part removed is shown in fig 4 under the partition of wiregauze q r is a space intended by mr carrick for medicated substances and which may be filled with cottonwool the mouth is placed against the aperture o which fits closely round the lips and the filtered air enters the mouth through a light valve v which is lifted by the act of inhalation during exhalation this valve closes the breath escapes by a second valve v into the open air the wool is thus kept dry and cool the air in passing through it being filtered of everything it holds in suspension the respirator has since taken other forms fig 4 firemans respirator we have thus been led by our first unpractical experiments into a thicket of practical considerations but another step is possible admiring as i do the bravery of our firemen and hearing that smoke was a more serious enemy than flame itself i thought of devising a firemans respirator our fireescapes are each in charge of a single man and it would be of obvious importance to place it in the power of each of those men to penetrate through the densest smoke into the recesses of a house and there to rescue those who would otherwise be suffocated or burnt cottonwool which so effectually arrested dust was first tried but though found soothing in certain gentle kinds of smoke it was no match for the pungent fumes of a resinous fire for the purpose of catching the atmospheric germs m pouchet spread a film of glycerine on a plate of glass urged air against the film and examined the dust which stuck to it the moistening of the cottonwool with glycerine was a decided improvement still the respirator only enabled us to remain in dense smoke for three or four minutes after which the irritation became unendurable reflection suggested that besides the smoke there must be numerous hydrocarbons produced which being in a state of vapour would be very imperfectly arrested by the cottonwool these in all probability were the cause of the residual irritation and if these could be removed a practically perfect respirator might possibly be obtained i state the reasoning exactly as it occurred to my mind its result will be anticipated by many present all bodies possess the power of condensing in a greater or less degree gases and vapours upon their surfaces and when the condensing body is very porous or in a fine state of division the force of condensation may produce very remarkable effects thus a clean piece of platinumfoil placed in a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen so squeezes the gases together as to cause them to combine and if the experiment be made with care the heat of combination may raise the platinum to bright redness the promptness of this action is greatly augmented by reducing the platinum to a state of fine division a pellet of spongy platinum for instance plunged into a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen causes the gases to explode instantly in virtue of its extreme porosity a similar power is possessed by charcoal it is not strong enough to cause the oxygen and hydrogen to combine like the spongy platinum but it so squeezes the more condensable vapours and acts with such condensing power upon the oxygen of the air as to bring both within the combining distance thus enabling the oxygen to attack and destroy the vapours in the pores of the charcoal in this way effluvia of all kinds may be virtually burnt up and this is the principle of the excellent charcoal respirators invented by dr stenhouse armed with one of these you may go into the foulestsmelling places without having your nose offended but while powerful to arrest vapours the charcoal respirator is ineffectual as regards smoke the smokeparticles get freely through the respirator with a number of such respirators tested in a proper room from half a minute to a minute was the limit of endurance this might be exceeded by faradays simple method of emptying the lungs completely and then filling them before going into a smoky atmosphere in fact each solid smoke particle is itself a bit of charcoal and carries on it and in it its little load of irritating vapour it is this far more than the particles of carbon themselves that produces the irritation hence two causes of offence are to be removed the carbon particles which convey the irritant by adhesion and condensation and the free vapour which accompanies the particles the cottonwool moistened with glycerine i knew would arrest the first fragments of charcoal i hoped would stop the second in the first firemans respirator mr carricks arrangement of two valves the one for inhalation the other for exhalation was preserved but the portion of the respirator which holds the filtering and absorbent substances was prolonged to a depth of four or five inches see fig 5 under the partition of wiregauze q r at the bottom of the space which fronts the mouth was placed a layer of cottonwool c moistened with glycerine then a thin layer of dry wool c then a layer of charcoal fragments and finally a second thin layer of dry cottonwool the succession of the layers may be changed without prejudice to the action a wiregauze cover shown in plan under fig 5 keeps the substances from falling out of the respirator a layer of caustic lime may be added for the absorption of carbonic acid but in the densest smoke that we have hitherto employed it has not been found necessary nor is it shown in the figure in a flaming building indeed the mixture of air with the smoke never permits the carbonic acid to become so dense as to be irrespirable but in a place where the gas is present in undue quantity the fragments of lime would materially mitigate its action in a small cellarlike chamber with a stone flooring and stone walls the first experiments were made we placed there furnaces containing resinous pinewood lighted the wood and placing over it a lid which prevented too brisk a circulation of the air generated dense volumes of smoke with our eyes protected by suitable glasses my assistant and i have remained for half an hour and more in smoke so dense and pungent that a single inhalation through the undefended mouth would be perfectly unendurable we might have prolonged our stay for hours fig 5 having thus far perfected the instrument i wrote to the chief officer of the metropolitan fire brigade asking him whether such a respirator would be of use to him his reply was prompt it would be most valuable he had however made himself acquainted with every contrivance of the kind in this and other countries and had found none of them of any practical use he offered to come and test it here or to place a room at my disposal in the city at my request he came here accompanied by three of his men our small room was filled with smoke to their entire satisfaction the three men went successively into it and remained there as long as captain shaw wished them on coming out they said that they had not suffered the slightest inconvenience that they could have remained all day in the smoke captain shaw then tested the respirator with the same result and he afterwards took great interest in the perfecting of the instrument various ameliorations and improvements have recently been introduced into the smoke respirator the hood of captain shaw has been improved upon by the simple and less expensive mouthpiece of mr sinclair and this in its turn has been simplified and improved by my assistant mr john cottrell the respirator is now in considerable demand and it has already done good practical service care is however necessary in moistening the wool with glycerine it must be carefully teazed so that the individual fibres may be moistened and clots must be avoided i cannot recommend the layers of moistened flannel which in some cases have been used instead of cottonwool nothing equals the wool when carefully treated an experiment made last year brought out very conspicuously the necessity of careful packing and the enormous comparative power of resisting smoke irritation possessed by our firemen and the able officer who commands them having heard from captain shaw that in some recent very trying experiments he had obtained the best effects from dry cottonwool and thinking that i could not have been mistaken in my first results which proved the dry so much inferior to the moistened wool and its associated charcoal i proposed to captain shaw to bring the matter to a test at his workshops in the city he was good enough to accept my proposal and thither i went on may 7 1874 the smoke was generated in a confined space from wet straw and it was certainly very diabolical at this season of the year i am usually somewhat shorn of vigour and therefore not in the best condition for severe experiments still i wished to test the matter in my own person with a respirator which had been in use some days previously and which was not carefully packed i followed a fireman into the smoke he being provided with a drywool respirator i was compelled to quit the place in about three minutes while the fireman remained there for six or seven minutes i then tried his respirator upon myself and found that with it i could not remain more than a minute in the smoke in fact the first inhalation provoked coughing thinking that captain shaw himself might have lungs more like mine than those of his fireman i proposed that we should try the respirators together but he informed me that his lungs were very strong he was however good enough to accede to my request before entering the den a second time i repacked my respirator with due care and entered the smoke in company with captain shaw i could hear him breathe long slow inhalations his labour was certainly greater than mine and after the lapse of seven minutes i heard him cough in seven and a half minutes he had to quit the place thus proving that his lungs were able to endure the irritation seven times as long as mine could bear it i continued in the smoke with hardly any discomfort for sixteen minutes and certainly could have remained in it much longer the advantage arising from the glycerine was thus placed beyond question during this time i was in a condition to render very material assistance to a person in danger of suffocation helmholtz on hay fever in my lecture on dust and disease in 1870 i referred to an experiment made by helmholtz upon himself which strikingly connected hay fever with animalcular life about a year ago i received from professor binz of bonn a short but important paper embracing helmholtzs account of his observation to which professor binz has added some remarks of his own the paper being mainly intended for english medical men was published in english and though here and there its style might be amended i think it better to publish it unaltered from what i have observed says professor binz of recent english publications on the subject of hay fever i am led to suppose that english authorities are inaccurately acquainted with the discovery of professor helmholtz as far back as 1868 of the existence of uncommon low organisms in the nasal secretions in this complaint and of the possibility of arresting their action by the local employment of quinine i therefore purpose to republish the letter in which he originally announced these facts to myself and to add some further observations on this topic the letter is as follows footnote cf virchows archiv vol xlvi i have suffered as well as i can remember since the year 1847 from the peculiar catarrh called by the english hay fever the speciality of which consists in its attacking its victims regularly in the hay season myselfbetween may 20 and the end of june that it ceases in the cooler weather but on the other hand quickly reaches a great intensity if the patients expose themselves to heat and sunshine an extraordinary violent sneezing then sets in and a strongly corrosive thin discharge with which much epithelium is thrown off this increases after a few hours to a painful inflammation of the mucous membrane and of the outside of the nose and excites fever with severe headache and great depression if the patient cannot withdraw himself from the heat and the sunshine in a cool room however these symptoms vanish as quickly as they come on and there then only remains for a few days a lessened discharge and soreness as if caused by the loss of epithelium i remark by the way that in all my other years i had very little tendency to catarrh or catching cold while the hay fever has never failed during the twentyone years of which i have spoken and has never attacked me earlier or later in the year than the times named the condition is extremely troublesome and increases if one is obliged to be much exposed to the sun to an excessively severe malady the curious dependence of the disease on the season of the year suggested to me the thought that organisms might be the origin of the mischief in examining the secretion i regularly found in the last five years certain vibriolike bodies in it which at other times i could not observe in my nasal secretion they are very small and can only be recognised with the immersionlens of a very good hartnacks microscope it is characteristic of the common isolated single joints that they contain four nuclei in a row of which two pairs are more closely united the length of the joints is 0004 millimetre upon the warm objectivestage they move with moderate activity partly in mere vibration partly shooting backwards and forwards in the direction of their long axis in lower temperatures they are very inactive occasionally one finds them arranged in rows upon each other or in branching series observed some days in the moist chamber they vegetated again and appeared somewhat larger and more conspicuous than immediately after their excretion it is to be noticed that only that kind of secretion contains them which is expelled by violent sneezings that which drops slowly does not contain any they stick tenaciously enough in the lower cavities and recesses of the nose when i saw your first notice respecting the poisonous action of quinine upon infusoria i determined at once to make an experiment with that substance thinking that these vibrionic bodies even if they did not cause the whole illness still could render it much more unpleasant through their movements and the decompositions caused by them for that reason i made a neutral solution of sulphate of quinine which did not contain much of the salt 1800 but still was effective enough and caused moderate irritation on the mucus membrane of the nose i then lay flat on my back keeping my head very low and poured with a pipette about four cubic centimetres into both nostrils then i turned my head about in order to let the liquid flow in all directions the desired effect was obtained immediately and remained for some hours i could expose myself to the sun without fits of sneezing and the other disagreeable symptoms coming on it was sufficient to repeat the treatment three times a day even under the most unfavourable circumstances in order to keep myself quite free footnote there is no foundation for the objection that syringing the nose could not cure the asthma which accompanies hay fever for this asthma is only the reflex effect arising from the irritation of the noseb there were then no such vibrios in the secretion if i only go out in the evening it suffices to inject the quinine once a day just before going after continuing this treatment for some days the symptoms disappear completely but if i leave off they return till towards the end of june my first experiments with quinine date from the summer of 1867 this year 1868 i began at once as soon as the first traces of the illness appeared and i have thus been able to stop its development completely i have hesitated as yet in publishing the matter because i have found no other patient footnote helmholtz now professor of physics at the university of berlin is although md no medical practitionerb on whom i could try the experiment there is it seems to me no doubt considering the extraordinary regularity in the recurrence and course of the illness that quinine had here a most quick and decided effect and this again makes my hypothesis very probable that the vibrios although of no specific form but a very frequent one are at least the cause of the rapid increase of the symptoms in warm air as heat excites them to lively action i should be very glad if the above lines would induce medical men in englandthe haunt of hay feverto test the observation of helmholtz to most patients the application with the pipette may be too difficult or impossible i have therefore already suggested the use of webers very simple but effective nosedouche also it will be advisable to apply the solution of quinine tepid it can further not be repeated often enough that quinine is frequently adulterated especially with cinchona the action of which is much less to be depended upon dr frickhoefer of schwalbach has communicated to me a second case in which hay fever was cured by local application of quinine footnote cf virchows archiv 1870 vol li p 176 professor busch of bonn authorises me to say that he succeeded in two cases of catarrhus aestivus by the same method a third patient was obliged to abstain from the use of quinine as it produced an unbearable irritation of the sensible nerves of the nose in the autumn of 1872 helmholtz told me that his fever was quite cured and that in the meantime two other patients had by his advice tried this method and with the same success footnote prof helmholtz whom i had the pleasure of meeting in switzerland last year then told me that he was quite convinced that hay fever was produced by the pollen afloat in early summer in the atmosphere vi voyage to algeria to observe the eclipse 1870 the opening of the eclipse expedition was not propitious portsmouth on monday december 5 1870 was swathed by fog which was intensified by smoke and traversed by a drizzle of fine rain at six pm i was on board the urgent on tuesday morning the weather was too thick to permit of the ships being swung and her compasses calibrated the admiral of the port a man of very noble presence came on board under his stimulus the energy which the weather had damped appeared to become more active and soon after his departure we steamed down to spithead here the fog had so far lightened as to enable the officers to swing the ship at three pm on tuesday december 6 we got away gliding successively past whitecliff bay bembridge sandown shanklin ventnor and st catherines lighthouse on wednesday morning we sighted the isle of ushant on the french side of the channel the northern end of the island has been fretted by the waves into detached towerlike masses of rock of very remarkable appearance in the channel the sea was green and opposite ushant it was a brighter green on wednesday evening we committed ourselves to the bay of biscay the roll of the atlantic was full but not violent there had been scarcely a gleam of sunshine throughout the day but the cloudforms were fine and their apparent solidity impressive on thursday morning the green of the sea was displaced by a deep indigo blue the whole of thursday we steamed across the bay we had little blue sky but the clouds were again grand and variedcirrus stratus cumulus and nimbus we had them all dusky hairlike trails were sometimes dropped from the distant clouds to the sea these were falling showers and they sometimes occupied the whole horizon while we steamed across the rainless circle which was thus surrounded sometimes we plunged into the rain and once or twice by slightly changing our course avoided a heavy shower from time to time perfect rainbows spanned the heavens from side to side at times a bow would appear in fragments showing the keystone of the arch midway in air and its two buttresses on the horizon in all cases the light of the bow could be quenched by a nicols prism with its long diagonal tangent to the arc sometimes gleaming patches of the firmament were seen amid the clouds when viewed in the proper direction the gleam could be quenched by a nicols prism a dark aperture being thus opened into stellar space at sunset on thursday the denser clouds were fiercely fringed while through the lighter ones seemed to issue the glow of a conflagration on friday morning we sighted cape finisterrethe extreme end of the arc which sweeps from ushant round the bay of biscay calm spaces of blue in which floated quietly scraps of cumuli were behind us but in front of us was a horizon of portentous darkness it continued thus threatening throughout the day towards evening the wind strengthened to a gale and at dinner it was difficult to preserve the plates and dishes from destruction our thinned company hinted that the rolling had other consequences it was very wild when we went to bed i slumbered and slept but after some time was rendered anxiously conscious that my body had become a kind of projectile with the ships side for a target i gripped the edge of my berth to save myself from being thrown out outside i could hear somebody say that he had been thrown from his berth and sent spinning to the other side of the saloon the screw laboured violently amid the lurching it incessantly quitted the water and twirling in the air rattled against its bearings causing the ship to shudder from stem to stern at times the waves struck us not with the soft impact which might be expected from a liquid but with the sudden solid shock of batteringrams no man knows the force of water said one of the officers until he has experienced a storm at sea these blows followed each other at quicker intervals the screw rattling after each of them until finally the delivery of a heavier stroke than ordinary seemed to reduce the saloon to chaos furniture crashed glasses rang and alarmed enquiries immediately followed amid the noises i heard one note of forced laughter it sounded very ghastly men tramped through the saloon and busy voices were heard aft as if something there had gone wrong i rose and not without difficulty got into my clothes in the aftercabin under the superintendence of the able and energetic navigating lieutenant mr brown a group of bluejackets were working at the tillerropes these had become loose and the helm refused to answer the wheel high moral lessons might be gained on shipboard by observing what steadfast adherence to an object can accomplish and what large effects are heaped up by the addition of infinitesimals the tillerrope as the bluejackets strained in concert seemed hardly to move still it did move a little until finally by timing the pull to the lurching of the ship the mastery of the rudder was obtained i had previously gone on deck round the saloondoor were a few members of the eclipse party who seemed in no mood for scientific observation nor did i but i wished to see the storm i climbed the steps to the poop exchanged a word with captain toynbee the only member of the party to be seen on the poop and by his direction made towards a cleat not far from the wheel footnote the cleat is a tshaped mass of metal employed for the fastening of ropes round it i coiled my arms with the exception of the men at the wheel who stood as silent as corpses i was alone i had seen grandeur elsewhere but this was a new form of grandeur to me the urgent is long and narrow and during our expedition she lacked the steadying influence of sufficient ballast she was for a time practically rudderless and lay in the trough of the sea i could see the long ridges with some hundreds of feet between their crests rolling upon the ship perfectly parallel to her sides as they approached they so grew upon the eye as to render the expression mountains high intelligible at all events there was no mistaking their mechanical might as they took the ship upon their shoulders and swung her like a pendulum the deck sloped sometimes at an angle which i estimated at over fortyfive degrees wanting my previous alpine practice i should have felt less confidence in my grip of the cleat here and there the long rollers were tossed by interference into heaps of greater height the wind caught their crests and scattered them over the sea the whole surface of which was seething white the aspect of the clouds was a fit accompaniment to the fury of the ocean the moon was almost fullat times concealed at times revealed as the scud flew wildly over it these things appealed to the eye while the ear was filled by the groaning of the screw and the whistle and boom of the storm nor was the outward agitation the only object of interest to me i was at once subject and object to myself and watched with intense interest the workings of my own mind the urgent is an elderly ship she had been built i was told by a contracting firm for some foreign government and had been diverted from her first purpose when converted into a troopship she had been for some time out of work and i had heard that one of her boilers at least needed repair our scanty but excellent crew moreover did not belong to the urgent but had been gathered from other ships our three lieutenants were also volunteers all this passed swiftly through my mind as the steamer shook under the blows of the waves and i thought that probably no one on board could say how much of this thumping and straining the urgent would be able to bear this uncertainty caused me to look steadily at the worst and i tried to strengthen myself in the face of it but at length the helm laid hold of the water and the ship was got gradually round to face the waves the rolling diminished a certain amount of pitching taking its place our speed had fallen from eleven knots to two i went again to bed after a space of calm when we seemed crossing the vortex of a storm heavy tossing recommenced i was afraid to allow myself to fall asleep as my berth was high and to be pitched out of it might be attended with bruises if not with fractures from friday at noon to saturday at noon we accomplished sixtysix miles or an average of less than three miles an hour i overheard the sailors talking about this storm the urgent according to those that knew her had never previously experienced anything like it footnote there is it will be seen a fair agreement between these impressions and those so vigorously described by a scientific correspondent of the times all through saturday the wind though somewhat sobered blew dead against us the atmospheric effects were exceedingly fine the cumuli resembled mountains in shape and their peaked summits shone as white as alpine snows at one place this resemblance was greatly strengthened by a vast area of cloud uniformly illuminated and lying like a nv below the peaks from it fell a kind of cloudriver strikingly like a glacier the horizon at sunset was remarkablespaces of brilliant green between clouds of fiery red rainbows had been frequent throughout the day and at night a perfectly continuous lunar bow spanned the heavens from side to side its colours were feeble but contrasted with the black ground against which it rested its luminousness was extraordinary sunday morning found us opposite to lisbon and at midnight we rounded cape st vincent where the lurching seemed disposed to recommence through the kindness of lieutenant walton a cot had been slung for me it hung between a tillerwheel and a flue and at one am i was roused by the banging of the cot against its boundaries but the wind was now behind us and we went along at a speed of eleven knots we felt certain of reaching cadiz by three but a new lighthouse came in sight which some affirmed to be cadiz lighthouse while the surrounding houses were declared to be those of cadiz itself out of deference to these statements the navigating lieutenant changed his course and steered for the place a pilot came on board and he informed us that we were before the mouth of the guadalquivir and that the lighthouse was that of cipina cadiz was still some eighteen miles distant we steered towards the city hoping to get into the harbour before dark but the pilot who would have guided us had been snapped up by another vessel and we did not get in we beat about during the night and in the morning found ourselves about fifteen miles from cadiz the sun rose behind the city and we steered straight into the light the threetowered cathedral stood in the midst round which swarmed apparently a multitude of chimneystacks a nearer approach showed the chimneys to be small turrets a pilot was taken on board for there is a dangerous shoal in the harbour the appearance of the town as the sun shone upon its white and lofty walls was singularly beautiful we cast anchor some officials arrived and demanded a clean bill of health we had none they would have nothing to do with us so the yellow quarantine flag was hoisted and we waited for permission to land the cadiz party after some hours delay the english consul and viceconsul came on board and with them a spanish officer ablaze with gold lace and decorations under slight pressure the requisite permission had been granted we landed our party and in the afternoon weighed anchor thanks to the kindness of our excellent paymaster i was here transferred to a more roomy berth cadiz soon sank beneath the sea and we sighted in succession cape trafalgar tarifa and the revolving light of ceuta the water was very calm and the moon rose in a quiet heaven she swung with her convex surface downwards the common boundary between light and shadow being almost horizontal a pillar of reflected light shimmered up to us from the slightly rippled sea i had previously noticed the phosphorescence of the water but tonight it was stronger than usual especially among the foam at the bows a bucket let down into the sea brought up a number of the little sparkling organisms which caused the phosphorescence i caught some of them in my hand and here an appearance was observed which was new to most of us and strikingly beautiful to all standing at the bow and looking forwards at a distance of forty or fifty yards from the ship a number of luminous streamers were seen rushing towards us on nearing the vessel they rapidly turned like a comet round its perihelion placed themselves side by side and in parallel trails of light kept up with the ship one of them placed itself right in front of the bow as a pioneer these comets of the sea were joined at intervals by others sometimes as many as six at a time would rush at us bend with extraordinary rapidity round a sharp curve and afterwards keep us company i leaned over the bow and scanned the streamers closely the frontal portion of each of them revealed the outline of a porpoise the rush of the creatures through the water had started the phosphorescence every spark of which was converted by the motion of the retina into a line of light each porpoise was thus wrapped in a luminous sheath the phosphorescence did not cease at the creatures tail but was carried many porpoiselengths behind it to our right we had the african hills illuminated by the moon gibraltar rock at length became visible but the town remained long hidden by a belt of haze through which at length the brighter lamps struggled it was like the gradual resolution of a nebula into stars as the intervening depth became gradually less the mist vanished more and more and finally all the lamps shone through it they formed a bright foil to the sombre mass of rock above them the sea was so calm and the scene so lovely that mr huggins and myself stayed on deck till near midnight when the ship was moored during our walking to and fro a striking enlargement of the disk of jupiter was observed whenever the heated air of the funnel came between us and the planet on passing away from the heated air the flat dim disk would immediately shrink to a luminous point the effect was one of visual persistence the retinal image of the planet was set quivering in all azimuths by the streams of heated air describing in quick succession minute lines of light which summed themselves to a disk of sensible area at six oclock next morning the gun at the signal station on the summit of the rock boomed at eight the band on board the trafalgar trainingship which was in the harbour struck up the national anthem and immediately afterwards a crowd of mitelike cadets swarmed up the rigging after the removal of the apparatus belonging to the gibraltar party we went on shore winter was in england when we left but here we had the warmth of summer the vegetation was luxuriantpalmtrees cactuses and aloes all ablaze with scarlet flowers a visit to the governor was proposed as an act of necessary courtesy and i accompanied admiral ommaney and mr huggins to the convent or government house we sent in our cards waited for a time and were then conducted by an orderly to his excellency he is a fine old man over six feet high and of frank military bearing he received us and conversed with us in a very genial manner he took us to see his garden his palms his shaded promenades and his orangetrees loaded with fruit in all of which he took manifest delight evidently the hero of kars had fallen upon quarters after his own heart he appeared full of good nature and engaged us on the spot to dine with him that day we sought the townmajor for a pass to visit the lines while awaiting his arrival i purchased a stock of white glass bottles with a view to experiments on the colour of the sea mr huggins and myself who wished to see the rock were taken by captain salmond to the library where a model of gibraltar is kept and where we had a useful preliminary lesson at the library we met colonel maberly a courteous and kindly man who gave us good advice regarding our excursion he sent an orderly with us to the entrance of the lines the orderly handed us over to an intelligent irishman who was directed to show us everything that we desired to see and to hide nothing from us we took the upper line traversed the galleries hewn through the limestone looked through the embrasures which opened like doors in the precipice towards the hills of spain reached st georges hall and went still higher emerging on the summit of one of the noblest cliffs i have ever seen beyond were the spanish lines marked by a line of white sentryboxes nearer were the english lines less conspicuously indicated and between both was the neutral ground behind the spanish lines rose the conical hill called the queen of spains chair the general aspect of the mainland from the rock is bold and rugged doubling back from the galleries we struck upwards towards the crest reached the signal station where we indulged in shandygaff and bread and cheese thence to oharas tower the highest point of the rock it was built by a former governor who forgetful of the laws of terrestrial curvature thought he might look from the tower intothe port of cadiz the tower is riven and it may be climbed along the edges of the crack we got to the top of it thence descended the curious mediterranean staira zigzag mostly of steps down a steeply falling slope amid palmetto brush aloes and prickly pear passing over the windmill hill we were joined at the governors cottage by a car and drove afterwards to the lighthouse at europa point the tower was built i believe by queen adelaide and it contains a fine dioptric apparatus of the first order constructed by messrs chance of birmingham at the appointed hour we were at the convent during dinner the same genial traits which appeared in the morning were still more conspicuous the freshness of the governors nature showed itself best when he spoke of his old antagonist in arms mouravieff chivalry in war is consistent with its stern prosecution these two men were chivalrous and after striking the last blow became friends for ever our kind and courteous reception at gibraltar is a thing to be remembered with pleasure on december 15 we committed ourselves to the mediterranean the views of gibraltar with which we are most acquainted represent it as a huge ridge but its aspect end on both from the spanish lines and from the other side is truly noble there is a sloping bank of sand at the back of the rock which i was disposed to regard simply as the dbris of the limestone i wished to let myself down upon it but had not the time my friend mr busk however assures me that it is silica and that the same sand constitutes the adjacent neutral ground there are theories afloat as to its having been blown from sahara the mediterranean throughout this first day and indeed throughout the entire voyage to oran was of a less deep blue than the atlantic possibly the quantity of organisms may have modified the colour at night the phosphorescence was startling breaking suddenly out along the crests of the waves formed by the port and starboard bows its strength was not uniform having flashed brilliantly for a time it would in part subside and afterwards regain its vigour several large phosphorescent masses of weird appearance also floated past on the morning of the 16th we sighted the fort and lighthouse of marsa el kibir and beyond them the white walls of oran lying in the bight of a bay sheltered by dominant hills the sun was shining brightly during our whole voyage we had not had so fine a day the wisdom which had led us to choose oran as our place of observation seemed demonstrated a rather excitable pilot came on board and he guided us in behind the mole which had suffered much damage the previous year from an unexplained outburst of waves from the mediterranean both port and bow anchors were cast in deep water with three huge hawsers the ships stem was made fast to three gunpillars fixed in the mole and here for a time the urgent rested from her labours m janssen who had rendered his name celebrated by his observations of the eclipse in india in 1868 when he showed the solar flames to be eruptions of incandescent hydrogen was already encamped in the open country about eight miles from oran on december 2 he had quitted paris in a balloon with a strong young sailor as his assistant had descended near the mouth of the loire seen m gambetta and received from him encouragement and aid on the day of our arrival his encampment was visited by mr huggins and the kind and courteous engineer of the port drove me subsequently in his own phaeton to the place it bore the best repute as regards freedom from haze and fog and commanded an open outlook but it was inconvenient for us on account of its distance from the ship the place next in repute was the railway station between two and three miles distant from the mole it was inspected but being enclosed was abandoned for an eminence in an adjacent garden the property of mr hinshelwood a scotchman who had settled some years previously as an esparto merchant in oran footnote esparto is a kind of grass now much used in the manufacture of paper he in the most liberal manner placed his ground at the disposition of the party here the tents were pitched on the saturday by captain salmond and his intelligent corps of sappers the instruments being erected on the monday under cover of the tents close to the railway station runs a new loopholed wall of defence through which the highway passes into the open country standing on the highway and looking southwards about twenty yards to the right is a small bastionet intended to carry a gun or two its roof i thought would form an admirable basis for my telescope while the view of the surrounding country was unimpeded in all directions the authorities kindly allowed me the use of this bastionet two men one a bluejacket named elliot and the other a marine named hill were placed at my disposal by lieutenant walton and thus aided on monday morning i mounted my telescope the instrument was new to me and some hours of discipline were spent in mastering all the details of its manipulation mr huggins joined me and we visited together the arab quarter of oran the flatroofed houses appeared very clean and white the street was filled with loiterers and the thresholds were occupied by picturesque groups some of the men were very fine we saw many straight manly fellows who must have been six feet four in height they passed us with perfect indifference evincing no anger suspicion or curiosity hardly caring in fact to glance at us as we passed in one instance only during my stay at oran was i spoken to by an arab he was a tall goodhumoured fellow who came smiling up to me and muttered something about les anglais the mixed population of oran is picturesque in the highest degree the jews rich and poor varying in their costumes as their wealth varies the arabs more picturesque still and of all shades of complexionthe negroes the spaniards the french all grouped together each race preserving its own individuality formed a picture intensely interesting to me on tuesday the 20th i was early at the bastionet the night had been very squally the sergeant of the sappers had taken charge of our key and on tuesday morning elliot went for it he brought back the intelligence that the tents had been blown down and the instruments overturned among these was a large and valuable equatorial from the royal observatory greenwich it seemed hardly possible that this instrument with its wheels and verniers and delicate adjustments could have escaped uninjured from such a fall this however was the case and during the day all the overturned instruments were restored to their places and found to be in practical working order this and the following day were devoted to incessant schooling i had come out as a general stargazer and not with the intention of devoting myself to the observation of any particular phenomenon i wished to see the wholethe first contact the advance of the moon the successive swallowing up of the solar spots the breaking of the last line of crescent by the lunar mountains into baileys beads the advance of the shadow through the air the appearance of the corona and prominences at the moment of totality the radiant streamer of the corona the internal structure of the flames a glance through a polariscope a sweep round the landscape with the naked eye the reappearance of the soar limb through baileys beads and finally the retreat of the lunar shadow through the air i was provided with a telescope of admirable definition mounted adjusted packed and most liberally placed at my disposal by mr warren de la rue the telescope grasped the whole of the sun and a considerable portion of the space surrounding it but it would not take in the extreme limits of the corona for this i had lashed on to the large telescope a light but powerful instrument constructed by ross and lent to me by mr huggins i was also furnished with an excellent binocular by mr dallmeyer in fact no man could have been more efficiently supported it required a strict parcelling out of the interval of totality to embrace in it the entire series of observations these while the sun remained visible were to be made with an unsilvered diagonal eyepiece which reflected but a small fraction of the suns light this fraction being still further toned down by a dark glass at the moment of totality the dark glass was to be removed and a silver reflector pushed in so as to get the maximum of light from the corona and prominences the time of totality was distributed as follows 1 observe approach of shadow through the air totality 2 telescope 30 seconds 3 finder 30 seconds 4 double image prism 15 seconds 5 naked eye 10 seconds 6 finder or binocular 20 seconds 7 telescope 20 seconds 8 observe retreat of shadow in our rehearsals elliot stood beside me watch in hand and furnished with a lantern he called out at the end of each interval while i moved from telescope to finder from finder to polariscope from polariscope to naked eye from naked eye back to finder from finder to telescope abandoning the instrument finally to observe the retreating shadow all this we went over twenty times while looking at the actual sun and keeping him in the middle of the field it was my object to render the repetition of the lesson so mechanical as to leave no room for flurry forgetfulness or excitement volition was not to be called upon nor judgment exercised but a wellbeaten path of routine was to be followed had the opportunity occurred i think the programme would have been strictly carried out but the opportunity did not occur for several days the weather had been illnatured we had wind so strong as to render the hawsers at the stern of the urgent as rigid as iron and to destroy the navigating lieutenants sleep we had clouds a thunderstorm and some rain still the hope was held out that the atmosphere would cleanse itself and if it did we were promised air of extraordinary limpidity early on the 22nd we were all at our posts spaces of blue in the early morning gave us some encouragement but all depended on the relation of these spaces to the surrounding clouds which of them were to grow as the day advanced the wind was high and to secure the steadiness of my instrument i was forced to retreat behind a projection of the bastionet place stones upon its stand and further to avail myself of the shelter of a sail my practised men fastened the sail at the top and loaded it with boulders at the bottom it was tried severely but it stood firm the clouds and blue spaces fought for a time with varying success the sun was bidden and revealed at intervals hope oscillating in synchronism with the changes of the sky at the moment of first contact a dense cloud intervened but a minute or two afterwards the cloud had passed and the encroachment of the black body of the moon was evident upon the solar disk the moon marched onward and i saw it at frequent intervals a large group of spots were approached and swallowed up subsequently i caught sight of the lunar limb as it cut through the middle of a large spot the spot was not to be distinguished from the moon but rose like a mountain above it the clouds when thin could be seen as grey scud drifting across the black surface of the moon but they thickened more and more and made the intervals of clearness scantier during these moments i watched with an interest bordering upon fascination the march of the silver sickle of the sun across the field of the telescope it was so sharp and so beautiful no trace of the lunar limb could be observed beyond the suns boundary here indeed it could only be relieved by the corona which was utterly cut off by the dark glass the blackness of the moon beyond the sun was in fact confounded with the blackness of space beside me was elliot with the watch and lantern while lieutenant archer of the royal engineers had the kindness to take charge of my notebook i mentioned and he wrote rapidly down such things as seemed worthy of remembrance thus my hands and mind were entirely free but it was all to no purpose a patch of sunlight fell and rested upon the landscape some miles away it was the only illuminated spot within view but to the northwest there was still a space of blue which might reach us in time within seven minutes of totality another space towards the zenith became very dark the atmosphere was as it were on the brink of a precipice being charged with humidity which required but a slight chill to bring it down in clouds this was furnished by the withdrawal of the solar beams the clouds did come down covering up the space of blue on which our hopes had so long rested i abandoned the telescope and walked to and fro in despair as the moment of totality approached the descent towards darkness was as obvious as a falling stone i looked towards a distant ridge where the darkness would first appear at the moment a fan of beams issuing from the hidden sun was spread out over the southern heavens these beams are bars of alternate light and shade produced in illuminated haze by the shadows of floating cloudlets of varying density the beams are practically parallel but by an effect of perspective they appear divergent having the sun in fact for their point of convergence the darkness took possession of the ridge referred to lowered upon m janssens observatory passed over the southern heavens blotting out the beams as if a sponge had been drawn across them it then took successive possession of three spaces of blue sky in the southeastern atmosphere i again looked towards the ridge a glimmer as of daydawn was behind it and immediately afterwards the fan of beams which had been for more than two minutes absent revived the eclipse of 1870 had ended and as far as the corona and flames were concerned we had been defeated even in the heart of the eclipse the darkness was by no means perfect small print could be read in fact the clouds which rendered the day a dark one by scattering light into the shadow rendered the darkness less intense than it would have been had the atmosphere been without cloud in the more open spaces i sought for stars but could find none there was a lull in the wind before and after totality but during the totality the wind was strong i waited for some time on the bastionet hoping to get a glimpse of the moon on the opposite border of the sun but in vain the clouds continued and some rain fell the day brightened somewhat afterwards and having packed all up in the sober twilight mr crookes and myself climbed the heights above the fort of vera cruz from this eminence we had a very noble view over the mediterranean and the flanking african hills the sunset was remarkable and the whole outlook exceedingly fine the able and wellinstructed medical officer of the urgent mr goodman observed the following temperatures during the progress of the eclipse hour deg 1145 56 1155 55 1210 54 1237 53 1239 52 1243 51 15 52 127 53 144 56 210 57 the minimum temperature occurred some minutes after totality when a slight rain fell the wind was so strong on the 23rd that captain henderson would not venture out guided by mr goodman i visited a cave in a remarkable stratum of shellbreccia and thanks to my guide secured specimens mr busk informs me that a precisely similar breccia is found at gibraltar at approximately the same level during the afternoon admiral ommaney and myself drove to the fort of marsa el kibir the fortification is of ancient origin the moorish arches being still there in decay but the fort is now very strong about four or five hundred finelooking dragoons were looking after their horses waiting for a lull to enable them to embark for france one of their officers was wandering in a very solitary fashion over the fort we had some conversation with him he had been at sedan had been taken prisoner but had effected his escape he shook his head when we spoke of the termination of the war and predicted its long continuance there was bitterness in his tone as he spoke of the charges of treason so lightly levelled against french commanders the green waves raved round the promontory on which the fort stands smiting the rocks breaking into foam and jumping after impact to a height of a hundred feet and more into the air as we returned our vehicle broke down through the loss of a wheel the admiral went on board while i remained long watching the agitated sea the little horses of oran well merit a passing word their speed and endurance both of which are heavily drawn upon by their drivers are extraordinary the wind sinking we lifted anchor on the 24th for some hours we went pleasantly along but during the afternoon the storm revived and it blew heavily against us all the night when we came opposite the bay of almeria on the 25th the captain turned the ship and steered into the bay where under the shadow of the sierra nevada we passed christmas night in peace next morning a rose of dawn rested on the snows of the adjacent mountains while a purple haze was spread over the lower hills i had no notion that spain possessed so fine a range of mountains as the sierra nevada the height is considerable but the form also is such as to get the maximum of grandeur out of the height we weighed anchor at eight am passing for a time through shoal water the bottom having been evidently stirred up the adjacent land seemed eroded in a remarkable manner it has its floods which excavate these valleys and ravines and leave those singular ridges behind towards evening i climbed the mainmast and standing on the crosstrees saw the sun set amid a blaze of fiery clouds the wind was strong and bitterly cold and i was glad to slide back to the deck along a rope which stretched from the masthead to the ships side that night we cast anchor beside the mole of gibraltar on the morning of the 27th in company with two friends i drove to the spanish lines with the view of seeing the rock from that side it is an exceedingly noble mass the peninsular and oriental mailboat had been signalled and had come heavy duties called me homeward and by transferring myself from the urgent to the mailsteamer i should gain three days i hired a boat rowed to the steamer learned that she was to start at one and returned with all speed to the urgent making known to captain henderson my wish to get away he expressed doubts as to the possibility of reaching the mailsteamer in time with his accustomed kindness he however placed a boat at my disposal four hardy fellows and one of the ships officers jumped into it my luggage hastily thrown together was tumbled in and we were immediately on our way we had nearly four miles to row in about twenty minutes but we hoped the mailboat might not be punctual for a time we watched her anxiously there was no motion we came nearer but the flags were not yet hauled in the men put forth all their strength animated by the exhortations of the officer at the helm the roughness of the sea rendered their efforts to some extent nugatory still we were rapidly approaching the steamer at length she moved punctual almost to the minute at first slowly but soon with quickened pace we turned to the left so as to cut across her bows five minutes pull would have brought us up to her the officer waved his cap and i my hat if they could only see us they might back to us in a moment but they did not see us or if they did they paid us no attention i returned to the urgent discomfited but grateful to the fine fellows who had wrought so hard to carry out my wishes glad of the quiet in the sober afternoon i took a walk towards europa point the sky darkened and heavy squalls passed at intervals private theatricals were at the convent and the kind and courteous governor had sent cards to the eclipse party i failed in my duty in not going st michaels cave is said to rival if it does not outrival the mammoth cave of kentucky on the 28th mr crookes mr carpenter and myself guided by a military policeman who understood his work explored the cavern the mouth is about 1100 feet above the sea we zigzagged up to it and first were led into an aperture in the rock at some height above the true entrance of the cave in this upper cavern we saw some tall and beautiful stalactite pillars the water drips from the roof charged with bicarbonate of lime exposed to the air the carbonic acid partially escapes and the simple carbonate of lime which is hardly at all soluble in water deposits itself as a solid forming stalactites and stalagmites even the exposure of chalk or limestone water to the open air partially softens it a specimen of the redbourne water exposed by professors graham miller and hofmann in a shallow basin fell from eighteen degrees to nine degrees of hardness the softening process of clark is virtually a hastening of the natural process here however instead of being permitted to evaporate half the carbonic acid is appropriated by lime the half thus taken up as well as the remaining half being precipitated the solid precipitate is permitted to sink and the clear supernatant liquid is limpid soft water we returned to the real mouth of st michaels cave which is entered by a wicket the floor was somewhat muddy and the roof and walls were wet we soon found ourselves in the midst of a natural temple where tall columns sprang complete from floor to roof while incipient columns were growing to meet each other upwards and downwards the water which trickles from the stalactite after having in part yielded up its carbonate of lime falls upon the floor vertically underneath and there builds the stalagmite consequently the pillars grow from above and below simultaneously along the same vertical it is easy to distinguish the stalagmitic from the stalactitic portion of the pillars the former is always divided into short segments by protuberant rings as if deposited periodically while the latter presents a uniform surface in some cases the points of inverted cones of stalactite rested on the centres of pillars of stalagmite the process of solidification and the consequent architecture were alike beautiful we followed our guide through various branches and arms of the cave climbed and descended steps halted at the edges of dark shafts and apertures and squeezed ourselves through narrow passages from time to time we halted while mr crookes illuminated with ignited magnesium wire the roof columns dependent spears and graceful drapery of the stalactites once coming to a magnificent cluster of iciclelike spears we helped ourselves to specimens there was some difficulty in detaching the more delicate ones their fragility was so great a consciousness of vandalism which smote me at the time haunts me still for though our requisitions were moderate this beauty ought not to be at all invaded pendent from the roof in their natural habitat nothing can exceed their delicate beauty they live as it were surrounded by organic connections in london they are curious but not beautiful of gathered shells emerson writes i wiped away the weeds and foam and brought my seaborn treasures home but the poor unsightly noisome things had left their beauty on the shore with the sun and the sand and the wild uproar the promontory of gibraltar is so burrowed with caverns that it has been called the hill of caves they are apparently related to the geologic disturbances which the rock has undergone the earliest of these is the tilting of the once horizontal strata suppose a force of torsion to act upon the promontory at its southern extremity near europa point and suppose the rock to be of a partially yielding character such a force would twist the strata into screwsurfaces the greatest amount of twisting being endured near the point of application of the force such a twisting the rock appears to have suffered but instead of the twist fading gradually and uniformly off in passing from south to north the want of uniformity in the material has produced lines of dislocation where there are abrupt changes in the amount of twist thus at the northern end of the rock the dip to the west is nineteen degrees in the middle hill it is thirtyeight degrees in the centre of the south hill or sugar loaf it is fiftyseven degrees at the southern extremity of the sugar loaf strata are vertical while farther to the south they actually turn over and dip to the east the rock is thus divided into three sections separated from each other by places of dislocation where the strata are much wrenched and broken these are called the northern and southern quebrada from the spanish tierra quebrada or broken ground it is at these places that the inland caves of gibraltar are almost exclusively found based on the observations of dr falconer and himself an excellent and most interesting account of these caves and of the human remains and works of art which they contain was communicated by mr busk to the meeting of the congress of prehistoric archaeology at norwich and afterwards printed in the transactions of the congress footnote in this essay mr busk refers to the previous labours of mr smith of jordan hill to whom we owe most of our knowledge of the geology of the rock long subsequent to the operation of the twisting force just referred to the promontory underwent various changes of level there are seaterraces and layers of shellbreccia along its flanks and numerous caves which unlike the inland ones are the product of marine erosion the apes hill on the african side of the strait mr busk informs me has undergone similar disturbances footnote no one can rise from the perusal of mr busks paper without a feeling of admiration for the principal discoverer and indefatigable explorer of the gibraltar caves the late captain frederick brome in the harbour of gibraltar on the morning of our departure i resumed a series of observations on the colour of the sea on the way out a number of specimens had been collected with a view to subsequent examination but the bottles were claret bottles of doubtful purity at gibraltar therefore i purchased fifteen white glass bottles with ground glass stoppers and at cadiz thanks to the friendly guidance of mr cameron i secured a dozen more these sevenandtwenty bottles were filled with water taken at different places between oran and spithead and here let me express my warmest acknowledgments to captain henderson the commander of hms urgent who aided me in my observations in every possible way indeed my thanks are due to all the officers for their unfailing courtesy and help the captain placed at my disposal his own coxswain an intelligent fellow named thorogood who skilfully attached a cord to each bottle weighted it with lead cast it into the sea and after three successive rinsings filled it under my own eyes the contact of jugs buckets or other vessels was thus avoided and even the necessity of pouring out the water afterwards through the dirty london air the mode of examination applied to these bottles has been already described footnote on dust and disease p 168 the liquid is illuminated by a powerfully condensed beam its condition being revealed through the light scattered by its suspended particles care is taken to defend the eye from the access of all other light and thus defended it becomes an organ of inconceivable delicacy were water of uniform density perfectly free from suspended matter it would in my opinion scatter no light at all the track of a luminous beam could not be seen in such water but an amount of impurity so infinitesimal as to be scarcely expressible in numbers and the individual particles of which are so small as wholly to elude the microscope may when examined by the method alluded to produce not only sensible but striking effects upon the eye the results of the examination of nineteen bottles filled at various places between gibraltar and spithead are here tabulated no locality colour of sea appearance in luminous beam 1 gibraltar harbour green thick with fine particles 2 two miles clearer green thick with very from gibraltar fine particles 3 off cabreta point bright green still thick but less so 4 off cabreta point blackindigo much less thick very pure 5 off tarifa undecided thicker than no 4 6 beyond

off ushant dark green a good deal of matter 18 off st catherines yellowgreen exceedingly thick 19 spithead green exceedingly thick here we have three specimens of water described as green a clearer green and bright green taken in gibraltar harbour at a point two miles from the harbour and off cabreta point the home examination showed the first to be thick with suspended matter the second less thick and the third still less thick thus the green brightened as the suspended matter diminished in amount previous to the fourth observation our excellent navigating lieutenant mr brown steered along the coast thus avoiding the adverse current which sets in through the strait from the atlantic to the mediterranean he was at length forced to cross the boundary of the atlantic current which was defined with extraordinary sharpness on the one side of it the water was a vivid green on the other a deep blue standing at the bow of the ship a bottle could be filled with blue water while at the same moment a bottle cast from the stern could be filled with green water two bottles were secured one on each side of this remarkable boundary in the distance the atlantic had the hue called ultramarine but looked fairly down upon it was of almost inky blacknessblack qualified by a trace of indigo what change does the home examination here reveal in passing to indigo the water becomes suddenly augmented in purity the suspended matter becoming suddenly less off tarifa the deep indigo disappears and the sea is undecided in colour accompanying this change we have a rise in the quantity of suspended matter beyond tarifa we change to cobaltblue the suspended matter falling at the same time in quantity this water is distinctly purer than the green we approach cadiz and at twelve miles from the city get into yellowgreen water this the london examination shows to be thick with suspended matter the same is true of cadiz harbour and also of a point fourteen miles from cadiz in the homeward direction here there is a sudden change from yellowgreen to a bright emeraldgreen and accompanying the change a sudden fall in the quantity of suspended matter between cape st mary and cape st vincent the water changes to the deepest indigo a further diminution of the suspended matter being the concomitant phenomenon we now reach the remarkable group of rocks called the burlings and find the water between the shore and the rocks a strong green the home examination shows it to be thick with fine matter fifteen or twenty miles beyond the burlings we come again into indigo water from which the suspended matter has in great part disappeared off cape finisterre about the place where the captain went down the water becomes green and the home examination pronounces it to be thicker then we enter the bay of biscay where the indigo resumes its power and where the home examination shows the greatly augmented purity of the water a second specimen of water taken from the bay of biscay held in suspension fine particles of a peculiar kind the size of them was such as to render the water richly iridescent it showed itself green blue or salmoncoloured according to the direction of the line of vision finally we come to our last two bottles the one taken opposite st catherines lighthouse in the isle of wight the other at spithead the sea at both these places was green and both specimens as might be expected were pronounced by the home examination to be thick with suspended matter two distinct series of observations are here referred tothe one consisting of direct observations of the colour of the sea conducted during the voyage from gibraltar to portsmouth the other carried out in the laboratory of the royal institution and here it is to be noted that in the home examination i never knew what water was placed in my hands the labels with the names of the localities written upon them had been tied up all information regarding the source of the water being thus held back the bottles were simply numbered and not till all of them had been examined and described were the labels opened and the locality and seacolour corresponding to the various specimens ascertained the home observations therefore must have been perfectly unbiassed and they clearly establish the association of the green colour with fine suspended matter and of the ultramarine colour and more especially of the blackindigo hue of the atlantic with the comparative absence of such matter so much for mere observation but what is the cause of the dark hue of the deep ocean footnote a note written to me on october 22 by my friend canon kingsley contains the following reference to this point i have never seen the lake of geneva but i thought of the brilliant dazzling dark blue of the midatlantic under the sunlight and its blackblue under cloud both so solid that one might leap off the sponson on to it without fear this was to me the most wonderful thing which i saw on my voyages to and from the west indies a preliminary remark or two will clear our way towards an explanation colour resides in white light appearing when any constituent of the white light is withdrawn the hue of a purple liquid for example is immediately accounted for by its action on a spectrum it cuts out the yellow and green and allows the red and blue to pass through the blending of these two colours produces the purple but while such a liquid attacks with special energy the yellow and green it enfeebles the whole spectrum by increasing the thickness of the stratum we may absorb the whole of the light the colour of a blue liquid is similarly accounted for it first extinguishes the red then as the thickness augments it attacks the orange yellow and green in succession the blue alone finally remaining but even it might be extinguished by a sufficient depth of the liquid and now we are prepared for a brief but tolerably complete statement of that action of seawater upon light to which it owes its darkness the spectrum embraces three classes of raysthe thermal the visual and the chemical these divisions overlap each other the thermal rays are in part visual the visual rays in part chemical and vice versa the vast body of thermal rays lie beyond the red being invisible these rays are attacked with exceeding energy by water they are absorbed close to the surface of the sea and are the great agents in evaporation at the same time the whole spectrum suffers enfeeblement water attacks all its rays but with different degrees of energy of the visual rays the red are first extinguished as the solar beam plunges deeper into the sea orange follows red yellow follows orange green follows yellow and the various shades of blue where the water is deep enough follow green absolute extinction of the solar beam would be the consequence if the water were deep and uniform if it contained no suspended matter such water would be as black as ink a reflected glimmer of ordinary light would reach us from its surface as it would from the surface of actual ink but no light hence no colour would reach us from the body of the water in very clear and deep seawater this condition is approximately fulfilled and hence the extraordinary darkness of such water the indigo already referred to is i believe to be ascribed in part to the suspended matter which is never absent even in the purest natural water and in part to the slight reflection of the light from the limiting surfaces of strata of different densities a modicum of light is thus thrown back to the eye before the depth necessary to absolute extinction has been attained an effect precisely similar occurs under the moraines of glaciers the ice here is exceptionally compact and owing to the absence of the internal scattering common in bubbled ice the light plunges into the mass where it is extinguished the perfectly clear ice presenting an appearance of pitchy blackness footnote i learn from a correspondent that certain welsh tarns which are reputed bottomless have this inky hue the green colour of the sea has now to be accounted for and here again let us fall back upon the sure basis of experiment a strong white dinnerplate had a lead weight securely fastened to it fifty or sixty yards of strong hempen line were attached to the plate my assistant thorogood occupied a boat fastened as usual to the davits of the urgent while i occupied a second boat nearer the stern of the ship he cast the plate as a mariner heaves the lead and by the time it reached me it had sunk a considerable depth in the water in all cases the hue of this plate was green even when the sea was of the darkest indigo the green was vivid and pronounced i could notice the gradual deepening of the colour as the plate sank but at its greatest depth even in indigo water the colour was still a bluegreen footnote in no case of course is the green pure but a mixture of green and blue other observations confirmed this one the urgent is a screw steamer and right over the blades of the screw was an orifice called the screwwell through which one could look from the poop down upon the screw the surfaceglimmer which so pesters the eye was here in a great measure removed midway down a plank crossed the screwwell from side to side on this i placed myself and observed the action of the screw underneath the eye was rendered sensitive by the moderation of the light and to remove still further all disturbing causes lieutenant walton had a sail and tarpaulin thrown over the mouth of the well underneath this i perched myself on the plank and watched the screw in an indigo sea the play of colour was indescribably beautiful and the contrast between the water which had the screwblades and that which had the bottom of the ocean as a background was extraordinary the one was of the most brilliant green the other of the deepest ultramarine the surface of the water above the screwblade was always ruffled liquid lenses were thus formed by which the coloured light was withdrawn from some places and concentrated upon others the water flashing with metallic lustre the screwblades in this case played the part of the dinnerplate in the former case and there were other instances of a similar kind the white bellies of porpoises showed the green hue varying in intensity as the creatures swung to and fro between the surface and the deeper water foam at a certain depth below the surface was also green in a rough sea the light which penetrated the summit of a wave sometimes reached the eye a beautiful green cap being thus placed upon the wave even in indigo water but how is this colour to be connected with the suspended particles thus take the dinnerplate which showed so brilliant a green when thrown into indigo water suppose it to diminish in size until it reaches an almost microscopic magnitude it would still behave substantially as the larger plate sending to the eye its modicum of green light if the plate instead of being a large coherent mass were ground to a powder sufficiently fine and in this condition diffused through the clear seawater it would also send green light to the eye in fact the suspended particles which the home examination reveals act in all essential particulars like the plate or like the screwblades or like the foam or like the bellies of the porpoises thus i think the greenness of the sea is physically connected with the matter which it holds in suspension we reached portsmouth on january 5 1871 then ended a voyage which though its main object was not realised has left behind it pleasant memories both of the aspects of nature and the kindliness of men vii niagara footnote a discourse delivered at the royal institution of great britain april 4 1873 it is one of the disadvantages of reading books about natural scenery that they fill the mind with pictures often exaggerated often distorted often blurred and even when well drawn injurious to the freshness of first impressions such has been the fate of most of us with regard to the falls of niagara there was little accuracy in the estimates of the first observers of the cataract startled by an exhibition of power so novel and so grand emotion leaped beyond the control of the judgment and gave currency to notions which have often led to disappointment a record of a voyage in 1535 by a french mariner named jacques cartier contains it is said the first printed allusion to niagara in 1603 the first map of the district was constructed by a frenchman named champlain in 1648 the jesuit rageneau in a letter to his superior at paris mentions niagara as a cataract of frightful height footnote from an interesting little book presented to me at brooklyn by its author mr holly some of these data are derived hennepin kalm bakewell lyell hall and others i have myself consulted in the winter of 1678 and 1679 the cataract was visited by father hennepin and described in a book dedicated to the king of great britain he gives a drawing of the waterfall which shows that serious changes have taken place since his time he describes it as a great and prodigious cadence of water to which the universe does not offer a parallel the height of the fall according to hennepin was more than 600 feet the waters he says which fall from this great precipice do foam and boil in the most astonishing manner making a noise more terrible than that of thunder when the wind blows to the south its frightful roaring may be heard for more than fifteen leagues the baron la hontan who visited niagara in 1687 makes the height 800 feet in 1721 charlevois in a letter to madame de maintenon after referring to the exaggerations of his predecessors thus states the result of his own observations for my part after examining it on all sides i am inclined to think that we cannot allow it less than 140 or 150 feeta remarkably close estimate at that time viz a hundred and fifty years ago it had the shape of a horseshoe and reasons will subsequently be given for holding that this has been always the form of the cataract from its origin to its present site as regards the noise of the fall charlevois declares the accounts of his predecessors which i may say are repeated to the present hour to be altogether extravagant he is perfectly right the thunders of niagara are formidable enough to those who really seek them at the base of the horseshoe fall but on the banks of the river and particularly above the fall its silence rather than its noise is surprising this arises in part from the lack of resonance the surrounding country being flat and therefore furnishing no echoing surfaces to reinforce the shock of the water the resonance from the surrounding rocks causes the swiss reuss at the devils bridge when full to thunder more loudly than the niagara on friday november 1 1872 just before reaching the village of niagara falls i caught from the railway train my first glimpse of the smoke of the cataract immediately after my arrival i went with a friend to the northern end of the american fall it may be that my mood at the time toned down the impression produced by the first aspect of this grand cascade but i felt nothing like disappointment knowing from old experience that time and close acquaintanceship the gradual interweaving of mind and nature must powerfully influence my final estimate of the scene after dinner we crossed to goat island and turning to the right reached the southern end of the american fall the river is here studded with small islands crossing a wooden bridge to luna island and clasping a tree which grows near its edge i looked long at the cataract which here shoots down the precipice like an avalanche of foam it grew in power and beauty the channel spanned by the wooden bridge was deep and the river there doubled over the edge of the precipice like the swell of a muscle unbroken the ledge here overhangs the water being poured out far beyond the base of the precipice a space called the cave of the winds is thus enclosed between the wall of rock and the falling water goat island ends in a sheer dry precipice which connects the american and horseshoe falls midway between both is a wooden hut the residence of the guide to the cave of the winds and from the hut a winding staircase called biddles stair descends to the base of the precipice on the evening of my arrival i went down this stair and wandered along the bottom of the cliff one wellknown factor in the formation and retreat of the cataract was immediately observed a thick layer of limestone formed the upper portion of the cliff this rested upon a bed of soft shale which extended round the base of the cataract the violent recoil of the water against this yielding substance crumbles it away undermining the ledge above which unsupported eventually breaks off and produces the observed recession at the southern extremity of the horseshoe is a promontory formed by the doubling back of the gorge excavated by the cataract and into which it plunges on the promontory stands a stone building called the terrapin tower the door of which had been nailed up because of the decay of the staircase within it through the kindness of mr townsend the superintendent of goat island the door was opened for me from this tower at all hours of the day and at some hours of the night i watched and listened to the horseshoe fall the river here is evidently much deeper than the american branch and instead of bursting into foam where it quits the ledge it bends solidly over and falls in a continuous layer of the most vivid green the tint is not uniform long stripes of deeper hue alternating with bands of brighter colour close to the ledge over which the water rolls foam is generated the light falling upon which and flashing back from it is sifted in its passage to and fro and changed from white to emeraldgreen heaps of superficial foam are also formed at intervals along the ledge and are immediately drawn into long white striae footnote the direction of the wind with reference to the course of a ship may be inferred with accuracy from the foamstreaks on the surface of the sea lower down the surface shaken by the reaction from below incessantly rustles into whiteness the descent finally resolves itself into a rhythm the water reaching the bottom of the fall in periodic gushes nor is the spray uniformly diffused through the air but is wafted through it in successive veils of gauzelike texture from all this it is evident that beauty is not absent from the horseshoe fall but majesty is its chief attribute the plunge of the water is not wild but deliberate vast and fascinating from the terrapin tower the adjacent arm of the horseshoe is seen projected against the opposite one midway down to the imagination therefore is left the picturing of the gulf into which the cataract plunges the delight which natural scenery produces in some minds is difficult to explain and the conduct which it prompts can hardly be fairly criticised by those who have never experienced it it seems to me a deduction from the completeness of the celebrated thomas young that he was unable to appreciate natural scenery he had really says dean peacock no taste for life in the country he was one of those who thought that no one who was able to live in london would be content to live elsewhere well dr young like dr johnson had a right to his delights but i can understand a hesitation to accept them high as they were to the exclusion of that oerflowing joy which nature yields to her true lovers to all who are of this mind the strengthening of desire on my part to see and know niagara falls as far as it is possible for them to be seen and known will be intelligible on the first evening of my visit i met at the head of biddles stair the guide to the cave of the winds he was in the prime of manhoodlarge well built firm and pleasant in mouth and eye my interest in the scene stirred up his and made him communicative turning to a photograph he described by reference to it a feat which he had accomplished some time previously and which had brought him almost under the green water of the horseshoe fall can you lead me there tomorrow i asked he eyed me enquiringly weighing perhaps the chances of a man of light build and with grey in his whiskers in such an undertaking i wish i added to see as much of the fall as can be seen and where you lead i will endeavour to follow his scrutiny relaxed into a smile and he said very well i shall be ready for you tomorrow on the morrow accordingly i came in the hut at the head of biddles stair i stripped wholly and redressed according to instructionsdrawing on two pairs of woollen pantaloons three woollen jackets two pairs of socks and a pair of felt shoes even if wet my guide assured me that the clothes would keep me from being chilled and he was right a suit and hood of yellow oilcloth covered all most laudable precautions were taken by the young assistant who helped to dress me to keep the water out but his devices broke down immediately when severely tested we descended the stair the handle of a pitchfork doing in my case the duty of an alpenstock at the bottom the guide enquired whether we should go first to the cave of the winds or to the horseshoe remarking that the latter would try us most i decided on getting the roughest done first and he turned to the left over the stones they were sharp and trying the base of the first portion of the cataract is covered with huge boulders obviously the ruins of the limestone ledge above the water does not distribute itself uniformly among these but seeks out channels through which it pours torrentially we passed some of these with wetted feet but without difficulty at length we came to the side of a more formidable current my guide walked along its edge until he reached its least turbulent portion halting he said this is our greatest difficulty if we can cross here we shall get far towards the horseshoe he waded in it evidently required all his strength to steady him the water rose above his loins and it foamed still higher he had to search for footing amid unseen boulders against which the torrent rose violently he struggled and swayed but he struggled successfully and finally reached the shallower water at the other side stretching out his arm he said to me now come on i looked down the torrent as it rushed to the river below which was seething with the tumult of the cataract de saussure recommended the inspection of alpine dangers with the view of making them familiar to the eye before they are encountered and it is a wholesome custom in places of difficulty to put the possibility of an accident clearly before the mind and to decide beforehand what ought to be done should the accident occur thus wound up in the present instance i entered the water even where it was not more than kneedeep its power was manifest as it rose around me i sought to split the torrent by presenting a side to it but the insecurity of the footing enabled it to grasp my loins twist me fairly round and bring its impetus to bear upon my back further struggle was impossible and feeling my balance hopelessly gone i turned flung myself towards the bank just quitted and was instantly as expected swept into shallower water the oilcloth covering was a great incumbrance it had been made for a much stouter man and standing upright after my submersion my legs occupied the centre of two bags of water my guide exhorted me to try again prudence was at my elbow whispering dissuasion but taking everything into account it appeared more immoral to retreat than to proceed instructed by the first misadventure i once more entered the stream had the alpenstock been of iron it might have helped me but as it was the tendency of the water to sweep it out of my hands rendered it worse than useless i however clung to it by habit again the torrent rose and again i wavered but by keeping the left hip well against it i remained upright and at length grasped the hand of my leader at the other side he laughed pleasantly the first victory was gained and he enjoyed it no traveller he said was ever here before soon afterwards by trusting to a piece of driftwood which seemed firm i was again taken off my feet but was immediately caught by a protruding rock we clambered over the boulders towards the thickest spray which soon became so weighty as to cause us to stagger under its shock for the most part nothing could be seen we were in the midst of bewildering tumult lashed by the water which sounded at times like the cracking of innumerable whips underneath this was the deep resonant roar of the cataract i tried to shield my eyes with my hands and look upwards but the defence was useless the guide continued to move on but at a certain place he halted desiring me to take shelter in his lee and observe the cataract the spray did not come so much from the upper ledge as from the rebound of the shattered water when it struck the bottom hence the eyes could be protected from the blinding shock of the spray while the line of vision to the upper ledges remained to some extent clear on looking upwards over the guides shoulder i could see the water bending over the ledge while the terrapin tower loomed fitfully through the intermittent spraygusts we were right under the tower a little farther on the cataract after its first plunge hit a protuberance some way down and flew from it in a prodigious burst of spray through this we staggered we rounded the promontory on which the terrapin tower stands and moved amid the wildest commotion along the arm of the horsehoe until the boulders failed us and the cataract fell into the profound gorge of the niagara river here the guide sheltered me again and desired me to look up i did so and could see as before the green gleam of the mighty curve sweeping over the uipper ledge and the fitful plunge of the water as the spray between us and it alternately gathered and disappeared an eminent friend of mine often speaks of the mistake of those physicians who regard mans ailments as purely chemical to be met by chemical remedies only he contends for the psychological element of cure by agreeable emotions he says nervous currents are liberated which stimulate blood brain and viscera the influence rained from ladies eyes enables my friend to thrive on dishes which would kill him if eaten alone a sanative effect of the same order i experienced amid the spray and thunder of niagara quickened by the emotions there aroused the blood sped exultingly through the arteries abolishing introspection clearing the heart of all bitterness and enabling one to think with tolerance if not with tenderness on the most relentless and unreasonable foe apart from its scientific value and purely as a moral agent the play was worth the candle my companion knew no more of me than that i enjoyed the wildness of the scene but as i bent in the shelter of his large frame he said i should like to see you attempting to describe all this he rightly thought it indescribable the name of this gallant fellow was thomas conroy we returned clambering at intervals up and down so as to catch glimpses of the most impressive portions of the cataract we passed under ledges formed by tabular masses of limestone and through some curious openings formed by the falling together of the summits of the rocks at length we found ourselves beside our enemy of the morning conroy halted for a minute or two scanning the torrent thoughtfully i said that as a guide he ought to have a rope in such a place but he retorted that as no traveller had ever thought of coming there he did not see the necessity of keeping a rope he waded in the struggle to keep himself erect was evident enough he swayed but recovered himself again and again at length he slipped gave way did as i had done threw himself towards the bank and was swept into the shallows standing in the stream near its edge he stretched his arm towards me i retained the pitchfork handle for it had been useful among the boulders by wading some way in the staff could be made to reach him and i proposed his seizing it if you are sure he replied that in case of giving way you can maintain your grasp then i will certainly hold you remarking that he might count on this i waded in and stretched the staff to my companion it was firmly grasped by both of us thus helped though its onset was strong i moved safely across the torrent all danger ended here we afterwards roamed sociably among the torrents and boulders below the cave of the winds the rocks were covered with organic slime which could not have been walked over with bare feet but the felt shoes effectually prevented slipping we reached the cave and entered it first by a wooden way carried over the boulders and then along a narrow ledge to the point eaten deepest into the shale when the wind is from the south the falling water i am told can be seen tranquilly from this spot but when we were there a blinding hurricane of spray was whirled against us on the evening of the same day i went behind the water on the canada side which after the experiences of the morning struck me as an imposture still even this latter is exciting to some nerves its effect upon himself is thus vividly described by bakewell jun on turning a sharp angle of the rock a sudden gust of wind met us coming from the hollow between the fall and the rock which drove the spray directly in our faces with such force that in an instant we were wet through when in the midst of this showerbath the shock took away my breath i turned back and scrambled over the loose stones to escape the conflict the guide soon followed and told me that i had passed the worst part with that assurance i made a second attempt but so wild and disordered was my imagination that when i had reached half way i could bear it no longer footnote mag of nat hist 1830 pp 121 122 to complete my knowledge i desired to see the fall from the river below it and long negotiations were necessary to secure the means of doing so the only boat fit for the undertaking had been laid up for the winter but this difficulty through the kind intervention of mr townsend was overcome the main one was to secure oarsmen sufficiently strong and skilful to urge the boat where i wished it to be taken the son of the owner of the boat a finelybuilt young fellow but only twenty and therefore not sufficiently hardened was willing to go and up the river it was stated there lived another man who could do anything with the boat which strength and daring could accomplish he came his figure and expression of face certainly indicated extraordinary firmness and power on tuesday november 5 we started each of us being clad in oilcloth the elder oarsman at once assumed a tone of authority over his companion and struck immediately in amid the breakers below the american fall he hugged the cross freshets instead of striking out into the smoother water i asked him why he did so and he replied that they were directed outwards not downwards the struggle however to prevent the bow of the boat from being turned by them was often very severe the spray was in general blinding but at times it disappeared and yielded noble views of the fall the edge of the cataract is crimped by indentations which exalt its beauty here and there a little below the highest ledge a secondary one juts out the water strikes it and bursts from it in huge protuberant masses of foam and spray we passed goat island came to the horseshoe and worked for a time along its base the boulders over which conroy and myself had scrambled a few days previously lying between us and the cataract a rock was before us concealed and revealed at intervals as the waves passed over it our leader tried to get above this rock first on the outside of it the water however was here in violent motion the men struggled fiercely the older one ringing out an incessant peal of command and exhortation to the younger as we were just clearing the rock the bow came obliquely to the surge the boat was turned suddenly round and shot with astonishing rapidity down the river the men returned to the charge now trying to get up between the halfconcealed rock and the boulders to the left but the torrent set in strongly through this channel the tugging was quick and violent but we made little way at length seizing a rope the principal oarsman made a desperate attempt to get upon one of the boulders hoping to be able to drag the boat through the channel but it bumped so violently against the rock that the man flung himself back and relinquished the attempt we returned along the base of the american fall running in and out among the currents which rushed from it laterally into the river seen from below the american fall is certainly exquisitely beautiful but it is a mere frill of adornment to its nobler neighbour the horseshoe at times we took to the river from the centre of which the horseshoe fall appeared especially magnificent a streak of cloud across the neck of mont blanc can double its apparent height so here the green summit of the cataract shining above the smoke of spray appeared lifted to an extraordinary elevation had hennepin and la hontan seen the fall from this position their estimates of the height would have been perfectly excusable from a point a little way below the american fall a ferry crosses the river in summer to the canadian side below the ferry is a suspension bridge for carriages and footpassengers and a mile or two lower down is the railway suspension bridge between ferry and bridge the river niagara flows unruffled but at the suspension bridge the bed steepens and the river quickens its motion lower down the gorge narrows and the rapidity and turbulence increase at the place called the whirlpool rapids i estimated the width of the river at 300 feet an estimate confirmed by the dwellers on the spot when it is remembered that the drainage of nearly half a continent is compressed into this space the impetuosity of the rivers rush may be imagined had it not been for mr bierstdt the distinguished photographer of niagara i should have quitted the place without seeing these rapids for this and for his agreeable company to the spot i have to thank him from the edge of the cliff above the rapids we descended a little i confess to a climbers disgust in an elevator because the effects are best seen from the water level two kinds of motion are here obviously active a motion of translation and a motion of undulationthe race of the river through its gorge and the great waves generated by its collision with and rebound from the obstacles in its way in the middle of the river the rush and tossing are most violent at all events the impetuous force of the individual waves is here most strikingly displayed vast pyramidal heaps leap incessantly from the river some of them with such energy as to jerk their summits into the air where they hang momentarily suspended in crowds of liquid spherules the sun shone for a few minutes at times the wind coming up the river searched and sifted the spray carrying away the lighter drops and leaving the heavier ones behind wafted in the proper direction rainbows appeared and disappeared fitfully in the lighter mist in other directions the common gleam of the sunshine from the waves and their shattered crests was exquisitely beautiful the complexity of the action was still further illustrated by the fact that in some cases as if by the exercise of a local explosive force the drops were shot radially from a particular centre forming around it a kind of halo the first impression and indeed the current explanation of these rapids is that the central bed of the river is cumbered with large boulders and that the jostling tossing and wild leaping of the water there are due to its impact against these obstacles i doubt this explanation at all events there is another sufficient reason to be taken into account boulders derived from the adjacent cliffs visibly cumber the sides of the river against these the water rises and sinks rhythmically but violently large waves being thus produced on the generation of each wave there is an immediate compounding of the wavemotion with he rivermotion the ridges which in still water would proceed in circular curves round the centre of disturbance cross the river obliquely and the result is that at the centre waves commingle which have really been generated at the sides in the first instance we had a composition of wavemotion with rivermotion here we have the coalescence of waves with waves where crest and furrow cross each other the motion is annulled where furrow and furrow cross the river is ploughed to a greater depth and where crest and crest aid each other we have that astonishing leap of the water which breaks the cohesion of the crests and tosses them shattered into the air from the water level the cause of the action is not so easily seen but from the summit of the cliff the lateral generation of the waves and their propagation to the perfectly obvious if this explanation be correct the phenomena observed at the whirlpool rapids form one of the grandest illustrations of the principle of interference the nile cataract mr huxley informs me offers more moderate examples of the same action at some distance below the whirlpool rapids we have the celebrated whirlpool itself here the river makes a sudden bend to the northeast forming nearly a right angle with its previous direction the water strikes the concave bank with great force and scoops it incessantly away a vast basin has been thus formed in which the sweep of the river prolongs itself in gyratory currents bodies and trees which have come over the falls are stated to circulate here for days without finding the outlet from various points of the cliffs above this is curiously hidden the rush of the river into the whirlpool is obvious enough and though you imagine the outlet must be visible if one existed you cannot find it turning however round the bend of the precipice to the northeast the outlet comes into view the niagara season was over the chatter of sightseers had ceased and the scene presented itself as one of holy seclusion and beauty i went down to the rivers edge where the weird loneliness seemed to increase the basin is enclosed by high and almost precipitous bankscovered at the time with russet woods a kind of mystery attaches itself to gyrating water due perhaps to the fact that we are to some extent ignorant of the direction of its force it is said that at certain points of the whirlpool pinetrees are sucked down to be ejected mysteriously elsewhere the water is of the brightest emeraldgreen the gorge through which it escapes is narrow and the motion of the river swift though silent the surface is steeply inclined but it is perfectly unbroken there are no lateral waves no ripples with their breaking bubbles to raise a murmur while the depth is here too great to allow the inequality of the bed to ruffle the surface nothing can be more beautiful than this sloping liquid mirror formed by the niagara in sliding from the whirlpool the green colour is i think correctly accounted for in the last fragment while crossing the atlantic in 187273 i had frequent opportunities of testing the explanation there given looked properly down upon there are portions of the ocean to which we should hardly ascribe a trace of blue at the most a mere hint of indigo reaches the eye the water indeed is practically black and this is an indication both of its depth and of its freedom from mechanically suspended matter in small thicknesses water is sensibly transparent to all kinds of light but as the thickness increases the rays of low refrangibility are first absorbed and after them the other rays where therefore the water is very deep and very pure all the colours are absorbed and such water ought to appear black as no light is sent from its interior to the eye the approximation of the atlantic ocean to this condition is an indication of its extreme purity throw a white pebble into such water as it sinks it becomes greener and greener and before it disappears it reaches a vivid bluegreen break such a pebble into fragments each of these will behave like the unbroken mass grind the pebble to powder every particle will yield its modicum of green and if the particles be so fine as to remain suspended in the water the scattered light will be a uniform green hence the greenness of shoal water you go to bed with the black atlantic around you you rise in the morning find it a vivid green and correctly infer that you are crossing the bank of newfoundland such water is found charged with fine matter in a state of mechanical suspension the light from the bottom may sometimes come into play but it is not necessary a storm can render the water muddy by rendering the particles too numerous and gross such a case occurred towards the close of my visit to niagara there had been rain and storm in the upper lakeregions and the quantity of suspended matter brought down quite extinguished the fascinating green of the horseshoe nothing can be more superb than the green of the atlantic waves when the circumstances are favourable to the exhibition of the colour as long as a wave remains unbroken no colour appears but when the foam just doubles over the crest like an alpine snowcornice under the cornice we often see a display of the most exquisite green it is metallic in its brilliancy but the foam is necessary to its production the foam is first illuminated and it scatters the light in all directions the light which passes through the higher portion of the wave alone reaches the eye and gives to that portion its matchless colour the folding of the wave producing as it does a series of longitudinal protuberances and furrows which act like cylindrical lenses introduces variations in the intensity of the light and materially enhances its beauty we have now to consider the genesis and proximate destiny of the falls of niagara we may open our way to this subject by a few preliminary remarks upon erosion time and intensity are the main factors of geologic change and they are in a certain sense convertible a feeble force acting through long periods and an intense force acting through short ones may produce approximately the same results to dr hooker i have been indebted for some specimens of stones the first examples of which were picked up by mr hackworth on the shores of lyells bay near wellington in new zealand they were described by mr travers in the transactions of the new zealand institute unacquainted with their origin you would certainly ascribe their forms to human workmanship they resemble knives and spearheads being apparently chiselled off into facets with as much attention to symmetry as if a tool guided by human intelligence had passed over them but no human instrument has been brought to bear upon these stones they have been wrought into their present shape by the windblown sand of lyells bay two winds are dominant here and they in succession urged the sand against opposite sides of the stone every little particle of sand chipped away its infinitesimal bit of stone and in the end sculptured these singular forms footnote these stones which have a strong resemblance to works of human art occur in great abundance and of various sizes from halfaninch to several inches in length a large number were exhibited showing the various forms which are those of wedges knives arrowheads c and all with sharp cutting edges mr travers explained that notwithstanding their artificial appearance these stones were formed by the cutting action of the winddriven sand as it passed to and fro over an exposed boulderbank he gave a minute account of the manner in which the varieties of form are produced and referred to the effect which the erosive action thus indicated would have on railway and other works executed on sandy tracts dr hector stated that although as a group the specimens on the table could not well be mistaken for artificial productions still the forms are so peculiar and the edges in a few of them so perfect that if they were discovered associated with human works there is no doubt that they would have been referred to the socalled stone periodextracted from the minutes of the wellington philosophical society february 9 1869 the sphynx of egypt is nearly covered up by the sand of the desert the neck of the sphynx is partly cut across not as i am assured by mr huxley by ordinary weathering but by the eroding action of the fine sand blown against it in these cases nature furnishes us with hints which may be taken advantage of in art and this action of sand has been recently turned to extraordinary account in the united states when in boston i was taken by my courteous and helpful friend mr josiah quincey to see the action of the sandblast a kind of hopper containing fine silicious sand was connected with a reservoir of compressed air the pressure being variable at pleasure the hopper ended in a long slit from which the sand was blown a plate of glass was placed beneath this slit and caused to pass slowly under it it came out perfectly depolished with a bright opalescent glimmer such as could only be produced by the most careful grinding every little particle of sand urged against the glass having all its energy concentrated on the point of impact formed there a little pit the depolished surface consisting of innumerable hollows of this description but this was not all by protecting certain portions of the surface and exposing others figures and tracery of any required form could be etched upon the glass the figures of open ironwork could be thus copied while wiregauze placed over the glass produced a reticulated pattern but it required no such resisting substance as iron to shelter the glass the patterns of the finest lace could be thus reproduced the delicate filaments of the lace itself offering a sufficient protection all these effects have been obtained with a simple model of the sandblast devised by my assistant a fraction of a minute suffices to etch upon glass a rich and beautiful lace pattern any yielding substance may be employed to protect the glass by diffusing the shock of the particle such substances practically destroy the local erosive power the hand can bear without inconvenience a sandshower which would pulverise glass etchings executed on glass with suitable kinds of ink are accurately worked out by the sandblast in fact within certain limits the harder the surface the greater is the concentration of the shock and the more effectual is the erosion it is not necessary that the sand should be the harder substance of the two corundum for example is much harder than quartz still quartzsand can not only depolish but actually blow a hole through a plate of corundum nay glass may be depolished by the impact of fine shot the grains in this case bruising the glass before they have time to flatten and turn their energy into heat and here in passing we may tie together one or two apparently unrelated facts supposing you turn on at the lower part of a house a cock which is fed by a pipe from a cistern at the top of the house the column of water from the cistern downwards is set in motion by turning off the cock this motion is stopped and when the turning off is very sudden the pipe if not strong may be burst by the internal impact of the water by distributing the turning of the cock over half a second of time the shock and danger of rupture may be entirely avoided we have here an example of the concentration of energy in time the sandblast illustrates the concentration of energy in space the action of flint and steel is an illustration of the same principle the heat required to generate the spark is intense and the mechanical action being moderate must to produce fire be in the highest degree concentrated this concentration is secured by the collision of hard substances calcspar will not supply the place of flint nor lead the place of steel in the production of fire by collision with the softer substances the total heat produced may be greater than with the hard ones but to produce the spark the heat must be intensely localised we can however go far beyond the mere depolishing of glass indeed i have already said that quartzsand can wear a hole through corundum this leads me to express my acknowledgments to general tilghman who is the inventor of the sandblast footnote the absorbent power if i may use the phrase exerted by the industrial arts in the united states is forcibly illustrated by the rapid transfer of men like mr tilghman from the life of the soldier to that of the civilian general mcclellan now a civil engineer whom i had the honour of frequently meeting in new york is a most eminent example of the same kind at the end of the war indeed a million and a half of men were thus drawn in an astonishingly short time from military to civil life to his spontaneous kindness i am indebted for some beautiful illustrations of his process in one thick plate of glass a figure has been worked out to a depth of three eighths of an inch a second plate seven eighths of an inch thick is entirely perforated in a circular plate of marble nearly half an inch thick open work of most intricate and elaborate description has been executed it would probably take many days to perform this work by any ordinary process with the sandblast it was accomplished in an hour so much for the strength of the blast its delicacy is illustrated by this beautiful example of line engraving etched on glass by means of the blast this power of erosion so strikingly displayed when sand is urged by air renders us better able to conceive its action when urged by water the erosive power of a river is vastly augmented by the solid matter carried along with it sand or pebbles caught in a river vortex can wear away the hardest rock potholes and deep cylindrical shafts being thus produced an extraordinary instance of this kind of erosion is to be seen in the val tournanche above the village of this name the gorge at handeck has been thus cut out such waterfalls were once frequent in the valleys of switzerland for hardly any valley is without one or more transverse barriers of resisting material over which the river flowing through the valley once fell as a cataract near pontresina in the engadin there is such a case a hard gneiss being there worn away to form a gorge through which the river from the morteratsch glacier rushes the barrier of the kirchet above meyringen is also a case in point behind it was a lake derived from the glacier of the aar and over the barrier the lake poured its excess of water here the rock being limestone was in part dissolved but added to this we had the action of the sand and gravel carried along by the water which on striking the rock chipped it away like the particles of the sandblast thus by solution and mechanical erosion the great chasm of the finsteraarschlucht was formed it is demonstrable that the water which flows at the bottoms of such deep fissures once flowed at the level of their present edges and tumbled down the lower faces of the barriers almost every valley in switzerland furnishes examples of this kind the untenable hypothesis of earthquakes once so readily resorted to in accounting for these gorges being now for the most part abandoned to produce the canons of western america no other cause is needed than the integration of effects individually infinitesimal and now we come to niagara soon after europeans had taken possession of the country the conviction appears to have arisen that the deep channel of the river niagara below the falls had been excavated by the cataract in mr bakewells introduction to geology the prevalence of this belief has been referred to it is expressed thus by professor joseph henry in the transactions of the albany institute footnote quoted by bakewell in viewing the position of the falls and the features of the country round it is impossible not to be impressed with the idea that this great natural raceway has been formed by the continued action of the irresistible niagara and that the falls beginning at lewiston have in the course of ages worn back the rocky strata to their present site the same view is advocated by sir charles lyell by mr hall by m agassiz by professor ramsay indeed by most of those who have inspected the place a connected image of the origin and progress of the cataract is easily obtained walking northward from the village of niagara falls by the side of the river we have to our left the deep and comparatively narrow gorge through which the niagara flows the bounding cliffs of this gorge are from 300 to 350 feet high we reach the whirlpool trend to the northeast and after a little time gradually resume our northward course finally at about seven miles from the present falls we come to the edge of a declivity which informs us that we have been hitherto walking on tableland at some hundreds of feet below us is a comparatively level plain which stretches to lake ontario the declivity marks the end of the precipitous gorge of the niagara here the river escapes from its steep mural boundaries and in a widened bed pursues its way to the lake which finally receives its waters the fact that in historic times even within the memory of man the fall has sensibly receded prompts the question how far has this recession gone at what point did the ledge which thus continually creeps backwards begin its retrograde course to minds disciplined in such researches the answer has been and will beat the precipitous declivity which crossed the niagara from lewiston on the american to queenston on the canadian side over this transverse barrier the united affluents of all the upper lakes once poured their waters and here the work of erosion began the dam moreover was demonstrably of sufficient height to cause the river above it to submerge goat island and this would perfectly account for the finding by sir charles lyell mr hall and others in the sand and gravel of the island the same fluviatile shells as are now found in the niagara river higher up it would also account for those deposits along the sides of the river the discovery of which enabled lyell hall and ramsay to reduce to demonstration the popular belief that the niagara once flowed through a shallow valley the physics of the problem of excavation which i made clear to my mind before quitting niagara are revealed by a close inspection of the present horseshoe fall we see evidently that the greatest weight of water bends over the very apex of the horseshoe in a passage in his excellent chapter on niagara falls mr hall alludes to this fact here we have the most copious and the most violent whirling of the shattered liquid here the most powerful eddies recoil against the shale from this portion of the fall indeed the spray sometimes rises without solution of continuity to the region of clouds becoming gradually more attenuated and passing finally through the condition of true cloud into invisible vapour which is sometimes reprecipitated higher up all the phenomena point distinctly to the centre of the river as the place of greatest mechanical energy and from the centre the vigour of the fall gradually dies away towards the sides the horseshoe form with the concavity facing downwards is an obvious and necessary consequence of this action right along the middle of the river the apex of the curve pushes its way backwards cutting along the centre a deep and comparatively narrow groove and draining the sides as it passes them footnote in the discourse the excavation of the centre and drainage of the sides action was illustrated by a model devised by my assistant mr john cottrell hence the remarkable discrepancy between the widths of the niagara above and below the horseshoe all along its course from lewiston heights to its present position the form of the fall was probably that of a horseshoe for this is merely the expression of the greater depth and consequently greater excavating power of the centre of the river the gorge moreover varies in width as the depth of the centre of the ancient river varied being narrowest where that depth was greatest the vast comparative erosive energy of the horseshoe fall comes strikingly into view when it and the american fall are compared together the american branch of the river is cut at a right angle by the gorge of the niagara here the horseshoe fall was the real excavator it cut the rock and formed the precipice over which the american fall tumbles but since its formation the erosive action of the american fall has been almost nil while the horseshoe has cut its way for 600 yards across the end of goat island and is now doubling back to excavate its channel parallel to the length of the island this point which impressed me forcibly has not i have just learned escaped the acute observation of professor ramsay footnote his words are where the body of water is small in the american fall the edge has only receded a few yards where most eroded during the time that the canadian fall has receded from the north corner of goat island to the innermost curve of the horseshoe fallquarterly journal of geological society may 1859 the river bends the horseshoe immediately accommodates itself to the bending and will follow implicitly the direction of the deepest water in the upper stream the flexures of the gorge are determined by those of the river channel above it were the niagara centre above the fall sinuous the gorge would obediently follow its sinuosities once suggested no doubt geographers will be able to point out many examples of this action the zambesi is thought to present a great difficulty to the erosion theory because of the sinuosity of the chasm below the victoria falls but assuming the basalt to be of tolerably uniform texture had the river been examined before the formation of this sinuous channel the present zigzag course of the gorge below the fall could i am persuaded have been predicted while the sounding of the present river would enable us to predict the course to be pursued by the erosion in the future but not only has the niagara river cut the gorge it has carried away the chips of its own workshop the shale being probably crumbled is easily carried away but at the base of the fall we find the huge boulders already described and by some means or other these are removed down the river the ice which fills the gorge in winter and which grapples with the boulders has been regarded as the transporting agent probably it is so to some extent but erosion acts without ceasing on the abutting points of the boulders thus withdrawing their support and urging them gradually down the river solution also does its portion of the work that solid matter is carried down is proved by the difference of depth between the niagara river and lake ontario where the river enters it the depth falls from 72 feet to 20 feet in consequence of the deposition of solid matter caused by the diminished motion of the river footnote near the mouth of the gorge at queenston the depth according to the admiralty chart is 180 feet well within the gorge it is 132 feet the annexed highly instructive map has been reduced from one published in mr halls geology of new york it is based on surveys executed in 1842 by messrs gibson and evershed the ragged edge of the american fall north of goat island marks the amount of erosion which it has been able to accomplish while the horseshoe fall was cutting its way southward across the end of goat island to its present position the american fall is 168 feet high a precipice cut down not by itself but by the horseshoe fall the latter in 1842 was 159 feet high and as shown by the map is already turning eastward to excavate its gorge along the centre of the upper river p is the apex of the horseshoe and t marks the site of the terrapin tower with the promontory adjacent round which i was conducted by conroy probably since 1842 the horseshoe has worked back beyond the position here assigned to it in conclusion we may say a word regarding the proximate future of niagara at the rate of excavation assigned to it by sir charles lyell namely a foot a year five thousand years or so will carry the horseshoe fall far higher than goat island as the gorge recedes it will drain as it has hitherto done the banks right and left of it thus leaving a nearly level terrace between goat island and the edge of the gorge higher up it will totally drain the american branch of the river the channel of which in due time will become cultivable land the american fall will then be transformed into a dry precipice forming a simple continuation of the cliffy boundary of the niagara gorge at the place occupied by the fall at this moment we shall have the gorge enclosing a right angle a second whirlpool being the consequence to those who visit niagara a few millenniums hence i leave the verification of this prediction all that can be said is that if the causes now in action continue to act it will prove itself literally true fig 6 postscript a year or so after i had quitted the united states a man sixty years of age while engaged in painting one of the bridges which connect goat island with the three sisters slipped through the rails of the bridge into the rapids and was carried impetuously towards the horseshoe fall he was urged against a rock which rose above the water and with the grasp of desperation he clung to it the population of the village of niagara falls was soon upon the island and ropes were brought but there was none to use them in the midst of the excitement a tall powerful young fellow was observed making his way silently through the crowd he reached a rope selected from the bystanders a number of men and placed one end of the rope in their hands the other end he fastened round himself and choosing a point considerably above that to which the man clung he plunged into the rapids he was carried violently downwards but he caught the rock secured the old painter and saved him newspapers from all parts of the union poured in upon me describing this gallant act of my guide conroy viii the parallel roads of glen roy footnote a discourse delivered at the royal institution of great britain on june 9 1876 the first published allusion to the parallel roads of glen roy occurs in the appendix to the third volume of pennants tour in scotland a work published in 1776 in the face of these hills says this writer both sides of the glen there are three roads at small distances from each other and directly opposite on each side these roads have been measured in the complete parts of them and found to be 26 paces of a man 5 feet 10 inches high the two highest are pretty near each other about 50 yards and the lowest double that distance from the nearest to it they are carried along the sides of the glen with the utmost regularity nearly as exact as drawn with a line of rule and compass the correct heights of the three roads of glen roy are respectively 1150 1070 and 860 feet above the sea hence a vertical distance of 80 feet separates the two highest while the lowest road is 210 feet below the middle one these roads are usually shelves or terraces formed in the yielding drift which here covers the slopes of the mountains they are all sensibly horizontal and therefore parallel pennant accepted as reasonable the explanation of them given by the country people in his time they thought that the roads were designed for the chase and that the terraces were made after the spots were cleared in lines from wood in order to tempt the animals into the open paths after they were rouzed in order that they might come within reach of the bowmen who might conceal themselves in the woods above and below in these attempts of the country people we have an illustration of that impulse to which all scientific knowledge is duethe desire to know the causes of things and it is a matter of surprise that in the case of the parallel roads with their weird appearance challenging enquiry this impulse did not make itself more rapidly and energetically felt their remoteness may perhaps account for the fact that until the year 1817 no systematic description of them and no scientific attempt at an explanation of them appeared in that year dr macculloch who was then president of the geological society presented to that society a memoir in which the roads were discussed and pronounced to be the margins of lakes once embosomed in glen roy why there should be three roads or why the lakes should stand at these particular levels was left unexplained to dr macculloch succeeded a man possibly not so learned as a geologist but obviously fitted by nature to grapple with her facts and to put them in their proper setting i refer to sir thomas dicklauder who presented to the royal society of edinburgh on the 2nd of march 1818 his paper on the parallel roads of glen roy in looking over the literature of this subject which is now copious it is interesting to observe the differentiation of minds and to single out those who went by a kind of instinct to the core of the question from those who erred in it or who learnedly occupied themselves with its analogies adjuncts and details there is no man in my opinion connected with the history of the subject who has shown in relation to it this spirit of penetration this force of scientific insight more conspicuously than sir thomas dicklauder two distinct mental processes are involved in the treatment of such a question firstly the faithful and sufficient observation of the data and secondly that higher mental process in which the constructive imagination comes into play connecting the separate facts of observation with their common cause and weaving them into an organic whole in neither of these requirements did sir thomas dicklauder fail adjacent to glen roy is a valley called glen gluoy along the sides of which ran a single shelf or terrace formed obviously in the same manner as the parallel roads of glen roy the two shelves on the opposing sides of the glen were at precisely the same level and dicklauder wished to see whether and how they became united at the head of the glen he followed the shelves into the recesses of the mountains the bottom of the valley as it rose came ever nearer to them until finally at the head of glen gluoy he reached a col or watershed of precisely the same elevation as the road which swept round the glen the correct height of this col is 1170 feet above the sea that is to say 20 feet above the highest road in glen roy from this col a lateral branchvalleyglen turritled down to glen roy our explorer descended from the col to the highest road of the latter glen and pursued it exactly as he had pursued the road in glen gluoy for a time it belted the mountain sides at a considerable height above the bottom of the valley but this rose as he proceeded coming ever nearer to the highest shelf until finally he reached a col or watershed looking into glen spey and of precisely the same elevation as the highest road of glen roy he then dropped down to the lowest of these roads and followed it towards the mouth of the glen its elevation above the bottom of the valley gradually increased not because the shelf rose but because it remained level while the valley sloped downwards he found this lowest road doubling round the hills at the mouth of glen roy and running along the sides of the mountains which flank glen spean he followed it eastwards parallel roads of glen roy after a sketch by sir thomas dicklauder the bottom of the spean valley like the others gradually rose and therefore gradually approached the road on the adjacent mountainside he came to loch laggan the surface of which rose almost to the level of the road and beyond the head of this lake he found as in the other two cases a col or watershed at makul of exactly the same level as the single road in glen spean which it will be remembered is a continuation of the lowest road in glen roy here we have a series of facts of obvious significance as regards the solution of this problem the effort of the mind to form a coherent image from such facts may be compared with the effort of the eyes to cause the pictures of a stereoscope to coalesce for a time we exercise a certain strain the object remaining vague and indistinct suddenly its various parts seem to run together the object starting forth in clear and definite relief such i take it was the effect of his ponderings upon the mind of sir thomas dicklauder his solution was this taking all their features into account he was convinced that water only could have produced the terraces but how had the water been collected he saw clearly that supposing the mouth of glen gluoy to be stopped by a barrier sufficiently high if the waters from the mountains flanking the glen were allowed to collect they would form behind the barrier a lake the surface of which would gradually rise until it reached the level of the col at the head of the glen the rising would then cease the superfluous water of glen gluoy discharging itself over the col into glen roy as long as the barrier stopping the mouth of glen gluoy continued high enough we should have in that glen a lake at the precise level of its shelf which lake acting upon the loose drift of the flanking mountains would form the shelf revealed by observation so much for glen gluoy but suppose the mouth of glen roy also stopped by a similar barrier behind it also the water from the adjacent mountains would collect the surface of the lake thus formed would gradually rise until it had reached the level of the col which divides glen roy from glen spey here the rising of the lake would cease its superabundant water being poured over the col into the valley of the spey this state of things would continue as long as a sufficiently high barrier remained at the mouth of glen roy the lake thus dammed in with its surface at the level of the highest parallel road would act as in glen gluoy upon the friable drift overspreading the mountains and would form the highest road or terrace of glen roy and now let us suppose the barrier to be so far removed from the mouth of glen roy as to establish a connection between it and the upper part of glen spean while the lower part of the latter glen still continued to be blocked up upper glen spean and glen roy would then be occupied by a continuous lake the level of which would obviously be determined by the col at the head of loch laggan the water in glen roy would sink from the level it had previously maintained to the level of its new place of escape this new lakesurface would correspond exactly with the lowest parallel road and it would form that road by its action upon the drift of the adjacent mountains in presence of the observed facts this solution commends itself strongly to the scientific mind the question next occurs what was the character of the assumed barrier which stopped the glens there are at the present moment vast masses of detritus in certain portions of glen spean and of such detritus sir thomas dicklauder imagined his barriers to have been formed by some unknown convulsion this detritus had been heaped up but once given and once granted that it was subsequently removed in the manner indicated the single road of glen gluoy and the highest and lowest roads of glen roy would be explained in a satisfactory manner to account for the second or middle road of glen roy sir thomas dicklauder invoked a new agency he supposed that at a certain point in the breaking down or waste of his dam a halt occurred the barrier holding its ground at a particular level sufficiently long to dam a lake rising to the height of and forming the second road this point of weakness was at once detected by mr darwin and adduced by him as proving that the levels of the cols did not constitute an essential feature in the phenomena of the parallel roads though not destroyed sir thomas dicklauders theory was seriously shaken by this argument and it became a point of capital importance if the facts permitted to remove such source of weakness this was done in 1847 by mr david milne now mr milnehome on walking up glen roy from roy bridge we pass the mouth of a lateral glen called glen glaster running eastward from glen roy there is nothing in this lateral glen to attract attention or to suggest that it could have any conspicuous influence in the production of the parallel roads hence probably the failure of sir thomas dicklauder to notice it but mr milnehome entered this glen on the northern side of which the middle and lowest roads are fairly shown the principal stream running through the glen turns at a certain point northwards and loses itself among hills too high to offer any outlet but another branch of the glen turns to the southeast and following up this branch mr milnehome reached a col or watershed of the precise level of the second glen roy road when the barrier blocking the glens had been so far removed as to open this col the water in glen roy would sink to the level of the second road a new lake of diminished depth would be thus formed the surplus water of which would escape over the glen glaster col into glen spean the margin of this new lake acting upon the detrital matter would form the second road the theory of sir thomas dicklauder as regards the part played by the cols was reriveted by this new and unexpected discovery i have referred to mr darwin whose powerful mind swayed for a time the convictions of the scientific world in relation to this question his notion wasand it is a notion which very naturally presents itselfthat the parallel roads were formed by the sea that this whole region was once submerged and subsequently upheaved that there were pauses in the process of upheaval during which these glens constituted so many fiords on the sides of which the parallel terraces were formed this theory will not bear close criticism nor is it now maintained by mr darwin himself it would not account for the sea being 20 feet higher in glen gluoy than in glen roy it would not account for the absence of the second and third glen roy roads from glen gluoy where the mountain flanks are quite as impressionable as in glen roy it would not account for the absence of the shelves from the other mountains in the neighbourhood all of which would have been clasped by the sea had the sea been there here then and no doubt elsewhere mr darwin has shown himself to be fallible but here as elsewhere he has shown himself equal to that discipline of surrender to evidence which girds his intellect with such unassailable moral strength but granting the significance of sir thomas dicklauders facts and the reasonableness on the whole of the views which he has founded on them they will not bear examination in detail no such barriers of detritus as he assumed could have existed without leaving traces behind them but there is no trace left there is detritus enough in glen spean but not where it is wanted the two highest parallel roads stop abruptly at different points near the mouth of glen roy but no remnant of the barrier against which they abutted is to be seen it might be urged that the subsequent invasion of the valley by glaciers has swept the detritus away but there have been no glaciers in these valleys since the disappearance of the lakes professor geikie has favoured me with a drawing of the glen spean road near the entrance to glen trieg the road forms a shelf round a great mound of detritus which had a glacier followed the formation of the shelf must have been cleared away taking all the circumstances into account you may i think with safety dismiss the detrital barrier as incompetent to account for the present condition of glen gluoy and glen roy hypotheses in science though apparently transcending experience are in reality experience modified by scientific thought and pushed into an ultra experiential region at the time that he wrote sir thomas dicklauder could not possibly have discerned the cause subsequently assigned for the blockage of these glens a knowledge of the action of ancient glaciers was the necessary antecedent to the new explanation and experience of this nature was not possessed by the distinguished writer just mentioned the extension of swiss glaciers far beyond their present limits was first made known by a swiss engineer named venetz who established by the marks they had left behind them their former existence in places which they had long forsaken the subject of glacier extension was subsequently followed up with distinguished success by charpentier studer and others with characteristic vigour agassiz grappled with it extending his observations far beyond the domain of switzerland he came to this country in 1840 and found in various places indubitable marks of ancient glacier action england scotland wales and ireland he proved to have once given birth to glaciers he visited glen roy surveyed the surrounding neighbourhood and pronounced as a consequence of his investigation the barriers which stopped the glens and produced the parallel roads to have been barriers of ice to mr jamieson above all others we are indebted for the thorough testing and confirmation of this theory and let me here say that agassiz is only too likely to be misrated and misjudged by those who though accurate within a limited sphere fail to grasp in their totality the motive powers invoked in scientific investigation true he lacked mechanical precision but he abounded in that force and freshness of the scientific imagination which in some sciences and probably in some stages of all sciences are essential to the creator of knowledge to agassiz was given not the art of the refiner but the instinct of the discoverer and the strength of the delver who brings ore from the recesses of the mine that ore may contain its share of dross but it also contains the precious metal which gives employment to the refiner and without which his occupation would depart let us dwell for a moment upon this subject of ancient glaciers under a flask containing water in which a thermometer is immersed is placed a bunsens lamp the water is heated reaches a temperature of 212 and then begins to boil the rise of the thermometer then ceases although heat continues to be poured by the lamp into the water what becomes of that heat we know that it is consumed in the molecular work of vaporization in the experiment here arranged the steam passes from the flask through a tube into a second vessel kept at a low temperature here it is condensed and indeed congealed to ice the second vessel being plunged in a mixture cold enough to freeze the water as a result of the process we obtain a mass of ice that ice has an origin very antithetical to its own character though cold it is the child of heat if we removed the lamp there would be no steam and if there were no steam there would be no ice the mere cold of the mixture surrounding the second vessel would not produce ice the cold must have the proper material to work upon and this materialaqueous vapouris as we here see the direct product of heat it is now i suppose fifteen or sixteen years since i found myself conversing with an illustrious philosopher regarding that glacial epoch which the researches of agassiz and others had revealed this profoundly thoughtful man maintained the fixed opinion that at a certain stage in the history of the solar system the suns radiation had suffered diminution the glacial epoch being a consequence of this solar chill the celebrated french mathematician poisson had another theory astronomers have shown that the solar system moves through space and the temperature of space is a familiar expression with scientific men it was considered probable by poisson that our system during its motion had traversed portions of space of different temperatures and that during its passage through one of the colder regions of the universe the glacial epoch occurred notions such as these were more or less current everywhere not many years ago and i therefore thought it worth while to show how incomplete they were suppose the temperature of our planet to be reduced by the subsidence of solar heat the cold of space or any other cause say one hundred degrees fourandtwenty hours of such a chill would bring down as snow nearly all the moisture of our atmosphere but this would not produce a glacial epoch such an epoch would require the longcontinued generation of the material from which the ice of glaciers is derived mountain snow the nutriment of glaciers is derived from aqueous vapour raised mainly from the tropical ocean by the sun the solar fire is as necessary a factor in the process as our lamp in the experiment referred to a moment ago nothing is easier than to calculate the exact amount of heat expended by the sun in the production of a glacier it would as i have elsewhere shown footnote heat a mode of motion fifth edition chap vi forms of water sections 55 and 56 raise a quantity of cast iron five times the weight of the glacier not only to a white heat but to its point of fusion if as i have already urged instead of being filled with ice the valleys of the alps were filled with whitehot metal of quintuple the mass of the present glaciers it is the heat and not the cold that would arrest our attention and solicit our explanation the process of glacier making is obviously one of distillation in which the fire of the sun which generates the vapour plays as essential a part as the cold of the mountains which condenses it footnote in lyells excellent principles of geology the remark occurs that several writers have fallen into the strange error of supposing that the glacial period must have been one of higher mean temperature than usual the really strange error was the forgetfulness of the fact that without the heat the substance necessary to the production of glaciers would be wanting it was their ascription to glacier action that first gave the parallel roads of glen roy an interest in my eyes and in 1867 with a view to selfinstruction i made a solitary pilgrimage to the place and explored pretty thoroughly the roads of the principal glen i traced the highest road to the col dividing glen roy from glen spey and thanks to the civility of an ordnance surveyor i was enabled to inspect some of the roads with a theodolite and to satisfy myself regarding the common level of the shelves at opposite sides of the valley as stated by pennant the width of the roads amounts sometimes to more than twenty yards but near the head of glen roy the highest road ceases to have any width for it runs along the face of a rock the effect of the lapping of the water on the more friable portions of the rock being perfectly distinct to this hour my knowledge of the region was however far from complete and nine years had dimmed the memory even of the portion which had been thoroughly examined hence my desire to see the roads once more before venturing to talk to you about them the easter holidays of 1876 were to be devoted to this purpose but at the last moment a telegram from roy bridge informed me that the roads were snowed up finding books and memories poor substitutes for the flavour of facts i resolved subsequently to make another effort to see the roads accordingly last thursday fortnight after lecturing here i packed up and started not this time alone for the north next day at noon my wife and i found ourselves at dalwhinnie whence a drive of some fiveandthirty miles brought us to the excellent hostelry of mr macintosh at the mouth of glen roy we might have found the hills covered with mist which would have wholly defeated us but nature was goodnatured and we had two successful working days among the hills guided by the excellent ordnance map of the region on the saturday morning we went up the glen and on reaching the stream called allt bhreac achaidh faced the hills to the west at the watershed between glen roy and glen fintaig we bore northwards struck the ridge above glen gluoy came in view of its road which we persistently followed as long as it continued visible it is a feature of all the roads that they vanish before reaching the cola over which fell the waters of the lakes which formed them one reason doubtless is that at their upper ends the lakes were shallow and incompetent on this account to raise wavelets of any strength to act upon the mountain drift a second reason is that they were landlocked in the higher portions and protected from the southwesterly winds the stillness of their waters causing them to produce but a feeble impression upon the mountain sides from glen gluoy we passed down glen turrit to glen roy and through it homewards thus accomplishing two or three and twenty miles of rough and honest work next day we thoroughly explored glen glaster following its two roads as far as they were visible we reached the col discovered by mr milnehome which stands at the level of the middle road of glen roy thence we crossed southwards over the mountain creag dhubh and examined the erratic blocks upon its sides and the ridges and mounds of moraine matter which cumber the lower flanks of the mountain the observations of mr jamieson upon this region including the mouth of glen trieg are in the highest degree interesting we entered glen spean and continued a search begun on the evening of our arrival at roy bridgethe search namely for glacier polishings and markings we did not find them copious but they are indubitable one of the proofs most convenient for reference is a great rounded rock by the roadside 1000 yards east of the milestone marked threequarters of a mile from roy bridge farther east other cases occur and they leave no doubt upon the mind that glen spean was at one time filled by a great glacier to the disciplined eye the aspect of the mountains is perfectly conclusive on this point and in no position can the observer more readily and thoroughly convince himself of this than at the head of glen glaster the dominant hills here are all intensely glaciated but the great collecting ground of the glaciers which dammed the glens and produced the parallel roads were the mountains south and west of glen spean the monarch of these is ben nevis 4370 feet high the position of ben nevis and his colleagues in reference to the vapourladen winds of the atlantic is a point of the first importance it is exactly similar to that of carrantual and the macgillicuddy reeks in the southwest of ireland these mountains are and were the first to encounter the southwestern atlantic winds and the precipitation even at present in the neighbourhood of killarney is enormous the winds robbed of their vapour and charged with the heat set free by its precipitation pursue their direction obliquely across ireland and the effect of the drying process may be understood by comparing the rainfall at cahirciveen with that at portarlington as found by dr lloyd the ratio is as 59 to 21fiftynine inches annually at cahirciveen to twentyone at portarlington during the glacial epoch this vapour fell as snow and the consequence was a system of glaciers which have left traces and evidences of the most impressive character in the region of the killarney lakes i have referred in other places to the great glacier which descending from the reeks moved through the black valley took possession of the lakebasins and left its traces on every rock and island emergent from the waters of the upper lake they are all conspicuously glaciated not in switzerland itself do we find clearer traces of ancient glacier action what the macgillicuddy reeks did in ireland ben nevis and the adjacent mountains did and continue to do in scotland we had an example of this on the morning we quitted roy bridge from the bridge westward rain fell copiously and the roads were wet but the precipitation ceased near loch laggan whence eastward the roads were dry measured by the gauge the rainfall fort william is 86 inches while at laggan it is only 46 inches annually the difference between west and east is forcibly brought out by observations at the two ends of the caledonian canal fort william at the southwestern end has as just stated 86 inches while culloden at its northeastern end has only 24 to the researches of that able and accomplished meteorologist mr buchan we are indebted for these and other data of the most interesting and valuable kind adhering to the facts now presented to us it is not difficult to restore in idea the process by which the glaciers of lochaber were produced and the glens dammed by ice when the cold of the glacial epoch began to invade the scottish hills the sun at the same time acting with sufficient power upon the tropical ocean the vapours raised and drifted on to these northern mountains were more and more converted into snow this slid down the slopes and from every valley strath and corry south of glen spean glaciers were poured into that glen the two great factors here brought into play are the nutrition of the glaciers by the frozen material above and their consumption in the milder air below for a period supply exceeded consumption and the ice extended filling glen spean to an everincreasing height and abutting against the mountains to the north of that glen but why it may be asked should the valleys south of glen spean be receptacles of ice at a time when those north of it were receptacles of water the answer is to be found in the position and the greater elevation of the mountains south of glen spean they first received the loads of moisture carried by the atlantic winds and not until they had been in part dried and also warmed by the liberation of their latent heat did these winds touch the hills north of the glen an instructive observation bearing upon this point is here to be noted had our visit been in the winter we should have found all the mountains covered had it been in the summer we should have found the snow all gone but happily it was at a season when the aspect of the mountains north and south of glen spean exhibited their relative powers as snow collectors scanning the former hills from many points of view we were hardly able to detect a fleck of snow while heavy swaths and patches loaded the latter were the glacial epoch to return the relation indicated by this observation would cause glen spean to be filled with glaciers from the south while the hills and valleys on the north visited by warmer and drier winds would remain comparatively free from ice this flow from the south would be reinforced from the west and as long as the supply was in excess of the consumption the glaciers would extend the dams which closed the glens increasing in height byandby supply and consumption becoming approximately equal the height of the glacier barriers would remain constant then as milder weather set in consumption would be in excess a lowering of the barriers and a retreat of the ice being the consequence but for a long time the conflict between supply and consumption would continue retarding indefinitely the disappearance of the barriers and keeping the imprisoned lakes in the northern glens but however slow its retreat the ice in the long run would be forced to yield the dam at the mouth of glen roy which probably entered the glen sufficiently far to block up glen glaster would gradually retreat glen glaster and its col being opened the subsidence of the lake eighty feet from the level of the highest to that of the second parallel road would follow as a consequence i think this the most probable course of things but it is also possible that glen glaster may have been blocked by a glacier from glen trieg the ice dam continuing to retreat at length permitted glen roy to connect itself with upper glen spean a continuous lake then filled both glens the level of which as already explained was determined by the col at makul above the head of loch laggan the last to yield was the portion of the glacier which derived nutrition from ben nevis and probably also from the mountains north and south of loch arkaig but it at length yielded and the waters in the glens resumed the courses which they pursue today for the removal of the ice barriers no cataclysm is to be invoked the gradual melting of the dam would produce the entire series of phenomena in sinking from col to col the water would flow over a gradually melting barrier the surface of the imprisoned lake not remaining sufficiently long at any particular level to produce a shelf comparable to the parallel roads by temporary halts in the process of melting due to atmospheric conditions or to the character of the dam itself or through local softness in the drift small pseudoterraces would be formed which to the perplexity of some observers are seen upon the flanks of the glens today in presence then of the fact that the barriers which stopped these glens to a height it may be of 1500 feet above the bottom of glen spean have dissolved and left not a wreck behind in presence of the fact insisted on by professor geikie that barriers of detritus would undoubtedly have been able to maintain themselves had they ever been there in presence of the fact that great glaciers once most certainly filled these valleysthat the whole region as proved by mr jamieson is filled with the traces of their action the theory which ascribes the parallel roads to lakes dammed by barriers of ice has in my opinion a degree of probability on its side which amounts to a practical demonstration of its truth into the details of the terrace formation i do not enter mr darwin and mr jamieson on the one side and sir john lubbock on the other deal with true causes the terraces no doubt are due in part to the descending drift arrested by the water and in part to the fretting of the wavelets and the rearrangement of the stirred detritus along the belts of contact of lake and bill the descent of matter must have been frequent when the drift was unbound by the rootlets which hold it together now in some cases it may be remarked the visibility of the roads is materially augmented by differences of vegetation the grass upon the terraces is not always of the same character as that above and below them while on heathercovered hills the absence of the dark shrub from the roads greatly enhances their conspicuousness the annexed sketch of a model will enable the reader to grasp the essential features of the problem and its solution glen gluoy and glen roy are lateral valleys which open into glen spean let us suppose glen spean filled from v to w with ice of a uniform elevation of 1500 feet above the sea the ice not filling the upper part of that glen the ice would thrust itself for some distance up the lateral valleys closing all their mouths the streams from the mountains right and left of glen gluoy would pour their waters into that glen forming a lake the level of which would be determined by the height of the col at a 1170 feet above the sea over this col the water would flow into glen roy but in glen roy it could not rise higher than 1150 feet the height of the col at b over which it would flow into glen spey the water halting at these levels for a sufficient time would form the single road in glen gluoy and the highest road in glen roy this state of things would continue as long as the ice dam was sufficiently high to dominate the cols at a and b but when through change of climate the gradually sinking dam reached in succession the levels of these cols the water would then begin to flow over the dam instead of over the cols let us suppose the wasting of the ice to continue until a connection was established between glen roy and glen glaster a common lake would then fill both these glens the level of which would be determined by that of the col c over which the water would pour for an indefinite period into glen spean during this period the second glen roy road and the highest road of glen glaster would be formed the ice subsiding still further a connection would eventually be established between glen roy glen glaster and the upper part of glen spean a common lake would fill all three glens the level of which would be that of the col d over which for an indefinite period the lake would pour its water during this period the lowest glen roy road which is common also to glen glaster and glen spean would be formed finally on the disappearance of the ice from the lower part of glen spean the waters would flow down their respective valleys as they do today fig 7 reviewing our work we find three considerable steps to have marked the solution of the problem of the parallel roads of glen roy the first of these was taken by sir thomas dicklauder the second was the pregnant conception of agassiz regarding glacier action and the third was the testing and verification of this conception by the very thorough researches of mr jamieson no circumstance or incident connected with this discourse gives me greater pleasure than the recognition of the value of these researches they are marked throughout by unflagging industry by novelty and acuteness of observation and by reasoning power of a high and varied kind these pages had been returned for press when i learned that the relation of ben nevis and his colleagues to the vapourladen winds of the atlantic had not escaped mr jamieson to him obviously the exploration of lochaber and the development of the theory of the parallel roads has been a labour of love thus ends our rapid survey of this brief episode in the physical history of the scottish hillsbrief that is to say in comparison with the immeasurable lapses of time through which to produce its varied structure and appearances our planet must have passed in the survey of such a field two things are specially worthy to be taken into accountthe widening of the intellectual horizon and the reaction of expanding knowledge upon the intellectual organ itself at first as in the case of ancient glaciers through sheer want of capacity the mind refuses to take in revealed facts but by degrees the steady contemplation of these facts so strengthens and expands the intellectual powers that where truth once could not find an entrance it eventually finds a home footnote the formation connection successive subsidence and final disappearance of the glacial lakes of lochaber were illustrated in the discourse here reported by the model just described constructed under the supervision of my assistant mr john cottrell glen gluoy with its lake and road and the cataract over its col glen roy and its three roads with their respective cataracts at the head of glen spey glen glaster and glen spean were all represented the successive shiftings of the barriers which were formed of plate glass brought each successive lake and its corresponding road into view while the entire removal of the barriers caused the streams to flow down the glens of the model as they flow down the real glens of today a map of the district with the parallel roads shown in red is annexed literature of the

account for the conformation of the alps two hypotheses have been advanced which may be respectively named the hypothesis of fracture and the hypothesis of erosion the former assumes that the forces by which the mountains were elevated produced fissures in the earths crust and that the valleys of the alps are the tracks of these fissures while the latter maintains that the valleys have been cut out by the action of ice and water the mountains themselves being the residual forms of this grand sculpture i had heard the via mala cited as a conspicuous illustration of the fissure theorythe profound chasm thus named and through which the hinterrhein now flows could it was alleged be nothing else than a crack in the earths crust to the via mala i therefore went in 1864 to instruct myself upon the point in question the gorge commences about a quarter of an hour above tusis and on entering it the first impression certainly is that it must be a fissure this conclusion in my case was modified as i advanced some distance up the gorge i found upon the slopes to my right quantities of rolled stones evidently rounded by wateraction still further up and just before reaching the first bridge which spans the chasm i found more rolled stones associated with sand and gravel through this mass of detritus fortunately a vertical cutting had been made which exhibited a section showing perfect stratification there was no agency in the place to roll these stones and to deposit these alternating layers of sand and pebbles but the river which now rushes some hundreds of feet below them at one period of the via malas history the river must have run at this high level other evidences of wateraction soon revealed themselves from the parapet of the first bridge i could see the solid rock 200 feet above the bed of the river scooped and eroded it is stated in the guidebooks that the river which usually runs along the bottom of the gorge has been known almost to fill it during violent thunderstorms and it may be urged that the marks of erosion which the sides of the chasm exhibit are due to those occasional floods in reply to this it may be stated that even the existence of such floods is not well authenticated and that if the supposition were true it would be an additional argument in favour of the cutting power of the river for if floods operating at rare intervals could thus erode the rock the same agency acting without ceasing upon the rivers bed must certainly be competent to excavate it i proceeded upwards and from a point near another bridge which of them i did not note had a fine view of a portion of the gorge the river here runs at the bottom of a cleft of profound depth but so narrow that it might be leaped across that this cleft must be a crack is the impression first produced but a brief inspection suffices to prove that it has been cut by the river from top to bottom we have the unmistakable marks of erosion this cleft was best seen on looking downwards from a point near the bridge but looking upwards from the bridge itself the evidence of aqueous erosion was equally convincing the character of the erosion depends upon the rock as well as upon the river the action of water upon some rocks is almost purely mechanical they are simply ground away or detached in sensible masses water however in passing over limestone charges itself with carbonate of lime without damage to its transparency the rock is dissolved in the water and the gorges cut by water in such rocks often resemble those cut in the ice of glaciers by glacier streams to the solubility of limestone is probably to be ascribed the fantastic forms which peaks of this rock usually assume and also the grottos and caverns which interpenetrate limestone formations a rock capable of being thus dissolved will expose a smooth surface after the water has quitted it and in the case of the via mala it is the polish of the surfaces and the curved hollows scooped in the sides of the gorge which assure us that the chasm has been the work of the river about four miles from tusis and not far from the little village of zillis the via mala opens into a plain bounded by high terraces it occurred to me the moment i saw it that the plain had been the bed of an ancient lake and a farmer who was my temporary companion immediately informed me that such was the tradition of the neighbourhood this man conversed with intelligence and as i drew his attention to the rolled stones which rest not only above the river but above the road and inferred that the river must once have been there to have rolled those stones he saw the force of the evidence perfectly in fact in former times and subsequent to the retreat of the great glaciers a rocky barrier crossed the valley at this place damming the river which came from the mountains higher up a lake was thus formed which poured its waters over the barrier two actions were here at work both tending to obliterate the lakethe raising of its bed by the deposition of detritus and the cutting of its dam by the river in process of time the cut deepened into the via mala the lake was drained and the river now flows in a definite channel through the plain which its waters once totally covered from tusis i crossed to tiefenkasten by the schien pass and thence over the julier pass to pontresina there are three or four ancient lakebeds between tiefenkasten and the summit of the julier they are all of the same typea more or less broad and level valleybottom with a barrier in front through which the river has cut a passage the drainage of the lake being the consequence these lakes were sometimes dammed by barriers of rock sometimes by the moraines of ancient glaciers an example of this latter kind occurs in the rosegg valley about twenty minutes below the end of the rosegg glacier and about an hour from pontresina the valley here is crossed by a pinecovered moraine of the noblest dimensions in the neighbourhood of london it might be called a mountain that it is a moraine the inspection of it from a point on the surlei slopes above it will convince any person possessing an educated eye where moreover the interior of the mound is exposed it exhibits morainematterdetritus pulverised by the ice with boulders entangled in it it stretched quite across the valley and at one time dammed the river up but now the barrier is cut through the stream having about onefourth of the moraine to its right and the remaining threefourths to its left other moraines of a more resisting character hold their ground as barriers to the present day in the val di campo for example about threequarters of an hour from pisciadello there is a moraine composed of large boulders which interrupt the course of a river and compel the water to fall over them in cascades they have in great part resisted its action since the retreat of the ancient glacier which formed the moraine behind the moraine is a lakebed now converted into a level meadow which rests on a deep layer of mould at pontresina a very fine and instructive gorge is to be seen the river from the morteratsch glacier rushes through a deep and narrow chasm which is spanned at one place by a stone bridge the rock is not of a character to preserve smooth polishing but the larger features of wateraction are perfectly evident from top to bottom those features are in part visible from the bridge but still better from a point a little distance from the bridge in the direction of the upper village of pontresina the hollowing out of the rock by the eddies of the water is here quite manifest a few minutes walk upwards brings us to the end of the gorge and behind it we have the usual indications of an ancient lake and terraces of distinct water origin from this position indeed the genesis of the gorge is clearly revealed after the retreat of the ancient glacier a transverse ridge of comparatively resisting material crossed the valley at this place over the lowest part of this ridge the river flowed rushing steeply down to join at the bottom of the slope the stream which issued from the rosegg glacier on this incline the water became a powerful eroding agent and finally cut the channel to its present depth geological writers of reputation assume at this place the existence of a fissure the washing out of which resulted in the formation of the gorge now no examination of the bed of the river ever proved the existence of this fissure and it is certain that water particularly when charged with solid matter in suspension can cut a channel through unfissured rock cases of deep cutting can be pointed out where the clean bed of the stream is exposed the rock which forms the floor of the river not exhibiting a trace of fissure an example of this kind on a small scale occurs near the bernina gasthaus about two hours from pontresina a little way below the junction of the two streams from the bernina pass and the heuthal the river flows through a channel cut by itself and 20 or 30 feet in depth at some places the riverbed is covered with rolled stones at other places it is bare but shows no trace of fissure the abstract power of water if i may use the term to cut through rock is demonstrated by such instances but if water be competent to form a gorge without the aid of a fissure why assume the existence of such fissures in cases like that at pontresina it seems far more philosophical to accept the simple and impressive history written on the walls of those gorges by the agent which produced them numerous cases might be pointed out varying in magnitude but all identical in kind of barriers which crossed valleys and formed lakes having been cut through by rivers narrow gorges being the consequence one of the most famous examples of this kind is the finsteraarschlucht in the valley of hash here the ridge called the kirchet seems split across and the river aar rushes through the fissure behind the barrier we have the meadows and pastures of imhof resting on the sediment of an ancient lake were this an isolated case one might with an apparent show of reason conclude that the finsteraarschlucht was produced by an earthquake as some suppose it to have been but when we find it to be a single sample of actions which are frequent in the alpswhen probably a hundred cases of the same kind though different in magnitude can be pointed outit seems quite unphilosophical to assume that in each particular case an earthquake was at hand to form a channel for the river as in the case of the barrier at pontresina the kirchet after the retreat of the aar glacier dammed the waters flowing from it thus forming a lake on the bed of which now stands the village of imhof over this barrier the aar tumbled towards meyringen cutting as the centuries passed its bed ever deeper until finally it became deep enough to drain the lake leaving in its place the alluvial plain through which the river now flows in a definite channel in 1866 i subjected the finsteraarschlucht to a close examination the earthquake theory already adverted to was then prevalent regarding it and i wished to see whether any evidences existed of aqueous erosion near the summit of the kirchet is a signboard inviting the traveller to visit the aarenschlucht a narrow lateral gorge which runs down to the very bottom of the principal one the aspect of this smaller chasm from bottom to top proves to demonstration that water had in former ages been there at work it is scooped rounded and polished so as to render palpable to the most careless eye that it is a gorge of erosion but it was regarding the sides of the great chasm that instruction was needed and from its edge nothing to satisfy me could be seen i therefore stripped and waded into the river until a point was reached which commanded an excellent view of both sides of the gorge the water was cutting cold but i was repaid below me on the lefthand side was a jutting cliff which bore the thrust of the river and caused the aar to swerve from its direct course from top to bottom this cliff was polished rounded and scooped there was no room for doubt the river which now runs so deeply down had once been above it has been the delver of its own channel through the barrier of the kirchet but the broad view taken by the advocates of the fracture theory is that the valleys themselves follow the tracks of primeval fissures produced by the upheaval of the land the cracks across the barriers referred to being in reality portions of the great cracks which formed the valleys such an argument however would virtually concede the theory of erosion as applied to the valleys of the alps the narrow gorges often not more than twenty or thirty feet across sometimes even narrower frequently occur at the bottom of broad valleys such fissures might enter into the list of accidents which gave direction to the real erosive agents which scooped the valley out but the formation of the valley as it now exists could no more be ascribed to such cracks than the motion of a railway train could be ascribed to the finger of the engineer which turns on the steam these deep gorges occur i believe for the most part in limestone strata and the effects which the merest driblet of water can produce on limestone are quite astonishing it is not uncommon to meet chasms of considerable depth produced by small streams the beds of which are dry for a large portion of the year right and left of the larger gorges such secondary chasms are often found the idea of time must i think be more and more included in our reasonings on these phenomena happily the marks which the rivers have in most cases left behind them and which refer geologically considered to actions of yesterday give us ground and courage to conceive what may be effected in geologic periods thus the modern portion of the via mala throws light upon the whole near bergn in the valley of the albula there is also a little via mala which is not less significant than the great one the river flows here through a profound limestone gorge and to the very edges of the gorge we have the evidences of erosion but the most striking illustration of wateraction upon limestone rock that i have ever seen is the gorge at pfaeffers here the traveller passes along the side of the chasm midway between top and bottom whichever way he looks backwards or forwards upwards or downwards towards the sky or towards the river he meets everywhere the irresistible and impressive evidence that this wonderful fissure has been sawn through the mountain by the waters of the tamina i have thus far confined myself to the consideration of the gorges formed by the cutting through of the rockbarriers which frequently cross the valleys of the alps as far as they have been examined by me they are the work of erosion but the larger question still remains to what action are we to ascribe the formation of the valleys themselves this question includes that of the formation of the mountainridges for were the valleys wholly filled the ridges would disappear possibly no answer can be given to this question which is not beset with more or less of difficulty special localities might be found which would seem to contradict every solution which refers the conformation of the alps to the operation of a single cause still the alps present features of a character sufficiently definite to bring the question of their origin within the sphere of close reasoning that they were in whole or in part once beneath the sea will not be disputed for they are in great part composed of sedimentary rocks which required a sea to form them their present elevation above the sea is due to one of those local changes in the shape of the earth which have been of frequent occurrence throughout geologic time in some cases depressing the land and in others causing the seabottom to protrude beyond its surface considering the inelastic character of its materials the protuberance of the alps could hardly have been pushed out without dislocation and fracture and this conclusion gains in probability when we consider the foldings contortions and even reversals in position of the strata in many parts of the alps such changes in the position of beds which were once horizontal could not have been effected without dislocation fissures would be produced by these changes and such fissures the advocates of the fracture theory contend mark the positions of the valleys of the alps imagination is necessary to the man of science and we could not reason on our present subject without the power of presenting mentally a picture of the earths crust cracked and fissured by the forces which produced its upheaval imagination however must be strictly checked by reason and by observation that fractures occurred cannot i think be doubted but that the valleys of the alps are thus formed is a conclusion not at all involved in the admission of dislocations i never met with a precise statement of the manner in which the advocates of the fissure theory suppose the forces to have actedwhether they assume a general elevation of the region or a local elevation of distinct ridges or whether they assume local subsidences after a general elevation or whether they would superpose upon the general upheaval minor and local upheavals in the absence of any distinct statement i will assume the elevation to be generalthat a swelling out of the earths crust occurred here sufficient to place the most prominent portions of the protuberance three miles above the sealevel to fix the ideas let us consider a circular portion of the crust say one hundred miles in diameter and let us suppose in the first instance the circumference of this circle to remain fixed and that the elevation was confined to the space within it the upheaval would throw the crust into a state of strain and if it were inflexible the strain must be relieved by fracture crevasses would thus intersect the crust let us now enquire what proportion the area of these open fissures is likely to bear to the area of the unfissured crust an approximate answer is all that is here required for the problem is of such a character as to render minute precision unnecessary no one i think would affirm that the area of the fissures would be onehundredth the area of the land for let us consider the strain upon a single line drawn over the summit of the protuberance from a point on its rim to a point opposite regarding the protuberance as a spherical swelling the length of the arc corresponding to a chord of 100 miles and a versed sine of 3 miles is 10024 miles consequently the surface to reach its new position must stretch 024 of a mile or be broken a fissure or a number of cracks with this total width would relieve the strain that is to say the sum of the widths of all the cracks over the length of 100 miles would be 420 yards if instead of comparing the width of the fissures with the length of the lines of tension we compared their areas with the area of the unfissured land we should of course find the proportion much less these considerations will help the imagination to realise what a small ratio the area of the open fissures must bear to the unfissured crust they enable us to say for example that to assume the area of the fissures to be onetenth of the area of the land would be quite absurd while that the area of the fissures could be onehalf or more than onehalf that of the land would be in a proportionate degree unthinkable if we suppose the elevation to be due to the shrinking or subsidence of the land all round our assumed circle we arrive equally at the conclusion that the area of the open fissures would be altogether insignificant as compared with that of the unfissured crust to those who have seen them from a commanding elevation it is needless to say that the alps themselves bear no sort of resemblance to the picture which this theory presents to us instead of deep cracks with approximately vertical walls we have ridges running into peaks and gradually sloping to form valleys instead of a fissured crust we have a state of things closely resembling the surface of the ocean when agitated by a storm the valleys instead of being much narrower than the ridges occupy the greater space a plaster cast of the alps turned upside down so as to invert the elevations and depressions would exhibit blunter and broader mountains with narrower valleys between them than the present ones the valleys that exist cannot i think with any correctness of language be called fissures it may be urged that they originated in fissures but even this is unproved and were it proved the fissures would still play the subordinate part of giving direction to the agents which are to be regarded as the real sculptors of the alps the fracture theory then if it regards the elevation of the alps as due to the operation of a force acting throughout the entire region is in my opinion utterly incompetent to account for the conformation of the country if on the other hand we are compelled to resort to local disturbances the manipulation of the earths crust necessary to obtain the valleys and the mountains will i imagine bring the difficulties of the theory into very strong relief indeed an examination of the region from many of the more accessible eminencesfrom the galenstock the grauhaupt the pitz languard the monte confinaleor better still from mont blanc monte rosa the jungfrau the finsteraarhorn the weisshorn or the matterhorn where local peculiarities are toned down and the operations of the powers which really made this region what it is are alone brought into prominencemust i imagine convince every physical geologist of the inability of any fracture theory to account for the present conformation of the alps a correct model of the mountains with an unexaggerated vertical scale produces the same effect upon the mind as the prospect from one of the highest peaks we are apt to be influenced by local phenomena which though insignificant in view of the general question of alpine conformation are with reference to our customary standards vast and impressive in a true model those local peculiarities disappear for on the scale of a model they are too small to be visible while the essential facts and forms are presented to the undistracted attention a minute analysis of the phenomena strengthens the conviction which the general aspect of the alps fixes in the mind we find for example numerous valleys which the most ardent plutonist would not think of ascribing to any other agency than erosion that such is their genesis and history is as certain as that erosion produced the chines in the isle of wight from these indubitable cases of erosioncommencing if necessary with the small ravines which run down the flanks of the ridges with their little working navigators at their bottomswe can proceed by almost insensible gradations to the largest valleys of the alps and it would perplex the plutonist to fix upon the point at which fracture begins to play a material part in ascending one of the larger valleys we enter it where it is wide and where the eminences are gentle on either side the flanking mountains become higher and more abrupt as we ascend and at length we reach a place where the depth of the valley is a maximum continuing our walk upwards we find ourselves flanked by gentler slopes and finally emerge from the valley and reach the summit of an open col or depression in the chain of mountains this is the common character of the large valleys crossing the col we descend along the opposite slope of the chain and through the same series of appearances in the reverse order if the valleys on both sides of the col were produced by fissures what prevents the fissure from prolonging itself across the col the case here cited is representative and i am not acquainted with a single instance in the alps where the chain has been cracked in the manner indicated the cols are simply depressions in many of which the unfissured rock can be traced from side to side the typical instance just sketched follows as a natural consequence from the theory of erosion before either ice or water can exert great power as an erosive agent it must collect in sufficient mass on the higher slopes and plateausin the region of colsthe power is not fully developed but lower down tributaries unite erosion is carried on with increased vigour and the excavation gradually reaches a maximum lower still the elevations diminish and the slopes become more gentle the cutting power gradually relaxes until finally the eroding agent quits the mountains altogether and the grand effects which it produced in the earlier portions of its course entirely disappear i have hitherto confined myself to the consideration of the broad question of the erosion theory as compared with the fracture theory and all that i have been able to observe and think with reference to the subject leads me to adopt the former under the term erosion i include the action of water of ice and of the atmosphere including frost and rain water and ice however are the principal agents and which of these two has produced the greatest effect it is perhaps impossible to say two years ago i wrote a brief note on the conformation of the alps footnote phil mag vol xxiv p 169 in which i ascribed the paramount influence to glaciers the facts on which that opinion was founded are i think unassailable but whether the conclusion then announced fairly follows from the facts is i confess an open question the arguments which have been thus far urged against the conclusion are not convincing indeed the idea of glacier erosion appears so daring to some minds that its boldness alone is deemed its sufficient refutation it is however to be remembered that a precisely similar position was taken up by many excellent workers when the question of ancient glacier extension was first mooted the idea was considered too hardy to be entertained and the evidences of glacial action were sought to be explained by reference to almost any process rather than the true one let those who so wisely took the side of boldness in that discussion beware lest they place themselves with reference to the question of glacier erosion in the position formerly occupied by their opponents looking at the little glaciers of the present daymere pigmies as compared to the giants of the glacial epochwe find that from every one of them issues a river more or less voluminous charged with the matter which the ice has rubbed from the rocks where the rocks are soft the amount of this finely pulverised matter suspended in the water is very great the water for example of the river which flows from santa catarina to bormio is thick with it the rhine is charged with this matter and by it has so silted up the lake of constance as to abolish it for a large fraction of its length the rhone is charged with it and tens of thousands of acres of cultivable land are formed by the silt above the lake of geneva in the case of every glacier we have two agents at workthe ice exerting a crushing force on every point of its bed which bears its weight and either rasping this point into powder or tearing it bodily from the rock to which it belongs while the water which everywhere circulates upon the bed of the glacier continually washes the detritus away and leaves the rock clean for further abrasion confining the action of glaciers to the simple rubbing away of the rocks and allowing them sufficient time to act it is not a matter of opinion but a physical certainty that they will scoop out valleys but the glacier does more than abrade rocks are not homogeneous they are intersected by joints and places of weakness which divide them into virtually detached masses a glacier is undoubtedly competent to root such masses bodily away indeed the mere priori consideration of the subject proves the competence of a glacier to deepen its bed taking the case of a glacier 1000 feet deep and some of the older ones were probably three times this depth and allowing 40 feet of ice to an atmosphere we find that on every square inch of its bed such a glacier presses with a weight of 375 lbs and on every square yard of its bed with a weight of 486000 lbs with a vertical pressure of this amount the glacier is urged down its valley by the pressure from behind we can hardly i think deny to such a tool a power of excavation the retardation of a glacier by its bed has been referred to as proving its impotence as an erosive agent but this very retardation is in some measure an expression of the magnitude of the erosive energy either the bed must give way or the ice must slide over itself we get indeed some idea of the crushing pressure which the moving glacier exercises against its bedfrom the fact that the resistance and the effort to overcome it are such as to make the upper layers of a glacier move bodily over the lower onesa portion only of the total motion being due to the progress of the entire mass of the glacier down its valley the sudden bend in the valley of the rhone at martigny has also been regarded as conclusive evidence against the theory of erosion why it has been asked i did not the glacier of the rhone go straight forward instead of making this awkward bend but if the valley be a crack why did the crack make this bend the crack i submit had at least as much reason to prolong itself in a straight line as the glacier had a statement of sir john herschel with reference to another matter is perfectly applicable here a crack once produced has a tendency to runfor this plain reason that at its momentary limit at the point at which it has just arrived the divellent force on the molecules there situated is counteracted only by half of the cohesive force which acted when there was no crack viz the cohesion of the uncracked portion alone proc roy soc vol xii p 678 to account then for the bend the adherent of the fracture theory must assume the existence of some accident which turned the crack at right angles to itself and he surely will permit the adherent of the erosion theory to make a similar assumption the influence of small accidents on the direction of rivers is beautifully illustrated in glacier streams which are made to cut either straight or sinuous channels by causes apparently of the most trivial character in his interesting paper on the lakes of switzerland m studer also refers to the bend of the rhine at sargans in proof that the river must there follow a preexisting fissure i made a special expedition to the place in 1864 and though it was plain that m studer had good grounds for the selection of this spot i was unable to arrive at his conclusion as to the necessity of a fissure again in the interesting volume recently published by the swiss alpine club m desor informs us that the swiss naturalists who met last year at samaden visited the end of the morteratsch glacier and there convinced themselves that a glacier had no tendency whatever to imbed itself in the soil i scarcely think that the question of glacier erosion as applied either to lakes or valleys is to be disposed of so easily let me record here my experience of the morteratsch glacier i took with me in 1864 a theodolite to pontresina and while there had to congratulate myself on the aid of my friend mr hirst who in 1857 did such good service upon the mer de glace and its tributaries we set out three lines across the morteratsch glacier one of which crossed the icestream near the wellknown hut of the painter georgei while the two others were staked out the one above the hut and the other below it calling the highest line a the line which crossed the glacier at the hut b and the lowest line c the following are the mean hourly motions of the three lines deduced from observations which extended over several days on each line eleven stakes were fixed which are designated by the figures 1 2 3 c in the tables morteratsch glacier line a no of stake hourly motion 1 035 inch 2 049 inch 3 053 inch 4 054 inch 5 056 inch 6 054 inch 7 052 inch 8 049 inch 9 040 inch

edge of the glacier and the ice was thin at the place hence its slow motion crevasses prevented us from carrying the line sufficiently far across to render the retardation of the further side of the glacier fully evident morteratsch glacier line c no of stake hourly motion 1 005 inch 2 009 inch 3 018 inch 4 020 inch 5 025 inch 6 027 inch 7 027 inch 8 030 inch 9 021 inch 10 020 inch 11 016 inch comparing the three lines together it will be observed that the velocity diminishes as we descend the glacier in 100 hours the maximum motion of three lines respectively is as follows maximum motion in 100 hours line a 56 inches line b 45 inches line c 30 inches this deportment explains an appearance which must strike every observer who looks upon the morteratsch from the piz languard or from the new bernina road a medial moraine runs along the glacier commencing as a narrow streak but towards the end the moraine extending in width until finally it quite covers the terminal portion of the glacier the cause of this is revealed by the foregoing measurements which prove that a stone on the moraine where it is crossed by the line a approaches a second stone on the moraine where it is crossed by the line c with a velocity of twentysix inches per one hundred hours the moraine is in a state of longitudinal compression its materials are more and more squeezed together and they must consequently move laterally and render the moraine at the terminal portion of the glacier wider than above the motion of the morteratsch glacier then diminishes as we descend the maximum motion of the third line is thirty inches in one hundred hours or seven inches a daya very slow motion and had we run a line nearer to the end of the glacier the motion would have been slower still at the end itself it is nearly insensible footnote the snout of the aletsch glacier has a diurnal motion of less than two inches while a mile or so above the snout the velocity is eighteen inches the spreading out of the moraine is here very striking now i submit that this is not the place to seek for the scooping power of a glacier the opinion appears to be prevalent that it is the snout of a glacier that must act the part of ploughshare and it is certainly an erroneous opinion the scooping power will exert itself most where the weight and the motion are greatest a glaciers snout often rests upon matter which has been scooped from the glaciers bed higher up i therefore do not think that the inspection of what the end of a glacier does or does not accomplish can decide this question the snout of a glacier is potent to remove anything against which it can fairly abut and this power notwithstanding the slowness of the motion manifests itself at the end of the morteratsch glacier a hillock bearing pinetrees was in front of the glacier when mr hirst and myself inspected its end and this hillock is being bodily removed by the thrust of the ice several of the trees are overturned and in a few years if the glacier continues its reputed advance the mound will certainly be ploughed away the question of alpine conformation stands i think thus we have in the first place great valleys such as those of the rhine and the rhone which we might conveniently call valleys of the first order the mountains which flank these main valleys are also cut by lateral valleys running into the main ones and which may be called valleys of the second order when these latter are examined smaller valleys are found running into them which may be called valleys of the third order smaller ravines and depressions again join the latter which may be called valleys of the fourth order and so on until we reach streaks and cuttings so minute as not to merit the name of valleys at all at the bottom of every valley we have a stream diminishing in magnitude as the order of the valley ascends carving the earth and carrying its materials to lower levels we find that the larger valleys have been filled for untold ages by glaciers of enormous dimensions always moving grinding down and tearing away the rocks over which they passed we have moreover on the plains at the feet of the mountains and in enormous quantities the very matter derived from the sculpture of the mountains themselves the plains of italy and switzerland are cumbered by the dbris of the alps the lower wider and more level valleys are also filled to unknown depths with the materials derived from the higher ones in the vast quantities of morainematter which cumber many even of the higher valleys we have also suggestions as to the magnitude of the erosion which has taken place this morainematter moreover can only in small part have been derived from the falling of rocks upon the ancient glacier it is in great part derived from the grinding and the ploughingout of the glacier itself this accounts for the magnitude of many of the ancient moraines which date from a period when almost all the mountains were covered with ice and snow and when consequently the quantity of morainematter derived from the naked crests cannot have been considerable the erosion theory ascribes the formation of alpine valleys to the agencies here briefly referred to it invokes nothing but true causes its artificers are still there though it may be in diminished strength and if they are granted sufficient time it is demonstrable that they are competent to produce the effects ascribed to them and what does the fracture theory offer in comparison from no possible application of this theory pure and simple can we obtain the slopes and forms of the mountains erosion must in the long run be invoked and its power therefore conceded the fracture theory infers from the disturbances of the alps the existence of fissures and this is a probable inference but that they were of a magnitude sufficient to produce the conformation of the alps and that they followed as the alpine valleys do the lines of natural drainage of the country are assumptions which do not appear to me to be justified either by reason or by observation there is a grandeur in the secular integration of small effects implied by the theory of erosion almost superior to that involved in the idea of a cataclysm think of the ages which must have been consumed in the execution of this colossal sculpture the question may of course be pushed further think of the ages which the molten earth required for its consolidation but these vaster epochs lack sublimity through our inability to grasp them they bewilder us but they fail to make a solemn impression the genesis of the mountains comes more within the scope of the intellect and the majesty of the operation is enhanced by our partial ability to conceive it in the falling of a rock from a mountainhead in the shoot of an avalanche in the plunge of a cataract we often see more impressive illustrations of the power of gravity than in the motions of the stars when the intellect has to intervene and calculation is necessary to the building up of the conception the expansion of the feelings ceases to be proportional to the magnitude of the phenomena i will here record a few other measurements executed on the rosegg glacier the line was staked out across the trunk formed by the junction of the rosegg proper with the tschierva glacier a short distance below the rocky promontory

amounts to seven inches a day crevasses prevented us from continuing the line quite across the glacier x recent experiments on fogsignals footnote a discourse delivered in the royal institution march 22 1878 the care of its sailors is one of the first duties of a maritime people and one of the sailors greatest dangers is his proximity to the coast at night hence the idea of warning him of such proximity by beaconfires placed sometimes on natural eminences and sometimes on towers built expressly for the purpose close to dover castle for example stands an ancient pharos of this description as our marine increased greater skill was invoked and lamps reinforced by parabolic reflectors poured their light upon the sea several of these lamps were sometimes grouped together so as to intensify the light which at a little distance appeared as if it emanated from a single source this catoptric form of apparatus is still to some extent employed in our lighthouseservice but for a long time past it has been more and more displaced by the great lenses devised by the illustrious frenchman fresnel in a firstclass dioptric apparatus the light emanates from a lamp with several concentric wicks the flame of which being kindled by a very active draught attains to great intensity in fixed lights the lenses refract the rays issuing from the lamp so as to cause them to form a luminous sheet which grazes the seahorizon in revolving lights the lenses gather up the rays into distinct beams resembling the spokes of a wheel which sweep over the sea and strike the eye of the mariner in succession it is not for clear weather that the greatest strengthening of the light is intended for here it is not needed nor is it for densely foggy weather for here it is ineffectual but it is for the intermediate stages of hazy snowy or rainy weather in which a powerful light can assert itself while a feeble one is extinguished the usual firstorder lamp is one of four wicks but mr douglass the able and indefatigable engineer of the trinity house has recently raised the number of the wicks to six which produce a very noble flame to mr wigham of dublin we are indebted for the successful application of gas to lighthouse illumination in some lighthouses his power varies from 28 jets to 108 jets while in the lighthouse of galley head three burners of the largest size can be employed the maximum number of jets being 324 these larger powers are invoked only in case of fog the 28jet burner being amply sufficient for clear weather the passage from the small burner to the large and from the large burner to the small is made with ease rapidity and certainty this employment of gas is indigenous to ireland and the board of trade has exercised a wise liberality in allowing every facility to mr wigham for the development of his invention the last great agent employed in lighthouse illumination is electricity it was in this institution beginning in 1831 that faraday proved the existence and illustrated the laws of those induced currents which in our day have received such astounding development in relation to this subject faradays words have a prophetic ring i have rather he writes in 1831 been desirous of discovering new facts and new relations dependent on magnetoelectric induction than of exalting the force of those already obtained being assured that the latter would find their full development hereafter the labours of holmes of the paris alliance company of wilde and of gramme constitute a brilliant fulfilment of this prediction but as regards the augmentation of power the greatest step hitherto made was independently taken a few years ago by dr werner siemens and sir charles wheatstone through the application of their discovery a machine endowed with an infinitesimal charge of magnetism may by a process of accumulation at compound interest be caused so to enrich itself magnetically as to cast by its performance all the older machines into the shade the light now before you is that of a small machine placed downstairs and worked there by a minute steamengine it is a light of about 1000 candles and for it and for the steamengine that works it our members are indebted to the liberality of dr william siemens who in the most generous manner has presented the machine to this institution after an exhaustive trial at the south foreland machines on the principle of siemens but of far greater power than this one have been recently chosen by the elder brethren of the trinity house for the two lighthouses at the lizard point our most intense lights including the sixwick lamp the wigham gaslight and the electric light being intended to aid the mariner in heavy weather may be regarded in a certain sense as fogsignals but fog when thick is intractable to light the sun cannot penetrate it much less any terrestrial source of illumination hence the necessity of employing soundsignals in dense fogs bells gongs horns whistles guns and syrens have been used for this purpose but it is mainly if not wholly with explosive signals that we have now to deal the gun has been employed with useful effect at the north stack near holyhead on the kish bank near dublin at lundy island and at other points on our coasts during the long laborious and i venture to think memorable series of observations conducted under the auspices of the elder brethren of the trinity house at the south foreland in 1872 and 1873 it was proved that a short 55inch howitzer firing 3 lbs of powder yielded a louder report than a long 18pounder firing the same charge here was a hint to be acted on by the elder brethren the effectiveness of the sound depended on the shape of the gun and as it could not be assumed that in the howitzer we had hit accidentally upon the best possible shape arrangements were made with the war office for the construction of a gun specially calculated to produce the loudest sound attainable from the combustion of 3 lbs of powder to prevent the unnecessary landward waste of the sound the gun was furnished with a parabolic muzzle intended to project the sound over the sea where it was most needed the construction of this gun was based on a searching series of experiments executed at woolwich with small models provided with muzzles of various kinds a drawing of the gun is annexed p 309 it was constructed on the principle of the revolver its various chambers being loaded and brought in rapid succession into the firing position the performance of the gun proved the correctness of the principles on which its construction was based an incidental point of some interest was decided by the earliest woolwich experiments it had been a widely spread opinion among artillerists that a bronze gun produces a specially loud report i doubted from the outset whether this would help us and in a letter dated 22nd april 1874 i ventured to express myself thus the report of a gun as affecting an observer close at hand is made up of two factorsthe sound due to the shock of the air by the violently expanding gas and the sound derived from the vibrations of the gun which to some extent rings like a bell this latter i apprehend will disappear at considerable distances fig 8 breechloading fogsignal gun with bell mouth proposed by major maitland ra assistant superintendent footnote the carriage of this gun has been modified in construction since this drawing was made the result of subsequent trial as reported by general campbell is that the sonorous qualities of bronze are greatly superior to those of cast iron at short distances but that the advantage lies with the baser metal at long ranges footnote general campbell assigns a true cause for this difference the ring of the bronze gun represents so much energy withdrawn from the explosive force of the gunpowder further experiments would however be needed to place the superiority of the castiron gun at a distance beyond question coincident with these trials of guns at woolwich guncotton was thought of as a probably effective soundproducer from the first indeed theoretic considerations caused me to fix my attention persistently on this substance for the remarkable experiments of mr abel whereby its rapidity of combustion and violently explosive energy are demonstrated seemed to single it out as a substance eminently calculated to fulfil the conditions necessary to the production of an intense wave of sound what those conditions are we shall now more particularly enquire calling to our aid a brief but very remarkable paper published by professor stokes in the philosophical magazine for 1868 the explosive force of gunpowder is known to depend on the sudden conversion of a solid body into an intensely heated gas now the work which the artillerist requires the expanding gas to perform is the displacement of the projectile besides which it has to displace the air in front of the projectile which is backed by the whole pressure of the atmosphere such however is not the work that we want our gunpowder to perform we wish to transmute its energy not into the mere mechanical translation of either shot or air but into vibratory motion we want pulses to be formed which shall propagate themselves to vast distances through the atmosphere and this requires a certain choice and management of the explosive material a soundwave consists essentially of two partsa condensation and a rarefaction now air is a very mobile fluid and if the shock imparted to it lack due promptness the wave is not produced consider the case of a common clock pendulum which oscillates to and fro and which might be expected to generate corresponding pulses in the air when for example the bob moves to the right the air to the right of it might be supposed to be condensed while a partial vacuum might be supposed to follow the bob as a matter of fact we have nothing of the kind the air particles in front of the bob retreat so rapidly and those behind it close so rapidly in that no soundpulse is formed the mobility of hydrogen moreover being far greater than that of air a prompter action is essential to the formation of sonorous waves in hydrogen than in air it is to this rapid power of readjustment this refusal so to speak to allow its atoms to be crowded together or to be drawn apart that professor stokes with admirable penetration refers the damping power first described by sir john leslie of hydrogen upon sound a tuningfork which executes 256 complete vibrations in a second if struck gently on a pad and held in free air emits a scarcely audible note it behaves to some extent like the pendulum bob just referred to this feebleness is due to the prompt reciprocating flow of the air between the incipient condensations and rarefactions whereby the formation of soundpulses is forestalled stokes however has taught us that this flow may be intercepted by placing the edge of a card in close proximity to one of the corners of the fork an immediate augmentation of the sound of the fork is the consequence the more rapid the shock imparted to the air the greater is the fractional part of the energy of the shock converted into wave motion and as different kinds of gunpowder vary considerably in their rapidity of combustion it may be expected that they will also vary as producers of sound this theoretic inference is completely verified by experiment in a series of preliminary trials conducted at woolwich on the 4th of june 1875 the soundproducing powers of four different kinds of powder were determined in the order of the size of their grains they bear the names respectively of finegrain fg largegrain lg rifle largegrain rlg and pebblepowder p see annexed figures the charge in each case amounted to 45 lbs four 24lb howitzers being employed to fire the respective charges fig 9 there were eleven observers all of whom without a single dissentient pronounced the sound of the finegrain powder loudest of all in the opinion of seven of the eleven the largegrain powder came next seven also of the eleven placed the rifle largegrain third on the list while they were again unanimous in pronouncing the pebblepowder the worst soundproducer these differences are entirely due to differences in the rapidity of combustion all who have witnessed the performance of the 80ton gun must have been surprised at the mildness of its thunder to avoid the strain resulting from quick combustion the powder employed is composed of lumps far larger than those of the pebblepowder above referred to in the long tube of the gun these lumps of solid matter gradually resolve themselves into gas which on issuing from muzzle imparts a kind of push to the air instead of the sharp shock necessary to form the condensation of an intensely sonorous wave these are some of the physical reasons why guncotton might be regarded as a promising fogsignal firing it as we have been taught to do by mr abel its explosion is more rapid than that of gunpowder in its case the air particles alert as they are will not it might be presumed be able to slip from condensation to rarefaction with a rapidity sufficient to forestall the formation of the wave on priori grounds then we are entitled to infer the effectiveness of guncotton while in a great number of comparative experiments stretching from 1874 to the present time this inference has been verified in the most conclusive manner as regards explosive material and zealous and accomplished help in the use of it the resources of woolwich arsenal have been freely placed at the disposal of the elder brethren general campbell general younghusband colonel fraser colonel maitland and other officers have taken an active personal part in the investigation and in most cases have incurred the labour of reducing and reporting on the observations guns of various forms and sizes have been invoked for gunpowder while guncotton has been fired in free air and in the foci of parabolic reflectors on the 22nd of february 1875 a number of small guns cast specially for the purposesome with plain some with conical and some with parabolic muzzlesfiring 4 oz of finegrain powder were pitted against 4 oz of guncotton detonated both in the open and in the focus of a parabolic reflector footnote for charges of this weight the reflector is of moderate size and may be employed without fear of fracture the sound produced by the guncotton reinforced by the reflector was unanimously pronounced loudest of all with equal unanimity the guncotton detonated in free air was placed second in intensity though the same charge was used throughout the guns differed notably among themselves but none of them came up to the guncotton either with or without the reflector a second series observed from a different distance on the same day confirmed to the letter the foregoing result as a practical point however the comparative cost of guncotton and gunpowder has to be taken into account though considerations of cost ought not to be stretched too far in cases involving the safety of human life in the earlier experiments where quantities of equal price were pitted against each other the results were somewhat fluctuating indeed the perfect manipulation of the guncotton required some preliminary disciplinepromptness certainty and effectiveness of firing augmenting as experience increased as 1 lb of guncotton costs as much as 3 lbs of gunpowder these quantities were compared together on the 22nd of february the guns employed to discharge the gunpowder were a 12lb brass howitzer a 24lb castiron howitzer and the long 18pounder employed at the south foreland the result was that the 24lb howitzer firing 3 lbs of gunpowder had a slight advantage over 1 lb of guncotton detonated in the open while the 12lb howitzer and the 18pounder were both beaten by the guncotton on the end of may on the other hand the guncotton is reported as having been beaten by all the guns meanwhile the parabolicmuzzle gun expressly intended for fogsignalling was pushed rapidly forward and on march 22 and 23 1876 its power was tested at shoeburyness pitted against it were a 16pounder a 55inch howitzer 15 lb of guncotton detonated in the focus of a reflector see annexed figure and 15 lb of guncotton detonated in free air on this occasion nineteen different series of experiments were made when the new experimental gun firing a 3lb charge demonstrated its superiority over all guns previously employed to fire the same charge as regards the comparative merits of the guncotton fired in the open and the gunpowder fired from the new gun the mean values of their sounds were the same fired in the focus of the reflector the guncotton clearly dominated over all the other soundproducers footnote the reflector was fractured by the explosion but it did good service afterwards fig 10 guncotton slab 15 lb detonated in the focus of a castiron reflector the whole of the observations here referred to were embraced by an angle of about 70 of which 50 lay on the one side and 20 on the other side of the line of fire the shots were heard by eleven observers on board the galatea which took up positions varying from 2 miles to 135 miles from the firingpoint in all these observations the reinforcing action of the reflector and of the parabolic muzzle of the gun came into play but the reinforcement of the sound in one direction implies its withdrawal from some other direction and accordingly it was found that at a distance of 525 miles from the firingpoint and on a line including nearly an angle of 90 with the line of fire the guncotton in the open beat the new gun while behind the station at distances of 85 miles and 135 miles respectively the guncotton in the open beat both the gun and the guncotton in the reflector this result is rendered more important by the fact that the sound reached the mucking light a distance of 135 miles against a light wind which was blowing at the time most if not all of our ordinary soundproducers send forth waves which are not of uniform intensity throughout a trumpet is loudest in the direction of its axis the same is true of a gun a bell with its mouth pointed upwards or downwards sends forth waves which are far denser in the horizontal plane passing through the bell than at an angular distance of 90 from that plane the oldest bellbangers must have been aware of the fact that the sides of the bell and not its mouth emitted the strongest sound their practice being probably determined by this knowledge our slabs of guncotton also emit waves of different densities in different parts it has occurred in the experiments at shoeburyness that when the broad side of a slab was turned towards the suspending wire of a second slab six feet distant the wire was cut by the explosion while when the edge of the slab was turned to the wire this never occurred to the circumstance that the broadsides of the slabs faced the sea is probably to be ascribed the remarkable fact observed on march 23 that in two directions not far removed from the line of fire the guncotton detonated in the open had a slight advantage over the new gun theoretic considerations rendered it probable that the shape and size of the exploding mass would affect the constitution of the wave of sound i did not think large rectangular slabs the most favourable shape and accordingly proposed cutting a large slab into fragments of different sizes and pitting them against each other the differences between the sounds were by no means so great as the differences in the quantities of explosive material might lead one to expect the mean values of eighteen series of observations made on board the galatea at distances varying from 175 mile to 48 miles were as follows weights 4 oz 6 oz 9 oz 12 oz value of sound 312 334 40 403 these charges were cut from a slab of dry guncotton about 175 inch thick they were squares and rectangles of the following dimensions 4 oz 2 inches by 2 inches 6 oz 2 inches by 3 inches 9 oz 3 inches by 3 inches 12 oz 2 inches by 6 inches the numbers under the respective weights express the recorded value of the sounds they must be simply taken as a ready means of expressing the approximate relative intensity of the sounds as estimated by the ear when we find a 9oz charge marked 4 and a 12oz charge marked 403 the two sounds may be regarded as practically equal in intensity thus proving that an addition of 30 per cent in the larger charges produces no sensible difference in the sound were the sounds estimated by some physical means instead of by the ear the values of the sounds at the distances recorded would not in my opinion show a greater advance with the increase of material than that indicated by the foregoing numbers subsequent experiments rendered still more certain the effectiveness as well as the economy of the smaller charges of guncotton it is an obvious corollary from the foregoing experiments that on our nesses and promontories where the land is clasped on both sides for a considerable distance by the seawhere therefore the sound has to propagate itself rearward as well as forwardthe use of the parabolic gun or of the parabolic reflector might be a disadvantage rather than an advantage here guncotton exploded in the open forms the most appropriate source of sound this remark is especially applicable to such lightships as are intended to spread the sound all round them as from central foci as a signal in rock lighthouses where neither syren steamwhistle nor gun could be mounted and as a handy fleetsignal dispensing with the lumber of special signalguns the guncotton will prove invaluable but in most of these cases we have the drawback that local damage may be done by the explosion the lantern of the rock lighthouse might suffer from concussion near at hand and though mechanical arrangements might be devised both in the case of the lighthouse and of the ships deck to place the firingpoint of the guncotton at a safe distance no such arrangement could compete as regards simplicity and effectiveness with the expedient of a guncotton rocket had such a means of signalling existed at the bishops rock lighthouse the illfated schiller might have been warned of her approach to danger ten or it may be twenty miles before she reached the rock which wrecked her had the fleet possessed such a signal instead of the ubiquitous but ineffectual whistle the iron duke and vanguard need never have come into collision it was the necessity of providing a suitable signal for rock lighthouses and of clearing obstacles which cast an acoustic shadow that suggested the idea of the guncotton rocket to sir richard collinson deputy master of the trinity house his idea was to place a disk or short cylinder of guncotton in the head of a rocket the ascensional force of which should be employed to carry the disk to an elevation of 1000 feet or thereabouts where by the ignition of a fuse associated with a detonator the guncotton should be fired sending its sound in all directions vertically and obliquely down upon earth and sea the first attempt to realise this idea was made on july 18 1876 at the firework manufactory of the messrs brock at nunhead eight rockets were then fired four being charged with 5 oz and four with 75 oz of guncotton they ascended to a great height and exploded with a very loud report in the air on july 27 the rockets were tried at shoeburyness the most noteworthy result on this occasion was the hearing of the sounds at the mouse lighthouse 85 miles e by s and at the chapman lighthouse 85 miles w by n that is to say at opposite sides of the firingpoint it is worthy of remark that in the case of the chapman lighthouse land and trees intervened between the firingpoint and the place of observation this as general younghusband justly remarked at the time may prove to be a valuable consideration if it should be found necessary to place a signal station in a position whence the sea could not be freely observed indeed the clearing of such obstacles was one of the objects which the inventor of the rocket had in view with reference to the action of the wind it was thought desirable to compare the range of explosions produced near the surface of the earth with others produced at the elevation attainable by the guncotton rockets wind and weather however are not at our command and hence one of the objects of a series of experiments conducted on december 13 1876 was not fulfilled it is worthy however of note that on this day with smooth water and a calm atmosphere the rockets were distinctly heard at a distance of 112 miles from the firingpoint the quantity of guncotton employed was 75 oz on thursday march 8 1877 these comparative experiments of firing at high and low elevations were pushed still further the guncotton near the ground consisted of 05lb disks suspended from a horizontal iron bar about 45 feet above the ground the rockets carried the same quantity of guncotton in their heads and the height to which they attained as determined by a theodolite was from 800 to 900 feet the day was cold with occasional squalls of snow and hail the direction of the sound being at right angles to that of the wind five series of observations were made on board the vestal at distances varying from 3 to 6 miles the mean value of the explosions in the air exceeded that of the explosions near the ground by a small but sensible quantity at windmill hill gravesend however which was nearly to leeward and 55 miles from the firingpoint in nineteen cases out of twentyfour the disk fired near the ground was loudest while in the remaining five the rocket had the advantage towards the close of the day the atmosphere became very serene a few distant cumuli sailed near the horizon but the zenith and a vast angular space all round it were absolutely free from cloud from the deck of the galatea a rocket was discharged which reached a great elevation and exploded with a loud report following this solid nucleus of sound was a continuous train of echoes which retreated to a continually greater distance dying gradually off into silence after seven seconds duration these echoes were of the same character as those so frequently noticed at the south foreland in 187273 and called by me aerial echoes on the 23rd of march the experiments were resumed the most noteworthy results of that days observations being that the sounds were heard at tillingham 10 miles to the ne at west mersea 1575 miles to the ne by e at brightlingsea 175 miles to the ne and at clacton wash 205 miles to the ne by 12 e the wind was blowing at the time from the se some of these sounds were produced by rockets some by a 24lb howitzer and some by an 8inch maroon in december 1876 mr gardiner the managing director of the cottonpowder company had proposed a trial of this material against the guncotton the density of the cotton he urged was only 103 while that of the powder was 170 a greater quantity of explosive material being thus compressed into the same volume mr gardiner thought that a greater sonorous effect must be produced by the powder at the instance of mr mackie who had previously gone very thoroughly into the subject a committee of the elder brethren visited the cottonpowder manufactory on the banks of the swale near faversham on the 16th of june 1877 the weights of cottonpowder employed were 2 oz 8 oz 1 lb and 2 lbs in the form of rockets and of signals fired a few feet above the ground the experiments throughout were arranged and conducted by mr mackie our desire on this occasion was to get as near to windward as possible but the swale and other obstacles limited our distance to 15 mile we stood here ese from the firingpoint while the wind blew fresh from the ne the cottonpowder yielded a very effective report the rockets in general had a slight advantage over the same quantities of material fired near the ground the loudness of the sound was by no means proportional to the quantity of the material exploded 8 oz yielding very nearly as loud a report as 1 lb the aerial echoes which invariably followed the explosion of the rockets were loud and longcontinued on the 17th of october 1877 another series of experiments with howitzers and rockets was carried out at shoeburyness the charge of the howitzer was 3 lbs of l g powder the charges of the rockets were 12 oz 8 oz 4 oz and 2 oz of guncotton respectively the gun and the four rockets constituted a series and eight series were fired during the afternoon of the 17th the observations were made from the vestal and the galatea positions being successively assumed which permitted the sound to reach the observers with the wind against the wind and across the wind the distance of the galatea varied from 3 to 7 miles that of the vestal which was more restricted in her movements being 2 to 3 miles briefly summed up the result is that the howitzer firing a 3lb charge which it will be remembered was our best gun at the south foreland was beaten by the 12oz rocket by the 8oz rocket and by the 4oz rocket the 2oz rocket alone fell behind the howitzer it is worth while recording the distances at which some of the sounds were heard on the day now referred to 1 leigh 65 miles wnw 24 out of 40 sounds heard 2 girdler 12 miles se by e 5 out

times squally rising to a force of 6 or 7 and sometimes dropping to a force of 2 or 3 the station at leigh excepted all these places were to leeward of shoeburyness at four other stations to leeward varying in distance from 155 to 245 miles nothing was heard while at eleven stations to windward varying from 8 to 26 miles the sounds were also inaudible it was found indeed that the sounds proceeding directly against the wind did not penetrate much beyond 3 miles on the following day viz the 18th october we proceeded to dungeness with the view of making a series of strict comparative experiments with guncotton and cottonpowder rockets containing 8 oz 4 oz and 2 oz of guncotton had been prepared at the royal arsenal while others containing similar quantities of cottonpowder had been supplied by the cottonpowder company at faversham with these were compared the ordinary 18pounder gun which happened to be mounted at dungeness firing the usual charge of 3 lbs of powder and a syren from these experiments it appeared that the guncotton and cottonpowder were practically equal as producers of sound the effectiveness of small charges was illustrated in a very striking manner only a single unit separating the numerical value of the 8oz rocket from that of the 2oz rocket the former was recorded as 69 and the latter as 59 the value of the 4oz rocket being intermediate between them these results were recorded by a number of very practised observers on board the galatea they were completely borne out by the observations of the coastguard who marked the value of the 8oz rocket 61 and that of the 2oz rocket 52 the 18pounder gun fell far behind all the rockets a result possibly to be in part ascribed to the imperfection of the powder the performance of the syren was on the whole less satisfactory than that of the rocket the instrument was worked not by steam of 70 lbs pressure as at the south foreland but by compressed air beginning with 40 lbs and ending with 30 lbs pressure the trumpet was pointed to windward and in the axis of the instrument the sound was about as effective as that of the 8oz rocket but in a direction at right angles to the axis and still more in the rear of this direction the syren fell very sensibly behind even the 2oz rocket these are the principal comparative trials made between the guncotton rocket and other fogsignals but they are not the only ones on the 2nd of august 1877 for example experiments were made at lundy island with the following results at 2 miles distant from the firingpoint with land intervening the 18pounder firing a 3lb charge was quite unheard both the 4oz rocket and the 8oz rocket however reached an elevation which commanded the acoustic shadow and yielded loud reports when both were in view the rockets were still superior to the gun on the 6th of august at st anns the 4oz and 8oz rockets proved superior to the syren on the shambles lightvessel when a pressure of 13 lbs was employed to sound the syren the rockets proved greatly superior to that instrument proceeding along the sea margin at flamboro head mr edwards states that at a distance of 125 mile with the 18pounder previously used as a fogsignal hidden behind the cliffs its report was quite unheard while the 4oz rocket rising to an elevation which brought it clearly into view yielded a powerful sound in the face of an opposing wind on the evening of february 9th 1877 a remarkable series of experiments were made by mr prentice at stowmarket with the guncotton rocket from the report with which he has kindly furnished

155 miles reports distinct attributed to distant thunder in the great majority of these cases the direction of the sound enclosed a large angle with the direction of the wind in some cases indeed the two directions were at right angles to each other it is needless to dwell for a moment on the advantage of possessing a signal commanding ranges such as these the explosion of substances in the air after having been carried to a considerable elevation by rockets is a familiar performance in 1873 moreover the board of trade proposed a lightandsound rocket as a signal of distress which proposal was subsequently realized but in a form too elaborate and expensive for practical use the idea of a guncotton rocket fit for signalling in fogs is i believe wholly due to sir richard collinson the deputy master of the trinity house thanks to the skilful aid given by the authorities of woolwich by mr prentice and mr brock that idea is now an accomplished fact a signal of great power handiness and economy being thus placed at the service of our mariners not only may the rocket be applied in association with lighthouses and lightships but in the navy also it may be turned to important account soon after the loss of the vanguard i ventured to urge upon an eminent naval officer the desirability of having an organized code of fogsignals for the fleet he shook his head doubtingly and referred to the difficulty of finding room for signal guns the guncotton rocket completely surmounts this difficulty it is manipulated with ease and rapidity while its discharges may be so grouped and combined as to give a most important extension to the voice of the admiral in command it is needless to add that at any point upon our coasts or upon any other coast where its establishment might be desirable a fogsignal station might be extemporised without difficulty i have referred more than once to the train of echoes which accompanied the explosion of guncotton in free air speaking of them as similar in all respects to those which were described for the first time in my report on fogsignals addressed to the corporation of trinity house in 1874 footnote see also philosophical transactions for 1874 p 183 to these echoes i attached a fundamental significance there was no visible reflecting surface from which they could come on some days with hardly a cloud in the air and hardly a ripple on the sea they reached a magical intensity as far as the sense of hearing could judge they came from the body of the air in front of the great trumpet which produced them the trumpet blasts were five seconds in duration but long before the blast had ceased the echoes struck in adding their strength to the primitive note of the trumpet after the blast had ended the echoes continued retreating further and further from the point of observation and finally dying away at great distances the echoes were perfectly continuous as long as the sea was clear of ships tapering by imperceptible gradations into absolute silence but when a ship happened to throw itself athwart the course of the sound the echo from the broadside of the vessel was returned as a shock which rudely interrupted the continuity of the dying atmospheric music these echoes have been ascribed to reflection from the crests of the seawaves but this hypothesis is negatived by the fact that the echoes were produced in great intensity and duration when no waves existedwhen the sea in fact was of glassy smoothness it has been also shown that the direction of the echoes depended not on that of waves real or assumed but on the direction of the axis of the trumpet causing that axis to traverse an arc of 210 and the trumpet to sound at various points of the arc the echoes were always at all events in calm weather returned from that portion of the atmosphere towards which the trumpet was directed they could not under the circumstances come from the glassy sea while both their variation of direction and their perfectly continuous fall into silence are irreconcilable with the notion that they came from fixed objects on the land they came from that portion of the atmosphere into which the trumpet poured its maximum sound and fell in intensity as the direct sound penetrated to greater atmospheric distances the day on which our latest observations were made was particularly fine before reaching dungeness the smoothness of the sea and the serenity of the air caused me to test the echoing power of the atmosphere a single ship lay about half a mile distant between us and the land the result of the proposed experiment was clearly foreseen it was this the rocket being sent up it exploded at a great height the echoes retreated in their usual fashion becoming less and less intense as the distances of the invisible surfaces of reflection from the observers increased about five seconds after the explosion a single loud shock was sent back to us from the side of the vessel lying between us and the land obliterated for a moment by this more intense echo the aerial reverberation continued its retreat dying away into silence in two or three seconds afterwards footnote the echoes of the gun fired on shore this day were very brief those of the 12oz guncotton rocket were 12 and those of the 8oz cottonpowder rocket 11 in duration i have referred to the firing of an 8oz rocket from the deck of the galatea on march 8 1877 stating the duration of its echoes to be seven seconds mr prentice who was present at the time assured me that in his experiments similar echoes had been frequently heard of more than twice this duration the ranges of his sounds alone would render this result in the highest degree probable to attempt to interpret an experiment which i have not had an opportunity of repeating is an operation of some risk and it is not without a consciousness of this that i refer here to a result announced by professor joseph henry which he considers adverse to the notion of aerial echoes he took the trouble to point the trumpet of a syren towards the zenith and found that when the syren was sounded no echo was returned now the reflecting surfaces which give rise to these echoes are for the most part due to differences of temperature between sea and air if through any cause the air above be chilled we have descending streamsif the air below be warmed we have ascending streams as the initial cause of atmospheric flocculence a sound proceeding vertically does not cross the streams nor impinge upon the reflecting surfaces as does a sound proceeding horizontally across them aerial echoes therefore will not accompany the vertical sound as they accompany the horizontal one the experiment as i interpret it is not opposed to the theory of these echoes which i have ventured to enunciate but as i have indicated not only to see but to vary such an experiment is a necessary prelude to grasping its full significance in a paper published in the philosophical transactions for 1876 professor osborne reynolds refers to these echoes in the following terms without attempting to explain the reverberations and echoes which have been observed i will merely call attention to the fact that in no case have i heard any attending the reports of the rockets footnote these carried 12 oz of gunpowder which has been found by col fraser to require an iron case to produce an effective explosion although they seem to have been invariable with the guns and pistols these facts suggest that the echoes are in some way connected with the direction given to the sound they are caused by the voice trumpets and the syren all of which give direction to the sound but i am not aware that they have ever been observed in the case of a sound which has no direction of greatest intensity the reference to the voice and other references in his paper cause me to think that in speaking of echoes professor osborne reynolds and myself are dealing with different phenomena be that as it may the foregoing observations render it perfectly certain that the condition as to direction here laid down is not necessary to the production of the echoes there is not a feature connected with the aerial echoes which cannot be brought out by experiments in the air of the laboratory i have recently made the following experiment a rectangle x y p 331 22 inches by 12 was crossed by twentythree brass tubes half the number would suffice and only eleven are shown in the figure each having a slit along it from which gas can issue in this way twentythree low flat flames were obtained a sounding reed a fixed in a short tube was placed at one end of the rectangle and a sensitive flame footnote fully described in my lectures on sound 3rd edition p 227 f at some distance beyond the other end when the reed sounded the flame in front of it was violently agitated and roared boisterously turning on the gas and lighting it as it issued from the slits the air above the flames became so heterogeneous that the sensitive flame was instantly stilled rising from a height of 6 inches to a height of 18 inches here we had the acoustic opacity of the air in front of the south foreland strikingly imitated footnote lectures on sound 3rd ed p 268 turning off the gas and removing the sensitive flame to f some distance behind the reed it burned there tranquilly though the reed was sounding again lighting the gas as it issued from the brass tubes the sound reflected from the heterogeneous air threw the sensitive flame into violent agitation here we had imitated the aerial echoes heard when standing behind the syrentrumpet at the south foreland the experiment is extremely simple and in the highest degree impressive fig 11 the explosive rapidity of dynamite marks it as a substance specially suitable for the production of sound at the suggestion of professor dewar mr mcroberts has carried out a series of experiments on dynamite with extremely promising results immediately after the delivery of the foregoing lecture i was informed that mr brock proposed the employment of dynamite in the collinson rocket xi on the study of physics footnote from a lecture delivered in the royal institution of great britain in the spring of 1854 i hold in my hand an uncorrected proof of the syllabus of this course of lectures and the title of the present lecture a there stated to be on the importance of the study of physics as a means of education the corrected proof however contains the title on the importance of the study of physics as a branch of education small as this editorial alteration may seem the two words suggest two radically distinct modes of viewing the subject before us the term education is sometimes applied to a single faculty or organ and if we know wherein the education of a single faculty consists this will help us to clearer notions regarding the education of the sum of all the faculties or of the mind when for example we speak of the education of the voice what do we mean there are certain membranes at the top of the windpipe which throw into vibration the air forced between them from the lungs thus producing musical sounds these membranes are to some extent under the control of the will and it is found that they can be so modified by exercise as to produce notes of a clearer and more melodious character this exercise we call the education of the voice we may choose for our exercise songs new or old festive or solemn the education of the voice being the object aimed at the songs may be regarded as the means by which this education is accomplished i think this expresses the state of the case more clearly than if we were to call the songs a branch of education regarding also the education of the human mind as the improvement and development of the mental faculties i shall consider the study of physics as a means towards the attainment of this end from this point of view i degrade physics into an implement of culture and this is my deliberate design the term physics as made use of in the present lecture refers to that portion of natural science which lies midway between astronomy and chemistry the former indeed is physics applied to masses of enormous weight while the latter is physics applied to atoms and molecules the subjects of physics proper are therefore those which lie nearest to human perception light and heat colour sound motion the loadstone electrical attractions and repulsions thunder and lightning rain snow dew and so forth our senses stand between these phenomena and the reasoning mind we observe the fact but are not satisfied with the mere act of observation the fact must be accounted forfitted into its position in the line of cause and effect taking our facts from nature we transfer them to the domain of thought look at them compare them observe their mutual relations and connexions and bringing them ever clearer before the mental eye finally alight upon the cause which unites them this is the last act of the mind in this centripetal directionin its progress from the multiplicity of facts to the central cause on which they depend but having guessed the cause we are not yet contented we set out from the centre and travel in the other direction if the guess be true certain consequences must follow from it and we appeal to the law and testimony of experiment whether the thing is so thus is the circuit of thought completedfrom without inward from multiplicity to unity and from within outward from unity to multiplicity in thus traversing both ways the line between cause and effect all our reasoning powers are called into play the mental effort involved in these processes may be compared to those exercises of the body which invoke the cooperation of every muscle and thus confer upon the whole frame the benefits of healthy action the first experiment a child makes is a physical experiment the suctionpump is but an imitation of the first act of every newborn infant nor do i think it calculated to lessen that infants reverence or to make him a worse citizen when his riper experience shows him that the atmosphere was his helper in extracting the first draught from his mothers breast the child grows but is still an experimenter he grasps at the moon and his failure teaches him to respect distance at length his little fingers acquire sufficient mechanical tact to lay hold of a spoon he thrusts the instrument into his mouth hurts his gums and thus learns the impenetrability of matter he lets the spoon fall and jumps with delight to hear it rattle against the table the experiment made by accident is repeated with intention and thus the young student receives his first lessons upon sound and gravitation there are pains and penalties however in the path of the enquirer he is sure to go wrong and nature is just as sure to inform him of the fact he falls downstairs burns his fingers cuts his hand scalds his tongue and in this way learns the conditions of his physical well being this is natures way of proceeding and it is wonderful what progress her pupil makes his enjoyments for a time are physical and the confectioners shop occupies the foreground of human happiness but the blossoms of a finer life are already beginning to unfold themselves and the relation of cause and effect dawns upon the boy he begins to see that the present condition of things is not final but depends upon one that has gone before and will be succeeded by another he becomes a puzzle to himself and to satisfy his newlyawakened curiosity asks all manner of inconvenient questions the needs and tendencies of human nature express themselves through these early yearnings of the child as thought ripens he desires to know the character and causes of the phenomena presented to his observation and unless this desire has been granted for the express purpose of having it repressed unless the attractions of natural phenomena be like the blush of the forbidden fruit conferred merely for the purpose of exercising our selfdenial in letting them alone we may fairly claim for the study of physics the recognition that it answers to an impulse implanted by nature in the constitution of man a few days ago a master of arts who is still a young man and therefore the recipient of a modern education stated to me that until he had reached the age of twenty years he had never been taught anything whatever regarding natural phenomena or natural law twelve years of his life previously had been spent exclusively among the ancients the case i regret to say is typical now we cannot without prejudice to humanity separate the present from the past the nineteenth century strikes its roots into the centuries gone by and draws nutriment from them the world cannot afford to lose the record of any great deed or utterance for such are prolific throughout all time we cannot yield the companionship of our loftier brothers of antiquityof our socrates and catowhose lives provoke us to sympathetic greatness across the interval of two thousand years as long as the ancient languages are the means of access to the ancient mind they must ever be of priceless value to humanity but surely these avenues might be kept open without making such sacrifices as that above referred to universal we have conquered and possessed ourselves of continents of land concerning which antiquity knew nothing and if new continents of thought reveal themselves to the exploring human spirit shall we not possess them also in these latter days the study of physics has given us glimpses of the methods of nature which were quite hidden from the ancients and we should be false to the trust committed to us if we were to sacrifice the hopes and aspirations of the present out of deference to the past the bias of my own education probably manifests itself in a desire i always feel to seize upon every possible opportunity of checking my assumptions and conclusions by experience in the present case it is true your own consciousness might be appealed to in proof of the tendency of the human mind to inquire into the phenomena presented to it by the senses but i trust you will excuse me if instead of doing this i take advantage of the facts which have fallen in my way through life referring to your judgment to decide whether such facts are truly representative and general and not merely individual and local at an agricultural college in hampshire with which i was connected for some time and which is now converted into a school for the general education of youth a society was formed among the boys who met weekly for the purpose of reading reports and papers upon various subjects the society had its president and treasurer and abstracts of its proceedings were published in a little monthly periodical issuing from the school press one of the most remarkable features of these weekly meetings was that after the general business had been concluded each member enjoyed the right of asking questions on any subject on which he desired information the questions were either written out previously in a book or if a question happened to suggest itself during the meeting it was written upon a slip of paper and handed in to the secretary who afterwards read all the questions aloud a number of teachers were usually present and they and the boys made a common stock of their wisdom in furnishing replies as might be expected from an assemblage of eighty or ninety boys varying from eighteen to eight years old many odd questions were proposed to the mind which loves to detect in the tendencies of the young the instincts of humanity generally such questions are not without a certain philosophic interest and i have therefore thought it not derogatory to the present course of lectures to copy a few of them and to introduce them here they run as follows what are the duties of the astronomer royal what is frost why are thunder and lightning more frequent in summer than in winter what occasions falling stars what is the cause of the sensation called pins and needles what is the cause of waterspouts what is the cause of hiccup if a towel be wetted with water why does the wet portion become darker than before what is meant by lancashire witches does the dew rise or fall what is the principle of the hydraulic press is there more oxygen in the air in summer than in winter what are those rings which we see round the gas and sun what is thunder how is it that a black hat can be moved by forming round it a magnetic circle while a white hat remains stationary what is the cause of perspiration is it true that men were once monkeys what is the difference between the soul and the mind is it contrary to the rules of vegetarianism to eat eggs in looking over these questions which were wholly unprompted and have been copied almost at random from the book alluded to we see that many of them are suggested directly by natural objects and are not such as had an interest conferred on them by previous culture now the fact is beyond the boys control and so certainly is the desire to know its cause the sole question then is whether this desire is to be gratified or not who created the fact who implanted the desire certainly not man who then will undertake to place himself between the desire and its fulfilment and proclaim a divorce between them take for example the case of the wetted towel which at first sight appears to be one of the most unpromising questions in the list shall we tell the proposer to repress his curiosity as the subject is improper for him to know and thus interpose our wisdom to rescue the boy from the consequences of a wish which acts to his prejudice or recognising the propriety of the question how shall we answer it it is impossible to answer it without reference to the laws of opticswithout making the boy to some extent a natural philosopher you may say that the effect is due to the reflection of light at the common surface of two media of different refractive indices but this answer presupposes on the part of the boy a knowledge of what reflection and refraction are or reduces you to the necessity of explaining them on looking more closely into the matter we find that our wet towel belongs to a class of phenomena which have long excited the interest of philosophers the towel is white for the same reason that snow is white that foam is white that pounded granite or glass is white and that the salt we use at table is white on quitting one medium and entering another a portion of light is always reflected but on this conditionthe media must possess different refractive indices thus when we immerse a bit of glass in water light is reflected from the common surface of both and it is this light which enables us to see the glass but when a transparent solid is immersed in a liquid of the same refractive index as itself it immediately disappears i remember once dropping the eyeball of an ox into water it vanished as if by magic with the exception of the crystalline lens and the surprise was so great as to cause a bystander to suppose that the vitreous humour had been instantly dissolved this however was not the case and a comparison of the refractive index of the humour with that of water cleared up the whole matter the indices were identical and hence the light pursued its way through both as if they formed one continuous mass in the case of snow powdered quartz or salt we have a transparent solid mixed with air at every transition from solid to air or from air to solid a portion of light is reflected and this takes place so often that the light is wholly intercepted thus from the mixture of two transparent bodies we obtain an opaque one now the case of the towel is precisely similar the tissue is composed of semitransparent vegetable fibres with the interstices between them filled with air repeated reflection takes place at the limiting surfaces of air and fibre and hence the towel becomes opaque like snow or salt but if we fill the interstices with water we diminish the reflection a portion of the light is transmitted and the darkness of the towel is due to its increased transparency thus the deportment of various minerals such as hydrophane and tabasheer the transparency of tracing paper used by engineers and many other considerations of the highest scientific interest are involved in the simple enquiry of this unsuspecting little boy again take the question regarding the rising or falling of the dewa question long agitated and finally set at rest by the beautiful researches of wells i do not think that any boy of average intelligence will be satisfied with the simple answer that the dew falls he will wish to learn how you know that it falls and if acquainted with the notions of the middle ages he may refer to the opinion of father laurus that a goose egg filled in the morning with dew and exposed to the sun will rise like a balloona swans egg being better for the experiment than a goose egg it is impossible to give the boy a clear notion of the beautiful phenomenon to which his question refers without first making him acquainted with the radiation and conduction of heat take for example a blade of grass from which one of these orient pearls is depending during the day the grass and the earth beneath it possess a certain amount of warmth imparted by the sun during a serene night heat is radiated from the surface of the grass into space and to supply the loss there is a flow of heat from the earth to the blade thus the blade loses heat by radiation and gains heat by conduction now in the case before us the power of radiation is great whereas the power of conduction is small the consequence is that the blade loses more than it gains and hence becomes more and more refrigerated the light vapour floating around the surface so cooled is condensed upon it and there accumulates to form the little pearly globe which we call a dewdrop thus the boy finds the simple and homely fact which addressed his senses to be the outcome and flower of the deepest laws the fact becomes in a measure sanctified as an object of thought and invested for him with a beauty for evermore he thus learns that things which at first sight seem to stand isolated and without apparent brotherhood in nature are organically united and finds the detection of such analogies a source of perpetual delight to enlist pleasure on the side of intellectual performance is a point of the utmost importance for the exercise of the mind like that of the body depends for its value upon the spirit in which it is accomplished every physician knows that something more than mere mechanical motion is comprehended under the idea of healthful exercisethat indeed being most healthful which makes us forget all ulterior ends in the mere enjoyment of it what for example could be substituted for the action of the playground where the boy plays for the mere love of playing and without reference to physiological laws while kindly nature accomplishes her ends unconsciously and makes his very indifference beneficial to him you may have more systematic motions you may devise means for the more perfect traction of each particular muscle but you cannot create the joy and gladness of the game and where these are absent the charm and the health of the exercise are gone the case is similar with the education of the mind the study of physics as already intimated consists of two processes which are complementary to each otherthe tracing of facts to their causes and the logical advance from the cause to the fact in the former process called induction certain moral qualities come into play the first condition of success is patient industry an honest receptivity and a willingness to abandon all preconceived notions however cherished if they be found to contradict the truth believe me a selfrenunciation which has something lofty in it and of which the world never hears is often enacted in the private experience of the true votary of science and if a man be not capable of this selfrenunciationthis loyal surrender of himself to nature and to fact he lacks in my opinion the first mark of a true philosopher thus the earnest prosecutor of science who does not work with the idea of producing a sensation in the world who loves the truth better than the transitory blaze of todays fame who comes to his task with a single eye finds in that task an indirect means of the highest moral culture and although the virtue of the act depends upon its privacy this sacrifice of self this upright determination to accept the truth no matter how it may present itselfeven at the hands of a scientific foe if necessarycarries with it its own reward when prejudice is put under foot and the stains of personal bias have been washed awaywhen a man consents to lay aside his vanity and to become natures organhis elevation is the instant consequence of his humility i should not wonder if my remarks provoked a smile for they seem to indicate that i regard the man of science as a heroic if not indeed an angelic character and cases may occur to you which indicate the reverse you may point to the quarrels of scientific men to their struggles for priority to that unpleasant egotism which screams around its little property of discovery like a scared plover about its young i will not deny all this but let it be set down to its proper account to the weaknessor if you willto the selfishness of man but not to the charge of physical science the second process in physical investigation is deduction or the advance of the mind from fixed principles to the conclusions which flow from them the rules of logic are the formal statement of this process which however was practised by every healthy mind before ever such rules were written in the study of physics induction and deduction are perpetually wedded to each other the man observes strips facts of their peculiarities of form and tries to unite them by their essences having effected this he at once deduces and thus checks his induction here the grand difference between the methods at present followed and those of the ancients becomes manifest they were onesided in these matters they omitted the process of induction and substituted conjecture for observation they could never therefore fulfil the mission of man to replenish the earth and subdue it the subjugation of nature is only to be accomplished by the penetration of her secrets and the patient mastery of her laws this not only enables us to protect ourselves from the hostile action of natural forces but makes them our slaves by the study of physics we have indeed opened to us treasuries of power of which antiquity never dreamed but while we lord it over matter we have thereby become better acquainted with the laws of mind for to the mental philosopher the study of physics furnishes a screen against which the human spirit projects its own image and thus becomes capable of selfinspection thus then as a means of intellectual culture the study of physics exercises and sharpens observation it brings the most exhaustive logic into play it compares abstracts and generalizes and provides a mental scenery appropriate to these processes the strictest precision of thought is everywhere enforced and prudence foresight and sagacity are demanded by its appeals to experiment it continually checks itself and thus walks on a foundation of facts hence the exercise it invokes does not end in a mere game of intellectual gymnastics such as the ancients delighted in but tends to the mastery of nature this gradual conquest of the external world and the consciousness of augmented strength which accompanies it render the study of physics as delightful as it is important with regard to the effect on the imagination certain it is that the cool results of physical induction furnish conceptions which transcend the most daring flights of that faculty take for example the idea of an allpervading aether which transmits a tingle so to speak to the finger ends of the universe every time a street lamp is lighted the invisible billows of this aether can be measured with the same ease and certainty as that with which an engineer measures a base and two angles and from these finds the distance across the thames now it is to be confessed that there may be just as little poetry in the measurement of an aethereal undulation as in that of the river for the intellect during the acts of measurement and calculation destroys those notions of size which appeal to the poetic sense it is a mistake to suppose with dr young that an undevout astronomer is mad there being no necessary connexion between a devout state of mind and the observations and calculations of a practical astronomer it is not until the man withdraws from his calculation as a painter from his work and thus realizes the great idea on which he has been engaged that imagination and wonder are excited there is i admit a possible danger here if the arithmetical processes of science be too exclusively pursued they may impair the imagination and thus the study of physics is open to the same objection as philological theological or political studies when carried to excess but even in this case the injury done is to the investigator himself it does not reach the mass of mankind indeed the conceptions furnished by his cold unimaginative reckonings may furnish themes for the poet and excite in the highest degree that sentiment of wonder which notwithstanding all its foolish vagaries tableturning included i for my part should be sorry to see banished from the world i have thus far dwelt upon the study of physics as an agent of intellectual culture but like other things in nature this study subserves more than a single end the colours of the clouds delight the eye and no doubt accomplish moral purposes also but the selfsame clouds hold within their fleeces the moisture by which our fields are rendered fruitful the sunbeams excite our interest and invite our investigation but they also extend their beneficent influences to our fruits and corn and thus accomplish not only intellectual ends but minister at the same time to our material necessities and so it is with scientific research while the love of science is a sufficient incentive to the pursuit of science and the investigator in the prosecution of his enquiries is raised above all material considerations the results of his labours may exercise a potent influence upon the physical condition of the community this is the arrangement of nature and not that of the scientific investigator himself for he usually pursues his object without regard to its practical applications and let him who is dazzled by such applicationswho sees in the steamengine and the electric telegraph the highest embodiment of human genius and the only legitimate object of scientific research beware of prescribing conditions to the investigator let him beware of attempting to substitute for that simple love with which the votary of science pursues his task the calculations of what he is pleased to call utility the professed utilitarian is unfortunately in most cases the very last man to see the occult sources from which useful results are derived he admires the flower but is ignorant of the conditions of its growth the scientific man must approach nature in his own way for if you invade his freedom by your socalled practical considerations it may be at the expense of those qualities on which his success as a discoverer depends let the selfstyled practical man look to those from the fecundity of whose thought be and thousands like him have sprung into existence were they inspired in their first enquiries by the calculations of utility not one of them they were often forced to live low and lie hard and to seek compensation for their penury in the delight which their favourite pursuits afforded them in the words of one well qualified to speak upon this subject i say not merely look at the pittance of men like john dalton or the voluntary starvation of the late graff but compare what is considered as competency or affluence by your faradays liebigs and herschels with the expected results of a life of successful commercial enterprise then compare the amount of mind put forth the work done for society in either case and you will be constrained to allow that the former belong to a class of workers who properly speaking are not paid and cannot be paid for their work as indeed it is of a sort to which no payment could stimulate but while the scientific investigator standing upon the frontiers of human knowledge and aiming at the conquest of fresh soil from the surrounding region of the unknown makes the discovery of truth his exclusive object for the time he cannot but feel the deepest interest in the practical application of the truth discovered there is something ennobling in the triumph of mind over matter apart even from its uses to society there is something elevating in the idea of man having tamed that wild force which flashes through the telegraphic wire and made it the minister of his will our attainments in these directions appear to be commensurate with our needs we had already subdued horse and mule and obtained from them all the service which it was in their power to render we must either stand still or find more potent agents to execute our purposes at this point the steamengine appears these are still new things it is not long since we struck into the scientific methods which have produced these results we cannot for an instant regard them as the final achievements of science but rather as an earnest of what she is yet to do they mark our first great advances upon the dominion of nature animal strength fails but here are the forces which hold the world together and the instincts and successes of man assure him that these forces are his when he is wise enough to command them as an instrument of intellectual culture the study of physics is profitable to all as bearing upon special functions its value though not so great is still more tangible why for example should members of parliament be ignorant of the subjects concerning which they are called upon to legislate in this land of practical physics why should they be unable to form an independent opinion upon a physical question why should the member of a parliamentary committee be left at the mercy of interested disputants when a scientific question is discussed until he deems the nap a blessing which rescues him from the bewilderments of the committeeroom the education which does not supply the want here referred to fails in its duty to england with regard to our working people in the ordinary sense of the term working the study of physics would i imagine be profitable not only as a means of intellectual culture but also as a moral influence to woo them from pursuits which now degrade them a mans reformation oftener depends upon the indirect than upon the direct action of the will the will must be exerted in the choice of employment which shall break the force of temptation by erecting a barrier against it the drunkard for example is in a perilous condition if he content himself merely with saying or swearing that he will avoid strong drink his thoughts if not attracted by another force will revert to the publichouse and to rescue him permanently from this you must give him an equivalent by investing the objects of hourly intercourse with an interest which prompts reflection new enjoyments would be opened to the working man and every one of these would be a point of force to protect him against temptation besides this our factories and our foundries present an extensive field of observation and were those who work in them rendered capable by previous culture of observing what they see the results might be incalculable who can say what intellectual samsons are at the present moment toiling with closed eyes in the mills and forges of manchester and birmingham grant these samsons sight and you multiply the chances of discovery and with them the prospects of national advancement in our multitudinous technical operations we are constantly playing with forces our ignorance of which is often the cause of our destruction there are agencies at work in a locomotive of which the maker of it probably never dreamed but which nevertheless may be sufficient to convert it into an engine of death when we reflect on the intellectual condition of the people who work in our coal mines those terrific explosions which occur from time to time need not astonish us if these men possessed sufficient physical knowledge from the operatives themselves would probably emanate a system by which these shocking accidents might be avoided possessed of the knowledge their personal interests would furnish the necessary stimulus to its practical application and thus two ends would be served at the same time the elevation of the men and the diminution of the calamity before the present course of lectures was publicly announced i had many misgivings as to the propriety of my taking a part in them thinking that my place might be better filled by an older and more experienced man to my experience however such as it was i resolved to adhere and i have therefore described things as they revealed themselves to my own eyes and have been enacted in my own limited practice there is one mind common to us all and the true expression of this mind even in small particulars will attest itself by the response which it calls forth in the convictions of my hearers i ask your permission to proceed a little further in this fashion and to refer to a fact or two in addition to those already cited which presented themselves to my notice during my brief career as a teacher in the college already alluded to the facts though extremely humble and deviating in some slight degree from the strict subject of the present discourse may yet serve to illustrate an educational principle one of the duties which fell to my share was the instruction of a class in mathematics and i usually found that euclid and the ancient geometry generally when properly and sympathetically addressed to the understanding formed a most attractive study for youth but it was my habitual practice to withdraw the boys from the routine of the book and to appeal to their selfpower in the treatment of questions not comprehended in that routine at first the change from the beaten track usually excited aversion the youth felt like a child amid strangers but in no single instance did this feeling continue when utterly disheartened i have encouraged the boy by the anecdote of newton where he attributes the difference between him and other men mainly to his own patience or of mirabeau when he ordered his servant who had stated something to be impossible never again to use that blockhead of a word thus cheered the boy has returned to his task with a smile which perhaps had something of doubt in it but which nevertheless evinced a resolution to try again i have seen his eye brighten and at length with a pleasure of which the ecstasy of archimedes was but a simple expansion heard him exclaim i have it sir the consciousness of selfpower thus awakened was of immense value and animated by it the progress of the class was astonishing it was often my custom to give the boys the choice of pursuing their propositions in the book or of trying their strength at others not to be found there never in a single instance was the book chosen i was ever ready to assist when help was needful but my offers of assistance were habitually declined the boys had tasted the sweets of intellectual conquest and demanded victories of their own their diagrams were scratched on the walls cut into the beams upon the playground and numberless other illustrations were afforded of the living interest they took in the subject for my own part as far as experience in teaching goes i was a mere fledglingknowing nothing of the rules of pedagogics as the germans name it but adhering to the spirit indicated at the commencement of this discourse and endeavouring to make geometry a means rather than a branch of education the experiment was successful and some of the most delightful hours of my existence have been spent in marking the vigorous and cheerful expansion of mental power when appealed to in the manner here described our pleasure was enhanced when we applied our mathematical knowledge to the solution of physical problems many objects of hourly contact had thus a new interest and significance imparted to them the swing the seesaw the tension of the giantstride ropes the fall and rebound of the football the advantage of a small boy over a large one when turning short particularly in slippy weather all became subjects of investigation a lady stands before a lookingglass of her own height it was required to know how much of the glass was really useful to her we learned with pleasure the economic fact that she might dispense with the lower half and see her whole figure notwithstanding it was also pleasant to prove by mathematics and verify by experiment that the angular velocity of a reflected beam is twice that of the mirror which reflects it from the hum of a bee we were able to determine the number of times the insect flaps its wings in a second following up our researches upon the pendulum we learned how colonel sabine had made it the means of determining the figure of the earth and we were also startled by the inference which the pendulum enabled us to draw that if the diurnal velocity of the earth were seventeen times its present amount the centrifugal force at the equator would be precisely equal to the force of gravitation so that an inhabitant of those regions would then have the same tendency to fall upwards as downwards all these things were sources of wonder and delight to us and when we remembered that we were gifted with the powers which had reached such results and that the same great field was ours to work in our hopes arose that at some future day we might possibly push the subject a little further and add our own victories to the conquests already won i ought to apologise to you for dwelling so long upon this subject but the days spent among these young philosophers made a deep impression on me i learned among them something of myself and of human nature and obtained some notion of a teachers vocation if there be one profession in england of paramount importance i believe it to be that of the schoolmaster and if there be a position where selfishness and incompetence do most serious mischief by lowering the moral tone and exciting irreverence and cunning where reverence and noble truthfulness ought to be the feelings evoked it is that of the principal of a school when a man of enlarged heart and mind comes among boys when he allows his spirit to stream through them and observes the operation of his own character evidenced in the elevation of theirsit would be idle to talk of the position of such a man being honourable it is a blessed position the man is a blessing to himself and to all around him such men i believe are to be found in england and it behoves those who busy themselves with the mechanics of education at the present day to seek them out for no matter what means of culture may be chosen whether physical or philological success must ever mainly depend upon the amount of life love and earnestness which the teacher himself brings with him to his vocation let me again and finally remind you that the claims of that science which finds in me today its unripened advocate are those of the logic of nature upon the reason of her childthat its disciplines as an agent of culture are based upon the natural relations subsisting between man and the universe of which he forms a part on the one side we have the apparently lawless shifting of phenomena on the other side mind which requires law for its equilibrium and through its own indestructible instincts as well as through the teachings of experience knows that these phenomena are reducible to law to chasten this apparent chaos is a problem which man has set before him the world was built in order and to us are trusted the will and power to discern its harmonies and to make them the lessons of our lives from the cradle to the grave we are surrounded with objects which provoke inquiry descending for a moment from this high plea to considerations which lie closer to us as a nationas a land of gas and furnaces of steam and electricity as a land which science practically applied has made great in peace and mighty in war i ask you whether this land of old and just renown has not a right to expect from her institutions a culture more in accordance with her present needs than that supplied by declension and conjugation and if the tendency should be to lower the estimate of science by regarding it exclusively as the instrument of material prosperity let it be the high mission of our universities to furnish the proper counterpoise by pointing out its nobler useslifting the national mind to the contemplation of it as the last development of that increasing purpose which runs through the ages and widens the thoughts of men xii on crystalline and slaty cleavage footnote from a discourse delivered in the royal institution of great britain june 6 1856 when the student of physical science has to investigate the character of any natural force his first care must be to purify it from the mixture of other forces and thus study its simple action if for example he wishes to know how a mass of liquid would shape itself if at liberty to follow the bent of its own molecular forces he must see that these forces have free and undisturbed exercise we might perhaps refer him to the dewdrop for a solution of the question but here we have to do not only with the action of the molecules of the liquid upon each other but also with the action of gravity upon the mass which pulls the drop downwards and elongates it if he would examine the problem in its purity he must do as plateau has done detach the liquid mass from the action of gravity he would then find the shape to be a perfect sphere natural processes come to us in a mixed manner and to the uninstructed mind are a mass of unintelligible confusion suppose halfadozen of the best musical performers to be placed in the same room each playing his own instrument to perfection but no two playing the same tune though each individual instrument might be a source of perfect music still the mixture of all would produce mere noise thus it is with the processes of nature where mechanical and molecular laws intermingle and create apparent confusion their mixture constitutes what may be called the noise of natural laws and it is the vocation of the man of science to resolve this noise into its components and thus to detect the underlying music the necessity of this detachment of one force from all other forces is nowhere more strikingly exhibited than in the phenomena of crystallisation here for example is a solution of common sulphate of soda or glauber salt looking into it mentally we see the molecules of that liquid like disciplined squadrons under a governing eye arranging themselves into battalions gathering round distinct centres and forming themselves into solid masses which after a time assume the visible shape of the crystal now held in my hand i may like an ignorant meddler wishing to hasten matters introduce confusion into this order this may be done by plunging a glass rod into the vessel the consequent action is not the pure expression of the crystalline forces the molecules rush together with the confusion of an unorganised mob and not with the steady accuracy of a disciplined host in this mass of bismuth also we have an example of confused crystallisation but in the crucible behind me a slower process is going on here there is an architect at work who makes no chips no din and who is now building the particles into crystals similar in shape and structure to those beautiful masses which we see upon the table by permitting alum to crystallise in this slow way we obtain these perfect octahedrons by allowing carbonate of lime to crystallise nature produces these beautiful rhomboids when silica crystallises we have formed these hexagonal prisms capped at the ends by pyramids by allowing saltpetre to crystallise we have these prismatic masses and when carbon crystallises we have the diamond if we wish to obtain a perfect crystal we must allow the molecular forces free play if the crystallising mass be permitted to rest upon a surface it will be flattened and to prevent this a small crystal must be so suspended as to be surrounded on all sides by the liquid or if it rest upon the surface it must be turned daily so as to present all its faces in succession to the working builder in building up crystals these little atomic bricks often arrange themselves into layers which are perfectly parallel to each other and which can be separated by mechanical means this is called the cleavage of the crystal the crystal of sugar i hold in my hand has thus far escaped the solvent and abrading forces which sooner or later determine the fate of sugarcandy i readily discover that it cleaves with peculiar facility in one direction again i lay my knife upon this piece of rocksalt and with a blow cleave it in one direction laying the knife at right angles to its former position the crystal cleaves again and finally placing the knife at right angles to the two former positions we find a third cleavage rocksalt cleaves in three directions and the resulting solid is this perfect cube which may be broken up into any number of smaller cubes iceland spar also cleaves in three directions not at right angles but oblique to each other the resulting solid being a rhomboid in each of these cases the mass cleaves with equal facility in all three directions for the sake of completeness i may say that many crystals cleave with unequal facility in different directions heavy spar presents an example of this kind of cleavage turn we now to the consideration of some other phenomena to which the term cleavage may be applied beech deal and other woods cleave with facility along the fibre and this cleavage is most perfect when the edge of the axe is laid across the rings which mark the growth of the tree if you look at this bundle of hay severed from a rick you will see a sort of cleavage in it also the stalks lie in horizontal planes and only a small force is required to separate them laterally but we cannot regard the cleavage of the tree as the same in character as that of the hayrick in the one case it is the molecules arranging themselves according to organic laws which produce a cleavable structure in the other case the easy separation in one direction is due to the mechanical arrangement of the coarse sensible stalks of hay this sandstone rock was once a powder held in mechanical suspension by water the powder was composed of two distinct parts fine grains of sand and small plates of mica imagine a wide strand covered by a tide or an estuary with water which holds such powder in suspension how will it sink the rounded grains of sand will reach the bottom first because they encounter least resistance the mica afterwards and when the tide recedes we have the little plates shining like spangles upon the surface of the sand each successive tide brings its charge of mixed powder deposits its duplex layer day after day and finally masses of immense thickness are piled up which by preserving the alternations of sand and mica tell the tale of their formation take the sand and mica mix them together in water and allow them to subside they will arrange themselves in the manner indicated and by repeating the process you can actually build up a mass which shall be the exact counterpart of that presented by nature now this structure cleaves with readiness along the planes in which the particles of mica are strewn specimens of such a rock sent to me from halifax and other masses from the quarries of over darwen in lancashire are here before you with a hammer and chisel i can cleave them into flags indeed these flags are employed for roofing purposes in the districts from which the specimens have come and receive the name of slatestone but you will discern without a word from me that this cleavage is not a crystalline cleavage any more than that of a hayrick is it is molar not molecular this so far as i am aware of has never been imagined and it has been agreed among geologists not to call such splitting as this cleavage at all but to restrict the term to a phenomenon of a totally different character those who have visited the slate quarries of cumberland and north wales will have witnessed the phenomenon to which i refer we have long drawn our supply of roofingslates from such quarries schoolboys ciphered on these slates they were used for tombstones in churchyards and for billiardtables in the metropolis but not until a comparatively late period did men begin to enquire how their wonderful structure was produced what is the agency which enables us to split honister crag or the cliffs of snowdon into laminae from crown to base this question is at the present moment one of the great difficulties of geologists and occupies their attention perhaps more than any other you may wonder at this looking into the quarry of penrhyn you may be disposed to offer the explanation i heard given two years ago these planes of cleavage said a friend who stood beside me on the quarrys edge are the planes of stratification which have been lifted by some convulsion into an almost vertical position but this was a mistake and indeed here lies the grand difficulty of the problem the planes of cleavage stand in most cases at a high angle to the bedding thanks to sir roderick murchison i am able to place the proof of this before you here is a specimen of slate in which both the planes of cleavage and of bedding are distinctly marked one of them making a large angle with the other this is common the cleavage of slates then is not a question of stratification what then is its cause in an able and elaborate essay published in 1835 prof sedgwick proposed the theory that cleavage is due to the action of crystalline or polar forces subsequent to the consolidation of the rock we may affirm he says that no retreat of the parts no contraction of dimensions in passing to a solid state can explain such phenomena they appear to me only resolvable on the supposition that crystalline or polar forces acted upon the whole mass simultaneously in one direction and with adequate force and again in another place crystalline forces have rearranged whole mountain masses producing a beautiful crystalline cleavage passing alike through all the strata footnote transactions of the geological society ser ii vol iii p 477 the utterance of such a man struck deep as it ought to do into the minds of geologists and at the present day there are few who do not entertain this view either in whole or in part footnote in a letter to sir charles lyell dated from the cape of good hope february 20 1836 sir john herschel writes as follows if rocks have been so heated as to allow of a commencement of crystallisation that is to say if they have been heated to a point at which the particles can begin to move amongst themselves or at least on their own axes some general law must then determine the position in which these particles will rest on cooling probably that position will have some relation to the direction in which the heat escapes now when all or a majority of particles of the same nature have a general tendency to one position that must of course determine a cleavage plane the boldness of the theory indeed has in some cases caused speculation to run riot and we have books published on the action of polar forces and geologic magnetism which rather astonish those who know something about the subject according to this theory whole districts of north wales and cumberland mountains included are neither more nor less than the parts of a gigantic crystal these masses of slate were originally fine mud composed of the broken and abraded particles of older rocks they contain silica alumina potash soda and mica mixed mechanically together in the course of ages the mixture became consolidated and the theory before us assumes that a process of crystallisation afterwards rearranged the particles and developed in it a single plane of cleavage though a bold and i think inadmissible stretch of analogies this hypothesis has done good service right or wrong a thoughtfully uttered theory has a dynamic power which operates against intellectual stagnation and even by provoking opposition is eventually of service to the cause of truth it would however have been remarkable if among the ranks of geologists themselves men were not found to seek an explanation of slatecleavage involving a less hardy assumption the first step in an enquiry of this kind is to seek facts this has been done and the labours of daniel sharpe the late president of the geological society who to the loss of science and the sorrow of all who knew him has so suddenly been taken away from us mr henry clifton sorby and others have furnished us with a body of facts associated with slaty cleavage and having a most important bearing upon the question fossil shells are found in these slaterocks i have here several specimens of such shells in the actual rock and occupying various positions in regard to the cleavage planes they are squeezed distorted and crushed in all cases the distortion leads to the inference that the rock which contains these shells has been subjected to enormous pressure in a direction at right angles to the planes of cleavage the shells are all flattened and spread out in these planes compare this fossil trilobite of normal proportions with these others which have suffered distortion some have lain across some along and some oblique to the cleavage of the slate in which they are found but in all cases the distortion is such as required for its production a compressing force acting at right angles to the planes of cleavage as the trilobites lay in the mud the jaws of a gigantic vice appear to have closed upon them and squeezed them into the shapes you see we sometimes find a thin layer of coarse gritty material between two layers of finer rock through which and across the gritty layer pass the planes of lamination the coarse layer is found bent by the pressure into sinuosities like a contorted ribbon mr sorby has described a striking case of this kind this crumpling can be experimentally imitated the amount of compression might moreover be roughly estimated by supposing the contorted bed to be stretched out its length measured and compared with the shorter distance into which it has been squeezed we find in this way that the yielding of the mass has been considerable let me now direct your attention to another proof of pressure you see the varying colours which indicate the bedding on this mass of slate the dark portion is gritty being composed of comparatively coarse particles which owing to their size shape and gravity sink first and constitute the bottom of each layer gradually from bottom to top the coarseness diminishes and near the upper surface we have a layer of exceedingly fine grain it is the fine mud thus consolidated from which are derived the german razorstones so much prized for the sharpening of surgical instruments when a bed is thin the finegrain slate is permitted to rest upon a slab of the coarse slate in contact with it when the fine bed is thick it is cut into slices which are cemented to pieces of ordinary slate and thus rendered stronger the mud thus deposited is as might be expected often rolled up into nodular masses carried forward and deposited among coarser material by the rivers from which the slatemud has subsided here are such nodules enclosed in sandstone everybody moreover who has ciphered upon a schoolslate must remember the whitishgreen spots which sometimes dotted the surface of the slate and over which the pencil usually slid as if the spots were greasy now these spots are composed of the finer mud and they could not on account of their fineness bite the pencil like the surrounding gritty portions of the slate here is a beautiful example of these spots you observe them on the cleavage surface in broad round patches but turn the slate edgeways and the section of each nodule is seen to be a sharp oval with its longer axis parallel to the cleavage this instructive fact has been adduced by mr sorby i have made excursions to the quarries of wales and cumberland and to many of the slate yards of london and found the fact general thus we elevate a common experience of our boyhood into evidence of the highest significance as regards a most important geological problem from the magnetic deportment of these slates i was led to infer that these spots contain a less amount of iron than the surrounding dark slate an analysis was made for me by mr hambly in the laboratory of dr percy at the school of mines with the following result analysis of slate dark slate two analyses 1 percentage of iron 585 2 percentage of iron 613 mean 599 whitish green slate 1 percentage of iron 324 2 percentage of iron 312 mean 318 according to these analyses the quantity of iron in the dark slate immediately adjacent to the greenish spot is nearly double the quantity contained in the spot itself this is about the proportion which the magnetic experiments suggested let me now remind you that the facts brought before you are typicaleach is the representative of a class we have seen shells crushed the trilobites squeezed beds contorted nodules of greenish marl flattened and all these sources of independent testimony point to one and the same conclusion namely that slaterocks have been subjected to enormous pressure in a direction at right angles to the planes of cleavage in reference to mr sorbys contorted bed i have said that by supposing it to be stretched out and its length measured it would give us an idea of the amount of yielding of the mass above and below the bed such a measurement however would not give the exact amount of yielding i hold in my hand a specimen of slate with its bedding marked upon it the lower portions of each layer being composed of a comparatively coarse gritty material something like what you may suppose the contorted bed to be composed of now in crossing these gritty portions the cleavage turns as if tending to cross the bedding at another angle when the pressure began to act the intermediate bed which is not entirely unyielding suffered longitudinal pressure as it bent the pressure became gradually more transverse and the direction of its cleavage is exactly such as you would infer from an action of this kindit is neither quite across the bed nor yet in the same direction as the cleavage of the slate above and below it but intermediate between both supposing the cleavage to be at right angles to the pressure this is the direction which it ought to take across these more unyielding strata thus we have established the concurrence of the phenomena of cleavage and pressurethat they accompany each other but the question still remains is the pressure sufficient to account for the cleavage a single geologist as far as i am aware answers boldly in the affirmative this geologist is sorby who has attacked the question in the true spirit of a physical investigator call to mind the cleavage of the flags of halifax and over darwen which is caused by the interposition of layers of mica between the gritty strata mr sorby finds plates of mica to be also a constituent of slaterock he asks himself what will be the effect of pressure upon a mass containing such plates confusedly mixed up in it it will be he argues and he argues rightly to place the plates with their flat surfaces more or less perpendicular to the direction in which the pressure is exerted he takes scales of the oxide of iron mixes them with a fine powder and on squeezing the mass finds that the tendency of the scales is to set themselves at right angles to the line of pressure along the planes of weakness produced by the scales the mass cleaves by tests of a different character from those applied by mr sorby it might be shown how true his conclusion isthat the effect of pressure on elongated particles or plates will be such as he describes it but while the scales must be regarded as a true cause i should not ascribe to them a large share in the production of the cleavage i believe that even if the plates of mica were wholly absent the cleavage of slaterocks would be much the same as it is at present here is a mass of pure white wax it contains no mica particles no scales of iron or anything analogous to them here is the selfsame substance submitted to pressure i would invite the attention of the eminent geologists now before me to the structure of this wax no slate ever exhibited so clean a cleavage it splits into laminae of surpassing tenuity and proves at a single stroke that pressure is sufficient to produce cleavage and that this cleavage is independent of intermixed plates or scales i have purposely mixed this wax with elongated particles and am unable to say at the present moment that the cleavage is sensibly affected by their presenceif anything i should say they rather impair its fineness and clearness than promote it the finer the slate is the more perfect will be the resemblance of its cleavage to that of the wax compare the surface of the wax with the surface of this slate from borrodale in cumberland you have precisely the same features in both you see flakes clinging to the surfaces of each which have been partially torn away in cleaving let any close observer compare these two effects he will i am persuaded be led to the conclusion that they are the product of a common cause footnote i have usually softened the wax by warming it kneaded it with the fingers and pressed it between thick plates of glass previously wetted at the ordinary summer temperature the pressed wax is soft and tears rather than cleaves on this account i cool my compressed specimens in a mixture of pounded ice and salt and when thus cooled they split cleanly but you will ask me how according to my view does pressure produce this remarkable result this may be stated in a very few words there is no such thing in nature as a body of perfectly homogeneous structure i break this clay which seems so uniform and find that the fracture presents to my eyes innumerable surfaces along which it has given way and it has yielded along those surfaces because in them the cohesion of the mass is less than elsewhere i break this marble and even this wax and observe the same result look at the mud at the bottom of a dried pond look at some of the ungravelled walks in kensington gardens on drying after rainthey are cracked and split and other circumstances being equal they crack and split where the cohesion is a minimum take then a mass of partially consolidated mud such a mass is divided and subdivided by interior surfaces along which the cohesion is comparatively small penetrate the mass in idea and you will see it composed of numberless irregular polyhedra bounded by surfaces of weak cohesion imagine such a mass subjected to pressureit yields and spreads out in the direction of least resistance the little polyhedra become converted into laminae separated from each other by surfaces of weak cohesion and the infallible result will be a tendency to cleave at right angles to the line of pressure footnote it is scarcely necessary to say that if the mass were squeezed equally in all directions no laminated structure could be produced it must have room to yield in a lateral direction mr warren de la rue informs me that he once wished to obtain whitelead in a fine granular state and to accomplish this he first compressed it the mould was conical and permitted the lead to spread out a little laterally the lamination was as perfect as that of slate and it quite defeated him in his effort to obtain a granular powder further a mass of dried mud is full of cavities and fissures if you break dried pipeclay you see them in great numbers and there are multitudes of them so small that you cannot see them a flattening of these cavities must take place in squeezed mud and this must to some extent facilitate the cleavage of the mass in the direction indicated although the time at my disposal has not permitted me duly to develope these thoughts yet for the last twelve months the subject has presented itself to me almost daily under one aspect or another i have never eaten a biscuit during this period without remarking the cleavage developed by the rollingpin you have only to break a biscuit across and to look at the fracture to see the laminated structure we have here the means of pushing the analogy further i invite you to compare the structure of this slate which was subjected to a high temperature during the conflagration of mr scott russells premises with that of a biscuit air or vapour within the slate has caused it to swell and the mechanical structure it reveals is precisely that of a biscuit during these enquiries i have received much instruction in the manufacture of puffpaste here is some such paste baked under my own superintendence the cleavage of our hills is accidental cleavage but this is cleavage with intention the volition of the pastrycook has entered into its formation it has been his aim to preserve a series of surfaces of structural weakness along which the dough divides into layers puffpaste in preparation must not be handled too much it ought moreover to be rolled on a cold slab to prevent the butter from melting and diffusing itself thus rendering the paste more homogeneous and less liable to split puffpaste is then simply an exaggerated case of slaty cleavage the principle here enunciated is so simple as to be almost trivial nevertheless it embraces not only the cases mentioned but if time permitted it might be shown you that the principle has a much wider range of application when iron is taken from the puddling furnace it is more or less spongy an aggregate in fact of small nodules it is at a welding heat and at this temperature is submitted to the process of rolling bright smooth bars are the result but notwithstanding the high heat the nodules do not perfectly blend together the process of rolling draws them into fibres here is a mass acted upon by dilute sulphuric acid which exhibits in a striking manner this fibrous structure the experiment was made by my friend dr percy without any reference to the question of cleavage break a piece of ordinary iron and you have a granular fracture heat the iron you elongate these granules and finally render the mass fibrous here are pieces of rails along which the wheels of locomotives have slidden the granules have yielded and become plates they exfoliate or come off in leaves all these effects belong i believe to the great class of phenomena of which slaty cleavage forms the most prominent example footnote for some further observations on this subject by mr sorby and myself see philosophical magazine for august 1856 we have now reached the termination of our task you have witnessed the phenomena of crystallisation and have had placed before you the facts which are found associated with the cleavage of slate rocks such facts as expressed by helmholtz are so many telescopes to our spiritual vision by which we can see backward through the night of antiquity and discern the forces which have been in operation upon the earths surface ere the lion roared or the eagle soared from evidence of the most independent and trustworthy character we come to the conclusion that these slaty masses have been subjected to enormous pressure and by the sure method of experiment we have shownand this is the only really new point which has been brought before youhow the pressure is sufficient to produce the cleavage expanding our field of view we find the selfsame law whose footsteps we trace amid the crags of wales and cumberland extending into the domain of the pastrycook and ironfounder nay a wheel cannot roll over the halfdried mud of our streets without revealing to us more or less of the features of this law let me say in conclusion that the spirit in which this problem has been attacked by geologists indicates the dawning of a new day for their science the great intellects who have laboured at geology and who have raised it to its present pitch of grandeur were compelled to deal with the subject in mass they had no time to look after details but the desire for more exact knowledge is increasing facts are flowing in which while they leave untouched the intrinsic wonders of geology are gradually supplanting by solid truths the uncertain speculations which beset the subject in its infancy geologists now aim to imitate as far as possible the conditions of nature and to produce her results they are approaching more and more to the domain of physics and i trust the day will soon come when we shall interlace our friendly arms across the common boundary of our sciences and pursue our respective tasks in a spirit of mutual helpfulness encouragement and goodwill i would now lay more stress on the lateral yielding referred to in the footnote concerning mr warren de la rues attempt to produce finely granular whitelead accompanied as it is by tangential sliding than i was prepared to do when this lecture was given this sliding is i think the principal cause of the planes of weakness both in pressed wax and slate rock j t 1871 xiii on paramagnetic and diamagnetic forces footnote abstract of a discourse delivered in the royal institution february 1 1856 the notion of an attractive force which draws bodies towards the centre of the earth was entertained by anaxagoras and his pupils by democritus pythagoras and epicurus and the conjectures of these ancients were renewed by galileo huyghens and others who stated that bodies attract each other as a magnet attracts iron kepler applied the notion to bodies beyond the surface of the earth and affirmed the extension of this force to the most distant stars thus it would appear that in the attraction of iron by a magnet originated the conception of the force of gravitation nevertheless if we look closely at the matter it will be seen that the magnetic force possesses characters strikingly distinct from those of the force which holds the universe together the theory of gravitation is that every particle of matter attracts every other particle in magnetism also we have attraction but we have always at the same time repulsion the final effect being due to the difference of these two forces a body may be intensely acted on by a magnet and still no motion of translation will follow if the repulsion be equal to the attraction previous to magnetization a dipping needle when its centre of gravity is supported stands accurately level but after magnetization one end of it in our latitude is pulled towards the north pole of the earth the needle however being suspended from the arm of a fine balance its weight is found unaltered by its magnetization in like manner when the needle is permitted to float upon a liquid and thus to follow the attraction of the north magnetic pole of the earth there is no motion of the mass towards that pole the reason is known to be that although the marked end of the needle is attracted by the north pole the unmarked end is repelled by an equal force the two equal and opposite forces neutralizing each other when the pole of an ordinary magnet is brought to act upon the swimming needle the latter is attractedthe reason being that the attracted end of the needle being nearer to the pole of the magnet than the repelled end the force of attraction is the more powerful of the two in the case of the earth its pole is so distant that the length of the needle is practically zero in like manner when a piece of iron is presented to a magnet the nearer parts are attracted while the more distant parts are repelled and because the attracted portions are nearer to the magnet than the repelled ones we have a balance in favour of attraction here then is the special characteristic of the magnetic force which distinguishes it from that of gravitation the latter is a simple unpolar force while the former is duplex or polar were gravitation like magnetism a stone would no more fall to the ground than a piece of iron towards the north magnetic pole and thus however rich in consequences the supposition of kepler and others may have been it is clear that a force like that of magnetism would not be able to transact the business of the universe the object of this discourse is to enquire whether the force of diamagnetism which manifests itself as a repulsion of certain bodies by the poles of a magnet is to be ranged as a polar force beside that of magnetism or as an unpolar force beside that of gravitation when a cylinder of soft iron is placed within a wire helix and surrounded by an electric current the antithesis of its two ends or in other words its polar excitation is at once manifested by its action upon a magnetic needle and it may be asked why a cylinder of bismuth may not be substituted for the cylinder of iron and its state similarly examined the reason is that the excitement of the bismuth is so feeble that it would be quite masked by that of the helix in which it is enclosed and the problem that now meets us is so to excite a diamagnetic body that the pure action of the body upon a magnetic needle may be observed unmixed with the action of the body used to excite the diamagnetic how this has been effected may be illustrated in the following manner when through an upright helix of covered copper wire a voltaic current is sent the top of the helix attracts while its bottom repels the same pole of a magnetic needle its central point on the contrary is neutral and exhibits neither attraction nor repulsion such a helix is caused to stand between the two poles ns of an astatic system footnote the reversal of the poles of the two magnets which were of the same strength completely annulled the action of the earth as a magnet the two magnets s n and sn are united by a rigid cross piece at their centres and are suspended from the point a so that both magnets swing in the same horizontal plane it is so arranged that the poles n s are opposite to the central or neutral point of the helix so that when a current is sent through the latter the magnets as before explained are unaffected here then we have an excited helix which itself has no action upon the magnets and we are thus enabled to examine the action of a body placed within the helix and excited by it undisturbed by the influence of the latter the helix being 12 inches high a cylinder of soft iron 6 inches long suspended from a string and passing over a pulley can be raised or lowered within the helix when it is so far sunk that its lower end rests upon the table the upper end finds itself between the poles ns of the astatic system the iron cylinder is thus converted into a strong magnet attracting one of the poles and repelling the other and consequently deflecting the entire astatic system when the cylinder is raised so that the upper end is at the level of the top of the helix its lower end comes between the poles ns and a deflection opposed in direction to the former one is the immediate consequence to render these deflections more easily visible a mirror m is attached to the system of magnets a beam of light thrown upon the mirror being reflected and projected as a bright disk against the wall the distance of this image from the mirror being considerable and its angular motion double that of the latter a very slight motion of the magnet is sufficient to produce a displacement of the image through several yards this then is the principle of the beautiful apparatus footnote devised by prof w weber and constructed by m leyser of leipzig by which the investigation was conducted it is manifest that if a second helix be placed between the poles sn with a cylinder within it the action upon the astatic magnet may be exalted this was the arrangement made use of in the actual enquiry thus to intensify the feeble action which it is here our object to seek we have in the first place neutralized the action of the earth upon the magnets by placing them astatically secondly by making use of two cylinders and permitting them to act simultaneously on the four poles of the magnets we have rendered the deflecting force four times what it would be if only a single pole were used finally the whole apparatus was enclosed in a suitable case which protected the magnets from aircurrents and the deflections were read off through a glass plate in the case by means of a telescope and scale placed at a considerable distance from the instrument a pair of bismuth cylinders was first examined sending a current through the helices and observing that the magnets swung perfectly free it was first arranged that the bismuth cylinders within the helices had their central or neutral points opposite to the poles of the magnets all being at rest the number on the scale marked by the cross wire of the telescope was 572 the cylinders were then moved one up the other down so that two of their ends were brought to bear simultaneously upon the magnetic poles the magnet moved promptly and after some oscillations footnote to lessen these a copper damper was made use of came to rest at the number 612 thus moving from a smaller to a larger number the other two ends of the bars were next brought to bear upon the magnet a prompt deflection was the consequence and the final position of equilibrium was 526 the movement being from a larger to a smaller number we thus observe a manifest polar action of the bismuth cylinders upon the magnet one pair of ends deflecting it in one direction and the other pair deflecting it in the opposite direction substituting for the cylinders of bismuth thin cylinders of iron of magnetic slate of sulphate of iron carbonate of iron protochloride of iron red ferrocyanide of potassium and other magnetic bodies it was found that when the position of the magnetic cylinders was the same as that of the cylinders of bismuth the deflection produced by the former was always opposed in direction to that produced by the latter and hence the disposition of the force in the diamagnetic body must have been precisely antithetical to its disposition in the magnetic ones but it will be urged and indeed has been urged against this inference that the deflection produced by the bismuth cylinders may be due to induced currents excited in the metal by its motion within the helices in reply to this objection it may be stated in the first place that the deflection is permanent and cannot therefore be due to induced currents which are only of momentary duration it has also been urged that such experiments ought to be made with other metals and with better conductors than bismuth for if due to currents of induction the better the conductor the more exalted will be the effect this requirement was complied with cylinders of antimony were substituted for those of bismuth this metal is a better conductor of electricity but less strongly diamagnetic than bismuth if therefore the action referred to be due to induced currents we ought to have it greater in the case of antimony than with bismuth but if it springs from a true diamagnetic polarity the action of the bismuth ought to exceed that of the antimony experiment proves this to be the case hence the deflection produced by these metals is due to their diamagnetic and not to their conductive capacity copper cylinders were next examined here we have a metal which conducts electricity fifty times better than bismuth but its diamagnetic power is nearly null if the effects be due to induced currents we ought to have them here in an enormously exaggerated degree but no sensible deflection was produced by the two cylinders of copper it has also been proposed by the opponents of diamagnetic polarity to coat fragments of bismuth with some insulating substance so as to render the formation of induced currents impossible and to test the question with cylinders of these fragments this requirement was also fulfilled it is only necessary to reduce the bismuth to powder and expose it for a short time to the air to cause the particles to become so far oxidised as to render them perfectly insulating the insulating power of the powder was exhibited experimentally nevertheless this powder enclosed in glass tubes exhibited an action scarcely less powerful than that of the massive bismuth cylinders but the most rigid proof a proof admitted to be conclusive by those who have denied the antithesis of magnetism and diamagnetism remains to be stated prisms of the same heavy glass as that with which the diamagnetic force was discovered were substituted for the metallic cylinders and their action upon the magnet was proved to be precisely the same in kind as that of the cylinders of bismuth the enquiry was also extended to other insulators to phosphorus sulphur nitre calcareous spar statuary marble with the same invariable result each of these substances was proved to be polar the disposition of the force being the same as that of bismuth and the reverse of that of iron when a bar of iron is set erect its lower end is known to be a north pole and its upper end a south pole in virtue of the earths induction a marble statue on the contrary has its feet a south pole and its head a north pole and there is no doubt that the same remark applies to its living archetype each man walking over the earths surface is a true diamagnet with its poles the reverse of those of a mass of magnetic matter of the same shape and position an experiment of practical value as affording a ready estimate of the different conductive powers of two metals for electricity was exhibited in the lecture for the purpose of proving experimentally some of the statements made in reference to this subject a cube of bismuth was suspended by a twisted string between the two poles of an electromagnet the cube was attached by a short copper wire to a little square pyramid the base of which was horizontal and its sides formed of four small triangular pieces of lookingglass a beam of light was suffered to fall upon this reflector and as the reflector followed the motion of the cube the images cast from its sides followed each other in succession each describing a circle about thirty feet in diameter as the velocity of rotation augmented these images blended into a continuous ring of light at a particular instant the electromagnet was excited currents were evolved in the rotating cube and the strength of these currents which increases with the conductivity of the cube for electricity was practically estimated by the time required to bring the cube and its associated mirrors to a state of rest with bismuth this time amounted to a score of seconds or more a cube of copper on the contrary was struck almost instantly motionless when the circuit was established xiv physical basis of solar chemistry footnote from a discourse delivered at the royal institution of great britain june 7 1861 omitting all preface attention was first drawn to an experimental arrangement intended to prove that gaseous bodies radiate heat in different degrees near a double screen of polished tin was placed an ordinary ring gasburner and on this was placed a hot copper ball from which a column of heated air ascended behind the screen but so situated that no ray from the ball could reach the instrument was an excellent thermoelectric pile connected by wires with a very delicate galvanometer the pile was known to be an instrument whereby heat is applied to the generation of electric currents the strength of the current being an accurate measure of the quantity of the heat as long as both faces of the pile are at the same temperature no current is produced but the slightest difference in the temperature of the two faces at once declares itself by the production of a current which when carried through the galvanometer indicates by the deflection of the needle both its strength and its direction the two faces of the pile were in the first instance brought to the same temperature the equilibrium being shown by the needle of the galvanometer standing at zero the rays emitted by the current of hot air already referred to were permitted to fall upon one of the faces of the pile and an extremely slight movement of the needle showed that the radiation from the hot air though sensible was extremely feeble connected with the ringburner was a holder containing oxygen gas and by turning a cock a stream of this gas was permitted to issue from the burner strike the copper ball and ascend in a heated column in front of the pile the result was that oxygen showed itself as a radiator of heat to be quite as feeble as atmospheric air a second holder containing olefiant gas was then connected with the ringburner oxygen and air had already flowed over the ball and cooled it in some degree hence the olefiant gas laboured under a disadvantage but on permitting the gas to rise from the ball it casts an amount of heat against the adjacent face of the pile sufficient to impel the needle of the galvanometer almost to 90 this experiment proved the vast difference between two equally invisible gases with regard to their power of emitting radiant heat the converse experiment was now performed the thermoelectric pile was removed and placed between two cubes filled with water kept in a state of constant ebullition and it was so arranged that the quantities of heat falling from the cubes on the opposite faces of the pile were exactly equal thus neutralising each other the needle of the galvanometer being at zero a sheet of oxygen gas was caused to issue from a slit between one of the cubes and the adjacent face of the pile if this sheet of gas possessed any sensible power of intercepting the thermal rays from the cube one face of the pile being deprived of the heat thus intercepted a difference of temperature between its two faces would instantly set in and the result would be declared by the galvanometer the quantity absorbed by the oxygen under those circumstances was too feeble to affect the galvanometer the gas in fact proved perfectly transparent to the rays of heat it had but a feeble power of radiation it had an equally feeble power of absorption the pile remaining in its position a sheet of olefiant gas was caused to issue from the same slit as that through which the oxygen had passed no one present could see the gas it was quite invisible the light went through it as freely as through oxygen or air but its effect upon the thermal rays emanating from the cube was what might be expected from a sheet of metal a quantity so large was cut off that the needle of the galvanometer promptly quitting the zero line moved with energy to its stops thus the olefiant gas so light and clear and pervious to luminous rays was proved to be a most potent destroyer of the rays emanating from an obscure source the reciprocity of action established in the case of oxygen comes out here the good radiator is found by this experiment to be the good absorber this result now exhibited before a public audience for the first time was typical of what had been obtained with gases generally going through the entire list of gases and vapours in this way we find radiation and absorption to be as rigidly associated as positive and negative in electricity or as north and south polarity in magnetism so that if we make the number which expresses the absorptive power the numerator of a fraction and that which expresses its radiative power the denominator the result would be that on account of the numerator and denominator varying in the same proportion the value of that fraction would always remain the same whatever might be the gas or vapour experimented with but why should this reciprocity exist what is the meaning of absorption what is the meaning of radiation when you cast a stone into still water rings of waves surround the place where it falls motion is radiated on all sides from the centre of disturbance when a hammer strikes a bell the latter vibrates and sound which is nothing more than an undulatory motion of the air is radiated in all directions modern philosophy reduces light and heat to the same mechanical category a luminous body is one with its atoms in a state of vibration a hot body is one with its atoms also vibrating but at a rate which is incompetent to excite the sense of vision and as a sounding body has the air around it through which it propagates its vibrations so also the luminous or heated body has a medium called aether which accepts its motions and carries them forward with inconceivable velocity radiation then as regards both light and heat is the transference of motion from the vibrating body to the aether in which it swings and as in the case of sound the motion imparted to the air is soon transferred to surrounding objects against which the aerial undulations strike the sound being in technical language absorbed so also with regard to light and heat absorption consists in the transference of motion from the agitated aether to the molecules of the absorbing body the simple atoms are found to be bad radiators the compound atoms good ones and the higher the degree of complexity in the atomic grouping the more potent as a general rule is the radiation and absorption let us get definite ideas here however gross and purify them afterwards by the process of abstraction imagine our simple atoms swinging like single spheres in the aether they cannot create the swell which a group of them united to form a system can produce an oar runs freely edgeways through the water and imparts far less of its motion to the water than when its broad flat side is brought to bear upon it in our present language the oar broad side vertical is a good radiator broad side horizontal it is a bad radiator conversely the waves of water impinging upon the flat face of the oarblade will impart a greater amount of motion to it than when impinging upon the edge in the position in which the oar radiates well it also absorbs well simple atoms glide through the aether without much resistance compound ones encounter resistance and hence yield up more speedily their motion to the aether mix oxygen and nitrogen mechanically they absorb and radiate a certain amount of heat cause these gases to combine chemically and form nitrous oxide both the absorption and radiation are thereby augmented hundreds of times in this way we look with the telescope of the intellect into atomic systems and obtain a conception of processes which the eye of sense can never reach but gases and vapours possess a power of choice as to the rays which they absorb they single out certain groups of rays for destruction and allow other groups to pass unharmed this is best illustrated by a famous experiment of sir david brewsters modified to suit present requirements into a glass cylinder with its ends stopped by discs of plateglass a small quantity of nitrous acid gas is introduced the presence of the gas being indicated by its rich brown colour the beam from an electric lamp being sent through two prisms of bisulphide of carbon a spectrum seven feet long and eighteen inches wide is cast upon the screen introducing the cylinder containing the nitrous acid into the path of the beam as it issues from the lamp the splendid and continuous spectrum becomes instantly furrowed by numerous dark bands the rays answering to which are intercepted by the nitric gas while the light which falls upon the intervening spaces is permitted to pass with comparative impunity here also the principle of reciprocity as regards radiation and absorption holds good and could we without otherwise altering its physical character render that nitrous gas luminous we should find that the very rays which it absorbs are precisely those which it would emit when atmospheric air and other gases are brought to a state of intense incandescence by the passage of an electric spark the spectra which we obtain from them consist of a series of bright bands but such spectra are produced with the greatest brilliancy when instead of ordinary gases we make use of metals heated so highly as to volatilise them this is easily done by the voltaic current a capsule of carbon filled with mercury which formed the positive electrode of the electric lamp has a carbon point brought down upon it on separating the one from the other a brilliant arc containing the mercury in a volatilised condition passes between them the spectrum of this arc is not continuous like that of the solid carbon points but consists of a series of vivid bands each corresponding in colour to that particular portion of the spectrum to which its rays belong copper gives its system of bands zinc gives its system and brass which is an alloy of copper and zinc gives a spectrum made up of the bands belonging to both metals not only however when metals are united like zinc and copper to form an alloy is it possible to obtain the bands which belong to them no matter how we may disguise the metalallowing it to unite with oxygen to form an oxide and this again with an acid to form a salt if the heat applied be sufficiently intense the bands belonging to the metal reveal themselves with perfect definition into holes drilled in a cylinder of retort carbon pure culinary salt is introduced when the carbon is made the positive electrode of the lamp the resultant spectrum shows the brilliant yellow lines of the metal sodium similar experiments made with the chlorides of strontium calcium lithium footnote the vividness of the colours of the lithium spectrum is extraordinary the spectrum moreover contained a blue band of indescribable splendour it was thought by many during the discourse that i had mistaken strontium for lithium as this blue band had never before been seen i have obtained it many times since and my friend dr miller having kindly analysed the substance made use of pronounces it pure chloride of lithiumj t and other metals give the bands due to the respective metals when different salts are mixed together and rammed into holes in the carbon a spectrum is obtained which contains the bands of them all the position of these bright bands never varies and each metal has its own system hence the competent observer can infer from the bands of the spectrum the metals which produce it it is a language addressed to the eye instead of the ear and the certainty would not be augmented if each metal possessed the power of audibly calling out i am here nor is this language affected by distance if we find that the sun or the stars give us the bands of our terrestrial metals it is a declaration on the part of these orbs that such metals enter into their composition does the sun give us any such intimation does the solar spectrum exhibit bright lines which we might compare with those produced by our terrestrial metals and prove either their identity or difference no the solar spectrum when closely examined gives us a multitude of fine dark lines instead of bright ones they were first noticed by dr wollaston but were multiplied and investigated with profound skill by fraunhofer and named after him fraunhofers lines they had been long a standing puzzle to philosophers the bright lines yielded by metallic vapours had been also known to us for years but the connection between both classes of phenomena was wholly unknown until kirchhoff with admirable acuteness revealed the secret and placed it at the same time in our power to chemically analyse the sun we have now some difficult work before us hitherto we have been delighted by objects which addressed themselves as much to our aesthetic taste as to our scientific faculty we have ridden pleasantly to the base of the final cone of etna and must now dismount and march through ashes and lava if we would enjoy the prospect from the summit our problem is to connect the dark lines of fraunhofer with the bright ones of the metals the white beam of the lamp is refracted in passing through our two prisms but its different components are refracted in different degrees and thus its colours are drawn apart now the colour depends solely upon the rate of oscillation of the atoms of the luminous body red light being produced by one rate blue light by a much quicker rate and the colours between red and blue by the intermediate rates the solid incandescent coalpoints give us a continuous spectrum or in other words they emit rays of all possible periods between the two extremes of the spectrum colour as many of you know is to light what pitch is to sound when a violinplayer presses his finger on a string he makes it shorter and tighter and thus causing it to vibrate more speedily heightens the pitch imagine such a player to move his fingers slowly along the string shortening it gradually as he draws his bow the note would rise in pitch by a regular gradation there would be no gap intervening between note and note here we have the analogue to the continuous spectrum whose colours insensibly blend together without gap or interruption from the red of the lowest pitch to the violet of the highest but suppose the player instead of gradually shortening his string to press his finger on a certain point and to sound the corresponding note then to pass on to another point more or less distant and sound its note then to another and so on thus sounding particular notes separated from each other by gaps which correspond to the intervals of the string passed over we should then have the exact analogue of a spectrum composed of separate bright bands with intervals of darkness between them but this though a perfectly true and intelligible analogy is not sufficient for our purpose we must look with the minds eye at the oscillating atoms of the volatilised metal figure these atoms as connected together by springs of a certain tension which if the atoms are squeezed together push them again asunder and if the atoms are drawn apart pull them again together causing them before coming to rest to quiver for a certain time at a certain definite rate determined by the strength of the spring now the volatilised metal which gives us one bright band is to be figured as having its atoms united by springs all of the same tension its vibrations are all of one kind the metal which gives us two bands may be figured as having some of its atoms united by springs of one tension and others by springs of a different tension its vibrations are of two distinct kinds so also when we have three or more bands we are to figure as many distinct sets of springs each capable of vibrating in its own particular time and at a different rate from the others if we seize this idea definitely we shall have no difficulty in dropping the metaphor of springs and substituting for it mentally the forces by which the atoms act upon each other having thus far cleared our way let us make another effort to advance a heavy ivory ball is here suspended from a string i blow against this ball a single puff of my breath moves it a little way from its position of rest it swings back towards me and when it reaches the limit of its swing i puff again it now swings further and thus by timing the puffs i can so accumulate their action as to produce oscillations of large amplitude the ivory ball here has absorbed the motion which my breath communicated to the air i now bring the ball to rest suppose instead of the breath a wave of air to strike against it and that this wave is followed by a series of others which succeed each other exactly in the same intervals as my puffs it is obvious that these waves would communicate their motion to the ball and cause it to swing as the puffs did and it is equally manifest that this would not be the case if the impulses of the waves were not properly timed for then the motion imparted to the pendulum by one wave would be neutralised by another and there could not be the accumulation of effect obtained when the periods of the waves correspond with the periods of the pendulum so much for the particular impulses absorbed by the pendulum but if such a pendulum set oscillating in air could produce waves in the air it is evident that the waves it would produce would be of the same period as those whose motions it would take up or absorb most completely if they struck against it perhaps the most curious effect of these timed impulses ever described was that observed by a watchmaker named ellicott in the year 1741 he left two clocks leaning against the same rail one of them which we may call a was set going the other b not some time afterwards he found to his surprise that b was ticking also the pendulums being of the same length the shocks imparted by the ticking of a to the rail against which both clocks rested were propagated to b and were so timed as to set b going other curious effects were at the same time observed when the pendulums differed from each other a certain amount set b going but the reaction of b stopped a then b set a going and the reaction of a stopped b when the periods of oscillation were close to each other but still not quite alike the clocks mutually controlled each other and by a kind of compromise they ticked in perfect unison but what has all this to do with our present subject the varied actions of the universe are all modes of motion and the vibration of a ray claims strict brotherhood with the vibrations of our pendulum suppose aethereal waves striking upon atoms which oscillate in the same periods as the waves the motion of the waves will be absorbed by the atoms suppose we send our beam of white light through a sodium flame the atoms of that flame will be chiefly affected by those undulations which are synchronous with their own periods of vibration there will be on the part of those particular rays a transference of motion from the agitated aether to the atoms of the volatilised metal which as already defined is absorption the experiment justifying this conclusion is now for the first time to be made before a public audience i pass a beam through our two prisms and the spectrum spreads its colours upon the screen between the lamp and the prism i interpose a snapdragon light alcohol and water are here mixed with common salt and the metal dish that holds them is heated by a spiritlamp the vapour from the mixture ignites and we have a monochromatic flame through this flame the beam from the lamp is now passing and observe the result upon the spectrum you see a shady band cut out of the yellownot very dark but sufficiently so to be seen by everybody present but let me exalt this effect placing in front of the electric lamp the intense flame of a large bunsens burner a platinum capsule containing a bit of sodium less than a pea in magnitude is plunged into the flame the sodium soon volatilises and burns with brilliant incandescence the beam crosses the flame and at the same time the yellow band of the spectrum is clearly and sharply cut out a band of intense darkness occupying its place on withdrawing the sodium the brilliant yellow of the spectrum takes its proper place while the reintroduction of the flame causes the band to reappear let me be more precise the yellow colour of the spectrum extends over a sensible space blending on one side with the orange and on the other with the green the term yellow band is therefore somewhat indefinite this vagueness may be entirely removed by dipping the carbonpoint used for the positive electrode into a solution of common salt and replacing it in the lamp the bright yellow band produced by the sodium vapour stands out from the spectrum when the sodium flame is caused to act upon the beam it is that particular yellow band that is obliterated an intensely black streak occupying its place an additional step of reasoning leads to the conclusion that if instead of the flame of sodium alone we were to introduce into the path of the beam a flame in which lithium strontium magnesium calcium c are in a state of volatilisation each metallic vapour would cut out a system of bands corresponding exactly in position with the bright bands of the same metallic vapour the light of our electric lamp shining through such a composite flame would give us a spectrum cut up by dark lines exactly as the solar spectrum is cut up by the lines of fraunhofer thus by the combination of the strictest reasoning with the most conclusive experiment we reach the solution of one of the grandest of scientific problemsthe constitution of the sun the sun consists of a nucleus surrounded by a flaming atmosphere the light of the nucleus would give us a continuous spectrum like that of our common carbonpoints but having to pass through the photosphere as our beam had to pass through the flame those rays of the nucleus which the photosphere can itself emit are absorbed and shaded spaces corresponding to the particular rays absorbed occur in the spectrum abolish the solar nucleus and we should have a spectrum showing a bright line in the place of every dark line of fraunhofer these lines are therefore not absolutely dark but dark by an amount corresponding to the difference between the light of the nucleus intercepted by the photosphere and the light which issues from the latter the man to whom we owe this noble generalisation is kirchhoff professor of natural philosophy in the university of heidelberg footnote now professor in the university of berlin but like every other great discovery it is compounded of various elements mr talbot observed the bright lines in the spectra of coloured flames sixteen years ago dr miller gave drawings and descriptions of the spectra of various coloured flames wheatstone with his accustomed ingenuity analysed the light of the electric spark and showed that the metals between which the spark passed determined the bright bands in the spectrum of the spark masson published a prize essay on these bands van der willigen and more recently plucker have given us beautiful drawings of the spectra obtained from the discharge of ruhmkorffs coil but none of these distinguished men betrayed the least knowledge of the connection between the bright bands of the metals and the dark lines of the solar spectrum the man who came nearest to the philosophy of the subject was angstrom in a paper translated from poggendorffs annalen by myself and published in the philosophical magazine for 1855 he indicates that the rays which a body absorbs are precisely those which it can emit when rendered luminous in another place he speaks of one of his spectra giving the general impression of a reversal of the solar spectrum foucault stokes and thomson have all been very close to the discovery and for my own part the examination of the radiation and absorption of heat by gases and vapours some of the results of which i placed before you at the commencement of this discourse would have led me in 1859 to the law on which all kirchhoffs speculations are founded had not an accident withdrawn me from the investigation but kirchhoffs claims are unaffected by these circumstances true much that i have referred to formed the necessary basis of his discovery so did the laws of kepler furnish to newton the basis of the theory of gravitation but what kirchhoff has done carries us far beyond all that had before been accomplished he has introduced the order of law amid a vast assemblage of empirical observations and has ennobled our previous knowledge by showing its relationship to some of the most sublime of natural phenomena xv elementary magnetism a lecture to schoolmasters we have no reason to believe that the sheep or the dog or indeed any of the lower animals feel an interest in the laws by which natural phenomena are regulated a herd may be terrified by a thunderstorm birds may go to roost and cattle return to their stalls during a solar eclipse but neither birds nor cattle as far as we know ever think of enquiring into the causes of these things it is otherwise with man the presence of natural objects the occurrence of natural events the varied appearances of the universe in which he dwells penetrate beyond his organs of sense and appeal to an inner power of which the senses are the mere instruments and excitants no fact is to him either original or final he cannot limit himself to the contemplation of it alone but endeavours to ascertain its position in a series to which uniform experience assures him it must belong he regards all that he witnesses in the present as the efflux and sequence of something that has gone before and as the source of a system of events which is to follow the notion of spontaneity by which in his ruder state he accounted for natural events is abandoned the idea that nature is an aggregate of independent parts also disappears as the connection and mutual dependence of physical powers become more and more manifest until he is finally led to regard nature as an organic wholeas a body each of whose members sympathises with the rest changing it is true from age to age but changing without break of continuity in the relation of cause and effect the system of things which we call nature is however too vast and various to be studied firsthand by any single mind as knowledge extends there is always a tendency to subdivide the field of investigation its various parts are taken up by different minds and thus receive a greater amount of attention than could possibly be bestowed on them if each investigator aimed at the mastery of the whole the centrifugal form in which knowledge as a whole advances spreading ever wider on all sides is due in reality to the exertions of individuals each of whom directs his efforts more or less along a single line accepting in many respects his culture from his fellowmentaking it from spoken words or from written booksin some one direction the student of nature ought actually to touch his work he may otherwise be a distributor of knowledge but not a creator and he fails to attain that vitality of thought and correctness of judgment which direct and habitual contact with natural truth can alone impart one large department of the system of nature which forms the chief subject of my own studies and to which it is my duty to call your attention this evening is that of physics or natural philosophy this term is large enough to cover the study of nature generally but it is usually restricted to a department which perhaps lies closer to our perceptions than any other it deals with the phenomena and laws of light and heatwith the phenomena and laws of magnetism and electricitywith those of soundwith the pressures and motions of liquids and gases whether at rest or in a state of translation or of undulation the science of mechanics is a portion of natural philosophy though at present so large as to need the exclusive attention of him who would cultivate it profoundly astronomy is the application of physics to the motions of the heavenly bodies the vastness of the field causing it however to bed regarded as a department in itself in chemistry physical agents play important parts by heat and light we cause atoms and molecules to unite or to fall asunder electricity exerts a similar power through their ability to separate nutritive compounds into their constituents the solar beams build up the whole vegetable world and by it the animal world the touch of the selfsame beams causes hydrogen and chlorine to unite with sudden explosion and to form by their combination a powerful acid thus physics and chemistry intermingle physical agents are however employed by the chemist as a means to an end while in physics proper the laws and phenomena of the agents themselves both qualitative and quantitative are the primary objects of attention my duty here tonight is to spend an hour in telling how this subject is to be studied and how a knowledge of it is to be imparted to others from the domain of physics which would be unmanageable as a whole i select as a sample the subject of magnetism i might readily entertain you on the present occasion with an account of what natural philosophy has accomplished i might point to those applications of science of which we hear so much in the newspapers and which are so often mistaken for science itself i might of course ring changes on the steamengine and the telegraph the electrotype and the photograph the medical applications of physics and the various other inlets by which scientific thought filters into practical life that would be easy compared with the task of informing you how you are to make the study of physics the instrument of your pupils culture how you are to possess its facts and make them living seeds which shall take root and grow in the mind and not lie like dead lumber in the storehouse of memory this is a task much heavier than the mere recounting of scientific achievements and it is one which feeling my own want of time to execute it aright i might well hesitate to accept but let me sink excuses and attack the work before me first and foremost then i would advise you to get a knowledge of facts from actual observation facts looked at directly are vital when they pass into words half the sap is taken out of them you wish for example to get a knowledge of magnetism well provide yourself with a good book on the subject if you can but do not be content with what the book tells you do not be satisfied with its descriptive woodcuts see the operations of the force yourself half of our book writers describe experiments which they never made and their descriptions often lack both force and truth but no matter how clever or conscientious they may be their written words cannot supply the place of actual observation every fact has numerous radiations which are shorn off by the man who describes it go then to a philosophical instrument maker and give a shilling or half a crown for a straight barmagnet or if you can afford it purchase a pair of them or get a smith to cut a length of ten inches from a bar of steel an inch wide and half an inch thick file its ends smoothly harden it and get somebody like myself to magnetise it procure some darning needles and also a little unspun silk which will give you a suspending fibre void of torsion make little loop of paper or of wire and attach your fibre to it do it neatly in the loop place a darningneedle and bring the two ends or poles as they are called of your barmagnet successively up to the ends of the needle both the poles you find attract both ends of the needle replace the needle by a bit of annealed iron wire the same effects ensue suspend successively little rods of lead copper silver brass wood glass ivory or whalebone the magnet produces no sensible effect upon any of the substances you thence infer a special property in the case of steel and iron multiply your experiments however and you will find that some other substances besides iron and steel are acted upon by your magnet a rod of the metal nickel or of the metal cobalt from which the blue colour used by painters is derived exhibits powers similar to those observed with the iron and steel in studying the character of the force you may however confine yourself to iron and steel which are always at hand make your experiments with the darningneedle over and over again operate on both ends of the needle try both ends of the magnet do not think the work dull you are conversing with nature and must acquire over her language a certain grace and mastery which practice can alone impart let every movement be made with care and avoid slovenliness from the outset experiment as i have said is the language by which we address nature and through which she sends her replies in the use of this language a lack of straightforwardness is as possible and as prejudicial as in the spoken language of the tongue if therefore you wish to become acquainted with the truth of nature you must from the first resolve to deal with her sincerely now remove your needle from its loop and draw it from eye to point along one of the ends of the magnet resuspend it and repeat your former experiment you now find that each extremity of the magnet attracts one end of the needle and repels the other the simple attraction observed in the first instance is now replaced by a dual force repeat the experiment till you have thoroughly observed the ends which attract and those which repel each other withdraw the magnet entirely from the vicinity of your needle and leave the latter freely suspended by its fibre shelter it as well as you can from currents of air and if you have iron buttons on your coat or a steel penknife in your pocket beware of their action if you work at night beware of iron candlesticks or of brass ones with iron rods inside freed from such disturbances the needle takes up a certain determinate position it sets its length nearly north and south draw it aside and let it go after several oscillations it will again come to the same position if you have obtained your magnet from a philosophical instrument maker you will see a mark on one of its ends supposing then that you drew your needle along the end thus marked and that the point of your needle was the last to quit the magnet you will find that the point turns to the south the eye of the needle turning towards the north make sure of this and do not take the statement on my authority now take a second darningneedle like the first and magnetise it in precisely the same manner freely suspended it also will turn its eye to the north and its point to the south your next step is to examine the action of the two needles which you have thus magnetised upon each other take one of them in your hand and leave the other suspended bring the eyeend of the former near the eyeend of the latter the suspended needle retreats it is repelled make the same experiment with the two points you obtain the same result the suspended needle is repelled now cause the dissimilar ends to act on each otheryou have attractionpoint attracts eye and eye attracts point prove the reciprocity of this action by removing the suspended needle and putting the other in its place you obtain the same result the attraction then is mutual and the repulsion u mutual you have thus demonstrated in the clearest manner the fundamental law of magnetism that like poles repel and that unlike poles attract each other you may say that this is all easily understood without doing but do it and your knowledge will not be confined to what i have uttered here i have said that one end of your bar magnet has a mark upon it lay several silk fibres together so as to get sufficient strength or employ a thin silk ribbon and form a loop large enough to hold your magnet suspend it it turns its marked end towards the north this marked end is that which in england is called the north pole if a common smith has made your magnet it will be convenient to determine its north pole yourself and to mark it with a file vary your experiments by causing your magnetised darningneedle to attract and repel your large magnet it is quite competent to do so in magnetising the needle i have supposed the point to be the last to quit the marked end of the magnet the point of the needle is a south pole the end which last quits the magnet is always opposed in polarity to the end of the magnet with which it has been last in contact you may perhaps learn all this in a single hour but spend several at it if necessary and remember understanding it is not sufficient you must obtain a manual aptitude in addressing nature if you speak to your fellowman you are not entitled to use jargon bad experiments are jargon addressed to nature and just as much to be deprecated manual dexterity in illustrating the interaction of magnetic poles is of the utmost importance at this stage of your progress and you must not neglect attaining this power over your implements as you proceed moreover you will be tempted to do more than i can possibly suggest thoughts will occur to you which you will endeavour to follow out questions will arise which you will try to answer the same experiment may be twenty different things to twenty people having witnessed the action of pole on pole through the air you will perhaps try whether the magnetic power is not to be screened off you use plates of glass wood slate pasteboard or guttapercha but find them all pervious to this wondrous force one magnetic pole acts upon another through these bodies as if they were not present should you ever become a patentee for the regulation of ships compasses you will not fall as some projectors have done into the error of screening off the magnetism of the ship by the interposition of such substances if you wish to teach a class you must contrive that the effects which you have thus far witnessed for yourself shall be witnessed by twenty or thirty pupils and here your private ingenuity must come into play you will attach bits of paper to your needles so as to render their movements visible at a distance denoting the north and south poles by different colours say green and red you may also improve upon your darningneedle take a strip of sheet steel heat it to vivid redness and plunge it into cold water it is thereby hardened rendered in fact almost as brittle as glass six inches of this magnetised in the manner of the darningneedle will be better able to carry your paper indexes having secured such a strip you proceed thus magnetise a small sewingneedle and determine its poles or break half an inch or an inch off your magnetised darningneedle and suspend it by a fine silk fibre the sewingneedle or the fragment of the darning needle is now to be used as a testneedle to examine the distribution of the magnetism in your strip of steel hold the strip upright in your left hand and cause the testneedle to approach the lower end of your strip one end of the testneedle is attracted the other is repelled raise your needle along the strip its oscillations which at first were quick become slower opposite the middle of the strip they cease entirely neither end of the needle is attracted above the middle the testneedle turns suddenly round its other end being now attracted go through the experiment thoroughly you thus learn that the entire lower half of the strip attracts one end of the needle while the entire upper half attracts the opposite end supposing the north end of your little needle to be that attracted below you infer that the entire lower half of your magnetised strip exhibits south magnetism while the entire upper half exhibits north magnetism so far then you have determined the distribution of magnetism in your strip of steel you look at this fact you think of it in its suggestiveness the value of an experiment chiefly consists the thought naturally arises what will occur if i break my strip of steel across in the middle shall i obtain two magnets each possessing a single pole try the experiment break your strip of steel and test each half as you tested the whole the mere presentation of its two ends in succession to your testneedle suffices to show that you have not a magnet with a single polethat each half possesses two poles with a neutral point between them and if you again break the half into two other halves you will find that each quarter of the original strip exhibits precisely the same magnetic distribution as the whole strip you may continue the breaking process no matter how small your fragment may be it still possesses two opposite poles and a neutral point between them well your hand ceases to break where breaking becomes a mechanical impossibility but does the mind stop there no you follow the breaking process in idea when you can no longer realise it in fact your thoughts wander amid the very atoms of your steel and you conclude that each atom is a magnet and that the force exerted by the strip of steel is the mere summation or resultant of the forces of its ultimate particles here then is an exhibition of power which we can call forth at pleasure or cause to disappear we magnetise our strip of steel by drawing it along the pole of a magnet we can demagnetise it or reverse its magnetism by properly drawing it along the same pole in the opposite direction what then is the real nature of this wondrous change what is it that takes place among the atoms of the steel when the substance is magnetised the question leads us beyond the region of sense and into that of imagination this faculty indeed is the diviningrod of the man of science not however an imagination which catches its creations from the air but one informed and inspired by facts capable of seizing firmly on a physical image as a principle of discerning its consequences and of devising means whereby these forecasts of thought may be brought to an experimental test if such a principle be adequate to account for all the phenomenaif from an assumed cause the observed acts necessarily follow we call the assumption a theory and once possessing it we can not only revive at pleasure facts already known but we can predict others which we have never seen thus then in the prosecution of physical science our powers of observation memory imagination and inference are all drawn upon we observe facts and store them up the constructive imagination broods upon these memories tries to discern their interdependence and weave them to an organic whole the theoretic principle flashes or slowly dawns upon the mind and then the deductive faculty interposes to carry out the principle to its logical consequences a perfect theory gives dominion over natural facts and even an assumption which can only partially stand the test of a comparison with facts may be of eminent use in enabling us to connect and classify groups of phenomena the theory of magnetic fluids is of this latter character and with it we must now make ourselves familiar with the view of stamping the thing more firmly on your minds i will make use of a strong and vivid image in optics red and green are called complementary colours their mixture produces white now i ask you to imagine each of these colours to possess a selfrepulsive power that red repels red that green repels green but that red attracts green and green attracts red the attraction of the dissimilar colours being equal to the repulsion of the similar ones imagine the two colours mixed so as to produce white and suppose two strips of wood painted with this white what will be their action upon each other suspend one of them freely as we suspended our darningneedle and bring the other near it what will occur the red component of the strip you hold in your hand will repel the red component of your suspended strip but then it will attract the green and the forces being equal they neutralise each other in fact the least reflection shows you that the strips will be as indifferent to each other as two unmagnetised darningneedles would be under the same circumstances but suppose instead of mixing the colours we painted one half of each strip from centre to end red and the other half green it is perfectly manifest that the two strips would now behave towards each other exactly as our two magnetised darningneedlesthe red end would repel the red and attract the green the green would repel the green and attract the red so that assuming two colours thus related to each other we could by their mixture produce the neutrality of an unmagnetised body while by their separation we could produce the duality of action of magnetised bodies but you have already anticipated a defect in my conception for if we break one of our strips of wood in the middle we have one half entirely red and the other entirely green and with these it would be impossible to imitate the action of our broken magnet how then must we modify our conception we must evidently suppose each molecule of the wood painted green on one face and red on the opposite one the resultant action of all the atoms would then exactly resemble the action of a magnet here also if the two opposite colours of each atom could be caused to mix so as to produce white we should have as before perfect neutrality for these two selfrepellent and mutually attractive colours substitute in your minds two invisible selfrepellent and mutually attractive fluids which in ordinary steel are mixed to form a neutral compound but which the act of magnetisation separates from each other placing the opposite fluids on the opposite face of each molecule you have then a perfectly distinct conception of the celebrated theory of magnetic fluids the strength of the magnetism excited is supposed to be proportional to the quantity of neutral fluid decomposed according to this theory nothing is actually transferred from the exciting magnet to the excited steel the act of magnetisation consists in the forcible separation of two fluids which existed in the steel before it was magnetised but which then neutralised each other by their coalescence and if you test your magnet after it has excited a hundred pieces of steel you will find that it has lost no forceno more indeed than i should lose had my words such a magnetic influence on your minds as to excite in them a strong resolve to study natural philosophy i should rather be the gainer by my own utterance and by the reaction of your fervour the magnet also is the gainer by the reaction of the body which it magnetises look now to your excited piece of steel figure each molecule with its opposed fluids spread over its opposite faces how can this state of things be permanent the fluids by hypothesis attract each other what then keeps them apart why do they not instantly rush together across the equator of the atom and thus neutralise each other to meet this question philosophers have been obliged to infer the existence of a special force which holds the fluids asunder they call it coercive force and it is found that those kinds of steel which offer most resistance to being magnetisedwhich require the greatest amount of coercion to tear their fluids asunderare the very ones which offer the greatest resistance to the reunion of the fluids after they have been once separated such kinds of steel are most suited to the formation of permanent magnets it is manifest indeed that without coercive force a permanent magnet would not be at all possible probably long before this you will have dipped the end of your magnet among iron filings and observed how they cling to it or into a nailbox and found how it drags the nails after it i know very well that if you are not the slaves of routine you will have by this time done many things that i have not told you to do and thus multiplied your experience beyond what i have indicated you are almost sure to have caused a bit of iron to hang from the end of your magnet and you have probably succeeded in causing a second bit to attach itself to the first a third to the second until finally the force has become too feeble to bear the weight of more if you have operated with nails you may have observed that the points and edges hold together with the greatest tenacity and that a bit of iron clings more firmly to the corner of your magnet than to one of its flat surfaces in short you will in all likelihood have enriched your experience in many ways without any special direction from me well the magnet attracts the nail and the nail attracts a second one this proves that the nail in contact with the magnet has had the magnetic quality developed in it by that contact if it be withdrawn from the magnet its power to attract its fellow nail ceases contact however is not necessary a sheet of glass or paper or a space of air may exist between the magnet and the nail the latter is still magnetised though not so forcibly as when in actual contact the nail thus presented to the magnet is itself a temporary magnet that end which is turned towards the magnetic pole has the opposite magnetism of the pole which excites it the end most remote from the pole has the same magnetism as the pole itself and between the two poles the nail like the magnet possesses a magnetic equator conversant as you now are with the theory of magnetic fluids you have already i doubt not anticipated me in imagining the exact condition of an iron nail under the influence of the magnet you picture the iron as possessing the neutral fluid in abundance you picture the magnetic pole when brought near decomposing the fluid repelling the fluid of a like kind with itself and attracting the unlike fluid thus exciting in the parts of the iron nearest to itself the opposite polarity but the iron is incapable of becoming a permanent magnet it only shows its virtue as long as the magnet acts upon it what then does the iron lack which the steel possesses it lacks coercive force its fluids are separated with ease but once the separating cause is removed they flow together again and neutrality is restored imagination must be quite nimble in picturing these changesable to see the fluids dividing and reuniting according as the magnet is brought near or withdrawn fixing a definite pole in your mind you must picture the precise arrangement of the two fluids with reference to this pole and be able to arouse similar pictures in the minds of your pupils you will cause them to place magnets and iron in various positions and describe the exact magnetic state of the iron in each particular case the mere facts of magnetism will have their interest immensely augmented by an acquaintance with the principles whereon the facts depend still while you use this theory of magnetic fluids to track out the phenomena and link them together you will not forget to tell your pupils that it is to be regarded as a symbol merelya symbol moreover which is incompetent to cover all the facts but which does good practical service whilst we are waiting for the actual truth footnote this theory breaks down when applied to diamagnetic bodies which are repelled by magnets like soft iron such bodies are thrown into a state of temporary excitement in virtue of which they are repelled but any attempt to explain such a repulsion by the decomposition of a fluid will demonstrate its own futility the state of excitement into which iron is thrown by the influence of a magnet is sometimes called magnetisation by influence more commonly however the magnetism is said to be induced in the iron and hence this mode of magnetising is called magnetic induction now there is nothing theoretically perfect in nature there is no iron so soft as not to possess a certain amount of coercive force and no steel so hard as not to be capable in some degree of magnetic induction the quality of steel is in some measure possessed by iron and the quality of iron is shared in some degree by steel it is in virtue of this latter fact that the unmagnetised darningneedle was attracted in your first experiment and from this you may at once deduce the consequence that after the steel has been magnetised the repulsive action of a magnet must be always less than its attractive action for the repulsion is opposed by the inductive action of the magnet on the steel while the attraction is assisted by the same inductive action make this clear to your minds and verify it by your experiments in some cases you can actually make the attraction due to the temporary magnetism overbalance the repulsion due to the permanent magnetism and thus cause two poles of the same kind apparently to attract each other when however good hard magnets act on each other from a sufficient distance the inductive action practically vanishes and the repulsion of like poles is sensibly equal to the attraction of unlike ones i dwell thus long on elementary principles because they are of the first importance and it is the temptation of this age of unhealthy cramming to neglect them now follow me a little farther in examining the distribution of magnetism in your strip of steel you raised the needle slowly from bottom to top and found what we called a neutral point at the centre now does the magnet really exert no influence on the pole presented to its centre let us see let sn fig 13 be our magnet and let n represent a particle of north magnetism placed exactly opposite the middle of the magnet of course this is an imaginary case as you can never in reality thus detach your north magnetism from its neighbour but supposing us to have done so what would be the action of the two poles of the magnet on n your reply will of course be that the pole s attracts n while the pole n repels it let the magnitude and direction of the attraction be expressed by the line n m and the magnitude and direction of the repulsion by the line n o now the particle n being equally distant from s and n the line n o expressing the repulsion will be equal to m n which expresses the attraction acted upon by two such forces the particle n must evidently move in the direction n p exactly midway between m n and n o hence you see that although there is no tendency of the particle n to move towards the magnetic equator there is a tendency on its part to move parallel to the magnet if instead of a particle of north magnetism we placed a particle of south magnetism opposite to the magnetic equator it would evidently be urged along the line n q and if instead of two separate particles of magnetism we place a little magnetic needle containing both north and south magnetism opposite the magnetic equator its south pole being urged along n q and its north along n p the little needle will be compelled to set itself parallel to the magnet s n make the experiment and satisfy yourselves that this is a true deduction substitute for your magnetic needle a bit of iron wire devoid of permanent magnetism and it will set itself exactly as the needle does acted upon by the magnet the wire as you know becomes a magnet and behaves as such it will turn its north pole towards p and south pole towards q just like the needle but supposing you shift the position of your particle of north magnetism and bring it nearer to one end of your magnet than to the other the forces acting on the particle are no longer equal the nearest pole of the magnet will act more powerfully on the particle than the more distant one let sn fig 14 be the magnet and n the particle of north magnetism in its new position it is repelled by n and attracted by s let the repulsion be represented in magnitude and direction by the line n o and the attraction by the shorter line n m the resultant of these two forces will be found by completing the parallelogram m n o p and drawing its diagonal n p along n p then a particle of north magnetism would be urged by the simultaneous action of s and n substituting a particle of south magnetism for n the same reasoning would lead to the conclusion that the particle would be urged along it q if we place at n a short magnetic needle its north pole will be urged along n p its south pole along n q the only position possible to the needle thus acted on being along the line p q which is no longer parallel to the magnet verify this deduction by actual experiment in this way we might go round the entire magnet and considering its two poles as two centres from which the force emanates we could in accordance with ordinary mechanical principles assign a definite direction to the magnetic needle at every particular place and substituting as before a bit of iron wire for the magnetic needle the positions of both will be the same now i think without further preface you will be able to comprehend for yourselves and explain to others one of the most interesting effects in the whole domain of magnetism iron filings you know are particles of iron irregular in shape being longer in some directions than in others for the present experiment moreover instead of the iron filings very small scraps of thin iron wire might be employed i place a sheet of paper over the magnet it is all the better if the paper be stretched on a wooden frame as this enables us to keep it quite level i scatter the filings or the scraps of wire from a sieve upon the paper and tap the latter gently so as to liberate the particles for a moment from its friction the magnet acts on the filings through the paper and see how it arranges them they embrace the magnet in a series of beautiful curves which are technically called magnetic curves or lines of magnetic force does the meaning of these lines yet flash upon you set your magnetic needle or your suspended bit of wire at any point of one of the curves and you will find the direction of the needle or of the wire to be exactly that of the particle of iron or of the magnetic curve at that point go round and round the magnet the direction of your needle always coincides with the direction of the curve on which it is placed these then are the lines along which a particle of south magnetism if you could detach it would move to the north pole and a bit of north magnetism to the south pole they are the lines along which the decomposition of the neutral fluid takes place in the case of the magnetic needle one of its poles being urged in one direction and the other pole in the opposite direction the needle must necessarily set itself as a tangent to the curve i will not seek to simplify this subject further if there be anything obscure or confused or incomplete in my statement you ought now by patient thought to be able to clear away the obscurity to reduce the confusion to order and to supply what is needed to render the explanation complete do not quit the subject until you thoroughly understand it and if you are then able to look with your minds eye at the play of forces around a magnet and see distinctly the operation of those forces in the production of the magnetic curves the time which we have spent together will not have been spent in vain fig 15 in this thorough manner we must master our materials reason upon them and by determined study attain to clearness of conception facts thus dealt with exercise an expansive force upon the intellect they widen the mind to generalisation we soon recognise a brotherhood between the larger phenomena of nature and the minute effects which we have observed in our private chambers why we enquire does the magnetic needle set north and south evidently it is compelled to do so by the earth the great globe which we inherit is itself a magnet let us learn a little more about it by means of a bit of wax or otherwise attach the end of your silk fibre to the middle point of your magnetic needle the needle will thus be uninterfered with by the paper loop and will enjoy to some extent a power of dipping its point or its eye below the horizon lay your bar magnet on a table and hold the needle over the equator of the magnet the needle sets horizontal move it towards the north end of the magnet the south end of the needle dips the dip augmenting as you approach the north pole over which the needle if free to move will set itself exactly vertical move it back to the centre it resumes its horizontality pass it on towards the south pole its north end now dips and directly over the south pole the needle becomes vertical its north end being now turned downwards thus we learn that on the one side of the magnetic equator the north end of the needle dips on the other side the south end dips the dip varying from nothing to 90 if we go to the equatorial regions of the earth with a suitably suspended needle we shall find there the position of the needle horizontal if we sail north one end of the needle dips if we sail south the opposite end dips and over the north or south terrestrial magnetic pole the needle sets vertical the south magnetic pole has not yet been found but sir james ross discovered the north magnetic pole on june 1 1831 in this manner we establish a complete parallelism between the action of the earth and that of an ordinary magnet the terrestrial magnetic poles do not coincide with the geographical ones nor does the earths magnetic equator quite coincide with the geographical equator the direction of the magnetic needle in london which is called the magnetic meridian encloses an angle of 24 with the astronomical meridian this angle being called the declination of the needle for london the north pole of the needle now lies to the west of the true meridian the declination is westerly in the year 1660 however the declination was nothing while before that time it was easterly all this proves that the earths magnetic constituents are gradually changing their distribution this change is very slow it is therefore called the secular change and the observation of it has not yet extended over a sufficient period to enable us to guess even approximately at its laws having thus discovered to some extent the secret of the earths magnetic power we can turn it to account in the line of dip i hold a poker formed of good soft iron the earth acting as a magnet is at this moment constraining the two fluids of the poker to separate making the lower end of the poker a north pole and the upper end a south pole mark the experiment when the knob is uppermost it attracts the north end of a magnetic needle when undermost it attracts the south end of a magnetic needle with such a poker repeat this experiment and satisfy yourselves that the fluids shift their position according to the manner in which the poker is presented to the earth it has already been stated that the softest iron possesses a certain amount of coercive force the earth at this moment finds in this force an antagonist which opposes the decomposition of the neutral fluid the component fluids may be figured as meeting an amount of friction or possessing an amount of adhesion which prevents them from gliding over the molecules of the poker can we assist the earth in this case if we wish to remove the residue of a powder from the interior surface of a glass to which the powder clings we invert the glass tap it loosen the hold of the powder and thus enable the force of gravity to pull it down so also by tapping the end of the poker we loosen the adhesion of the magnetic fluids to the molecules and enable the earth to pull them apart but what is the consequence the portion of fluid which has been thus forcibly dragged over the molecules refuses to return when the poker has been removed from the line of dip the iron as you see has become a permanent magnet by reversing its position and tapping it again we reverse its magnetism a thoughtful and competent teacher will know how to place these remarkable facts before his pupils in a manner which will excite their interest by the use of sensible images more or less gross he will first give those whom he teaches definite conceptions purifying these conceptions afterwards as the minds of his pupils become more capable of abstraction by thus giving them a distinct substratum for their reasonings he will confer upon his pupils a profit and a joy which the mere exhibition of facts without principles or the appeal to the bodily senses and the power of memory alone could never inspire as an expansion of the note on magnetic fluids the following extract may find a place here it is well known that a voltaic current exerts an attractive force upon a second current flowing in the same direction and that when the directions are opposed to each other the force exerted is a repulsive one by coiling wires into spirals ampre was enabled to make them produce all the phenomena of attraction and repulsion exhibited by magnets and from this it was but a step to his celebrated theory of molecular currents he supposed the molecules of a magnetic body to be surrounded by such currents which however in the natural state of the body mutually neutralised each other on account of their confused grouping the act of magnetisation he supposed to consist in setting these molecular currents parallel to each other and starting from this principle he reduced all the phenomena of magnetism to the mutual action of electric currents if we reflect upon the experiments recorded in the foregoing pages from first to last we can hardly fail to be convinced that diamagnetic bodies operated on by magnetic forces possess a polarity the same in kind as but the reverse in direction of that acquired by magnetic bodies but if this be the case how are we to conceive the physical mechanism of this polarity according to coulombs and poissons theory the act of magnetisation consists in the decomposition of a neutral magnetic fluid the north pole of a magnet for example possesses an attraction for the south fluid of a piece of soft iron submitted to its influence draws the said fluid towards it and with it the material particles with which the fluid is associated to account for diamagnetic phenomena this theory seems to fail altogether according to it indeed the oftused phrase a north pole exciting a north pole and a south pole a south pole involves a contradiction for if the north fluid be supposed to be attracted towards the influencing north pole it is absurd to suppose that its presence there could produce repulsion the theory of ampre is equally at a loss to explain diamagnetic action for if we suppose the particles of bismuth surrounded by molecular currents then according to all that is known of electrodynamic laws these currents would set themselves parallel to and in the same direction as those of the magnet and hence attraction and not repulsion would be the result the fact however of this not being the case proves that these molecular currents are not the mechanism by which diamagnetic induction is effected the consciousness of this i doubt not drove m weber to the assumption that the phenomena of diamagnetism are produced by molecular currents not directed but actually excited in the bismuth by the magnet such induced currents would according to known laws have a direction opposed to those of the inducing magnet and hence would produce the phenomena of repulsion to carry out the assumption here made m weber is obliged to suppose that the molecules of diamagnetic bodies are surrounded by channels in which the induced molecular currents once excited continue to flow without resistance footnote in assuming these nonresisting channels m weber it must be admitted did not go beyond the assumptions of amprediamagnetism and magnecrystallic action p 1367 xvi on force footnote a discourse delivered in the royal institution june 6 1862 a sphere of lead was suspended at a height of 16 feet above the theatre floor of the royal institution it was liberated and fell by gravity that weight required a second to fall to the floor from that elevation and the instant before it touched the floor it had a velocity of 32 feet a second that is to say if at that instant the earth were annihilated and its attraction annulled the weight would proceed through space at the uniform velocity of 32 feet a second if instead of being pulled downward by gravity the weight be cast upward in opposition to gravity then to reach a height of 16 feet it must start with a velocity of 32 feet a second this velocity imparted to the weight by the human hand or by any other mechanical means would carry it to the precise height from which we saw it fall now the lifting of the weight may be regarded as so much mechanical work performed by means of a ladder placed against the wall the weight might be carried up to a height of 16 feet or it might be drawn up to this height by means of a string and pulley or it might be suddenly jerked up to a height of 16 feet the amount of work done in all these cases as far as the raising of the weight is concerned would be absolutely the same the work done at one and the same place and neglecting the small change of gravity with the height depends solely upon two things on the quantity of matter lifted and on the height to which it is lifted if we call the quantity or mass of matter m and the height through which it is lifted h then the product of m into h or mh expresses or is proportional to the amount of work done supposing instead of imparting a velocity of 32 feet a second we impart at starting twice this velocity to what height will the weight rise you might be disposed to answer to twice the height but this would be quite incorrect instead of twice 16 or 32 feet it would reach a height of four times 16 or 64 feet so also if we treble the starting velocity the weight would reach nine times the height if we quadruple the speed at starting we attain sixteen times the height thus with a fourfold velocity of 128 feet a second at starting the weight would attain an elevation of 256 feet with a sevenfold velocity at starting the weight would rise to 49 times the height or to an elevation of 784 feet now the work doneor as it is sometimes called the mechanical effectother things being constant is as before explained proportional to the height and as a double velocity gives four times the height a treble velocity nine times the height and so on it is perfectly plain that the mechanical effect increases as the square of the velocity if the mass of the body be represented by the letter m and its velocity by v the mechanical effect would be proportional to or represented by m v2 in the case considered i have supposed the weight to be cast upward being opposed in its flight by the resistance of gravity but the same holds true if the projectile be sent into water mud earth timber or other resisting material if for example we double the velocity of a cannonball we quadruple its mechanical effect hence the importance of augmenting the velocity of a projectile and hence the philosophy of sir william armstrong in using a large charge of powder in his recent striking experiments the measure then of mechanical effect is the mass of the body multiplied by the square of its velocity now in firing a ball against a target the projectile after collision is often found hot mr fairbairn informs me that in the experiments at shoeburyness it is a common thing to see a flash even in broad daylight when the ball strikes the target and if our lead weight be examined after it has fallen from a height it is also found heated now here experiment and reasoning lead us to the remarkable law that like the mechanical effect the amount of heat generated is proportional to the product of the mass into the square of the velocity double your mass other things being equal and you double your amount of heat double your velocity other things remaining equal and you quadruple your amount of heat here then we have common mechanical motion destroyed and heat produced when a violin bow is drawn across a string the sound produced is due to motion imparted to the air and to produce that motion muscular force has been expended we may here correctly say that the mechanical force of the arm is converted into music in a similar way we say that the arrested motion of our descending weight or of the cannonball is converted into heat the mode of motion changes but motion still continues the motion of the mass is converted into a motion of the atoms of the mass and these small motions communicated to the nerves produce the sensation we call heat we know the amount of heat which a given amount of mechanical force can develope our lead ball for example in falling to the earth generated a quantity of heat sufficient to raise its own temperature threefifths of a fahrenheit degree it reached the earth with a velocity of 32 feet a second and forty times this velocity would be small for a rifle bullet multiplying 06 by the square of 40 we find that the amount of heat developed by collision with the target would if wholly concentrated in the lead raise its temperature 960 degrees this would be more than sufficient to fuse the lead in reality however the heat developed is divided between the lead and the body against which it strikes nevertheless it would be worth while to pay attention to this point and to ascertain whether rifle bullets do not under some circumstances show signs of fusion footnote eight years subsequently this surmise was proved correct in the francogerman war signs of fusion were observed in the case of bullets impinging on bones from the motion of sensible masses by gravity and other means we now pass to the motion of atoms towards each other by chemical affinity a collodion balloon filled with a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen being hung in the focus of a parabolic mirror in the focus of a second mirror 20 feet distant a strong electric light was suddenly generated the instant the concentrated light fell upon the balloon the gases within it exploded hydrochloric acid being the result here the atoms virtually fell together the amount of heat produced showing the enormous force of the collision the burning of charcoal in oxygen is an old experiment but it has now a significance beyond what it used to have we now regard the act of combination on the part of the atoms of oxygen and coal as we regard the clashing of a falling weight against the earth the heat produced in both cases is referable to a common cause a diamond which burns in oxygen as a star of white light glows and burns in consequence of the falling of the atoms of oxygen against it and could we measure the velocity of the atoms when they clash and could we find their number and weights multiplying the weight of each atom by the square of its velocity and adding all together we should get a number representing the exact amount of heat developed by the union of the oxygen and carbon thus far we have regarded the heat developed by the clashing of sensible masses and of atoms work is expended in giving motion to these atoms or masses and heat is developed but we reverse this process daily and by the expenditure of heat execute work we can raise a weight by heat and in this agent we possess an enormous store of mechanical power a pound of coal produces by its combination with oxygen an amount of heat which if mechanically applied would suffice to raise a weight of 100 lbs to a height of 20 miles above the earths surface conversely 100 lbs falling from a height of 20 miles and striking against the earth would generate an amount of heat equal to that developed by the combustion of a pound of coal wherever work is done by heat heat disappears a gun which fires a ball is less heated than one which fires blank cartridge the quantity of heat communicated to the boiler of a working steamengine is greater than that which could be obtained from the recondensation of the steam after it had done its work and the amount of work performed is the exact equivalent of the amount of heat lost mr smyth informed us in his interesting discourse that we dig annually 84 millions of tons of coal from our pits the amount of mechanical force represented by this quantity of coal seems perfectly fabulous the combustion of a single pound of coal supposing it to take place in a minute would be equivalent to the work of 300 horses and if we suppose 108 millions of horses working day and night with unimpaired strength for a year their united energies would enable them to perform an amount of work just equivalent to that which the annual produce of our coalfields would be able to accomplish comparing with ordinary gravity the force with which oxygen and carbon unite together chemical affinity seems almost infinite but let us give gravity fair play by permitting it to act throughout its entire range place a body at such a distance from the earth that the attraction of our planet is barely sensible and let it fall to the earth from this distance it would reach the earth with a final velocity of 36747 feet a second and on collision with the earth the body would generate about twice the amount of heat generated by the combustion of an equal weight of coal we have stated that by falling through a space of 16 feet our lead bullet would be heated threefifths of a degree but a body falling from an infinite distance has already used up 1299999 parts out of 1300000 of the earths pulling power when it has arrived within 16 feet of the surface on this space only 11300000 of the whole force is exerted let us now turn our thoughts for a moment from the earth to the sun the researches of sir john herschel and m pouillet have informed us of the annual expenditure of the sun as regards heat and by an easy calculation we ascertain the precise amount of the expenditure which falls to the share of our planet out of 2300 million parts of light and heat the earth receives one the whole heat emitted by the sun in a minute would be competent to boil 12000 millions of cubic miles of icecold water how is this enormous loss made goodwhence is the suns heat derived and by what means is it maintained no combustionno chemical affinity with which we are acquainted would be competent to produce the temperature of the suns surface besides were the sun a burning body merely its light and heat would speedily come to an end supposing it to be a solid globe of coal its combustion would only cover 4600 years of expenditure in this short time it would burn itself out what agency then can produce the temperature and maintain the outlay we have already regarded the case of a body falling from a great distance towards the earth and found that the heat generated by its collision would be twice that produced by the combustion of an equal weight of coal how much greater must be the heat developed by a body falling against the sun the maximum velocity with which a body can strike the earth is about 7 miles in a second the maximum velocity with which it can strike the sun is 390 miles in a second and as the heat developed by the collision is proportional to the square of the velocity destroyed an asteroid falling into the sun with the above velocity would generate about 10000 times the quantity of heat produced by the combustion of an asteroid of coal of the same weight have we any reason to believe that such bodies exist in space and that they may be raining down upon the sun the meteorites flashing through the air are small planetary bodies drawn by the earths attraction they enter our atmosphere with planetary velocity and by friction against the air they are raised to incandescence and caused to emit light and heat at certain seasons of the year they shower down upon us in great numbers in boston 240000 of them were observed in nine hours there is no reason to suppose that the planetary system is limited to vast masses of enormous weight there is on the contrary reason to believe that space is stocked with smaller masses which obey the same laws as the larger ones that lenticular envelope which surrounds the sun and which is known to astronomers as the zodiacal light is probably a crowd of meteors and moving as they do in a resisting medium they must continually approach the sun falling into it they would produce enormous heat and this would constitute a source from which the annual loss of heat might be made good the sun according to this hypothesis would continually grow larger but how much larger were our moon to fall into the sun it would develope an amount of heat sufficient to cover one or two years loss and were our earth to fall into the sun a centurys loss would be made good still our moon and our earth if distributed over the surface of the sun would utterly vanish from perception indeed the quantity of matter competent to produce the required effect would during the range of history cause no appreciable augmentation in the suns magnitude the augmentation of the suns attractive force would be more sensible however this hypothesis may fare as a representant of what is going on in nature it certainly shows how a sun might be formed and maintained on known thermodynamic principles our earth moves in its orbit with a velocity of 68040 miles an hour were this motion stopped an amount of heat would be developed sufficient to raise the temperature of a globe of lead of the same size as the earth 384000 degrees of the centigrade thermometer it has been prophesied that the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earths own motion embraces the conditions of fulfilment stop that motion and the greater part if not the whole of our planet would be reduced to vapour if the earth fell into the sun the amount of heat developed by the shock would be equal to that developed by the combustion of a mass of solid coal 6435 times the earth in size there is one other consideration connected with the permanence of our present terrestrial conditions which is well worthy of our attention standing upon one of the london bridges we observe the current of the thames reversed and the water poured upward twice aday the water thus moved rubs against the rivers bed and heat is the consequence of this friction the heat thus generated is in part radiated into space and lost as far as the earth is concerned what supplies this incessant loss the earths rotation let us look a little more closely at the matter imagine the moon fixed and the earth turning like a wheel from west to east in its diurnal rotation suppose a high mountain on the earths surface approaching the earths meridian that mountain is as it were laid hold of by the moon it forms a kind of handle by which the earth is pulled more quickly round but when the meridian is passed the pull of the moon on the mountain would be in the opposite direction it would tend to diminish the velocity of rotation as much as it previously augmented it thus the action of all fixed bodies on the earths surface is neutralised but suppose the mountain to lie always to the east of the moons meridian the pull then would be always exerted against the earths rotation the velocity of which would be diminished in a degree corresponding to the strength of the pull the tidal wave occupies this positionit lies always to the east of the moons meridian the waters of the ocean are in part dragged as a brake along the surface of the earth and as a brake they must diminish the velocity of the earths rotation footnote kant surmised an action of this kind supposing then that we turn a mill by the action of the tide and produce heat by the friction of the millstones that heat has an origin totally different from the heat produced by another mill which is turned by a mountain stream the former is produced at the expense of the earths rotation the latter at the expense of the suns radiation the sun by the act of vaporisation lifts mechanically all the moisture of our air which when it condenses falls in the form of rain and when it freezes falls as snow in this solid form it is piled upon the alpine heights and furnishes materials for glaciers but the sun again interposes liberates the solidified liquid and permits it to roll by gravity to the sea the mechanical force of every river in the world as it rolls towards the ocean is drawn from the heat of the sun no streamlet glides to a lower level without having been first lifted to the elevation from which it springs by the power of the sun the energy of winds is also due entirely to the same power but there is still another work which the sun performs and its connection with which is not so obvious trees and vegetables grow upon the earth and when burned they give rise to heat and hence to mechanical energy whence is this power derived you see this oxide of iron produced by the falling together of the atoms of iron and oxygen you cannot see this transparent carbonic acid gas formed by the falling together of carbon and oxygen the atoms thus in close union resemble our lead weight while resting on the earth but we can wind up the weight and prepare it for another fall and so these atoms can be wound up and thus enabled to repeat the process of combination in the building of plants carbonic acid is the material from which the carbon of the plant is derived and the solar beam is the agent which tears the atoms asunder setting the oxygen free and allowing the carbon to aggregate in woody fibre let the solar rays fall upon a surface of sand the sand is heated and finally radiates away as much heat as it receives let the same beams fall upon a forest the quantity of heat given back is less than the forest receives for the energy of a portion of the sunbeams is invested in building the trees without the sun the reduction of the carbonic acid cannot be effected and an amount of sunlight is consumed exactly equivalent to the molecular work done thus trees are formed thus the cotton on which mr bazley discoursed last friday is produced i ignite this cotton and it flames the oxygen again unites with the carbon but an amount of heat equal to that produced by its combustion was sacrificed by the sun to form that bit of cotton we cannot however stop at vegetable life for it is the source mediate or immediate of all animal life the sun severs the carbon from its oxygen and builds the vegetable the animal consumes the vegetable thus formed a reunion of the severed elements takes place producing animal heat the process of building a vegetable is one of winding up the process of building an animal is one of running down the warmth of our bodies and every mechanical energy which we exert trace their lineage directly to the sun the fight of a pair of pugilists the motion of an army or the lifting of his own body by an alpine climber up a mountain slope are all cases of mechanical energy drawn from the sun a man weighing 150 pounds has 64 pounds of muscle but these when dried reduce themselves to 15 pounds doing an ordinary days work for eighty days this mass of muscle would be wholly oxidised special organs which do more work would be more quickly consumed the heart for example if entirely unsustained would be oxidised in about a week take the amount of heat due to the direct oxidation of a given weight of food less heat is developed by the oxidation of the same amount of food in the working animal frame and the missing quantity is the equivalent of the mechanical work accomplished by the muscles i might extend these considerations the work indeed is done to my handbut i am warned that you have been already kept too long to whom then are we indebted for the most striking generalisations of this evenings discourse they are the work of a man of whom you have scarcely ever heardthe published labours of a german doctor named mayer without external stimulus and pursuing his profession as town physician in heilbronn this man was the first to raise the conception of the interaction of heat and other natural forces to clearness in his own mind and yet he is scarcely ever heard of and even to scientific men his merits are but partially known led by his own beautiful researches and quite independent of mayer mr joule published in 1843 his first paper on the mechanical value of heat but in 1842 mayer had actually calculated the mechanical equivalent of heat from data which only a man of the rarest penetration could turn to account in 1845 he published his memoir on organic motion and applied the mechanical theory of heat in the most fearless and precise manner to vital processes he also embraced the other natural agents in his chain of conservation in 1853 mr waterston proposed independently the meteoric theory of the suns heat and in 1854 professor william thomson applied his admirable mathematical powers to the development of the theory but six years previously the subject had been handled in a masterly manner by mayer and all that i have said about it has been derived from him when we consider the circumstances of mayers life and the period at which he wrote we cannot fail to be struck with astonishment at what he has accomplished here was a man of genius working in silence animated solely by a love of his subject and arriving at the most important results in advance of those whose lives were entirely devoted to natural philosophy it was the accident of bleeding a feverish patient at java in 1840 that led mayer to speculate on these subjects he noticed that the venous blood in the tropics was of a brighter red than in colder latitudes and his reasoning on this fact led him into the laboratory of natural forces where he has worked with such signal ability and success well you will desire to know what has become of this man his mind it is alleged gave way it is said he became insane and he was certainly sent to a lunatic asylum in a biographical dictionary of his country it is stated that he died there but this is incorrect he recovered and i believe is at this moment a cultivator of vineyards in heilbronn june 20 1862 while preparing for publication my last course of lectures on heat i wished to make myself acquainted with all that dr mayer had done in connection with this subject i accordingly wrote to two gentlemen who above all others seemed likely to give me the information which i needed footnote helmholtz and clausius both of them are germans and both particularly distinguished in connection with the dynamical theory of heat each of them kindly furnished me with the list of mayers publications and one of them clausius was so friendly as to order them from a bookseller and to send them to me this friend in his reply to my first letter regarding mayer stated his belief that i should not find anything very important in mayers writings but before forwarding the memoirs to me he read them himself his letter accompanying them contains the following words i must here retract the statement in my last letter that you would not find much matter of importance in mayers writings i am astonished at the multitude of beautiful and correct thoughts which they contain and he goes on to point out various important subjects in the treatment of which mayer had anticipated other eminent writers my other friend in whose own publications the name of mayer repeatedly occurs and whose papers containing these references were translated some years ago by myself was on the 10th of last month unacquainted with the thoughtful and beautiful essay of mayers entitled beitraege zur dynamik des himmels and in 1854 when professor william thomson developed in so striking a manner the meteoric theory of the suns heat he was certainly not aware of the existence of that essay though from a recent article in macmillans magazine i infer that he is now aware of it mayers physiological writings have been referred to by physiologistsby dr carpenter for examplein terms of honouring recognition we have hitherto indeed obtained fragmentary glimpses of the man partly from physicists and partly from physiologists but his total merit has never yet been recognised as it assuredly would have been had he chosen a happier mode of publication i do not think a greater disservice could be done to a man of science than to overstate his claims such overstatement is sure to recoil to the disadvantage of him in whose interest it is made but when mayers opportunities achievements and fate are taken into account i do not think that i shall be deeply blamed for attempting to place him in that honourable position which i believe to be his due here however are the titles of mayers papers the perusal of which will correct any error of judgment into which i may have fallen regarding their author bemerkungen ueber die kraefte der unbelebten natur liebigs annalen 1842 vol 42 p 231 die organische bewegung in ihrem zusammenhange mit dem stoffwechsel heilbronn 1845 beitraege zur dynamik des himmels heilbronn 1848 bemerkungen ueber das mechanische equivalent der waerme heilbronn 1851 in memoriamdr julius robert mayer died at heilbronn on march 20 1878 aged 63 years it gives me pleasure to reflect that the great positionwhich he will for ever occupy in the annals of science was first virtually assigned to him in the foregoing discourse he was subsequently hosen by acclamation a member of the french academy of sciences and he received from the royal society the copley medalits highest reward footnote see the copley medalist for 1871 p479 november 1878 at the meeting of the british association at glasgow in 1876that is to say more than fourteen years after its delivery and publicationthe foregoing lecture was made the cloak for an unseemly personal attack by professor tait the anger which found this uncourteous vent dates from 1863 when it fell to my lot to maintain in opposition to him and a more eminent colleague the position which in 1862 i had assigned to dr mayer footnote see philosophical magazine for this and the succeeding years in those days professor tait denied to mayer all originality and he has since i regret to say never missed an opportunity however small of carping at mayers claims the action of the academy of sciences and of the royal society summarily disposes of this detraction to which its object during his lifetime never vouchsafed either remonstrance or reply some time ago professor tait published a volume of lectures entitled recent advances in physical science which i have reason to know has evoked an amount of censure far beyond that hitherto publicly expressed many of the best heads on the continent of europe agree in their rejection and condemnation of the historic portions of this book in march last it was subjected to a brief but pungent critique by du boisreymond the celebrated perpetual secretary of the academy of sciences in berlin du boisreymonds address was on national feeling and his critique is thus wound up the author of the lectures is not perhaps sufficiently well acquainted with the history on which he professes to throw light and on the later phases of which he passes so unreserved schroff a judgment he thus exposes himself to the suspicionwhich unhappily is not weakened by his other writingsthat the fiery celtic blood of his country occasionally runs away with him converting him for the time into a scientific chauvin scientific chauvinism adds the learned secretary from which german investigators have hitherto kept free is more reprehensible gehaessig than political chauvinism inasmuch as selfcontrol sittliche haltung is more to be expected from men of science than from the politically excited mass footnote festrede delivered before the academy of sciences of berlin in celebration of the birthday of the emperor and king march 28 1878 in the case before this expectation would i fear be doomed to disappointment but du boisreymond and his countrymen must not accept the writings of professor tait as representative of the thought of england surely no nation in the world has more effectually shaken itself free from scientific chauvinism from the day that davy on presenting the copley medal to arago scornfully brushed aside that spurious patriotism which would run national boundaries through the free domain of science chivalry towards foreigners has been a guiding principle with the royal society on the more private amenities indulged in by professor tait i do not consider it necessary to say a word xvii contributions to molecular physics footnote a discourse delivered at the royal institution march 18 1864supplementing though of prior date the rede lecture on radiation having on previous occasions dwelt upon the enormous differences which exist among gaseous bodies both as regards their power of absorbing and emitting radiant heat i have now to consider the effect of a change of aggregation when a gas is condensed to a liquid or a liquid congealed to a solid the molecules coalesce and grapple with each other by forces which are insensible as long as the gaseous state is maintained but even in the solid and liquid conditions the luminiferous aether still surrounds the molecules hence if the acts of radiation and absorption depend on them individually regardless of their state of aggregation the change from the gaseous to the liquid state ought not materially to affect the radiant and absorbent power if on the contrary the mutual entanglement of the molecular by the force of cohesion be of paramount influence then we may expect that liquids will exhibit a deportment towards radiant heat altogether different from that of the vapours from which they are derived the first part of an enquiry conducted in 186364 was devoted to an exhaustive examination of this question twelve different liquids were employed and five different layers of each varying in thickness from 002 of an inch to 027 of an inch the liquids were enclosed not in glass vessels which would have materially modified the incident heat but between plates of transparent rocksalt which only slightly affected the radiation the source of heat throughout these comparative experiments consisted of a platinum wire raised to incandescence by an electric current of unvarying strength the quantities of radiant heat absorbed and transmitted by each of the liquids at the respective thicknesses were first determined the vapours of these liquids were subsequently examined the quantities of vapour employed being rendered proportional to the quantities of liquid previously traversed by the radiant heat the result was that for heat from the same source the order of absorption of liquids and of their vapours proved absolutely the same there is no known exception to this law so that to determine the position of a vapour as an absorber or a radiator it is only necessary to determine the position of its liquid this result proves that the state of aggregation as far at all events as the liquid stage is concerned is of altogether subordinate momenta conclusion which will probably prove to be of cardinal importance in molecular physics on one important and contested point it has a special bearing if the position of a liquid as an absorber and radiator determine that of its vapour the position of water fixes that of aqueous vapour water has been compared with other liquids in a multitude of experiments and it has been found both as a radiant and as an absorbent to transcend them all thus for example a layer of bisulphide of carbon 002 of an inch in thickness absorbs 6 per cent and allows 94 per cent of the radiation from the redhot platinum spiral to pass through it benzol absorbs 43 and transmits 57 per cent of the same radiation alcohol absorbs 67 and transmits 33 per cent and alcohol as an absorber of radiant heat stands at the head of all liquids except one the exception is water a layer of this substance of the thickness above given absorbs 81 per cent and permits only 19 per cent of the radiation to pass through it had no single experiment ever been made upon the vapour of water its vigorous action upon radiant heat might be inferred from the deportment of the liquid the relation of absorption and radiation to the chemical constitution of the radiating and absorbing substances was next briefly considered for the first six substances in the list of liquids examined the radiant and absorbent powers augment as the number of atoms in the compound molecule augments thus bisulphide of carbon has 3 atoms chloroform 5 iodide of ethyl 8 benzol 12 and amylene 15 atoms in their respective molecules the order of their power as radiants and absorbents is that here indicated bisulphide of carbon being the feeblest and amylene the strongest of the six alcohol however excels benzol as an absorber though it has but 9 atoms in its molecule but on the other hand its molecule is rendered more complex by the introduction of a new element benzol contains carbon and hydrogen while alcohol contains carbon hydrogen and oxygen thus not only does atomic multitude come into play in absorption and radiationatomic complexity must also be taken into account i would recommend to the particular attention of chemists the molecule of water the deportment of this substance towards radiant heat being perfectly anomalous if the chemical formula at present ascribed to it be correct sir william herschel made the important discovery that beyond the limits of the red end of the solar spectrum rays of high heating power exist which are incompetent to excite vision the discovery is capable of extension dissolving iodine in the bisulphide of carbon a solution is obtained which entirely intercepts the light of the most brilliant flames while to the ultrared rays of such flames the same iodine is found to be perfectly diathermic the transparent bisulphide which is highly pervious to invisible heat exercises on it the same absorption as the perfectly opaque solution a hollow prism filled with the opaque liquid being placed in the path of the beam from an electric lamp the lightspectrum is completely intercepted but the heat spectrum may be received upon a screen and there examined falling upon a thermoelectric pile its invisible presence is shown by the prompt deflection of even a coarse galvanometer what then is the physical meaning of opacity and transparency as regards light and radiant heat the visible rays of the spectrum differ from the invisible ones simply in period the sensation of light is excited by waves of aether shorter and more quickly recurrent than the nonvisual waves which fall beyond the extreme red but why should iodine stop the former and allow the latter to pass the answer to this question no doubt is that the intercepted waves are those whose periods of recurrence coincide with the periods of oscillation possible to the atoms of the dissolved iodine the elastic forces which keep these atoms apart compel them to vibrate in definite periods and when these periods synchronise with those of the aethereal waves the latter are absorbed briefly defined then transparency in liquids as well as in gases is synonymous with discord while opacity is synonymous with accord between the periods of the waves of aether and those of the molecules on which they impinge according to this view transparent and colourless substances owe their transparency to the dissonance existing between the oscillating periods of their atoms and those of the waves of the whole visible spectrum from the prevalence of transparency in compound bodies the general discord of the vibrating periods of their atoms with the lightgiving waves of the spectrum may be inferred while their synchronism with the ultrared periods is to be inferred from their opacity to the ultrared rays water illustrates this in a most striking manner it is highly transparent to the luminous rays which proves that its atoms do not readily oscillate in the periods which excite vision it is highly opaque to the ultrared undulations which proves the synchronism of its vibrating periods with those of the longer waves if then to the radiation from any source water shows itself eminently or perfectly opaque we may infer that the atoms whence the radiation emanates oscillate in ultrared periods let us apply this test to the radiation from a flame of hydrogen this flame consists mainly of incandescent aqueous vapour the temperature of which as calculated by bunsen is 3259c so that if the penetrative power of radiant heat as generally supposed augment with the temperature of its source we may expect the radiation from this flame to be copiously transmitted by water while however a layer of the bisulphide of carbon 007 of an inch in thickness transmits 72 per cent of the incident radiation and while every other liquid examined transmits more or less of the heat a layer of water of the above thickness is entirely opaque to the radiation from the hydrogen flame thus we establish accord between the periods of the atoms of cold water and those of aqueous vapour at a temperature of 3259c but the periods of water have already been proved to be ultra redhence those of the hydrogen flame must be sensibly ultrared also the absorption by dry air of the heat emitted by a platinum spiral raised to incandescence by electricity is insensible while that by the ordinary undried air is 6 per cent substituting for the platinum spiral a hydrogen flame the absorption by dry air still remains insensible while that of the undried air rises to 20 per cent of the entire radiation the temperature of the hydrogen flame is as stated 3259c that of the aqueous vapour of the air 20c suppose then the temperature of aqueous vapour to rise from 20c to 3259c we must conclude that the augmentation of temperature is applied to an increase of amplitude or width of swing and not to the introduction of quicker periods into the radiation the part played by aqueous vapour in the economy of nature is far more wonderful than has been hitherto supposed to nourish the vegetation of the earth the actinic and luminous rays of the sun must penetrate our atmosphere and to such rays aqueous vapour is eminently transparent the violet and the ultraviolet rays pass through it with freedom to protect vegetation from destructive chills the terrestrial rays must be checked in their transit towards stellar space and this is accomplished by the aqueous vapour diffused through the air this substance is the great moderator of the earths temperature bringing its extremes into proximity and obviating contrasts between day and night which would render life insupportable but we can advance beyond this general statement now that we know the radiation from aqueous vapour is intercepted in a special degree by water and reciprocally the radiation from water by aqueous vapour for it follows from this that the very act of nocturnal refrigeration which produces the condensation of aqueous vapour at the surface of the earthgiving as it were a varnish of water to that surfaceimparts to terrestrial radiation that particular character which disqualifies it from passing through the earths atmosphere and losing itself in space and here we come to a question in molecular physics which at the present moment occupies attention by allowing the violet and ultraviolet rays of the spectrum to fall upon sulphate of quinine and other substances professor stokes has changed the periods of those rays attempts have been made to produce a similar result at the other end of the spectrumto convert the ultrared periods into periods competent to excite visionbut hitherto without success such a change of period i agree with dr miller in believing occurs when the limelight is produced by an oxyhydrogen flame in this common experiment there is an actual breaking up of long periods into short onesa true rendering of unvisual periods visual the change of refrangibility here effected differs from that of professor stokes firstly by its being in the opposite directionthat is from a lower refrangibility to a higher and secondly in the circumstance that the lime is heated by the collision of the molecules of aqueous vapour before their heat has assumed the radiant form but it cannot be doubted that the same effect would be produced by radiant heat of the same periods provided the motion of the aether could be rendered sufficiently intense footnote this was soon afterwards accomplished see the section on transmutation of rays the effect in principle is the same whether we consider the lime to be struck by a particle of aqueous vapour oscillating at a certain rate or by a particle of aether oscillating at the same rate by plunging a platinum wire into a hydrogen flame we cause it to glow and thus introduce shorter periods into the radiation these as already stated are in discord with the atomic vibrations of water hence we may infer that the transmission through water will be rendered more copious by the introduction of the wire into the flame experiment proves this conclusion to be true water from being opaque opens a passage to 6 per cent of the radiation from the spiral a thin plate of colourless glass moreover transmits 68 per cent of the radiation from the hydrogen flame but when the flame and spiral are employed 78 per cent of the heat is transmitted for an alcohol flame knoblauch and melloni found glass to be less transparent than for the same flame with a platinum spiral immersed in it but melloni afterwards showed that the result was not generalthat black glass and black mica were decidedly more diathermic to the radiation from the pure alcohol flame melloni did not explain this but the reason is now obvious the mica and glass owe their blackness to the carbon diffused through them this carbon as first proved by melloni is in some measure transparent to the ultrared rays and i have myself succeeded in transmitting between 40 and 50 per cent of the radiation from a hydrogen flame through a layer of carbon which intercepted the light of an intensely brilliant flame the products of combustion of alcohol are carbonic acid and aqueous vapour the heat of which is almost wholly ultrared for this radiation then the carbon is in a considerable degree transparent while for the radiation from the platinum spiral it is in a great measure opaque the platinum wire therefore which augmented the radiation through the pure glass augmented the absorption of the black glass and mica no more striking or instructive illustration of the influence of coincidence could be adduced than that furnished by the radiation from a carbonic oxide flame here the product of combustion is carbonic acid and on the radiation from this flame even the ordinary carbonic acid of the atmosphere exerts a powerful effect a quantity of the gas only onethirtieth of an atmosphere in density contained in a polished brass tube four feet long intercepts 50 per cent of the radiation from the carbonic oxide flame for the heat emitted by lampblack olefiant gas is a far more powerful absorber than carbonic acid in fact for such heat with one exception carbonic acid is the most feeble absorber to be found among the compound gases moreover for the radiation from a hydrogen flame olefiant gas possesses twice the absorbent power of carbonic acid while for the radiation from the carbonic oxide flame at a common pressure of one inch of mercury the absorption by carbonic acid is more than twice that of olefiant gas thus we establish the coincidence of period between carbonic acid at a temperature of 20c and carbonic acid at a temperature of over 3000c the periods of oscillation of both the incandescent and the cold gas belonging to the ultrared portion of the spectrum it will be seen from the foregoing remarks and experiments how impossible it is to determine the effect of temperature pure and simple on the transmission of radiant heat if different sources of heat be employed throughout such an examination the same oscillating atoms ought to be retained this is done by beating a platinum spiral by an electric current the temperature meanwhile varying between the widest possible limits their comparative opacity to the ultrared rays shows the general accord of the oscillating periods of the vapours referred to at the commencement of this lecture with those of the ultrared undulations hence by gradually heating a platinum wire from darkness up to whiteness we ought gradually to augment the discord between it and these vapours and thus augment the transmission experiment entirely confirms this conclusion formic nether for example absorbs 45 per cent of the radiation from a platinum spiral heated to barely visible redness 32 per cent of the radiation from the same spiral at a red heat 26 per cent of the radiation from a whitehot spiral and only 21 per cent when the spiral is brought near its point of fusion remarkable cases of inversion as to transparency also occur for barely visible redness formic aether is more opaque than sulphuric for a bright red heat both are equally transparent while for a white heat and still more for a higher temperature sulphuric aether is more opaque than formic this result gives us a clear view of the relationship of the two substances to the luminiferous aether as we introduce waves of shorter period the sulphuric aether augments most rapidly in opacity that is to say its accord with the shorter waves is greater than that of the formic hence we may infer that the atoms of formic aether oscillate on the whole more slowly than those of sulphuric aether when the source of heat is a leslies cube coated with lampblack and filled with boiling water the opacity of formic aether in comparison with sulphuric is very decided with this source also the positions of chloroform and iodide of methyl are inverted for a whitehot spiral the absorption of chloroform vapour being 10 per cent that of iodide of methyl is 16 with the blackened cube as source the absorption by chloroform is 22 per cent while that by the iodide of methyl is only 19 this inversion is not the result of temperature merely for when a platinum wire heated to the temperature of boiling water is employed as a source the iodide continues to be the most powerful absorber all the experiments hitherto made go to prove that from heated lampblack an emission takes place which synchronises in an especial manner with chloroform for the cube at 100 c coated with lampblack the absorption by chloroform is more than three times that by bisulphide of carbon for the radiation from the most luminous portion of a gasflame the absorption by chloroform is also considerably in excess of that by bisulphide of carbon while for the flame of a bunsens burner from which the incandescent carbon particles are removed by the free admixture of air the absorption by bisulphide of carbon is nearly twice that by chloroform the removal of the carbon particles more than doubles the relative transparency of the chloroform testing moreover the radiation from various parts of the same flame it was found that for the blue base of the flame the bisulphide of carbon was most opaque while for all other parts of the flame the chloroform was most opaque for the radiation from a very small gas flame consisting of a blue base and a small white tip the bisulphide was also most opaque and its opacity very decidedly exceeded that of the chloroform when the source of heat was the flame of bisulphide of carbon comparing the radiation from a leslies cube coated with isinglass with that from a similar cube coated with lampblack at the common temperature of 100c it was found that out of eleven vapours all but one absorbed the radiation from the isinglass most powerfully the single exception was chloroform it is worthy of remark that whenever through a change of source the position of a vapour as an absorber of radiant heat was altered the position of the liquid from which the vapour was derived underwent a similar change it is still a point of difference between eminent investigators whether radiant heat up to a temperature of 100c is monochromatic or not some affirm this some deny it a long series of experiments enables me to state that probably no two substances at a temperature of 100c emit heat of the same quality the heat emitted by isinglass for example is different from that emitted by lampblack and the heat emitted by cloth or paper differs from both it is also a subject of discussion whether rocksalt is equally diathermic to all kinds of calorific rays the differences affirmed to exist by some investigators being ascribed by others to differences of incidence from the various sources employed mm de la provostaye and desains maintain the former view melloni and m knoblauch maintain the latter i tested this point without changing anything but the temperature of the source its size distance and surroundings remaining the same the experiments proved rocksalt to be coloured thermally it is more opaque for example to the radiation from a barely visible spiral than to that from a whitehot one in regard to the relation of radiation to conduction if we define radiation internal as well as external as the communication of motion from the vibrating atoms to the aether we may i think by fair theoretic reasoning reach the conclusion that the best radiators ought to prove the worst conductors a broad consideration of the subject shows at once the general harmony of this conclusion with observed facts organic substances are all excellent radiators they are also extremely bad conductors the moment we pass from the metals to their compounds we pass from good conductors to bad ones and from bad radiators to good ones water among liquids is probably the worst conductor it is the best radiator silver among solids is the best conductor it is the worst radiator the excellent researches of mm de la provostaye and desains furnish a striking illustration of what i am inclined to regard as a natural lawthat those atoms which transfer the greatest amount of motion to the aether or in other words radiate most powerfully are the least competent to communicate motion to each other or in other words to propagate by conduction readily xviii life and letters of faraday 1870 undertaken and executed in a reverent and loving spirit the work of dr bence jones makes faraday the virtual writer of his own life everybody now knows the story of the philosophers birth that his father was a smith that he was born at newington butts in 1791 that he ran along the london pavements a brighteyed errand boy with a load of brown curls upon his head and a packet of newspapers under his arm that the lads master was a bookseller and bookbindera kindly man who became attached to the little fellow and in due time made him his apprentice without fee that during his apprenticeship he found his appetite for knowledge provoked and strengthened by the books he stitched and covered thus he grew in wisdom and stature to his year of legal manhood when he appears in the volumes before us as a writer of letters which reveal his occupation acquirements and tone of mind his correspondent was mr abbott a member of the society of friends who with a forecast of his correspondents greatness preserved his letters and produced them at the proper time in later years faraday always carried in his pocket a blank card on which he jotted down in pencil his thoughts and memoranda he made his notes in the laboratory in the theatre and in the streets this distrust of his memory reveals itself in his first letter to abbot to a proposition that no new enquiry should be started between them before the old one had been exhaustively discussed faraday objects your notion he says i can hardly allow for the following reason ideas and thoughts spring up in my mind which are irrevocably lost for want of noting at the time gentle as he seemed he wished to have his own way and he had it throughout his life differences of opinion sometimes arose between the two friends and then they resolutely faced each other i accept your offer to fight it out with joy and shall in the battle of experience cause not pain but i hope pleasure faraday notes his own impetuosity and incessantly checks it there is at times something almost mechanical in his selfrestraint in another nature it would have hardened into mere correctness of conduct but his overflowing affections prevented this in his case the habit of self control became a second nature to him at last and lent serenity to his later years in october 1812 he was engaged by a mr de la roche as a journeyman bookbinder but the situation did not suit him his master appears to have been an austere and passionate man and faraday was to the last degree sensitive all his life he continued so he suffered at times from dejection and a certain grimness too pervaded his moods at present he writes to abbott i am as serious as you can be and would not scruple to speak a truth to any human being whatever repugnance it might give rise to being in this state of mind i should have refrained from writing to you did i not conceive from the general tenor of your letters that your mind is at proper times occupied upon serious subjects to the exclusion of those that are frivolous plainly he had fallen into that stern puritan mood which not only crucifies the affections and lusts of him who harbours it but is often a cause of disturbed digestion to his friends about three months after his engagement with de la roche faraday quitted him and bookbinding together he had heard davy copied his lectures and written to him entreating to be released from trade which he hated and enabled to pursue science davy recognised the merit of his correspondent kept his eye upon him and when occasion offered drove to his door and sent in a letter offering him the post of assistant in the laboratory of the royal institution he was engaged march 1 1813 and on the 8th we find him extracting the sugar from beetroot he joined the city philosophical society which had been founded by mr tatum in 1808 the discipline was very sturdy the remarks very plain and the results most valuable faraday derived great profit from this little association in the laboratory he had a discipline sturdier still both davy and himself were at this time frequently cut and bruised by explosions of chloride of nitrogen one explosion was so rapid as to blow my hand open tear away a part of one nail and make my fingers so sore that i cannot use them easily in another experiment the tube and receiver were blown to pieces i got a cut on the head and sir humphry a bruise on his hand and again speaking of the same substance he says when put in the pump and exhausted it stood for a moment and then exploded with a fearful noise both sir h and i had masks on but i escaped this time the best sir h had his face cut in two places about the chin and a violent blow on the forehead struck through a considerable thickness of silk and leather it was this same substance that blew out the eye of dulong over and over again even at this early date we can discern the quality which compounded with his rare intellectual power made faraday a great experimental philosopher this was his desire to see facts and not to rest contented with the descriptions of them he frequently pits the eye against the ear and affirms the enormous superiority of the organ of vision late in life i have heard him say that he could never fully understand an experiment until he had seen it but he did not confine himself to experiment he aspired to be a teacher and reflected and wrote upon the method of scientific exposition a lecturer he observes should appear easy and collected undaunted and unconcerned still his whole behaviour should evince respect for his audience these recommendations were afterwards in great part embodied by himself i doubt his unconcern but his fearlessness was often manifested it used to rise within him as a wave which carried both him and his audience along with it on rare occasions also when he felt himself and his subject hopelessly unintelligible he suddenly evoked a certain recklessness of thought and without halting to extricate his bewildered followers he would dash alone through the jungle into which he had unwittingly led them thus saving them from ennui by the exhibition of a vigour which for the time being they could neither share nor comprehend in october 1813 he quitted england with sir humphry and lady davy during his absence he kept a journal from which copious and interesting extracts have been made by dr bence jones davy was considerate preferring at times to be his own servant rather than impose on faraday duties which he disliked but lady davy was the reverse she treated him as an underling he chafed under the treatment and was often on the point of returning home they halted at geneva de la rive the elder had known davy in 1799 and by his writings in the bibliothque britannique had been the first to make the english chemists labours known abroad he welcomed davy to his country residence in 1814 both were sportsmen and they often went out shooting together on these occasions faraday charged davys gun while de la rive charged his own once the genevese philosopher found himself by the side of faraday and in his frank and genial way entered into conversation with the young man it was evident that a person possessing such a charm of manner and such high intelligence could be no mere servant on enquiry de la rive was somewhat shocked to find that the soidisant domestique was really prparateur in the laboratory of the royal institution and he immediately proposed that faraday thenceforth should join the masters instead of the servants at their meals to this davy probably out of weak deference to his wife objected but an arrangement was come to that faraday thenceforward should have his food in his own room rumour states that a dinner in honour of faraday was given by de la rive this is a delusion there was no such banquet but faraday never forgot the kindness of the friend who saw his merit when he was a mere garcon de laboratoire footnote while confined last autumn at geneva by the effects of a fall in the alps my friends with a kindness i can never forget did all that friendship could suggest to render my captivity pleasant to me m de la rive then wrote out for me the full account of which the foregoing is a condensed abstract it was at the desire of dr bence jones that i asked him to do so the rumour of a banquet at geneva illustrates the tendency to substitute for the youth of 1814 the faraday of later years he returned in 1815 to the royal institution here he helped davy for years he worked also for himself and lectured frequently at the city philosophical society he took lessons in elocution happily without damage to his natural force earnestness and grace of delivery he was never pledged to theory and he changed in opinion as knowledge advanced with him life was growth in those early lectures we hear him say in knowledge that man only is to be contemned and despised who is not in a state of transition and again nothing is more difficult and requires more caution than philosophical deduction nor is there anything more adverse to its accuracy than fixity of opinion not that he was wafted about by every wind of doctrine but that he united flexibility with his strength in striking contrast with this intellectual expansiveness was his fixity in religion but this is a subject which cannot be discussed here of all the letters published in these volumes none possess a greater charm than those of faraday to his wife here as dr bence jones truly remarks he laid open all his mind and the whole of his character and what can be made known can scarcely fail to charm every one by its loveliness its truthfulness and its earnestness abbott and he sometimes swerved into wordplay about love but up to 1820 or thereabouts the passion was potential merely faradays journal indeed contains entries which show that he took pleasure in the assertion of his contempt for love but these very entries became links in his destiny it was through them that he became acquainted with one who inspired him with a feeling which only ended with his life his biographer has given us the means of tracing the varying moods which preceded his acceptance they reveal more than the common alternations of light and gloom at one moment he wishes that his flesh might melt and that he might become nothing at another he is intoxicated with hope the impetuosity of his character was then unchastened by the discipline to which it was subjected in after years the very strength of his passion proved for a time a bar to its advance suggesting as it did to the conscientious mind of miss barnard doubts of her capability to return it with adequate force but they met again and again and at each successive meeting he found his heaven clearer until at length he was able to say not a moments alloy of this evenings happiness occurred everything was delightful to the last moment of my stay with my companion because she was so the turbulence of doubt subsided and a calm and elevating confidence took its place what can i call myself he writes to her in a subsequent letter to convey most perfectly my affection and love for you can i or can truth say more than that for this world i am yours assuredly he made his profession good and no fairer light falls upon his character than that which reveals his relations to his wife never i believe existed a manlier purer steadier love like a burning diamond it continued to shed for sixandforty years its white and smokeless glow faraday was married on june 12 1821 and up to this date davy appears throughout as his friend soon afterwards however disunion occurred between them which while it lasted must have given faraday intense pain it is impossible to doubt the honesty of conviction with which this subject has been treated by dr bence jones and there may be facts known to him but not appearing in these volumes which justify his opinion that davy in those days had become jealous of faraday this which is the prevalent belief is also reproduced in an excellent article in the march number of framers magazine but the best analysis i can make of the data fails to present davy in this light to me the facts as i regard them are briefly these in 1820 oersted of copenhagen made the celebrated discovery which connects electricity with magnetism and immediately afterwards the acute mind of wollaston perceived that a wire carrying a current ought to rotate round its own axis under the influence of a magnetic pole in 1821 he tried but failed to realise this result in the laboratory of the royal institution faraday was not present at the moment but he came in immediately afterwards and heard the conversation of wollaston and davy about the experiment he had also heard a rumour of a wager that dr wollaston would eventually succeed this was in april in the autumn of the same year faraday wrote a history of electromagnetism and repeated for himself the experiments which he described it was while thus instructing himself that he succeeded in causing a wire carrying an electric current to rotate round a magnetic pole this was not the result sought by wollaston but it was closely related to that result the strong tendency of faradays mind to look upon the reciprocal actions of natural forces gave birth to his greatest discoveries and we who know this should be justified in concluding that even had wollaston not preceded him the result would have been the same but in judging davy we ought to transport ourselves to his time and carefully exclude from our thoughts and feelings that noble subsequent life which would render simply impossible the ascription to faraday of anything unfair it would be unjust to davy to put our knowledge in the place of his or to credit him with data which he could not have possessed rumour and fact had connected the name of wollaston with these supposed interactions between magnets and currents when therefore faraday in october published his successful experiment without any allusion to wollaston general though really ungrounded criticism followed i say ungrounded because firstly faradays experiment was not that of wollaston and secondly faraday before he published it had actually called upon wollaston and not finding him at home did not feel himself authorised to mention his name in december faraday published a second paper on the same subject from which through a misapprehension the name of wollaston was also omitted warburton and others thereupon affirmed that wollastons ideas had been appropriated without acknowledgment and it is plain that wollaston himself though cautious in his utterance was also hurt censure grew till it became intolerable i hear writes faraday to his friend stodart every day more and more of these sounds which though only whispers to me are i suspect spoken aloud among scientific men he might have written explanations and defences but he went straighter to the point he wished to see the principals face to faceto plead his cause before them personally there was a certain vehemence in his desire to do this he saw wollaston he saw davy he saw warburton and i am inclined to think that it was the irresistible candour and truth of character which these viva voce defences revealed as much as the defences themselves that disarmed resentment at the time as regards davy another cause of dissension arose in 1823 in the spring of that year faraday analysed the hydrate of chlorine a substance once believed to be the element chlorine but proved by davy to be a compound of that element and water the analysis was looked over by davy who then and there suggested to faraday to heat the hydrate in a closed glass tube this was done the substance was decomposed and one of the products of decomposition was proved by faraday to be chlorine liquefied by its own pressure on the day of its discovery he communicated this result to dr paris davy on being informed of it instantly liquefied another gas in the same way having struck thus into faradays enquiry ought he not to have left the matter in faradays hands i think he ought but considering his relation to both faraday and the hydrate of chlorine davy i submit may be excused for thinking differently a father is not always wise enough to see that his son has ceased to be a boy and estrangement on this account is not rare nor was davy wise enough to discern that faraday had passed the mere assistant stage and become a discoverer it is now hard to avoid magnifying this error but had faraday died or ceased to work at this time or had his subsequent life been devoted to moneygetting instead of to research would anybody now dream of ascribing jealousy to davy assuredly not why should he be jealous his reputation at this time was almost without a parallel his glory was without a cloud he had added to his other discoveries that of faraday and after having been his teacher for seven years his language to him was this it gives me great pleasure to hear that you are comfortable at the royal institution and i trust that you will not only do something good and honourable for yourself but also for science this is not the language of jealousy potential or actual but the chlorine business introduced irritation and anger to which and not to any ignobler motive davys opposition to the election of faraday to the royal society is i am persuaded to be ascribed these matters are touched upon with perfect candour and becoming consideration in the volumes of dr bence jones but in society they are not always so handled here a name of noble intellectual associations is surrounded by injurious rumours which i would willingly scatter for ever the pupils magnitude and the splendour of his position are too great and absolute to need as a foil the humiliation of his master brothers in intellect davy and faraday however could never have become brothers in feeling their characters were too unlike davy loved the pomp and circumstance of fame faraday the inner consciousness that he had fairly won renown they were both proud men but with davy pride projected itself into the outer world while with faraday it became a steadying and dignifying inward force in one great particular they agreed each of them could have turned his science to immense commercial profit but neither of them did so the noble excitement of research and the delight of discovery constituted their reward i commend them to the reverence which great gifts greatly exercised ought to inspire they were both ours and through the coming centuries england will be able to point with just pride to the possession of such men the first volume of the life and letters reveals to us the youth who was to be father to the man skilful aspiring resolute he grew steadily in knowledge and in power consciously or unconsciously the relation of action to reaction was ever present to faradays mind it had been fostered by his discovery of magnetic rotations and it planted in him more daring ideas of a similar kind magnetism he knew could be evoked by electricity and he thought that electricity in its turn ought to be capable of evolution by magnetism on august 29 1831 his experiments on this subject began he had been fortified by previous trials which though failures had begotten instincts directing him towards the truth he like every strong worker might at times miss the outward object but he always gained the inner light education and expansion of this faradays life was a constant illustration by november he had discovered and colligated a multitude of the most wonderful and unexpected phenomena he had generated currents by currents currents by magnets permanent and transitory and he afterwards generated currents by the earth itself aragos magnetism of rotation which had for years offered itself as a challenge to the best scientific intellects of europe now fell into his hands it proved to be a beautiful but still special illustration of the great principle of magnetoelectric induction nothing equal to this latter in the way of pure experimental enquiry had previously been achieved electricities from various sources were next examined and their differences and resemblances revealed he thus assured himself of their substantial identity he then took up conduction and gave many striking illustrations of the influence of fusion on conducting power renouncing professional work from which at this time he might have derived an income of many thousands a year he poured his whole momentum into his researches he was long entangled in electrochemistry the light of law was for a time obscured by the thick umbrage of novel facts but he finally emerged from his researches with the great principle of definite electrochemical decomposition in his hands if his discovery of magnetoelectricity may be ranked with that of the pile by volta this new discovery may almost stand beside that of definite combining proportions in chemistry he passed on to static electricityits conduction induction and mode of propagation he discovered and illustrated the principle of inductive capacity and turning to theory he asked himself how electrical attractions and repulsions are transmitted are they like gravity actions at a distance or do they require a medium if the former then like gravity they will act in straight lines if the latter then like sound or light they may turn a corner faraday heldand his views are gaining groundthat his experiments proved the fact of curvilinear propagation and hence the operation of a medium others denied this but none can deny the profound and philosophic character of his leading thought footnote in a very remarkable paper published in poggendorffs annalen for 1857 werner siemens accepts and develops faradays theory of molecular induction the first volume of the researches contains all the papers here referred to faraday had heard it stated that henceforth physical discoveries would be made solely by the aid of mathematics that we had our data and needed only to work deductively statements of a similar character crop out from time to time in our day they arise from an imperfect acquaintance with the nature present condition and prospective vastness of the field of physical enquiry the tendency of natural science doubtless is to bring all physical phenomena under the dominion of mechanical laws to give them in other words mathematical expression but our approach to this result is asymptotic and for ages to comepossibly for all the ages of the human racenature will find room for both the philosophical experimenter and the mathematician faraday entered his protest against the foregoing statement by labelling his investigations experimental researches in electricity they were completed in 1854 and three volumes of them have been published for the sake of reference he numbered every paragraph the last number being 3362 in 1859 he collected and published a fourth volume of papers under the title experimental researches in chemistry and physics thus did this apostle of experiment illustrate its power and magnify his office the second volume of the researches embraces memoirs on the electricity of the gymnotus on the source of power in the voltaic pile on the electricity evolved by the friction of water and steam in which the phenomena and principles of sir william armstrongs hydroelectric machine are described and developed a paper on magnetic rotations and faradays letters in relation to the controversy it aroused the contribution of most permanent value here is that on the source of power in the voltaic pile by it the contact theory pure and simple was totally overthrown and the necessity of chemical action to the maintenance of the current demonstrated the third volume of the researches opens with a memoir entitled the magnetisation of light and the illumination of magnetic lines of force it is difficult even now to affix a definite meaning to this title but the discovery of the rotation of the plane of polarisation which it announced seems pregnant with great results the writings of william thomson on the theoretic aspects of the discovery the excellent electrodynamic measurements of wilhelm weber which are models of experimental completeness and skill webers labours in conjunction with his lamented friend kohlrauschabove all the researches of clerk maxwell on the electromagnetic theory of lightpoint to that wonderful and mysterious medium which is the vehicle of light and radiant heat as the probable basis also of magnetic and electric phenomena the hope of such a connection was first raised by the discovery here referred to footnote a letter addressed to me by professor weber on march 18 last contains the following reference to the connection here mentioned die hoffnung einer solchen combination ist durch faradays entdeckung der drehung er polarisationsebene durch magnetische directionskraft zuerst und sodann durch die uebereinstimmung derjenigen geschwindigkeit welche das verhaeltniss der electrodynamischen einheit zur lectrostatischen ausdrueckt mit der geschwindigkeit des lichts angeregt worden und mir scheint von allen versuchen welche zur erwirklichung dieser hoffnung gemacht worden sind das von herrn maxwell gemachte am erfolgreichsten faraday himself seemed to cling with particular affection to this discovery he felt that there was more in it than he was able to unfold he predicted that it would grow in meaning with the growth of science this it has done this it is doing now its right interpretation will probably mark an epoch in scientific history rapidly following it is the discovery of diamagnetism or the repulsion of matter by a magnet brugmans had shown that bismuth repelled a magnetic needle here he stopped le bailliff proved that antimony did the same here he stopped seebeck becquerel and others also touched the discovery these fragmentary gleams excited a momentary curiosity and were almost forgotten when faraday independently alighted on the same facts and instead of stopping made them the inlets to a new and vast region of research the value of a discovery is to be measured by the intellectual action it calls forth and it was faradays good fortune to strike such lodes of scientific truth as give occupation to some of the best intellects of our age the salient quality of faradays scientific character reveals itself from beginning to end of these volumes a union of ardour and patiencethe one prompting the attack the other holding him on to it till defeat was final or victory assured certainty in one sense or the other was necessary to his peace of mind the right method of investigation is perhaps incommunicable it depends on the individual rather than on the system and the mark is missed when faradays researches are pointed to as merely illustrative of the power of the inductive philosophy the brain may be filled with that philosophy but without the energy and insight which this man possessed and which with him were personal and distinctive we should never rise to the level of his achievements his power is that of individual genius rather than of philosophic method the energy of a strong soul expressing itself after its own fashion and acknowledging no mediator between it and nature the second volume of the life and letters like the first is a historic treasury as regards faradays work and character and his scientific and social relations it contains letters from humboldt herschel hachette de la rive dumas liebig melloni becquerel oersted plucker du bois reymond lord melbourne prince louis napoleon and many other distinguished men i notice with particular pleasure a letter from sir john herschel in reply to a sealed packet addressed to him by faraday but which he had permission to open if he pleased the packet referred to one of the many unfulfilled hopes which spring up in the minds of fertile investigators go on and prosper from strength to strength like a victor marching with assured step to further conquests and be certain that no voice will join more heartily in the peans that already begin to rise and will speedily swell into a shout of triumph astounding even to yourself than that of j f w herschel faradays behaviour to melloni in 1835 merits a word of notice the young man was a political exile in paris he had newly fashioned and applied the thermoelectric pile and had obtained with it results of the greatest importance but they were not appreciated with the sickness of disappointed hope melloni waited for the report of the commissioners appointed by the academy of sciences to examine the primier at length he published his researches in the annales de chimie they thus fell into the hands of faraday who discerning at once their extraordinary merit obtained for their author the rumford medal of the royal society a sum of money always accompanies this medal and the pecuniary help was at this time even more essential than the mark of honour to the young refugee mellonis gratitude was boundless et vous monsieur he writes to faraday qui appartenez une socit laquelle je navais rien offert vous qui me connaissiez peine de nom vous navez pas demand si javais des ennemis faibles ou puissants ni calcul quel en tait le nombre mais vous avez parl pour lopprim tranger pour celui qui navait pas le moindre droit tant de bienveillance et vos paroles ont t accueillies favorablement par des collgues consciencieux je reconnais bien l des hommes dignes de leur noble mission les vritable reprsentants de la science dun pays libre et gnreux within the prescribed limits of this article it would be impossible to give even the slenderest summary of faradays correspondence or to carve from it more than the merest fragments of his character his letters written to lord melbourne and others in 1836 regarding his pension illustrate his uncompromising independence the prime minister had offended him but assuredly the apology demanded and given was complete i think it certain that notwithstanding the very full account of this transaction given by dr bence jones motives and influences were at work which even now are not entirely revealed the minister was bitterly attacked but he bore the censure of the press with great dignity faraday while he disavowed having either directly or indirectly furnished the matter of those attacks did not publicly exonerate the premier the hon caroline fox had proved herself faradays ardent friend and it was she who had healed the breach between the philosopher and the minister she manifestly thought that faraday ought to have come forward in lord melbournes defence and there is a flavour of resentment in one of her letters to him on the subject no doubt faraday had good grounds for his reticence but they are to me unknown in 1841 his health broke down utterly and he went to switzerland with his wife and brotherinlaw his bodily vigour soon revived and he accomplished feats of walking respectable even for a trained mountaineer the published extracts from his swiss journal contain many beautiful and touching allusions amid references to the tints of the jungfrau the blue rifts of the glaciers and the noble niesen towering over the lake of thun we come upon the charming little scrap which i have elsewhere quoted cloutnail making goes on here rather considerably and is a very neat and pretty operation to observe i love a smiths shop and anything relating to smithery my father was a smith this is from his journal but he is unconsciously speaking to somebodyperhaps to the world his description of the staubbach giessbach and of the scenic effects of sky and mountain are all fine and sympathetic but amid it all and in reference to it all he tells his sister that true enjoyment is from within not from without in those days agassiz was living under a slab of gneiss on the glacier of the aar faraday met forbes at the grimsel and arranged with him an excursion to the htel des neufchtelois but indisposition put the project out from the fort of ham in 1843 faraday received a letter addressed to him by prince louis napoleon bonaparte he read this letter to me many years ago and the desire shown in various ways by the french emperor to turn modern science to account has often reminded me of it since at the age of thirtyfive the prisoner of ham speaks of rendering his captivity less sad by studying the great discoveries which science owes to faraday and he asks a question which reveals his cast of thought at the time what is the most simple combination to give to a voltaic battery in order to produce a spark capable of setting fire to powder under water or under ground should the necessity arise the french emperor will not lack at the outset the best appliances of modern science while we i fear shall have to learn the magnitude of the resources we are now neglecting amid the pangs of actual war footnote the science has since been applied with astonishing effect by those who had studied it far more thoroughly than the emperor of the french we also i am happy to think have improved the time since the above words were written 1878 one turns with renewed pleasure to faradays letters to his wife published in the second volume here surely the loving essence of the man appears more distinctly than anywhere else from the house of dr percy in birmingham he writes thus hereeven here the moment i leave the table i wish i were with you in quiet oh what happiness is ours my runs into the world in this way only serve to make me esteem that happiness the more and again we have been to a grand conversazione in the townhall and i have now returned to my room to talk with you as the pleasantest and happiest thing that i can do nothing rests me so much as communion with you i feel it even now as i write and catch myself saying the words aloud as i write them take this moreover as indicative of his love for nature after writing i walk out in the evening hand in hand with my dear wife to enjoy the sunset for to me who love scenery of all that i have seen or can see there is none surpasses that of heaven a glorious sunset brings with it a thousand thoughts that delight me of the numberless lights thrown upon him by the life and letters some fall upon his religion in a letter to lady lovelace he describes himself as belonging to a very small and despised sect of christians known if known at all as sandemanians and our hope is founded on the faith that is in christ he adds i do not think it at all necessary to tie the study of the natural sciences and religion together and in my intercourse with my fellowcreatures that which is religious and that which is philosophical have ever been two distinct things he saw clearly the danger of quitting his moorings and his science acted indirectly as the safeguard of his faith for his investigations so filled his mind as to leave no room for sceptical questionings thus shielding from the assaults of philosophy the creed of his youth his religion was constitutional and hereditary it was implied in the eddies of his blood and in the tremors of his brain and however its outward and visible form might have changed faraday would still have possessed its elemental constituentsawe reverence truth and love it is worth enquiring how so profoundly religious a mind and so great a teacher would be likely to regard our present discussions on the subject of education faraday would be a secularist were he now alive he had no sympathy with those who contemn knowledge unless it be accompanied by dogma a lecture delivered before the city philosophical society in 1818 when he was twentysix years of age expresses the views regarding education which he entertained to the end of his life first then he says all theological considerations are banished from the society and of course from my remarks and whatever i may say has no reference to a future state or to the means which are to be adopted in this world in anticipation of it next i have no intention of substituting anything for religion but i wish to take that part of human nature which is independent of it morality philosophy commerce the various institutions and habits of society are independent of religion and may exist either with or without it they are always the same and can dwell alike in the breasts of those who from opinion are entirely opposed in the set of principles they include in the term religion or in those who have none to discriminate more closely if possible i will observe that we have no right to judge religious opinions but the human nature of this evening is that part of man which we have a right to judge and i think it will be found on examination that this humanityas it may perhaps be calledwill accord with what i have before described as being in our own hands so improvable and perfectible in an old journal i find the following remarks on one of my earliest dinners with faraday at two oclock he came down for me he his niece and myself formed the party i never give dinners he said i dont know how to give dinners and i never dine out but i should not like my friends to attribute this to a wrong cause i act thus for the sake of securing time for work and not through religious motives as some imagine he said grace i am almost ashamed to call his prayer a saying of grace in the language of scripture it might be described as the petition of a son into whose heart god had sent the spirit of his son and who with absolute trust asked a blessing from his father we dined on roast beef yorkshire pudding and potatoes drank sherry talked of research and its requirements and of his habit of keeping himself free from the distractions of society he was bright and joyfulboylike in fact though he is now sixtytwo his work excites admiration but contact with him warms and elevates the heart here surely is a strong man i love strength but let me not forget the example of its union with modesty tenderness and sweetness in the character of faraday faradays progress in discovery and the salient points of his character are well brought out by the wise choice of letters and extracts published in the volumes before us i will not call the labours of the biographer final so great a character will challenge reconstruction in the coming time some sympathetic spirit with the requisite strength knowledge and solvent power will i doubt not render these materials plastic give them more perfect organic form and send through them with less of interruption the currents of faradays life he was too good a man writes his present biographer for me to estimate rightly and too great a philosopher for me to understand thoroughly that may be but the reverent affection to which we owe the discovery selection and arrangement of the materials here placed before us is probably a surer guide than mere literary skill the task of the artist who may wish in future times to reproduce the real though unobtrusive grandeur the purity beauty and childlike simplicity of him whom we have lost will find his chief treasury already provided for him by dr bence joness labour of love xix the copley medalist of 1870 thirty years ago electromagnetism was looked to as a motive power which might possibly compete with steam in centres of industry such as manchester attempts to investigate and apply this power were numerous this is shown by the scientific literature of the time among others mr james prescot joule a resident of manchester took up the subject and in a series of papers published in sturgeons annals of electricity between 1839 and 1841 described various attempts at the construction and perfection of electromagnetic engines the spirit in which mr joule pursued these enquiries is revealed in the following extract i am particularly anxious he says to communicate any new arrangement in order if possible to forestall the monopolising designs of those who seem to regard this most interesting subject merely in the light of pecuniary speculation he was naturally led to investigate the laws of electromagnetic attractions and in 1840 he announced the important principle that the attractive force exerted by two electromagnets or by an electromagnet and a mass of annealed iron is directly proportional to the square of the strength of the magnetising current while the attraction exerted between an electromagnet and the pole of a permanent steel magnet varies simply as the strength of the current these investigations were conducted independently of though a little subsequently to the celebrated enquiries of henry jacobi and lenz and jacobi on the same subject on december 17 1840 mr joule communicated to the royal society a paper on the production of heat by voltaic electricity in it he announced the law that the calorific effects of equal quantities of transmitted electricity are proportional to the resistance overcome by the current whatever may be the length thickness shape or character of the metal which closes the circuit and also proportional to the square of the quantity of transmitted electricity this is a law of primary importance in another paper presented to but declined by the royal society he confirmed this law by new experiments and materially extended it he also executed experiments on the heat consequent on the passage of voltaic electricity through electrolytes and found in all cases that the heat evolved by the proper action of any voltaic current is proportional to the square of the intensity of that current multiplied by the resistance to conduction which it experiences from this law he deduced a number of conclusions of the highest importance to electrochemistry it was during these enquiries which are marked throughout by rare sagacity and originality that the great idea of establishing quantitative relations between mechanical energy and heat arose and assumed definite form in his mind in 1843 mr joule read before the meeting of the british association at cork a paper on the calorific effects of magnetoelectricity and on the mechanical value of heat even at the present day this memoir is tough reading and at the time it was written it must have appeared hopelessly entangled this i should think was the reason why faraday advised mr joule not to submit the paper to the royal society but its drift and results are summed up in these memorable words by its author written some time subsequently in that paper it was demonstrated experimentally that the mechanical power exerted in turning a magnetoelectric machine is converted into the heat evolved by the passage of the currents of induction through its coils and on the other hand that the motive power of the electromagnetic engine is obtained at the expense of the heat due to the chemical reaction of the battery by which it is worked footnote phil mag may 1845 it is needless to dwell upon the weight and importance of this statement considering the imperfections incidental to a first determination it is not surprising that the mechanical values of heat deduced from the different series of experiments published in 1843 varied widely from each other the lowest limit was 587 and the highest 1026 footpounds for 1 degree fahr of temperature one noteworthy result of his enquiries which was pointed out at the time by mr joule had reference to the exceedingly small fraction of the heat actually converted into useful effect in the steamengine the thoughts of the celebrated julius robert mayer who was then engaged in germany upon the same question had moved independently in the same groove but to his labours due reference will be made on a future occasion footnote see the next fragment in the memoir now referred to mr joule also announced that he had proved heat to be evolved during the passage of water through narrow tubes and he deduced from these experiments an equivalent of 770 footpounds a figure remarkably near the one now accepted a detached statement regarding the origin and convertibility of animal heat strikingly illustrates the penetration of mr joule and his mastery of principles at the period now referred to a friend had mentioned to him hallers hypothesis that animal heat might arise from the friction of the blood in the veins and arteries it is unquestionable writes mr joule that heat is produced by such friction but it must be understood that the mechanical force expended in the friction is a part of the force of affinity which causes the venous blood to unite with oxygen so that the whole heat of the system must still be referred to the chemical changes but if the animal were engaged in turning a piece of machinery or in ascending a mountain i apprehend that in proportion to the muscular effort put forth for the purpose a diminution of the heat evolved in the system by a given chemical action would be experienced the italics in this memorable passage written it is to be remembered in 1843 are mr joules own the concluding paragraph of this british association paper equally illustrates his insight and precision regarding the nature of chemical and latent heat i had he writes endeavoured to prove that when two atoms combine together the heat evolved is exactly that which would have been evolved by the electrical current due to the chemical action taking place and is therefore proportional to the intensity of the chemical force causing the atoms to combine i now venture to state more explicitly that it is not precisely the attraction of affinity but rather the mechanical force expended by the atoms in falling towards one another which determines the intensity of the current and consequently the quantity of heat evolved so that we have a simple hypothesis by which we may explain why heat is evolved so freely in the combination of gases and by which indeed we may account latent heat as a mechanical power prepared for action as a watchspring is when wound up suppose for the sake of illustration that 8 lbs of oxygen and 1 lb of hydrogen were presented to one another in the gaseous state and then exploded the heat evolved would be about 1 degree fahr in 60000 lbs of water indicating a mechanical force expended in the combination equal to a weight of about 50000000 lbs raised to the height of one foot now if the oxygen and hydrogen could be presented to each other in a liquid state the heat of combination would be less than before because the atoms in combining would fall through less space no words of mine are needed to point out the commanding grasp of molecular physics in their relation to the mechanical theory of heat implied by this statement perfectly assured of the importance of the principle which his experiments aimed at establishing mr joule did not rest content with results presenting such discrepancies as those above referred to he resorted in 1844 to entirely new methods and made elaborate experiments on the thermal changes produced in air during its expansion firstly against a pressure and therefore performing work secondly against no pressure and therefore performing no work he thus established anew the relation between the heat consumed and the work done from five different series of experiments he deduced five different mechanical equivalents the agreement between them being far greater than that attained in his first experiments the mean of them was 802 footpounds from experiments with water agitated by a paddlewheel he deduced in 1845 an equivalent of 890 footpounds in 1847 he again operated upon water and spermoil agitated them by a paddlewheel determined their elevation of temperature and the mechanical power which produced it from the one he derived an equivalent of 7816 footpounds from the other an equivalent of 7821 footpounds the mean of these two very close determinations is 7818 footpounds by this time the labours of the previous ten years had made mr joule completely master of the conditions essential to accuracy and success bringing his ripened experience to bear upon the subject he executed in 1849 a series of 40 experiments on the friction of water 50 experiments on the friction of mercury and 20 experiments on the friction of plates of castiron he deduced from these experiments our present mechanical equivalent of heat justly recognised all over the world as joules equivalent there are labours so great and so pregnant in consequences that they are most highly praised when they are most simply stated such are the labours of mr joule they constitute the experimental foundation of a principle of incalculable moment not only to the practice but still more to the philosophy of science since the days of newton nothing more important than the theory of which mr joule is the experimental demonstrator has been enunciated i have omitted all reference to the numerous minor papers with which mr joule has enriched scientific literature nor have i alluded to the important investigations which he has conducted jointly with sir william thomson but sufficient i think has been here said to show that in conferring upon mr joule the highest honour of the royal society the council paid to genius not only a wellwon tribute but one which had been fairly earned twenty years previously footnote lord beaconsfield has recently honoured himself and england by bestowing an annual pension of 200 pounds on dr joule xx the copley medalist of 1871 dr julius robert mayer was educated for d the medical profession in the summer of 1840 as he himself informs us he was at java and there observed that the venous blood of some of his patients had a singularly bright red colour the observation riveted his attention he reasoned upon it and came to the conclusion that the brightness of the colour was due to the fact that a less amount of oxidation sufficed to keep up the temperature of the body in a hot climate than in a cold one the darkness of the venous blood he regarded as the visible sign of the energy of the oxidation it would be trivial to remark that accidents such as this appealing to minds prepared for them have often led to great discoveries mayers attention was thereby drawn to the whole question of animal heat lavoisier had ascribed this heat to the oxidation of the food one great principle says mayer of the physiological theory of combustion is that under all circumstances the same amount of fuel yields by its perfect combustion the same amount of heat that this law holds good even for vital processes and that hence the living body notwithstanding all its enigmas and wonders is incompetent to generate heat out of nothing but beyond the power of generating internal heat the animal organism can also generate heat outside of itself a blacksmith for example by hammering can heat a nail and a savage by friction can warm wood to its point of ignition now unless we give up the physiological axiom that the living body cannot create heat out of nothing we are driven says mayer to the conclusion that it is the total heat generated within and without that is to be regarded as the true calorific effect of the matter oxidised in the body from this again he inferred that the heat generated externally must stand in a fixed relation to the work expended in its production for supposing the organic processes to remain the same if it were possible by the mere alteration of the apparatus to generate different amounts of heat by the same amount of work it would follow that the oxidation of the same amount of material would sometimes yield a less sometimes a greater quantity of heat hence says mayer that a fixed relation subsists between heat and work is a postulate of the physiological theory of combustion this is the simple and natural account given subsequently by mayer himself of the course of thought started by his observation in java but the conviction once formed that an unalterable relation subsists between work and heat it was inevitable that mayer should seek to express it numerically it was also inevitable that a mind like his having raised itself to clearness on this important point should push forward to consider the relationship of natural forces generally at the beginning of 1842 his work had made considerable progress but he had become physician to the town of heilbronn and the duties of his profession limited the time which he could devote to purely scientific enquiry he thought it wise therefore to secure himself against accident and in the spring of 1842 wrote to liebig asking him to publish in his annalen a brief preliminary notice of the work then accomplished liebig did so and dr mayers first paper is contained in the may number of the annalen for 1842 mayer had reached his conclusions by reflecting on the complex processes of the living body but his first step in public was to state definitely the physical principles on which his physiological deductions were to rest he begins therefore with the forces of inorganic nature he finds in the universe two systems of causes which are not mutually convertiblethe different kinds of matter and the different forms of force the first quality of both he affirms to be indestructibility a force cannot become nothing nor can it arise from nothing forces are convertible but not destructible in the terminology of his time he then gives clear expression to the ideas of potential and dynamic energy illustrating his point by a weight resting upon the earth suspended at a height above the earth and actually falling to the earth he next fixes his attention on cases where motion is apparently destroyed without producing other motion on the shock of inelastic bodies for example under what form does the vanished motion maintain itself experiment alone says mayer can help us here he warms water by stirring it he refers to the force expended in overcoming friction motion in both cases disappears but heat is generated and the quantity generated is the equivalent of the motion destroyed our locomotives he observes with extraordinary sagacity may be compared to distilling apparatus the heat beneath the boiler passes into the motion of the train and is again deposited as heat in the axles and wheels a numerical solution of the relation between heat and work was what mayer aimed at and towards the end of his first paper he makes the attempt it was known that a definite amount of air in rising one degree in temperature can take up two different amounts of heat if its volume be kept constant it takes up one amount if its pressure be kept constant it takes up a different amount these two amounts are called the specific heat under constant volume and under constant pressure the ratio of the first to the second is as 1 1421 no man to my knowledge prior to dr mayer penetrated the significance of these two numbers he first saw that the excess 0421 was not as then universally supposed heat actually lodged in the gas but heat which had been actually consumed by the gas in expanding against pressure the amount of work here performed was accurately known the amount of heat consumed was also accurately known and from these data mayer determined the mechanical equivalent of heat even in this first paper he is able to direct attention to the enormous discrepancy between the theoretic power of the fuel consumed in steamengines and their useful effect though this paper contains but the germ of his further labours i think it may be safely assumed that as regards the mechanical theory of heat this obscure heilbronn physician in the year 1842 was in advance of all the scientific men of the time having by the publication of this paper secured himself against what he calls eventualitaeten he devoted every hour of his spare time to his studies and in 1845 published a memoir which far transcends his first one in weight and fulness and indeed marks an epoch in the history of science the title of mayers first paper was remarks on the forces of inorganic nature the title of his second great essay was organic motion in its connection with nutrition in it he expands and illustrates the physical principles laid down in his first brief paper he goes fully through the calculation of the mechanical equivalent of heat he calculates the performances of steamengines and finds that 100 lbs of coal in a good working engine produce only the same amount of heat as 95 lbs in an unworking one the 5 missing lbs having been converted into work he determines the useful effect of gunpowder and finds nine per cent of the force of the consumed charcoal invested on the moving ball he records observations on the heat generated in water agitated by the pulping engine of a paper manufactory and calculates the equivalent of that heat in horsepower he compares chemical combination with mechanical combinationthe union of atoms with the union of falling bodies with the earth he calculates the velocity with which a body starting at an infinite distance would strike the earths surface and finds that the heat generated by its collision would raise an equal weight of water 17356 c in temperature he then determines the thermal effect which would be produced by the earth itself falling into the sun so that here in 1845 we have the germ of that meteoric theory of the suns heat which mayer developed with such extraordinary ability three years afterwards he also points to the almost exclusive efficacy of the suns heat in producing mechanical motions upon the earth winding up with the profound remark that the heat developed by friction in the wheels of our wind and water mills comes from the sun in the form of vibratory motion while the heat produced by mills driven by tidal action is generated at the expense of the earths axial rotation having thus with firm step passed through the powers of inorganic nature his next object is to bring his principles to bear upon the phenomena of vegetable and animal life wood and coal can burn whence come their heat and the work producible by that heat from the immeasurable reservoir of the sun nature has proposed to herself the task of storing up the light which streams earthward from the sun and of casting into a permanent form the most fugitive of all powers to this end she has overspread the earth with organisms which while living take in the solar light and by its consumption generate forces of another kind these organisms are plants the vegetable world indeed constitutes the instrument whereby the wavemotion of the sun is changed into the rigid form of chemical tension and thus prepared for future use with this prevision as shall subsequently be shown the existence of the human race itself is inseparably connected it is to be observed that mayers utterances are far from being anticipated by vague statements regarding the stimulus of light or regarding coal as bottled sunlight he first saw the full meaning of de saussures observation as to the reducing power of the solar rays and gave that observation its proper place in the doctrine of conservation in the leaves of a tree the carbon and oxygen of carbonic acid and the hydrogen and oxygen of water are forced asunder at the expense of the sun and the amount of power thus sacrificed is accurately restored by the combustion of the tree the heat and work potential in our coal strata are so much strength withdrawn from the sun of former ages mayer lays the axe to the root of the notions regarding vital force which were prevalent when he wrote with the plain fact before us that in the absence of the solar rays plants cannot perform the work of reduction or generate chemical tensions it is he contends incredible that these tensions should be caused by the mystic play of the vital force such an hypothesis would cut off all investigation it would land us in a chaos of unbridled phantasy i count he says therefore upon your agreement with me when i state as an axiomatic truth that during vital processes the conversion only and never the creation of matter or force occurs having cleared his way through the vegetable world as he had previously done through inorganic nature mayer passes on to the other organic kingdom the physical forces collected by plants become the property of animals animals consume vegetables and cause them to reunite with the atmospheric oxygen animal heat is thus produced and not only animal heat but animal motion there is no indistinctness about mayer here he grasps his subject in all its details and reduces to figures the concomitants of muscular action a bowler who imparts to an 8lb ball a velocity of 30 feet consumes in the act one tenth of a grain of carbon a man weighing 150 lbs who lifts his own body to a height of 8 feet consumes in the act 1 grain of carbon in climbing a mountain 10000 feet high the consumption of the same man would be 2 oz 4 drs 50 grs of carbon boussingault had determined experimentally the addition to be made to the food of horses when actively working and liebig had determined the addition to be made to the food of men employing the mechanical equivalent of heat which he had previously calculated mayer proves the additional food to be amply sufficient to cover the increased oxidation but he does not content himself with showing in a general way that the human body burns according to definite laws when it performs mechanical work he seeks to determine the particular portion of the body consumed and in doing so executes some noteworthy calculations the muscles of a labourer 150 lbs in weight weigh 64 lbs but when perfectly desiccated they fall to 15 lbs were the oxidation corresponding to that labourers work exerted on the muscles alone they would be utterly consumed in 80 days the heart furnishes a still more striking example were the oxidation necessary to sustain the hearts action exerted upon its own tissue it would be utterly consumed in 8 days and if we confine our attention to the two ventricles their action would be sufficient to consume the associated muscular tissue in 35 days here in his own words emphasised in his own way is mayers pregnant conclusion from these calculations the muscle is only the apparatus by means of which the conversion of the force is effected but it is not the substance consumed in the production of the mechanical effect he calls the blood the oil of the lamp of life it is the slowburning fluid whose chemical force in the furnace of the capillaries is sacrificed to produce animal motion this was mayers conclusion twentysix years ago it was in complete opposition to the scientific conclusions of his time but eminent investigators have since amply verified it thus in baldest outline i have sought to give some notion of the first half of this marvellous essay the second half is so exclusively physiological that i do not wish to meddle with it i will only add the illustration employed by mayer to explain the action of the nerves upon the muscles as an engineer by the motion of his finger in opening a valve or loosing a detent can liberate an amount of mechanical motion almost infinite compared with its exciting cause so the nerves acting upon the muscles can unlock an amount of activity wholly out of proportion to the work done by the nerves themselves as regards these questions of weightiest import to the science of physiology dr mayer in 1845 was assuredly far in advance of all living men mayer grasped the mechanical theory of heat with commanding power illustrating it and applying it in the most diverse domains he began as we have seen with physical principles he determined the numerical relation between heat and work he revealed the source of the energies of the vegetable world and showed the relationship of the heat of our fires to solar heat he followed the energies which were potential in the vegetable up to their local exhaustion in the animal but in 1845 a new thought was forced upon him by his calculations he then for the first time drew attention to the astounding amount of heat generated by gravity where the force has sufficient distance to act through he proved as i have before stated the heat of collision of a body falling from an infinite distance to the earth to be sufficient to raise the temperature of a quantity of water equal to the falling body in weight 17356c he also found in 1845 that the gravitating force between the earth and sun was competent to generate an amount of heat equal to that obtainable from the combustion of 6000 times the weight of the earth of solid coal with the quickness of genius he saw that we had here a power sufficient to produce the enormous temperature of the sun and also to account for the primal molten condition of our own planet mayer shows the utter inadequacy of chemical forces as we know them to produce or maintain the solar temperature he shows that were the sun a lump of coal it would be utterly consumed in 5000 years he shows the difficulties attending the assumption that the sun is a cooling body for supposing it to possess even the high specific heat of water its temperature would fall 15000 in 5000 years he finally concludes that the light and heat of the sun are maintained by the constant impact of meteoric matter i never ventured an opinion as to the truth of this theory that is a question which may still have to be fought out but i refer to it as an illustration of the force of genius with which mayer followed the mechanical theory of heat through all its applications whether the meteoric theory be a matter of fact or not with him abides the honour of proving to demonstration that the light and heat of suns and stars may be originated and maintained by the collisions of cold planetary matter it is the man who with the scantiest data could accomplish all this in six short years and in the hours snatched from the duties of an arduous profession that the royal society in 1871 crowned with its highest honour comparing this brief history with that of the copley medalist of 1870 the differentiating influence of environment on two minds of similar natural cast and endowment comes out in an instructive manner withdrawn from mechanical appliances mayer fell back upon reflection selecting with marvellous sagacity from existing physical data the single result on which could be founded a calculation of the mechanical equivalent of heat in the midst of mechanical appliances joule resorted to experiment and laid the broad and firm foundation which has secured for the mechanical theory the acceptance it now enjoys a great portion of joules time was occupied in actual manipulation freed from this mayer had time to follow the theory into its most abstruse and impressive applications with their places reversed however joule might have become mayer and mayer might have become joule it does not lie within the scope of these brief articles to enter upon the developments of the dynamical theory accomplished since joule and mayer executed their memorable labours xxi death by lightning people in general imagine when they think at all about the matter that an impression upon the nervesa blow for example or the prick of a pinis felt at the moment it is inflicted but this is not the case the seat of sensation being the brain to it the intelligence of any impression made upon the nerves has to be transmitted before this impression can become manifest as consciousness the transmission moreover requires time and the consequence is that a wound inflicted on a portion of the body distant from the brain is more tardily appreciated than one inflicted adjacent to the brain by an extremely ingenious experimental arrangement helmholtz has determined the velocity of this nervous transmission and finds it to be about eighty feet a second or less than onethirteenth of the velocity of sound in air if therefore a whale forty feet long were wounded in the tail it would not be conscious of the injury till half a second after the wound had been inflicted footnote a most admirable lecture on the velocity of nervous transmission has been published by dr du bois reymond in the proceedings of the royal institution for 1866 vol iv p 575 but this is not the only ingredient in the delay there can scarcely be a doubt that to every act of consciousness belongs a determinate molecular arrangement of the brainthat every thought or feeling has its physical correlative in that organ and nothing can be more certain than that every physical change whether molecular or mechanical requires time for its accomplishment so that besides the interval of transmission a still further time is necessary for the brain to put itself in orderfor its molecules to take up the motions or positions necessary to the completion of consciousness helmholtz considers that onetenth of a second is demanded for this purpose thus in the case of the whale above supposed we have first half a second consumed in the transmission of the intelligence through the sensor nerves to the head onetenth of a second consumed by the brain in completing the arrangements necessary to consciousness and if the velocity of transmission through the motor be the same as that through the sensor nerves half a second in sending a command to the tail to defend itself thus one second and a tenth would elapse before an impression made upon its caudal nerves could be responded to by a whale forty feet long now it is quite conceivable that an injury might be inflicted so rapidly that within the time required by the brain to complete the arrangements necessary to consciousness its power of arrangement might be destroyed in such a case though the injury might be of a nature to cause death this would occur without pain death in this case would be simply the sudden negation of life without any intervention of consciousness whatever the time required for a riflebullet to pass clean through a mans head may be roughly estimated at a thousandth of a second here therefore we should have no room for sensation and death would be painless but there are other actions which far transcend in rapidity that of the riflebullet a flash of lightning cleaves a cloud appearing and disappearing in less than a hundredthousandth of a second and the velocity of electricity is such as would carry it in a single second over a distance almost equal to that which separates the earth and moon it is well known that a luminous impression once made upon the retina endures for about onesixth of a second and that this is the reason why we see a continuous band of light when a glowing coal is caused to pass rapidly through the air a body illuminated by an instantaneous flash continues to be seen for the sixth of a second after the flash has become extinct and if the body thus illuminated be in motion it appears at rest at the place where the flash falls upon it when a colourtop with differentlycoloured sectors is caused to spin rapidly the colours blend together such a top rotating in a dark room and illuminated by an electric spark appears motionless each distinct colour being clearly seen professor dove has found that a flash of lightning produces the same effect during a thunderstorm he put a colourtop in exceedingly rapid motion and found that every flash revealed the top as a motionless object with its colours distinct if illuminated solely by a flash of lightning the motion of all bodies on the earths surface would as dove has remarked appear suspended a cannonball for example would have its flight apparently arrested and would seem to hang motionless in space as long as the luminous impression which revealed the ball remained upon the eye if then a riflebullet move with sufficient rapidity to destroy life without the interposition of sensation much more is a flash of lightning competent to produce this effect accordingly we have wellauthenticated cases of people being struck senseless by lightning who on recovery had no memory of pain the following circumstantial case is described by hemmer on june 30 1788 a soldier in the neighbourhood of mannheim being overtaken by rain placed himself under a tree beneath which a woman had previously taken shelter he looked upwards to see whether the branches were thick enough to afford the required protection and in doing so was struck by lightning and fell senseless to the earth the woman at his side experienced the shock in her foot but was not struck down some hours afterwards the man revived but remembered nothing about what had occurred save the fact of his looking up at the branches this was his last act of consciousness and he passed from the conscious to the unconscious condition without pain the visible marks of a lightning stroke are usually insignificant the hair is sometimes burnt slight wounds are observed while in some instances a red streak marks the track of the discharge over the skin under ordinary circumstances the discharge from a small leyden jar is exceedingly unpleasant to me some time ago i happened to stand in the presence of a numerous audience with a battery of fifteen large leyden jars charged beside me through some awkwardness on my part i touched a wire leading from the battery and the discharge went through my body life was absolutely blotted out for a very sensible interval without a trace of pain in a second or so consciousness returned i vaguely discerned the audience and apparatus and by the help of these external appearances immediately concluded that i had received the battery discharge the intellectual consciousness of my position was restored with exceeding rapidity but not so the optical consciousness to prevent the audience from being alarmed i observed that it had often been my desire to receive accidentally such a shock and that my wish had at length been fulfilled but while making this remark the appearance which my body presented to my eyes was that of a number of separate pieces the arms for example were detached from the trunk and seemed suspended in the air in fact memory and the power of reasoning appeared to be complete long before the optic nerve was restored to healthy action but what i wish chiefly to dwell upon here is the absolute painlessness of the shock and there cannot i think be a doubt that to a person struck dead by lightning the passage from life to death occurs without consciousness being in the least degree implicated it is an abrupt stoppage of sensation unaccompanied by a pang xxii science and the spirits their refusal to investigate spiritual phenomena is often urged as a reproach against scientific men i here propose to give a sketch of an attempt to apply to the phenomena those methods of enquiry which are found available in dealing with natural truth some years ago when the spirits were particularly active in this country faraday was invited or rather entreated by one of his friends to meet and question them he had however already made their acquaintance and did not wish to renew it i had not been so privileged and he therefore kindly arranged a transfer of the invitation to me the spirits themselves named the time of meeting and i was conducted to the place at the day and hour appointed absolute unbelief in the facts was by no means my condition of mind on the contrary i thought it probable that some physical principle not evident to the spiritualists themselves might underlie their manifestations extraordinary effects are produced by the accumulation of small impulses galileo set a heavy pendulum in motion by the welltimed puffs of his breath ellicot set one clock going by the ticks of another even when the two clocks were separated by a wall preconceived notions can moreover vitiate to an extraordinary degree the testimony of even veracious persons hence my desire to witness those extraordinary phenomena the existence of which seemed placed beyond a doubt by the known veracity of those who had witnessed and described them the meeting took place at a private residence in the neighbourhood of london my host his intelligent wife and a gentleman who may be called x were in the house when i arrived i was informed that the medium had not yet made her appearance that she was sensitive and might resent suspicion it was therefore requested that the tables and chairs should be examined before her arrival in order to be assured that there was no trickery in the furniture this was done and i then first learned that my hospitable host had arranged that the sance should be a dinnerparty this was to me an unusual form of investigation but i accepted it as one of the accidents of the occasion the medium arriveda delicatelooking young lady who appeared to have suffered much from ill health i took her to dinner and sat close beside her facts were absent for a considerable time a series of very wonderful narratives supplying their place the duty of belief on the testimony of witnesses was frequently insisted on x appeared to be a chosen spiritual agent and told us many surprising things he affirmed that when he took a pen in his hand an influence ran from his shoulder downwards and impelled him to write oracular sentences i listened for a time offering no observation and now continued x this power has so risen as to reveal to me the thoughts of others only this morning i told a friend what he was thinking of and what he intended to do during the day here i thought is something that can be at once tested i said immediately to x if you wish to win to your cause an apostle who will proclaim your principles to the world from the housetop tell me what i am now thinking of x reddened and did not tell me my thought some time previously i had visited baron reichenbach in vienna and i now asked the young lady who sat beside me whether she could see any of the curious things which he describesthe light emitted by crystals for example here is the conversation which followed as extracted from my notes written on the day following the sance mediumoh yes but i see light around all bodies ieven in perfect darkness mediumyes i see luminous atmospheres round all people the atmosphere which surrounds mr r c would fill this room with light iyou are aware of the effects ascribed by baron reichenbach to magnets mediumyes but a magnet makes me terribly ill iam i to understand that if this room were perfectly dark you could tell whether it contained a magnet without being informed of the fact mediumi should know of its presence on entering the room ihow mediumi should be rendered instantly ill ihow do you feel today mediumparticularly well i have not been so well for months ithen may i ask you whether there is at the present moment a magnet in my possession the young lady looked at me blushed and stammered no i am not en rapport with you i sat at her right hand and a lefthand pocket within six inches of her person contained a magnet our host here deprecated discussion as it exhausted the medium the wonderful narratives were resumed but i had narratives of my own quite as wonderful these spirits indeed seemed clumsy creations compared with those with which my own work had made me familiar i therefore began to match the wonders related to me by other wonders a lady present discoursed on spiritual atmospheres which she could see as beautiful colours when she closed her eyes i professed myself able to see similar colours and more than that to be able to see the interior of my own eyes the medium affirmed that she could see actual waves of light coming from the sun i retorted that men of science could tell the exact number of waves emitted in a second and also their exact length the medium spoke of the performances of the spirits on musical instruments i said that such performance was gross in comparison with a kind of music which had been discovered some time previously by a scientific man standing at a distance of twenty feet from a jet of gas he could command the flame to emit a melodious note it would obey and continue its song for hours so loud was the music emitted by the gasflame that it might be heard by an assembly of a thousand people these were acknowledged to be as great marvels as any of those of spiritdom the spirits were then consulted and i was pronounced to be a firstclass medium during this conversation a low knocking was heard from time to time under the table these i was told were the spirits knocks i was informed that one knock in answer to a question meant no that two knocks meant not yet and that three knocks meant yes in answer to a question whether i was a medium the response was three brisk and vigorous knocks i noticed that the knocks issued from a particular locality and therefore requested the spirits to be good enough to answer from another corner of the table they did not comply but i was assured that they would do it and much more byandby the knocks continuing i turned a wineglass upside down and placed my ear upon it as upon a stethoscope the spirits seemed disconcerted by the act they lost their playfulness and did not recover it for a considerable time somewhat weary of the proceedings i once threw myself back against my chair and gazed listlessly out of the window while thus engaged the table was rudely pushed attention was drawn to the wine still oscillating in the glasses and i was asked whether that was not convincing i readily granted the fact of motion and began to feel the delicacy of my position there were several pairs of arms upon the table and several pairs of legs under it but how was i without offence to express the conviction which i really entertained to ward off the difficulty i again turned a wineglass upside down and rested my ear upon it the rim of the glass was not level and my hair on touching it caused it to vibrate and produce a peculiar buzzing sound a perfectly candid and warmhearted old gentleman at the opposite side of the table whom i may call a drew attention to the sound and expressed his entire belief that it was spiritual i however informed him that it was the moving hair acting on the glass the explanation was not well received and x in a tone of severe pleasantry demanded whether it was the hair that had moved the table the promptness of my negative probably satisfied him that my notion was a very different one the superhuman power of the spirits was next dwelt upon the strength of man it was stated was unavailing in opposition to theirs no human power could prevent the table from moving when they pulled it during the evening this pulling of the table occurred or rather was attempted three times twice the table moved when my attention was withdrawn from it on a third occasion i tried whether the act could be provoked by an assumed air of inattention grasping the table firmly between my knees i threw myself back in the chair and waited with eyes fixed on vacancy for the pull it came for some seconds it was pull spirit hold muscle the muscle however prevailed and the table remained at rest up to the present moment this interesting fact is known only to the particular spirit in question and myself a species of mental scenepainting with which my own pursuits had long rendered me familiar was employed to figure the changes and distribution of spiritual power the spirits it was alleged were provided with atmospheres which combined with and interpenetrated each other and considerable ingenuity was shown in demonstrating the necessity of time in effecting the adjustment of the atmospheres a rearrangement of our positions was proposed and carried out and soon afterwards my attention was drawn to a scarcely sensible vibration on the part of the table several persons were leaning on the table at the time and i asked permission to touch the mediums hand oh i know i tremble was her reply throwing one leg across the other i accidentally nipped a muscle and produced thereby an involuntary vibration of the free leg this vibration i knew must be communicated to the floor and thence to the chairs of all present i therefore intentionally promoted it my attention was promptly drawn to the motion and a gentleman beside me whose value as a witness i was particularly desirous to test expressed his belief that it was out of the compass of human power to produce so strange a tremor i believe he added earnestly that it is entirely the spirits work so do i added with heat the candid and warmhearted old gentleman a why sir he continued i feel them at this moment shaking my chair i stopped the motion of the leg now sir a exclaimed they are gone i began again and a once more affirmed their presence i could however notice that there were doubters present who did not quite know what to think of the manifestations i saw their perplexity and as there was sufficient reason to believe that the disclosure of the secret would simply provoke anger i kept it to myself again a period of conversation intervened during which the spirits became animated the evening was confessedly a dull one but matters appeared to brighten towards its close the spirits were requested to spell the name by which i was known in the heavenly world our host commenced repeating the alphabet and when he reached the letter p a knock was heard he began again and the spirits knocked at the letter o i was puzzled but waited for the end the next letter knocked down was e i laughed and remarked that the spirits were going to make a poet of me admonished for my levity i was informed that the frame of mind proper for the occasion ought to have been superinduced by a perusal of the bible immediately before the sance the spelling however went on and sure enough i came out a poet but matters did not end here our host continued his repetition of the alphabet and the next letter of the name proved to be 0 here was manifestly an unfinished word and the spirits were apparently in their most communicative mood the knocks came from under the table but no person present evinced the slightest desire to look under it i asked whether i might go underneath the permission was granted so i crept under the table some tittered but the candid old a exclaimed he has a right to look into the very dregs of it to convince himself having pretty well assured myself that no sound could be produced under the table without its origin being revealed i requested our host to continued his questions he did so but in vain he adopted a tone of tender entreaty but the dear spirits had become dumb dogs and refused to be entreated i continued under that table for at least a quarter of an hour after which with a feeling of despair as regards the prospects of humanity never before experienced i regained my chair once there the spirits resumed their loquacity and dubbed me poet of science this then is the result of an attempt made by a scientific man to look into these spiritual phenomena it is not encouraging and for this reason the present promoters of spiritual phenomena divide themselves into two classes one of which needs no demonstration while the other is beyond the reach of proof the victims like to believe and they do not like to be undeceived science is perfectly powerless in the presence of this frame of mind it is moreover a state perfectly compatible with extreme intellectual subtlety and a capacity for devising hypotheses which only require the hardihood engendered by strong conviction or by callous mendacity to render them impregnable the logical feebleness of science is not sufficiently borne in mind it keeps down the weed of superstition not by logic but by slowly rendering the mental soil unfit for its cultivation when science appeals to uniform experience the spiritualist will retort how do you know that a uniform experience will continue uniform you tell me that the sun has risen for six thousand years that is no proof that it will rise tomorrow within the next twelve hours it may be puffed out by the almighty taking this ground a man may maintain the story of jack and the beanstalk in the face of all the science in the world you urge in vain that science has given us all the knowledge of the universe which we now possess while spiritualism has added nothing to that knowledge the drugged soul is beyond the reach of reason it is in vain that impostors are exposed and the special demon cast out he has but slightly to change his shape return to his house and find it empty swept and garnished since the time when the foregoing remarks were written i have been more than once among the spirits at their own invitation they do not improve on acquaintance surely no

roused emotions hostile to calm investigation it must for ages have seemed hopeless to seek for law or orderly relation and before the thought of law dawned upon the unfolding human mind these otherwise inexplicable effects were referred to personal agency in the fall of a cataract the savage saw the leap of a spirit and the echoed thunderpeal was to him the hammerclang of an exasperated god propitiation of these terrible powers was the consequence and sacrifice was offered to the demons of earth and air but observation tends to chasten the emotions and to check those structural efforts of the intellect which have emotion for their base one by one natural phenomena came to be associated with their proximate causes the idea of direct personal volition mixing itself with the economy of nature retreating more and more many of us fear this change our religious feelings are dear to us and we look with suspicion and dislike on any philosophy the apparent tendency of which is to dry them up probably every change from ancient savagery to our present enlightenment has excited in a greater or less degree fears of this kind but the fact is that we have not yet determined whether its present form is necessary to the life and warmth of religious feeling we may err in linking the imperishable with the transitory and confound the living plant with the decaying pole to which it clings my object however at present is not to argue but to mark a tendency we have ceased to propitiate the powers of natureceased even to pray for things in manifest contradiction to natural laws in protestant countries at least i think it is conceded that the age of miracles is past at an auberge near the foot of the rhone glacier i met in the summer of 1858 an athletic young priest who after a solid breakfast including a bottle of wine informed me that he had come up to bless the mountains this was the annual custom of the place year by year the highest was entreated by official intercessors to make such meteorological arrangements as should ensure food and shelter for the flocks and herds of the valaisians a diversion of the rhone or a deepening of the rivers bed would at the time i now mention have been of incalculable benefit to the inhabitants of the valley but the priest would have shrunk from the idea of asking the omnipotent to open a new channel for the river or to cause a portion of it to flow over the grimsel pass and down the valley of oberhasli to brientz this he would have deemed a miracle and he did not come to ask the creator to perform miracles but to do something which he manifestly thought lay quite within the bounds of the natural and nonmiraculous a protestant gentleman who was present at the time smiled at this recital he had no faith in the priests blessing still he deemed his prayer different in kind from a request to open a new rivercut or to cause the water to flow uphill in a similar manner the same protestant gentleman would doubtless smile at the honest tyrolese priest who when he feared the bursting of a glacier dam offered the sacrifice of the mass upon the ice as a means of averting the calamity that poor man did not expect to convert the ice into adamant or to strengthen its texture so as to enable it to withstand the pressure of the water nor did he expect that his sacrifice would cause the stream to roll back upon its source and relieve him by a miracle of its presence but beyond the boundaries of his knowledge lay a region where rain was generated he knew not how he was not so presumptuous as to expect a miracle but he firmly believed that in yonder cloudland matters could be so arranged without trespass on the miraculous that the stream which threatened him and his people should be caused to shrink within its proper bounds both these priests fashioned that which they did not understand to their respective wants and wishes in their case imagination came into play uncontrolled by a knowledge of law a similar state of mind was long prevalent among mechanicians many of these among whom were to be reckoned men of consummate skill were occupied a century ago with the question of perpetual motion they aimed at constructing a machine which should execute work without the expenditure of power and some of them went mad in the pursuit of this object the faith in such a consummation involving as it did immense personal profit to the inventor was extremely exciting and every attempt to destroy this faith was met by bitter resentment on the part of those who held it gradually however as men became more and more acquainted with the true functions of machinery the dream dissolved the hope of getting work out of mere mechanical combinations disappeared but still there remained for the speculator a cloudland denser than that which filled the imagination of the tyrolese priest and out of which he still hoped to evolve perpetual motion there was the mystic store of chemic force which nobody understood there were heat and light electricity and magnetism all competent to produce mechanical motion footnote see helmholtz wechselwirkung der naturkrfte here then was the mine in which our gem must be sought a modified and more refined form of the ancient faith revived and for aught i know a remnant of sanguine designers may at the present moment be engaged on the problem which likeminded men in former ages left unsolved and why should a perpetual motion even under modern conditions be impossible the answer to this question is the statement of that great generalisation of modern science which is known under the name of the conservation of energy this principle asserts that no power can make its appearance in nature without an equivalent expenditure of some other power that natural agents are so related to each other as to be mutually convertible but that no new agency is created light runs into heat heat into electricity electricity into magnetism magnetism into mechanical force and mechanical force again into light and heat the proteus changes but he is ever the same and his changes in nature supposing no miracle to supervene are the expression not of spontaneity but of physical necessity a perpetual motion then is deemed impossible because it demands the creation of energy whereas the principle of conservation isno creation but infinite conversion it is an old remark that the law which moulds a tear also rounds a planet in the application of law in nature the terms great and small are unknown thus the principle referred to teaches us that the italian wind gliding over the crest of the matterhorn is as firmly ruled as the earth in its orbital revolution round the sun and that the fall of its vapour into clouds is exactly as much a matter of necessity as the return of the seasons the dispersion therefore of the slightest mist by the special volition of the eternal would be as much a miracle as the rolling of the rhone over the grimsel precipices down the valley of hash to meyringen and brientz it seems to me quite beyond the present power of science to demonstrate that the tyrolese priest or his colleague of the rhone valley asked for an impossibility in praying for good weather but science can demonstrate the incompleteness of the knowledge of nature which limited their prayers to this narrow ground and she may lessen the number of instances in which we ask amiss by showing that we sometimes pray for the performance of a miracle when we do not intend it she does assert for example that without a disturbance of natural law quite as serious as the stoppage of an eclipse or the rolling of the river niagara up the falls no act of humiliation individual or national could call one shower from heaven or deflect towards us a single beam of the sun those therefore who believe that the miraculous is still active in nature may with perfect consistency join in our periodic prayers for fair weather and for rain while those who hold that the age of miracles is past will if they be consistent refuse to join in these petitions and these latter if they wish to fall back upon such a justification may fairly urge that the latest conclusions of science are in perfect accordance with the doctrine of the master himself which manifestly was that the distribution of natural phenomena is not affected by moral or religious causes he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust granting the power of free will in man so strongly claimed by professor mansel in his admirable defence of the belief in miracles and assuming the efficacy of free prayer to produce changes in external nature it necessarily follows that natural laws are more or less at the mercy of mans volition and no conclusion founded on the assumed permanence of those laws would be worthy of confidence it is a wholesome sign for england that she numbers among her clergy men wise enough to understand all this and courageous enough to act up to their knowledge such men do service to public character by encouraging a manly and intelligent conflict with the real causes of disease and scarcity instead of a delusive reliance on supernatural aid but they have also a value beyond this local and temporary one they prepare the public mind for changes which though inevitable could hardly without such preparation be wrought without violence iron is strong still water in crystallising will shiver an iron envelope and the more unyielding the metal is the worse for its safety there are in the world men who would encompass philosophic speculation by a rigid envelope hoping thereby to restrain it but in reality giving it explosive force in england thanks to men of the stamp to which i have alluded scope is gradually given to thought for changes of aggregation and the envelope slowly alters its form in accordance with the necessities of the time the proximate origin of the foregoing slight article and probably the remoter origin of the next following one was this some years ago a day of prayer and humiliation on account of a bad harvest was appointed by the proper religious authorities but certain clergymen of the church of england doubting the wisdom of the demonstration declined to join in the services of the day for this act of nonconformity they were severely censured by some of their brethren rightly or wrongly my sympathies were on the side of these men and to lend them a helping hand in their struggle against odds i inserted the foregoing chapter in a little book entitled mountaineering in 1861 some time subsequently i received from a gentleman of great weight and distinction in the scientific world and i believe of perfect orthodoxy in the religious one a note directing my attention to an exceedingly thoughtful article on prayer and cholera in the pall mall gazette my eminent correspondent deemed the article a fair answer to the remarks made by me in 1861 i also was struck by the temper and ability of the article but i could not deem its arguments satisfactory and in a short note to the editor of the pall mall gazette i ventured to state so much this letter elicited some very able replies and a second leading article was also devoted to the subject in answer to all i risked the publication of a second letter and soon afterwards by an extremely courteous note from the editor the discussion was closed though thus stopped locally the discussion flowed in other directions sermons were preached essays were published articles were written while a copious correspondence occupied the pages of some of the religious newspapers it gave me sincere pleasure to notice that the discussion save in a few cases where natural coarseness had the upper hand was conducted with a minimum of vituperation the severity shown was hardly more than sufficient to demonstrate earnestness while gentlemanly feeling was too predominant to permit that earnestness to contract itself to bigotry or to clothe itself in abuse it was probably the memory of this discussion which caused another excellent friend of mine to recommend to my perusal the exceedingly able work which in the next article i have endeavoured to review mr mozleys book belongs to that class of writing of which butler may be taken as the type it is strong genuine argument about difficult matters fairly tracing what is difficult fairly trying to grapple not with what appears the gist and strong point of a question but with what really at bottom is the knot of it it is a book the reasoning of which may not satisfy everyone but we think it is a book for people who wish to see a great subject handled on a scale which befits it and with a perception of its real elements it is a book which will have attractions for those who like to see a powerful mind applying itself without shrinking or holding back without trick or reserve or show of any kind as a wrestler closes body to body with his antagonist to the strength of an adverse and powerful argumenttimes tuesday june 5 1866 we should add that the faults of the work are wholly on the surface and in the arrangement that the matter is as solid and as logical as that of any book within recent memory and that it abounds in striking passages of which we have scarcely been able even to give a sample no future arguer against miracles can afford to pass it oversaturday review september 15 1866 ii miracles and special providences footnote fortnightly review new series vol i p 645 1867 it is my privilege to enjoy the friendship of a select number of religious men with whom i converse frankly upon theological subjects expressing without disguise the notions and opinions i entertain regarding their tenets and hearing in return these notions and opinions subjected to criticism i have thus far found them liberal and loving men patient in hearing tolerant in reply who know how to reconcile the duties of courtesy with the earnestness of debate from one of these nearly a year ago i received a note recommending strongly to my attention the volume of bampton lectures for 1865 in which the question of miracles is treated by mr mozley previous to receiving this note i had in part made the acquaintance of the work through an able and elaborate review of it in the times the combined effect of the letter and the review was to make the book the companion of my summer tour in the alps there during the wet and snowy days which were only too prevalent in 1866 and during the days of rest interpolated between days of toil i made myself more thoroughly conversant with mr mozleys volume i found it clear and strongan intellectual tonic as bracing and pleasant to my mind as the keen air of the mountains was to my body from time to time i jotted down thoughts regarding it intending afterwards to work them up into a coherent whole other duties however interfered with the complete carrying out of this intention and what i wrote last summer i now publish not hoping to be able within any reasonable time to render my defence of scientific method more complete mr mozley refers at the outset of his task to the movement against miracles which of late years has taken place and which determined his choice of a subject he acquits modern science of having had any great share in the production of this movement the objection against miracles he says does not arise from any minute knowledge of the laws of nature but simply because they are opposed to that plain and obvious order of nature which everybody sees the present movement is he thinks to be ascribed to the greater earnestness and penetration of the present age formerly miracles were accepted without question because without reflection but the exercise of the historic imagination is a characteristic of our own time men are now accustomed to place before themselves vivid images of historic facts and when a miracle rises to view they halt before the astounding occurrence and realising it with the same clearness as if it were now passing before their eyes they ask themselves can this have taken place in some instances the effort to answer this question has led to a disbelief in miracles in others to a strengthening of belief the aim of mr mozleys lectures is to show that the strengthening of belief is the logical result which ought to follow from the examination of the facts attempts have been made by religious men to bring the scripture miracles within the scope of the order of nature but all such attempts are rejected by mr mozley as utterly futile and wide of the mark regarding miracles as a necessary accompaniment of a revelation their evidential value in his eyes depends entirely upon their deviation from the order of nature thus deviating they suggest and illustrate a power higher than nature a personal will and they commend the person in whom this power is vested as a messenger from on high without these credentials such a messenger would have no right to demand belief even were his assertions regarding his divine mission backed by a holy life nor is it by miracles alone that the order of nature is or may be disturbed the material universe is also the arena of special providences under these two heads mr mozley distributes the total preternatural one form of the preternatural may shade into the other as one colour passes into another in the rainbow but while the line which divides the specially providential from the miraculous cannot be sharply drawn their distinction broadly expressed is this that while a special providence can only excite surmise more or less probable it is the nature of a miracle to give proof as distinguished from surmise of divine design mr mozley adduces various illustrations of what he regards to be special providences as distinguished from miracles the death of arius he says was not miraculous because the coincidence of the death of a heresiarch taking place when it was peculiarly advantageous to the orthodox faith was not such as to compel the inference of extraordinary divine agency but it was a special providence because it carried a reasonable appearance of it the miracle of the thundering legion was a special providence but not a miracle for the same reason because the coincidence of an instantaneous fall of rain in answer to prayer carried some appearance but not proof of preternatural agency the eminent lecturers remarks on this head brought to my recollection certain narratives published in methodist magazines which i used to read with avidity when a boy the general title of these exciting stories if i remember right was the providence of god asserted and in them the most extraordinary escapes from peril were recounted and ascribed to prayer while equally wonderful instances of calamity were adduced as illustrations of divine retribution in such magazines or elsewhere i found recorded the case of the celebrated samuel hick which as it illustrates a whole class of special providences approaching in conclusiveness to miracles is worthy of mention here it is related of this holy man that on one occasion flour was lacking to make the sacramental bread grain was present and a windmill was present but there was no wind to grind the corn with faith undoubting samuel hick prayed to the lord of the winds the sails turned the corn was ground after which the wind ceased according to the canon of the bampton lecturer this though carrying a strong appearance of an immediate exertion of divine energy lacks by a hairsbreadth the quality of a miracle for the wind might have arisen and might have ceased in the ordinary course of nature hence the occurrence did not compel the inference of extraordinary divine agency in like manner mr mozley considers that the appearance of the cross to constantine was a miracle or a special providence according to what account of it we adopt as only a meteoric appearance in the shape of a cross it gave some token of preternatural agency but not full evidence in the catholic canton of switzerland where i now write and still more among the pious tyrolese the mountains are dotted with shrines containing offerings of all kinds in acknowledgment of special mercieslegs feet arms and handsof gold silver brass and wood according as worldly possessions enabled the grateful heart to express its indebtedness most of these offerings are made to the virgin mary they are recognitions of special providences wrought through the instrumentality of the mother of god mr mozleys belief that of the methodist chronicler and that of the tyrolese peasant are substantially the same each of them assumes that nature instead of flowing ever onward in the uninterrupted rhythm of cause and effect is mediately ruled by the free human will as regards direct action upon natural phenomena mans wish and will as expressed in prayer are confessedly powerless but prayer is the trigger which liberates the divine power and to this extent if the will be free man of course commands nature did the existence of this belief depend solely upon the material benefits derived from it it could not in my opinion last a decade as a purely objective fact we should soon see that the distribution of natural phenomena is unaffected by the merits or the demerits of men that the law of gravitation crushes the simple worshippers of ottery st mary while singing their hymns just as surely as if they were engaged in a midnight brawl the hold of this belief upon the human mind is not due to outward verification but to the inner warmth force and elevation with which it is commonly associated it is plain however that these feelings may exist under the most various forms they are not limited to church of england protestantismthey are not even limited to christianity though less refined they are certainly not less strong in the heart of the methodist and the tyrolese peasant than in the heart of mr mozley indeed those feelings belong to the primal powers of mans nature a sceptic may have them they find vent in the battlecry of the moslem they take hue and form in the huntinggrounds of the red indian and raise all of them as they raise the christian upon a wave of victory above the terrors of the grave the character then of a miracle as distinguished from a special providence is that the former furnishes proof while in the case of the latter we have only surmise dissolve the element of doubt and the alleged fact passes from the one class of the preternatural into the other in other words if a special providence could be proved to be a special providence it would cease to be a special providence and become a miracle there is not the least cloudiness about mr mozleys meaning here a special providence is a doubtful miracle why then not call it so the term employed by mr mozley conveys no negative suggestion whereas the negation of certainty is the peculiar characteristic of the thing intended to be expressed there is an apparent unwillingness on the part of the lecturer to call a special providence what his own definition makes it to be instead of speaking of it as a doubtful miracle he calls it an invisible miracle he speaks of the point of contact of supernatural power with the chain of causation being so high up as to be wholly or in part out of sight whereas the essence of a special providence is the uncertainty whether there is any contact at all either high or low by the use of an incorrect term however a grave danger is avoided for the idea of doubt if kept systematically before the mind would soon be fatal to the special providence considered as a means of edification the term employed on the contrary invites and encourages the trust which is necessary to supplement the evidence this inner trust though at first rejected by mr mozley in favour of external proof is subsequently called upon to do momentous duty in regard to miracles whenever the evidence of the miraculous seems incommensurate with the fact which it has to establish or rather when the fact is so amazing that hardly any evidence is sufficient to establish it mr mozley invokes the affections they must urge the reason to accept the conclusion from which unaided it recoils the affections and emotions are eminently the court of appeal in matters of real religion which is an affair of the heart but they are not i submit the court in which to weigh allegations regarding the credibility of physical facts these must be judged by the dry light of the intellect alone appeals to the affections being reserved for cases where moral elevation and not historic conviction is the aim it is moreover because the result in the case under consideration is deemed desirable that the affections are called upon to back it if undesirable they would with equal right be called upon to act the other way even to the disciplined scientific mind this would be a dangerous doctrine a favourite theorythe desire to establish or avoid a certain n resultcan so warp the mind as to destroy its powers of estimating facts i have known men to work for years under a fascination of this kind unable to extricate themselves from its fatal influence they had certain data but not as it happened enough by a process exactly analogous to that invoked by mr mozley they supplemented the data and went wrong from that hour their intellects were so blinded to the perception of adverse phenomena that they never reached truth if then to the disciplined scientific mind this incongruous mixture of proof and trust be fraught with danger what must it be to the indiscriminate audience which mr mozley addresses in calling upon this agency he acts the part of frankenstein it is a monster thus evoked that we see stalking abroad in the degrading spiritualistic phenomena of the present day again i say where the aim is to elevate the mind to quicken the moral sense to kindle the fire of religion in the soul let the affections by all means be invoked but they must not be permitted to colour our reports or to influence our acceptance of reports of occurrences in external nature testimony as to natural facts is worthless when wrapped in this atmosphere of the affections the most earnest subjective truth being thus rendered perfectly compatible with the most astounding objective error there are questions in judging of which the affections or sympathies are often our best guides the estimation of moral goodness being one of these but at this precise point where they are really of use mr mozley excludes the affections and demands a miracle as a certificate of character he will not accept any other evidence of the perfect goodness of christ no outward life and conduct he says however irreproachable could prove his perfect sinlessness because goodness depends upon the inward motive and the perfection of the inward motive is not proved by the outward act but surely the miracle is an outward act and to pass from it to the inner motive imposes a greater strain upon logic than that involved in our ordinary methods of estimating men there is at least moral congruity between the outward goodness and the inner life but there is no such congruity between the miracle and the life within the test of moral goodness laid down by mr mozley is not the test of john who says he that doeth righteousness is righteous nor is it the test of jesus by their fruits ye shall know them do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles but it is the test of another if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread for my own part i prefer the attitude of fichte to that of mr mozley the jesus of john says this noble and mighty thinker knows no other god than the true god in whom we all are and live and may be blessed and out of whom there is only death and nothingness and continues fichte he appeals and rightly appeals in support of this truth not to reasoning but to the inward practical sense of truth in man not even knowing any other proof than this inward testimony if any man will do the will of him who sent me he shall know of the doetrine whether it be of god accepting mr mozleys test with which alone i am now dealing it is evident that in the demonstration of moral goodness the quantity of the miraculous comes into play had christ for example limited himself to the conversion of water into wine he would have fallen short of the performance of jannes and jambres for it is a smaller thing to convert one liquid into another than to convert a dead rod into a living serpent but jannes and jambres we are informed were not good hence if mr mozleys test be a true one a point must exist on the one side of which miraculous power demonstrates goodness while on the other side it does not how is this point of contrary flexure to be determined it must lie somewhere between the magicians and moses for within this space the power passed from the diabolical to the divine but how to mark the point of passagehow out of a purely quantitative difference in the visible manifestation of power we are to infer a total inversion of qualityit is extremely difficult to see moses we are informed produced a large reptile jannes and jambres produced a small one i do not possess the intellectual faculty which would enable me to infer from those data either the goodness of the one or the badness of the other and in the highest recorded manifestations of the miraculous i am equally at a loss let us not play fast and loose with the miraculous either it is a demonstration of goodness in all cases or in none if mr mozley accepts christs goodness as transcendent because he did such works as no other man did he ought logically speaking to accept the works of those who in his name had cast out devils as demonstrating a proportionate goodness on their part but it is people of this class who are consigned to everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels such zeal as that of mr mozley for miracles tends i fear to eat his religion up the logical threatens to stifles the spiritual the truly religious soul needs no miraculous proof of the goodness of christ the words addressed to matthew at the receipt of custom required no miracle to produce obedience it was by no stroke of the supernatural that jesus caused those sent to seize him to go backward and fall to the ground it was the sublime and holy effluence from within which needed no prodigy to commend it to the reverence even of his foes as regards the function of miracles in the founding of a religion mr mozley institutes a comparison between the religion of christ and that of mahomet and he derides the latter as irrational because it does not profess to adduce miracles in proof of its supernatural origin but the religion of mahomet notwithstanding this drawback has thriven in the world and at one time it held sway over larger populations than christianity itself the spread and influence of christianity are however brought forward by mr mozley as a permanent enormous and incalculable practical result of christian miracles and he makes use of this result to strengthen his plea for the miraculous his logical warrant for this proceeding is not clear it is the method of science when a phenomenon presents itself towards the production of which several elements may contribute to exclude them one by one so as to arrive at length at the truly effective cause heat for example is associated with a phenomenon we exclude heat but the phenomenon remains hence heat is not its cause magnetism is associated with a phenomenon we exclude magnetism but the phenomenon remains hence magnetism is not its cause thus also when we seek the cause of a diffusion of a religionwhether it be due to miracles or to the spiritual force of its founderswe exclude the miracles and finding the result unchanged we infer that miracles are not the effective cause this important experiment mahometanism has made for us it has lived and spread without miracles and to assert in the face of this that christianity has spread because of miracles is i submit opposed both to the spirit of science and the common sense of mankind the incongruity of inferring moral goodness from miraculous power has been dwelt upon above in another particular also the strain put by mr mozley upon miracles is i think more than they can bear in consistency with his principles it is difficult to see how he is to draw from the miracles of christ any certain conclusion as to his divine nature he dwells very forcibly on what he calls the argument from experience in the demolition of which he takes obvious delight he destroys the argument and repeats it for the mere pleasure of again and again knocking the breath out of it experience he urges can only deal with the past and the moment we attempt to project experience a hairsbreadth beyond the point it has at any moment reached we are condemned by reason it appears to me that when he infers from christs miracles a divine and altogether superhuman energy mr mozley places himself precisely under this condemnation for what is his logical ground for concluding that the miracles of the new testament illustrate divine power may they not be the result of expanded human power a miracle he defines as something impossible to man but how does he know that the miracles of the new testament are impossible to man seek as he may he has absolutely no reason to adduce save thisthat man has never hitherto accomplished such things but does the fact that man has never raised the dead prove that he can never raise the dead assuredly not must be mr mozleys reply for this would be pushing experience beyond the limit it has now reachedwhich i pronounce unlawful then a period may come when man will be able to raise the dead if this be concededand i do not see how mr mozley can avoid the concessionit destroys the necessity of inferring christs divinity from his miracles he it may be contended antedated the humanity of the future as a mighty tidal wave leaves high upon the beach a mark which byandby becomes the general level of the ocean turn the matter as you will no other warrant will be found for the allimportant conclusion that christs miracles demonstrate divine power than an argument which has been stigmatised by mr mozley as a rope of sandthe argument from experience the learned bampton lecturer would be in this position even had he seen with his own eyes every miracle recorded in the new testament but he has not seen these miracles and his intellectual plight is therefore worse he accepts these miracles on testimony why does he believe that testimony how does he know that it is not delusion how is he sure that it is not even fraud he will answer that the writing bears the marks of sobriety and truth and that in many cases the bearers of this message to mankind sealed it with their blood granted with all my heart but whence the value of all this is it not solely derived from the fact that men as we know them do not sacrifice their lives in the attestation of that which they know to be untrue does not the entire value of the testimony of the apostles depend ultimately upon our experience of human nature it appears then that those said to have seen the miracles based their inferences from what they saw on the argument from experience and that mr mozley bases his belief in their testimony on the same argument the weakness of his conclusion is quadrupled by this double insertion of a principle of belief to which he flatly denies rationality his reasoning in fact cuts two waysif it destroys our trust in the order of nature it far more effectually abolishes the basis on which mr mozley seeks to found the christian religion over this argument from experience which at bottom is his argument mr mozley rides roughshod there is a dash of scorn in the energy with which he tramples on it probably some previous writer had made too much of it and thus invited his powerful assault finding the difficulty of belief in miracles to rise from their being in contradiction to the order of nature he sets himself to examine the grounds of our belief in that order with a vigour of logic rarely equalled and with a confidence in its conclusions never surpassed he disposes of this belief in a manner calculated to startle those who without due examination had come to the conclusion that the order of nature was secure what we mean he says by our belief in the order of nature is the belief that the future will be like the past there is not according to mr mozley the slightest rational basis for this belief that any cause in nature is more permanent than its existing and known effects extending further and about to produce other and more instances besides what it has produced already we have no evidence let us imagine he continues the occurrence of a particular physical phenomenon for the first time upon that single occurrence we should have but the very faintest expectation of another if it did occur again once or twice so far from counting on another occurrence a cessation would occur as the most natural event to us but let it continue one hundred times and we should find no hesitation in inviting persons from a distance to see it and if it occurred every day for years its occurrence would be a certainty to us its cessation a marvel what ground of reason can we assign for an expectation that any part of the course of nature will be the next moment what it has been up to this moment ie for our belief in the uniformity of nature none no demonstrative reason can be given for the contrary to the recurrence of a fact of nature is no contradiction no probable reason can be given for all probable reasoning respecting the course of nature is founded upon this presumption of likeness and therefore cannot be the foundation of it no reason can be given for this belief it is without a reason it rests upon no rational grounds and can be traced to no rational principle everything mr mozley however adds depends upon this belief every provision we make for the future every safeguard and caution we employ against it all calculation all adjustment of means to ends supposes this belief and yet this belief has no more producible reason for it than a speculation of fancy it is necessary allimportant for the purposes of life but solely practical and possesses no intellectual character the proper function continues mr mozley of the inductive principle the argument from experience the belief in the order of natureby whatever phrase we designate the same instinctis to operate as a practical basis for the affairs of life and the carrying on of human society to sum up the belief in the order of nature is general but it is an unintelligent impulse of which we can give no rational account it is inserted into our constitution solely to induce us to till our fields to raise our winter fuel and thus to meet the future on the perfectly gratuitous supposition that it will be like the past thus step by step says mr mozley with the emphasis of a man who feels his position to be a strong one has philosophy loosened the connection of the order of nature with the ground of reason befriending in exact proportion as it has done this the principle of miracles for this belief not having itself a foundation in reason the ground is gone upon which it could be maintained that miracles as opposed to the order of nature are opposed to reason when we regard this belief in connection with science in which connection it receives a more imposing name and is called the inductive principle the result is the same the inductive principle is only this unreasoning impulse applied to a scientifically ascertained fact science has led up to the fact but there it stops and for converting this fact into a law a totally unscientific principle comes into play the same as that which generalises the commonest observation of nature the eloquent pleader of the cause of miracles passes over without a word the results of scientific investigation as proving anything rational regarding the principles or method by which such results have been achieved here as elsewhere he declines the test by their fruits shall ye know them perhaps our best way of proceeding will be to give one or two examples of the mode in which men of science apply the unintelligent impulse with which mr mozley credits them and which shall show by illustration the surreptitious method whereby they climb from the region of facts to that of laws before the sixteenth century it was known that water rises in a pump the effect being then explained by the maxim that nature abhors a vacuum it was not known that there was any limit to the height to which the water would ascend until on one occasion the gardeners of florence while attempting to raise water to a very great elevation found that the column ceased at a height of thirtytwo feet beyond this all the skill of the pumpmaker could not get it to rise the fact was brought to the notice of galileo and he soured by a world which had not treated his science over kindly is said to have twitted the philosophy of the time by remarking that nature evidently abhorred a vacuum only to a height of thirtytwo feet galileo however did not solve the problem it was taken up by his pupil torricelli to whom after due pondering the thought occurred that the water might be forced into the tube by a pressure applied to the surface of the liquid outside but where under the actual circumstances was such a pressure to be found after much reflection it flashed upon torricelli that the atmosphere might possibly exert this pressure that the impalpable air might possess weight and that a column of water thirtytwo feet high might be of the exact weight necessary to hold the pressure of the atmosphere in equilibrium there is much in this process of pondering and its results which it is impossible to analyse it is by a kind of inspiration that we rise from the wise and sedulous contemplation of facts to the principles on which they depend the mind is as it were a photographic plate which is gradually cleansed by the effort to think rightly and which when so cleansed and not before receives impressions from the light of truth this passage from facts to principles is called induction and induction in its highest form is as i have just stated a kind of inspiration but to make it sure the inward sight must be shown to be in accordance with outward fact to prove or disprove the induction we must resort to deduction and experiment torricelli reasoned thus if a column of water thirtytwo feet high holds the pressure of the atmosphere in equilibrium a shorter column of a heavier liquid ought to do the same now mercury is thirteen times heavier than water hence if my induction be correct the atmosphere ought to be able to sustain only thirty inches of mercury here then is a deduction which can be immediately submitted to experiment torricelli took a glass tube a yard or so in length closed at one end and open at the other and filling it with mercury he stopped the open end with his thumb and inverted it into a basin filled with the liquid metal one can imagine the feeling with which torricelli removed his thumb and the delight he experienced on finding that his thought had forestalled a fact never before revealed to human eyes the column sank but it ceased to sink at a height of thirty inches leaving the torricellian vacuum overhead from that hour the theory of the pump was established the celebrated pascal followed torricelli with another deduction he reasoned thus if the mercurial column be supported by the atmosphere the higher we ascend in the air the lower the column ought to sink for the less will be the weight of the air overhead he caused a friend to ascend the puy de dme carrying with him a barometric column and it was found that during the ascent the column sank and that during the subsequent descent the column rose between the time here referred to and the present millions of experiments have been made upon this subject every village pump is an apparatus for such experiments in thousands of instances moreover pumps have refused to work but on examination it has infallibly been found that the well was dry that the pump required priming or that some other defect in the apparatus accounted for the anomalous action in every case of the kind the skill of the pumpmaker has been found to be the true remedy in no case has the pressure of the atmosphere ceased constancy as regards the lifting of pumpwater has been hitherto the demonstrated rule of nature so also as regards pascals experiment his experience has been the universal experience ever since men have climbed mountains and gone up in balloons but no deviation from pascals result has ever been observed barometers like pumps have refused to act but instead of indicating any suspension of the operations of nature or any interference on the part of its author with atmospheric pressure examination has in every instance fixed the anomaly upon the instruments themselves it is this welding then of rigid logic to verifying fact that mr mozley refers to an unreasoning impulse let us now briefly consider the case of newton before his time men had occupied themselves with the problem of the solar system kepler had deduced from a vast mass of observations those general expressions of planetary motion known as keplers laws it had been observed that a magnet attracts iron and by one of those flashes of inspiration which reveal to the human mind the vast in the minute the general in the particular it had been inferred that the force by which bodies fall to the earth might also be an attraction newton pondered all these things he looked as was his wont into the darkness until it became entirely luminous how this light arises we cannot explain but as a matter of fact it does arise let me remark here that this kind of pondering is a process with which the ancients could have been but imperfectly acquainted they for the most part found the exercise of fantasy more pleasant than careful observation and subsequent brooding over facts hence it is that when those whose education has been derived from the ancients speak of the reason of man they are apt to omit from their conception of reason one of its most important factors well newton slowly marshalled his thoughts or rather they came to him while he intended his mind rising like a series of intellectual births out of chaos he made this idea of attraction his own but to apply the idea to the solar system it was necessary to know the magnitude of the attraction and the law of its variation with the distance his conceptions first of all passed from the action of the earth as a whole to that of its constituent particles and persistent thought brought more and more clearly out the final conclusion that every particle of matter attracts every other particle with a force varying inversely as the square of the distance between the particles here we have the flower and outcome of newtons induction and how to verify it or to disprove it was the next question the first step of the philosopher in this direction was to prove mathematically that if this law of attraction be the true one if the earth be constituted of particles which obey this law then the action of a sphere equal to the earth in size on a body outside of it is the same as that which would be exerted if the whole mass of the sphere were contracted to a point at its centre practically speaking then the centre of the earth is the point from which distances must be measured to bodies attracted by the earth from experiments executed before his time newton knew the amount of the earths attraction at the earths surface or at a distance of 4000 miles from its centre his object now was to measure the attraction at a greater distance and thus to determine the law of its diminution but how was he to find a body at a sufficient distance he had no balloon and even if he had he knew that any height to which he could attain would be too small to enable him to solve his problem what did he do he fixed his thoughts upon the moona body 240000 miles or sixty times the earths radius from the earths centre he virtually weighed the moon and found that weight to be 13600th of what it would be at the earths surface this is exactly what his theory required i will not dwell here upon the pause of newton after his first calculations or speak of his selfdenial in withholding them because they did not quite agree with the observations then at his command newtons action in this matter is the normal action of the scientific mind if it were otherwiseif scientific men were not accustomed to demand verificationif they were satisfied with the imperfect while the perfect is attainable their science instead of being as it is a fortress of adamant would be a house of clay illfitted to bear the buffetings of the theologic storms to which it is periodically exposed thus we see that newton like torricelli first pondered his facts illuminated them with persistent thought and finally divined the character of the force of gravitation but having thus travelled inward to the principle he reversed his steps carried the principle outwards and justified it by demonstrating its fitness to external nature and here in passing i would notice a point which is well worthy of attention kepler had deduced his laws from observation as far back as those observations extended the planetary motions had obeyed these laws and neither kepler nor newton entertained a doubt as to their continuing to obey them year after year as the ages rolled they believed that those laws would continue to illustrate themselves in the heavens but this was not sufficient the scientific mind can find no repose in the mere registration of sequence in nature the further question intrudes itself with resistless might whence comes the sequence what is it that binds the consequent to its antecedent in nature the truly scientific intellect never can attain rest until it reaches the forces by which the observed succession is produced it was thus with torricelli it was thus with newton it is thus preeminently with the scientific man of today in common with the most ignorant he shares the belief that spring will succeed winter that summer will succeed spring that autumn will succeed summer and that winter will succeed autumn but he knows still furtherand this knowledge is essential to his intellectual reposethat this succession besides being permanent is under the circumstances necessary that the gravitating force exerted between the sun and a revolving sphere with an axis inclined to the plane of its orbit must produce the observed succession of the seasons not until this relation between forces and phenomena has been established is the law of reason rendered concentric with the law of nature and not until this is effected does the mind of the scientific philosopher rest in peace the expectation of likeness then in the procession of phenomena is not that on which the scientific mind founds its belief in the order of nature if the force be permanent the phenomena are necessary whether they resemble or do not resemble anything that has gone before hence in judging of the order of nature our enquiries eventually relate to the permanence of force from galileo to newton from newton to our own time eager eyes have been scanning the heavens and clear heads have been pondering the phenomena of the solar system the same eyes and minds have been also observing experimenting and reflecting on the action of gravity at the surface of the earth nothing has occurred to indicate that the operation of the law has for a moment been suspended nothing has ever intimated that nature has been crossed by spontaneous action or that a state of things at any time existed which could not be rigorously deduced from the preceding state given the distribution of matter and the forces in operation in the time of galileo the competent mathematician of that day could predict what is now occurring in our own we calculate eclipses in advance and find our calculations true to the second we determine the dates of those that have occurred in the early times of history and find calculation and history in harmony anomalies and perturbations in the planets have been over and over again observed but these instead of demonstrating any inconstancy on the part of natural law have invariably been reduced to consequences of that law instead of referring the perturbations of uranus to any interference on the part of the author of nature with the law of gravitation the question which the astronomer proposed to himself was how in accordance with this law can the perturbation be produced guided by a principle he was enabled to fix the point of space in which if a mass of matter were placed the observed perturbations would follow we know the result the practical astronomer turned his telescope towards the region which the intellect of the theoretic astronomer had already explored and the planet now named neptune was found in its predicted place a very respectable outcome it will be admitted of an impulse which rests upon no rational grounds and can be traced to no rational principle which possesses no intellectual character which philosophy has uprooted from the ground of reason and fixed in that large irrational department discovered for it by mr mozley in the hitherto unexplored wilderness of the human mind the proper function of the inductive principle or the belief in the order of nature says mr mozley is to act as a practical basis for the affairs of life and the carrying on of human society but what it may be asked has the planet neptune or the belts of jupiter or the whiteness about the poles of mars to do with the affairs of society how is society affected by the fact that the suns atmosphere contains sodium or that the nebula of orion contains hydrogen gas nineteentwentieths of the force employed in the exercise of the inductive principle which reiterates mr mozley is purely practical have been expended upon subjects as unpractical as these what practical interest has society in the fact that the spots on the sun have a decennial period and that when a magnet is closely watched for half a century it is found to perform small motions which synchronise with the appearance and disappearance of the solar spots and yet i doubt not sir edward sabine would deem a life of intellectual toil amply rewarded by being privileged to solve at its close these infinitesimal motions the inductive principle is founded in mans desire to knowa desire arising from his position among phenomena which are reducible to order by his intellect the material universe is the complement of the intellect and without the study of its laws reason could never have awakened to the higher forms of selfconsciousness at all it is the nonego through and by which the ego is endowed with selfdiscernment we hold it to be an exercise of reason to explore the meaning of a universe to which we stand in this relation and the work we have accomplished is the proper commentary on the methods we have pursued before these methods were adopted the unbridled imagination roamed through nature putting in the place of law the figments of superstitious dread for thousands of years witchcraft and magic and miracles and special providences and mr mozleys distinctive reason of man had the world to themselves they made worse than nothing of itworse i say because they let and hindered those who might have made something of it hence it is that during a single lifetime of this era of unintelligent impulse the progress in knowledge is all but infinite as compared with that of the ages which preceded ours the believers in magic and miracles of a couple of centuries ago had all the strength of mr mozleys present logic on their side they had done for themselves what he rejoices in having so effectually done for uscleared the ground of the belief in the order of nature and declared magic miracles and witchcraft to be matters for ordinary evidence to decide the principle of miracles thus befriended had free scope and we know the result lacking that rockbarrier of natural knowledge which we now possess keen jurists and cultivated men were hurried on to deeds the bare recital of which makes the blood run cold skilled in all the rules of human evidence and versed in all the arts of crossexamination these men nevertheless went systematically astray and committed the deadliest wrongs against humanity and why because they could not put nature into the witnessbox and question herof her voiceless testimony they knew nothing in all cases between man and man their judgment was to be relied on but in all cases between man and nature they were blind leaders of the blind footnote in 1664 two women were hung in suffolk under a sentence of sir matthew hale who took the opportunity of declaring that the reality of witchcraft was unquestionable for first the scriptures had affirmed so much and secondly the wisdom of all nations had provided laws against such persons which is an argument of their confidence of such a crime sir thomas browne who was a great physician as well as a great writer was called as a witness and swore that he was clearly of opinion that the persons were bewitchedleckys history of rationalism vol i p 120 mr mozley concedes that it would be no great result if miracles were only accepted by the ignorant and superstitious because it is easy to satisfy those who do not enquire but he does consider it a great result that they have been accepted by the educated in what sense educated like those statesmen jurists and church dignitaries whose education was unable to save them from the frightful errors glanced at above not even in this sense for the great mass of mr mozleys educated people had no legal training and must have been absolutely defenceless against delusions which could set even that training at naught like ninetenths of our clergy at the present day they were versed in the literature of greece rome and judea but as regards a knowledge of nature which is here the one thing needful they were noble savages and nothing more in the case of miracles then it behoves us to understand the weight of the negative before we assign a value to the positive to comprehend the depositions of nature before we attempt to measure with them the evidence of men we have only to open our eyes to see what honest and even intellectual men and women are capable of as to judging evidence in this nineteenth century of the christian era and in latitude fiftytwo degrees north the experience thus gained ought i imagine to influence our opinion regarding the testimony of people inhabiting a sunnier clime with a richer imagination and without a particle of that restraint which the discoveries of physical science have imposed upon mankind having thus submitted mr mozleys views to the examination which they challenged at the hands of a student of nature i am unwilling to quit his book without expressing my admiration of his genius and my respect for his character though barely known to him personally his recent death affected me as that of a friend with regard to the style of his book i heartily subscribe to the description with which the times winds up its able and appreciative review it is marked throughout with the most serious and earnest conviction but is without a single word from first to last of asperity or insinuation against opponents and this not from any deficiency of feeling as to the importance of the issue but from a deliberate and resolutely maintained selfcontrol and from an overruling everpresent sense of the duty on themes like these of a more than judicial calmness to the argument regarding the quantity of the miraculous introduced at page 17 mr mozley has done me the honour of publishing a reply in the seventh volume of the contemporary reviewj t additional remarks on miracles among the scraps of manuscript written at the time when mr mozleys work occupied my attention i find the following reflections with regard to the influence of modern science which mr mozley rates so low one obvious effect of it is to enhance the magnitude of many of the recorded miracles and to increase proportionably the difficulties of belief the ancients knew but little of the vastness of the universe the rev mr kirkman for example has shown what inadequate notions the jews entertained regarding the firmament of heaven and sir george airy refers to the case of a greek philosopher who was persecuted for hazarding the assertion then deemed monstrous that the sun might be as large as the whole country of greece the concerns of a universe regarded from this point of view were much more commensurate with man and his concerns than those of the universe which science now reveals to us and hence that to suit mans purposes or that in compliance with his prayers changes should occur in the order of the universe was more easy of belief in the ancient world than it can be now in the very magnitude which it assigns to natural phenomena science has augmented the distance between them and man and increased the popular belief in their orderly progression as a natural consequence the demand for evidence is more exacting than it used to be whenever it is affirmed that the order of nature has been disturbed let us take as an illustration the miracle by which the victory of joshua over the amorites was rendered complete in this case the sun is reported to have stood still for about a whole day upon gibeon and the moon in the valley of ajalon an englishman of average education at the present day would naturally demand a greater amount of evidence to prove that this occurrence took place than would have satisfied an israelite in the age succeeding that of joshua for to the one the miracle probably consisted in the stoppage of a fiery ball less than a yard in diameter while to the other it would be the stoppage of an orb fourteen hundred thousand times the earth in size and even accepting the interpretation that joshua dealt with what was apparent merely but that what really occurred was the suspension of the earths rotation i think the right to exercise a greater reserve in accepting the miracle and to demand stronger evidence in support of it than that which would have satisfied an ancient israelite will still be conceded to a man of science there is a scientific as well as an historic imagination and when by the exercise of the former the stoppage of the earths rotation is clearly realised the event assumes proportions so vast in comparison with the result to be obtained by it that belief reels under the reflection the energy here involved is equal to that of six trillions of horses working for the whole of the time employed by joshua in the destruction of his foes the amount of power thus expended would be sufficient to supply every individual of an army a thousand times the strength of that of joshua with a thousand times the fighting power of each of joshuas soldiers not for the few hours necessary to the extinction of a handful of amorites but for millions of years all this wonder is silently passed over by the sacred historian manifestly because he knew nothing about it whether therefore we consider the miracle as purely evidential or as a practical means of vengeance the same lavish squandering of energy stares us in the face if evidential the energy was wasted because the israelites knew nothing of its amount if simply destructive then the ratio of the quantity lost to the quantity employed may be inferred from the foregoing figures to other miracles similar remarks apply transferring our thoughts from this little sandgrain of an earth to the immeasurable heavens where countless worlds with freights of life probably revolve unseen the very suns which warm them being barely visible across abysmal space reflecting that beyond these sparks of solar fire suns innumerable may burn whose light can never stir the optic nerve at all and bringing these reflections face to face with the idea of the builder and sustainer of it all showing himself in a burning bush exhibiting his hinder parts or behaving in other familiar ways ascribed to him in the jewish scriptures the incongruity must appear did this credulous prattle of the ancients about miracles stand alone were it not associated with words of imperishable wisdom and with examples of moral grandeur unmatched elsewhere in the history of the human race both the miracles and their evidences would have long since ceased to be the transmitted inheritance of intelligent men influenced by the thoughts which this universe inspires well may we exclaim in davids spirit if not in davids words when i consider the heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained what is man that thou shouldst be mindful of him or the son of man that thou shouldst so regard him if you ask me who is to limit the outgoings of almighty power my answer is not i if you should urge that if the builder and maker of this universe chose to stop the rotation of the earth or to take the form of a burning bush there is nothing to prevent him from doing so i am not prepared to contradict you i neither agree with you nor differ from you for it is a subject of which i know nothing but i observe that in such questions regarding almighty power your enquiries relate not to that power as it is actually displayed in the universe but to the power of your own imagination your question is not has the omnipotent done so and so or is it in the least degree likely that the omnipotent should do so and so but is my imagination competent to picture a being able and willing to do so and so i am not prepared to deny your competence to the human mind belongs the faculty of enlarging and diminishing of distorting and combining indefinitely the objects revealed by the senses it can imagine a mouse as large as an elephant an elephant as large as a mountain and a mountain as high as the stars it can separate congruities and unite incongruities we see a fish and we see a woman we can drop one half of each and unite in idea the other two halves to a mermaid we see a horse and we see a man we are able to drop one half of each and unite the other two halves to a centaur thus also the pictorial representations of the deity the bodies and wings of cherubs and seraphs the hoofs horns and tail of the evil one the joys of the blessed and the torments of the damned have been elaborated from materials furnished to the imagination by the senses it behoves you and me to take care that our notions of the power which rules the universe are not mere fanciful or ignorant enlargements of human power the capabilities of what you call your reason are not denied by the exercise of the faculty here adverted to you can picture to yourself a being able and willing to do any and every conceivable thing you are right in saying that in opposition to this power science is of no availthat it is a weapon of air the man of science however while accepting the figure would probably reverse its application thinking it is not science which is here the thing of air but that unsubstantial pageant of the imagination to which the solidity of science is opposed prayer as a means to effect a private end is theft and meannessemerson iii on prayer as a form of physical energy the editor of the contemporary review is liberal enough to grant me space for some remarks upon a subject which though my relation to it was simply that of a vehicle of transmission has brought down upon me a considerable amount of animadversion it may be interesting to some of my readers if i glance at a few cases illustrative of the history of the human mind in relation to this and kindred questions in the fourth century the belief in antipodes was deemed unscriptural and heretical the pious lactantius was as angry with the people who held this notion as my censors are now with me and quite as unsparing in his denunciations of their monstrosities lactantius was irritated because in his mind by education and habit cosmogony and religion were indissolubly associated and therefore simultaneously disturbed in the early part of the seventeenth century the notion that the earth was fixed and that the sun and stars revolved round it daily was interwoven with religious feeling the separation then attempted by galileo rousing the animosity and kindling the persecution of the church men still living can remember the indignation excited by the first revelations of geology regarding the age of the earth the association between chronology and religion being for the time indissoluble in our day however the bestinformed theologians are prepared to admit that our views of the universe and its author are not impaired but improved by the abandonment of the mosaic account of the creation look finally at the excitement caused by the publication of the origin of species and compare it with the calm attendant on the appearance of the far more outspoken and from the old point of view more impious descent of man thus religion survivesafter the removal of what had been long considered essential to it in our day the antipodes are accepted the fixity of the earth is given up the period of creation and the reputed age of the world are alike dissipated evolution is looked upon without terror and other changes have occurred in the same direction too numerous to be dwelt upon here in fact from the earliest times to the present religion has been undergoing a process of purification freeing itself slowly and painfully from the physical errors which the active but uninformed intellect mingled with the aspirations of the soul some of us think that a final act of purification is needed while others oppose this notion with the confidence and the warmth of ancient times the bone of contention at present is the physical value of prayer it is not my wish to excite surprise much less to draw forth protest by the employment of this phrase i would simply ask any intelligent person to look the problem honestly in the face and then to say whether in the estimation of the great body of those who sincerely resort to it prayer does not at all events upon special occasions invoke a power which checks and augments the descent of rain which changes the force and direction of winds which affects the growth of corn and the health of men and cattle a power in short which when appealed to under pressing circumstances produces the precise effects caused by physical energy in the ordinary course of things to any person who deals sincerely with the subject and refuses to blur his moral vision by intellectual subtleties this i think will appear a true statement of the case it is under this aspect alone that the scientific student so far as i represent him has any wish to meddle with prayer forced upon his attention as a form of physical energy or as the equivalent of such energy he claims the right of subjecting it to those methods of examination from which all our present knowledge of the physical universe is derived and if his researches lead him to a conclusion adverse to its claimsif his enquiries rivet him still closer to the philosophy implied in the words he maketh his sun to shine on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain upon the just and upon the unjusthe contends only for the displacement of prayer not for its extinction he simply says physical nature is not its legitimate domain this conclusion moreover must be based on pure physical evidence and not on any inherent unreasonableness in the act of prayer the theory that the system of nature is under the control of a being who changes phenomena in compliance with the prayers of men is in my opinion a perfectly legitimate one it may of course be rendered futile by being associated with conceptions which contradict it but such conceptions form no necessary part of the theory it is a matter of experience that an earthly father who is at the same time both wise and tender listens to the requests of his children and if they do not ask amiss takes pleasure in granting their requests we know also that this compliance extends to the alteration within certain limits of the current of events on earth with this suggestion offered by experience it is no departure from scientific method to place behind natural phenomena a universal father who in answer to the prayers of his children alters the currents of those phenomena thus far theology and science go hand in hand the conception of an aether for example trembling with the waves of light is suggested by the ordinary phenomena of wavemotion in water and in air and in like manner the conception of personal volition in nature is suggested by the ordinary action of man upon earth i therefore urge no impossibilities though i am constantly charged with doing so i do not even urge inconsistency but on the contrary frankly admit that the theologian has as good a right to place his conception at the root of phenomena as i have to place mine but without verification a theoretic conception is a mere figment of the intellect and i am sorry to find us parting company at this point the region of theory both in science and theology lies behind the world of the senses but the verification of theory occurs in the sensible world to check the theory we have simply to compare the deductions from it with the facts of observation if the deductions be in accordance with the facts we accept the theory if in opposition the theory is given up a single experiment is frequently devised by which the theory must stand or fall of this character was the determination of the velocity of light in liquids as a crucial test of the emission theory according to it light travelled faster in water than in air according to the undulatory theory it travelled faster in air than in water an experiment suggested by arago and executed by fizeau and foucault was conclusive against newtons theory but while science cheerfully submits to this ordeal it seems impossible to devise a mode of verification of their theories which does not rouse resentment in theological minds is it that while the pleasure of the scientific man culminates in the demonstrated harmony between theory and fact the highest pleasure of the religious man has been already tasted in the very act of praying prior to verification any further effort in this direction being a mere disturbance of his peace or is it that we have before us a residue of that mysticism of the middle ages so admirably described by whewellthat practice of referring things and events not to clear and distinct notions not to general rules capable of direct verification but to notions vague distant and vast which we cannot bring into contact with facts as when we connect natural events with moral and historic causes thus he continues the character of mysticism is that it refers particulars not to generalisations homogeneous and immediate but to such as are heterogeneous and remote to which we must add that the process of this reference is not a calm act of the intellect but is accompanied with a glow of enthusiastic feeling every feature here depicted and some more questionable ones have shown themselves of late most conspicuously i regret to say in the leaders of a weekly journal of considerable influence and one on many grounds entitled to the respect of thoughtful men in the correspondence however published by the same journal are to be found two or three letters well calculated to correct the temporary flightiness of the journal itself it is not my habit of mind to think otherwise than solemnly of the feeling which prompts prayer it is a power which i should like to see guided not extinguisheddevoted to practicable objects instead of wasted upon air in some form or other not yet evident it may as alleged be necessary to mans highest culture certain it is that while i rank many persons who resort to prayer low in the scale of beingnatural foolishness bigotry and intolerance being in their case intensified by the notion that they have access to the ear of godi regard others who employ it as forming part of the very cream of the earth the faith that adds to the folly and ferocity of the one is turned to enduring sweetness holiness abounding charity and selfsacrifice by the other religion in fact varies with the nature upon which it falls often unreasonable if not contemptible prayer in its purer forms hints at disciplines which few of us can neglect without moral loss but no good can come of giving it a delusive value by claiming for it a power in physical nature it may strengthen the heart to meet lifes losses and thus indirectly promote physical wellbeing as the digging of aesops orchard brought a treasure of fertility greater than the golden treasure sought such indirect issues we all admit but it would be simply dishonest to affirm that it is such issues that are always in view here for the present i must end i ask no space to reply to those railers who make such free use of the terms insolence outrage profanity and blasphemy they obviously lack the sobriety of mind necessary to give accuracy to their statements or to render their charges worthy of serious refutation iv vitality the origin growth and energies of living things are subjects which have always engaged the attention of thinking men to account for them it was usual to assume a special agent free to a great extent from the limitations observed among the powers of inorganic nature this agent was called vital force and under its influence plants and animals were supposed to collect their materials and to assume determinate forms within the last few years however our ideas of vital processes have undergone profound modifications and the interest and even disquietude which the change has excited are amply evidenced by the discussions and protests which are now common regarding the phenomena of vitality in tracing these phenomena through all their modifications the most advanced philosophers of the present day declare that they ultimately arrive at a single source of power from which all vital energy is derived and the disquieting circumstance is that this source is not the direct fiat of a supernatural agent but a reservoir of what if we do not accept the creed of zoroaster must be regarded as inorganic force in short it is considered as proved that all the energy which we derive from plants and animals is drawn from the sun a few years ago when the sun was affirmed to be the source of life nine out of ten of those who are alarmed by the form which this assertion has latterly assumed would have assented in a general way to its correctness their assent however was more poetic than scientific and they were by no means prepared to see a rigid mechanical signification attached to their words this however is the peculiarity of modern conclusions that there is no creative energy whatever in the vegetable or animal organism but that all the power which we obtain from the muscles of man and animals as much as that which we develop by the combustion of wood or coal has been produced at the suns expense the sun is so much the colder that we may have our fires he is also so much the colder that we may have our horseracing and alpine climbing it is for example certain that the sun has been chilled to an extent capable of being accurately expressed in numbers in order to furnish the power which lifted this year a certain number of tourists from the vale of chamouni to the summit of mont blanc to most minds however the energy of light and heat presents itself as a thing totally distinct from ordinary mechanical energy either of them can nevertheless be derived from the other wood can be raised by friction to the temperature of ignition while by properly striking a piece of iron a skilful blacksmith can cause it to glow thus by the rude agency of his hammer he generates light and heat this action if carried far enough would produce the light and heat of the sun in fact the suns light and heat have actually been referred to the fall of meteoric matter upon his surface and whether the sun is thus supported or not it is perfectly certain that he might be thus supported whether moreover the whilom molten condition of our planet was as supposed by eminent men due to the collision of cosmic masses or not it is perfectly certain that the molten condition might be thus brought about if then solar light and heat can be produced by the impact of dead matter and if from the light and heat thus produced we can derive the energies which we have been accustomed to call vital it indubitably follows that vital energy may have a proximately mechanical origin in what sense then is the sun to be regarded as the origin of the energy derivable from plants and animals let us try to give an intelligible answer to this question water may be raised from the sealevel to a high elevation and then permitted to descend in descending it may be made to assume various formsto fall in cascades to spurt in fountains to boil in eddies or to flow tranquilly along a uniform bed it may moreover be caused to set complex machinery in motion to turn millstones throw shuttles work saws and hammers and drive piles but every form of power here indicated would be derived from the original power expended in raising the water to the height from which it fell there is no energy generated by the machinery the work performed by the water in descending is merely the parcelling out and distribution of the work expended in raising it in precisely this sense is all the energy of plants and animals the parcelling out and distribution of a power originally exerted by the sun in the case of the water the source of the power consists in the forcible separation of a quantity of the liquid from a low level of the earths surface and its elevation to a higher position the power thus expended being returned by the water in its descent in the case of vital phenomena the source of power consists in the forcible separation of the atoms of compound substances by the sun we name the force which draws the water earthward gravity and that which draws atoms together chemical affinity but these different names must not mislead us regarding the qualitative identity of the two forces they are both attractions and to the intellect the falling of carbon atoms against oxygen atoms is not more difficult of conception than the falling of water to the earth the building up of the vegetable then is effected by the sun through the reduction of chemical compounds the phenomena of animal life are more or less complicated reversals of these processes of reduction we eat the vegetable and we breathe the oxygen of the air and in our bodies the oxygen which had been lifted from the carbon and hydrogen by the action of the sun again falls towards them producing animal heat and developing animal forms through the most complicated phenomena of vitality this law runs the vegetable is produced while a weight rises the animal is produced while a weight falls but the question is not exhausted here the water employed in our first illustration generates all the motion displayed in its descent but the form of the motion depends on the character of the machinery interposed in the path of the water in a similar way the primary action of the suns rays is qualified by the atoms and molecules among which their energy is distributed molecular forces determine the form which the solar energy will assume in the separation of the carbon and oxygen this energy may be so conditioned as to result in one case in the formation of a cabbage and in another case in the formation of an oak so also as regards the reunion of the carbon and the oxygen the molecular machinery through which the combining energy acts may in one case weave the texture of a frog while in another it may weave the texture of a man the matter of the animal body is that of inorganic nature there is no substance in the animal tissues which is not primarily derived from the rocks the water and the air are the forces of organic matter then different in kind from those of inorganic matter the philosophy of the present day negatives the question it is the compounding in the organic world of forces belonging equally to the inorganic that constitutes the mystery and the miracle of vitality every portion of every animal body may be reduced to purely inorganic matter a perfect reversal of this process of reduction would carry us from the inorganic to the organic and such a reversal is at least conceivable the tendency indeed of modern science is to break down the wall of partition between organic and inorganic and to reduce both to the operation of forces which are the same in kind but which are differently compounded consider the question of personal identity in relation to that of molecular form thirtyfour years ago mayer of heilbronn with that power of genius which breathes large meanings into scanty facts pointed out that the blood was 6 the oil of the lamp of life the combustion of which sustains muscular action the muscles are the machinery by which the dynamic power of the blood is brought into play thus the blood is consumed but the whole body though more slowly than the blood wastes also so that after a certain number of years it is entirely renewed how is the sense of personal identity maintained across this flight of molecules to man as we know him matter is necessary to consciousness but the matter of any period may be all changed while consciousness exhibits no solution of continuity like changing sentinels the oxygen hydrogen and carbon that depart seem to whisper their secret to their comrades that arrive and thus while the nonego shifts the ego remains the same constancy of form in the grouping of the molecules and not constancy of the molecules themselves is the correlative of this constancy of perception life is a wave which in no two consecutive moments of its existence is composed of the same particles supposing then the molecules of the human body instead of replacing others and thus renewing a preexisting form to be gathered first hand from nature and put together in the same relative positions as those which they occupy in the body supposing them to have the selfsame forces and distribution of forces the selfsame motions and distribution of motionswould this organised concourse of molecules stand before us as a sentient thinking being there seems no valid reason to believe that it would not or supposing a planet carved from the sun set spinning round an axis and revolving round the sun at a distance from him equal to that of our earth would one of the consequences of its refrigeration be the development of organic forms i lean to the affirmative structural forces are certainly in the mass whether or not those forces reach to the extent of forming a plant or an animal in an amorphous drop of water lie latent all the marvels of crystalline force and who will set limits to the possible play of molecules in a cooling planet if these statements startle it is because matter has been defined and maligned by philosophers and theologians who were equally unaware that it is at bottom essentially mystical and transcendental questions such as these derive their present interest in great part from their audacity which is sure in due time to disappear and the sooner the public dread is abolished with reference to such questions the better for the cause of truth as regards knowledge physical science is polar in one sense it knows or is destined to know everything in another sense it knows nothing science understands much of this intermediate phase of things that we call nature of which it is the product but science knows nothing of the origin or destiny of nature who or what made the sun and gave his rays their alleged power who or what made and bestowed upon the ultimate particles of matter their wondrous power of varied interaction science does not know the mystery though pushed back remains unaltered to many of us who feel that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in the present philosophy of science but who have been also taught by baffled efforts how vain is the attempt to grapple with the inscrutable the ultimate frame of mind is that of goethe who dares to name his name or belief in him proclaim veiled in mystery as he is the allenfolder gleams across the mind his light feels the lifted soul his

shoreless flood of action and lives through perpetual metamorphosescarlyle v matter and force footnote a lecture delivered to the working men of dundee september 5 1867 with additions it is the custom of the professors in the royal school of mines in london to give courses of evening lectures every year to working men the lectureroom holds 600 people and tickets to this amount are disposed of as quickly as they can be handed to those who apply for them so desirous are the working men of london to attend these lectures that the persons who fail to obtain tickets always bear a large proportion to those who succeed indeed if the lectureroom could hold 2000 instead of 600 i do not doubt that every one of its benches would be occupied on these occasions it is moreover worthy of remark that the lectures are but rarely of a character which could help the working man in his daily pursuits the information acquired is hardly ever of a nature which admits of being turned into money it is therefore a pure desire for knowledge as a thing good in itself and without regard to its practical application which animates the hearers of these lectures it is also my privilege to lecture to another audience in london composed in part of the aristocracy of rank while the audience just referred to is composed wholly of the aristocracy of labour as regards attention and courtesy to the lecturer neither of these audiences has anything to learn of the other neither can claim superiority over the other it would not perhaps be quite correct to take those persons who flock to the school of mines as average samples of their class they are probably picked menthe aristocracy of labour as i have just called them at all events their conduct demonstrates that the essential qualities of what we in england understand by a gentleman are confined to no class and they have often raised in my mind the wish that the gentlemen of all classes artisans as well as lords could by some process of selection be sifted from the general mass of the community and caused to know each other better when pressed some months ago by the council of the british association to give an evening lecture to the working men of dundee my experience of the working men of london naturally rose to my mind and though heavily weighted with other duties i could not bring myself to decline the request of the council hitherto the evening discourses of the association have been delivered before its members and associates alone but after the meeting at nottingham last year where the working men at their own request were addressed by our late president mr grove and by my excellent friend professor huxley the idea arose of incorporating with all subsequent meetings of the association an address to the working men of the town in which the meeting is held a resolution to that effect was sent to the committee of recommendations the committee supported the resolution the council of the association ratified the decision of the committee and here i am to carry out to the best of my ability their united wishes whether it be a consequence of longcontinued development or an endowment conferred once for all on man at his creation we find him here gifted with a mind curious to know the causes of things and surrounded by objects which excite its questionings and raise the desire for an explanation it is related of a young prince of one of the pacific islands that when he first saw himself in a lookingglass he ran round the glass to see who was standing at the back and thus it is with the general human intellect as regards the phenomena of the external world it wishes to get behind and learn the causes and connections of these phenomena what is the sun what is the earth what should we see if we came to the edge of the earth and looked over what is the meaning of thunder and lightning of hail rain storm and snow such questions presented themselves to early men and by and by it was discovered that this desire for knowledge was not implanted in vain after many trials it became evident that mans capacities were so to speak the complement of natures facts and that within certain limits the secret of the universe was open to the human understanding it was found that the mind of man had the power of penetrating far beyond the boundaries of his five senses that the things which are seen in the material world depend for their action upon things unseen in short that besides the phenomena which address the senses there are laws and principles and processes which do not address the senses at all but which must be and can be spiritually discerned to the subjects which require this discernment belong the phenomena of molecular force but to trace the genesis of the notions now entertained upon this subject we have to go a long way back in the drawing of a bow the darting of a javelin the throwing of a stonein the lifting of burdens and in personal combats even savage man became acquainted with the operation of force ages of discipline moreover taught him foresight he laid by at the proper season stores of food thus obtaining time to look about him and to become an observer and enquirer two things which he noticed must have profoundly stirred his curiosity he found that a kind of resin dropped from a certain tree possessed when rubbed the power of drawing light bodies to itself and of causing them to cling to it and he also found that a particular stone exerted a similar power over a particular kind of metal i allude of course to electrified amber and to the loadstone or natural magnet and its power to attract particles of iron previous experience of his own muscles had enabled our early enquirer to distinguish between a push and a pull augmented experience showed him that in the case of the magnet and the amber pulls and pushesattractions and repulsionswere also exerted and by a kind of poetic transfer be applied to things external to himself conceptions derived from himself the magnet and the rubbed amber were credited with pushing and pulling or in other words with exerting force in the time of the great lord bacon the margin of these pushes and pulls was vastly extended by dr gilbert a man probably of firmer scientific fibre and of finer insight than bacon himself gilbert proved that a multitude of other bodies when rubbed exerted the power which thousands of years previously had been observed in amber in this way the notion of attraction and repulsion in external nature was rendered familiar it was a matter of experience that bodies between which no visible link or connection existed possessed the power of acting upon each other and the action came to be technically called action at a distance but out of experience in science there grows something finer than mere experience experience furnishes the soil for plants of higher growth and this observation of action at a distance provided material for speculation upon the largest of problems bodies were observed to fall to the earth why should they do so the earth was proved to revolve round the sun and the moon to revolve round the earth why should they do so what prevents them from flying straight off into space supposing it were ascertained that from a part of the earths rocky crust a firmly fixed and tightly stretched chain started towards the sun we might be inclined to conclude that the earth is held in its orbit by the chainthat the sun twirls the earth around him as a boy twirls round his head a bullet at the end of a string but why should the chain be needed it is a fact of experience that bodies can attract each other at a distance without the intervention of any chain why should not the sun and earth so attract each other and why should not the fall of bodies from a height be the result of their attraction by the earth here then we reach one of those higher speculations which grow out of the fruitful soil of observation having started with the savage and his sensations of muscular force we pass on to the observation of force exerted between a magnet and rubbed amber and the bodies which they attract rising by an unbroken growth of ideas to a conception of the force by which sun and planets are held together this idea of attraction between sun and planets had become familiar in the time of newton he set himself to examine the attraction and here as elsewhere we find the speculative mind falling back for its materials upon experience it had been observed in the case of magnetic and electric bodies that the nearer they were brought together the stronger was the force exerted between them while by increasing the distance the force diminished until it became insensible hence the inference that the assumed pull between the earth and the sun would be influenced by their distance asunder guesses had been made as to the exact manner in which the force varied with the distance but newton supplemented the guess by the severe test of experiment and calculation comparing the pull of the earth upon a body close to its surface with its pull upon the moon 240000 miles away newton rigidly established the law of variation with the distance but on his way to this result newton found room for other conceptions some of which indeed constituted the necessary steppingstones to his result the one which here concerns us is that not only does the sun attract the earth and the earth attract the sun as wholes but every particle of the sun attracts every particle of the earth and the reverse his conclusion was that the attraction of the masses was simply the sum of the attractions of their constituent particles this result seems so obvious that you will perhaps wonder at my dwelling upon it but it really marks a turning point in our notions of force you have probably heard of certain philosophers of the ancient world named democritus epicurus and lucretius these men adopted developed and diffused the doctrine of atoms and molecules which found its consummation at the hands of the illustrious john dalton but the greek and roman philosophers i have named and their followers up to the time of newton pictured their atoms as falling and flying through space hitting each other and clinging together by imaginary hooks and claws they missed the central idea that atoms and molecules could come together not by being fortuitously knocked against each other but by their own mutual attractions this is one of the great steps taken by newton he familiarised the world with the conception of molecular force newton you know was preceded by a grand fellow named john keplera true working manwho by analysing the astronomical observations of his master tycho brahe had actually found that the planets moved as they are now known to move kepler knew as much about the motion of the planets as newton did in fact kepler taught newton and the world generally the facts of planetary motion but this was not enough the question arosewhy should the facts be so this was the great question for newton and it was the solution of it which renders his name and fame immortal starting from the principle that every particle of matter in the solar system attracts every other particle by a force which varies as the inverse square of the distance between the particles he proved that the planetary motions must be what observation makes them to be he showed that the moon fell towards the earth and that the planets fell towards the sun through the operation of the same force that pulls an apple from its tree this allpervading force which forms the solder of the material universe and the conception of which was necessary to newtons intellectual peace is called the force of gravitation gravitation is a purely attractive force but in electricity and magnetism repulsion had been always seen to accompany attraction electricity and magnetism are double or polar forces in the case of magnetism experience soon pushed the mind beyond the bounds of experience compelling it to conclude that the polarity of the magnet was resident in its molecules i hold a magnetised strip of steel by its centre and find that one half of the strip attracts and the other half repels the north end of a magnetic needle i break the strip in the middle find that this half which a moment ago attracted throughout its entire length the north pole of a magnetic needle is now divided into two new halves one of which wholly attracts and the other of which wholly repels the north pole of the needle the half proves to be as perfect a magnet as the whole you may break this half and go on till further breaking becomes impossible through the very smallness of the fragments the smallest fragment is found endowed with two poles and is therefore a perfect magnet but you cannot stop here you imagine where you cannot experiment and reach the conclusion entertained by all scientific men that the magnet which you see and feel is an assemblage of molecular magnets which you cannot see and feel but which as before stated must be intellectually discerned magnetism then is a polar force and experience hints that a force of this kind may exert a certain structural power it is known for example that iron filings strewn round a magnet arrange themselves in definite lines called by some magnetic curves and by others lines of magnetic force over two magnets now before me is spread a sheet of paper scattering iron filings over the paper polar force comes into play and every particle of the iron responds to that force we have a kind of architectural effortif i may use the termexerted on the part of the iron filings here then is a fact of experience which as you will see immediately furnishes further material for the mind to operate upon rendering it possible to attain intellectual clearness and repose while speculating upon apparently remote phenomena the magnetic force has here acted upon particles visible to the eye but as already stated there are numerous processes in nature which entirely elude the eye of the body and must be figured by the eye of the mind the processes of chemistry are examples of these long thinking and experimenting has led philosophers to conclude that matter is composed of atoms from which whether separate or in combination the whole material world is built up the air we breathe for example as mainly a mechanical mixture of the atoms of oxygen and nitrogen the water we drink is also composed of oxygen and hydrogen but it differs from the air in this particular that in water the oxygen and hydrogen are not mechanically mixed but chemically combined the atoms of oxygen and those of hydrogen exert enormous attractions on each other so that when brought into sufficient proximity they rush together with an almost incredible force to form a chemical compound but powerful as is the force with which these atoms lock themselves together we have the means of tearing them asunder and the agent by which we accomplish this may here receive a few moments attention into a vessel containing acidulated water i dip two strips of metal the one being zinc and the other platinum not permitting them to touch each other in the liquid i connect the two upper ends of the strips by a piece of copper wire the wire is now the channel of what for want of a better name we call an 6 electric current what the inner change of the wire is we do not know but we do know that a change has occurred by the external effects produced by the wire let me show you one or two of these effects before you is a series of ten vessels each with its pair of metals and i wish to get the added force of all ten the arrangement is called a voltaic battery i plunge a piece of copper wire among these iron filings they refuse to cling to it i employ the selfsame wire to connect the two ends of the battery and subject it to the same test the iron filings now crowd round the wire and cling to it i interrupt the current and the filings immediately fall the power of attraction continues only so long as the wire connects the two ends of the battery here is a piece of similar wire overspun with cotton to prevent the contact of its various parts and formed into a coil i make the coil part of the wire which connects the two ends of the voltaic battery by the attractive force with which it has become suddenly endowed it now empties this toolbox of its iron nails i twist a covered copper wire round this common poker connecting the wire with the two ends of the voltaic battery the poker is instantly transformed into a strong magnet two flat spirals are here suspended facing each other about six inches apart sending a current through both spirals they clash suddenly together reversing what is called the direction of the current in one of the spirals they fly asunder all these effects are due to the power which we name an electric current and which we figure as flowing through the wire when the voltaic circuit is complete by the same agent we tear asunder the locked atoms of a chemical compound into this small cell containing water dip two thin wires a magnified image of the cell is thrown upon the screen before you and you see plainly the images of the wires from a small battery i send an electric current from wire to wire bubbles of gas rise immediately from each of them and these are the two gases of which the water is composed the oxygen is always liberated on the one wire the hydrogen on the other the gases may be collected either separately or mixed i place upon my hand a soap bubble filled with the mixture of both gases applying a taper to the bubble a loud explosion is heard the atoms have rushed together with detonation and without injury to my hand and the water from which they were extracted is the result of their reunion one consequence of the rushing together of the atoms is the development of heat what is this heat here are two ivory balls suspended from the same point of support by two short strings i draw them thus apart and then liberate them they clash together but by virtue of their elasticity they quickly recoil and a sharp vibratory rattle succeeds their collision this experiment will enable you to figure to your mind a pair of clashing atoms we have in the first place a motion of the one atom towards the othera motion of translation as it is usually calledthen a recoil and afterwards a motion of vibration to this vibratory motion we give the name of heat thus three things are to be kept before the mindfirst the atoms themselves secondly the force with which they attract each other and thirdly the motion consequent upon the exertion of that force this motion must be figured first as a motion of translation and then as a motion of vibration to which latter we give the name of heat for some time after the act of combination this motion is so violent as to prevent the molecules from coming together the water being maintained in a state of vapour but as the vapour cools or in other words loses its motion the molecules coalesce to form a liquid and now we approach a new and wonderful display of force as long as the substance remains in a liquid or vaporous condition the play of this force is altogether masked and bidden but as the heat is gradually withdrawn the molecules prepare for new arrangements and combinations solid crystals of water are at length formed to which we give the familiar name of ice looking at these beautiful edifices and their internal structure the pondering mind has forced upon it the question how are they built up we have obtained clear conceptions of polar force and we infer from our broken magnet that polar force may be resident in the molecules or smallest particles of matter and that by the play of this force structural arrangement is possible what in relation to our present question is the natural action of a mind furnished with this knowledge it is compelled to transcend experience and endow the atoms and molecules of which crystals are built with definite poles whence issue attractions and repulsions in virtue of these forces some poles are drawn together while some retreat from each other atom is added to atom and molecule to molecule not boisterously or fortuitously but silently and symmetrically and in accordance with laws more rigid than those which guide a human builder when he places his materials together imagine the bricks and stones of this town of dundee endowed with structural power imagine them attracting and repelling and arranging themselves into streets and houses and kinnaird hallswould not that be wonderful hardly less wonderful is the play of force by which the molecules of water build themselves into the sheets of ice which every winter roof your ponds and lakes if i could show you the actual progress of this molecular architecture its beauty would delight and astonish you a reversal of the process of crystallisation may be actually shown the molecules of a piece of ice may be taken asunder before your eyes and from the manner in which they separate you may to some extent infer the manner in which they go together when a beam is sent from our electric lamp through a plate of glass a portion of the beam is intercepted and the glass is warmed by the portion thus retained within it when the beam is sent through a plate of ice a portion of the beam is also absorbed but instead of warming the ice the intercepted heat melts it internally it is to the delicate silent action of this beam within the ice that i now wish to direct your attention upon the screen is thrown a magnified image of the slab of ice the light of the beam passes freely through the ice without melting it and enables us to form the image but the heat is in great part intercepted and that heat now applies itself to the work of internal liquefaction selecting certain points for attack round about those points the beam works silently undoing the crystalline architecture and reducing to the freedom of liquidity molecules which had been previously locked in a solid embrace the liquefied spaces are rendered visible by strong illumination observe those sixpetaled flowers breaking out over the white surface and expanding in size as the action of the beam continues these flowers are liquefied ice under the action of the heat the molecules of the crystals fall asunder so as to leave behind them these exquisite forms we have here a process of demolition which clearly reveals the reverse process of construction in this fashion and in strict accordance with this hexangular type every ice molecule takes its place upon our ponds and lakes during the frosts of winter to use the language of an american poet the atoms march in tune moving to the music of law which thus renders the commonest substance in nature a miracle of beauty it is the function of science not as some think to divest this universe of its wonder and mystery but as in the case before us to point out the wonder and the mystery of common things those fernlike forms which on a frosty morning overspread your windowpanes illustrate the action of the same force breathe upon such a pane before the fires are lighted and reduce the solid crystalline film to the liquid condition then watch its subsequent resolidification you will see it all the better if you look at it through a common magnifying glass after you have ceased breathing the film abandoned to the action of its own forces appears for a moment to be alive lines of motion run through it molecule closes with molecule until finally the whole film passes from the state of liquidity through this state of motion to its final crystalline repose i can show you something similar over a piece of perfectly clean glass i pour a little water in which certain crystals have been dissolved a film of the solution clings to the glass by means of a microscope and a lamp an image of the plate of glass is thrown upon the screen the beam of the lamp besides illuminating the glass also heats it evaporation sets in and at a certain moment when the solution has become supersaturated splendid branches of crystal shoot out over the screen a dozen square feet of surface are now covered by those beautiful forms with another solution we obtain crystalline spears feathered right and left by other spears from distant nuclei in the middle of the field of view the spears shoot with magical rapidity in all directions the film of water on a windowpane on a frosty morning exhibits effects quite as wonderful as these latent in these formless solutions latent in every drop of water lies this marvellous structural power which only requires the withdrawal of opposing forces to bring it into action the clear liquid now held up before you is a solution of nitrate of silvera compound of silver and nitric acid when an electric current is sent through this liquid the silver is severed from the acid as the hydrogen was separated from the oxygen in a former experiment and i would ask you to observe how the metal behaves when its molecules are thus successively set free the image of the cell and of the two wires which dip into the liquid of the cell are now clearly shown upon the screen let us close the circuit and send the current through the liquid from one of the wires a beautiful silver tree commences immediately to sprout branches of the metal are thrown out and umbrageous foliage loads the branches you have here a growth apparently as wonderful as that of any vegetable perfected in a minute before your eyes substituting for the nitrate of silver acetate of lead which is a compound of lead and acetic acid the electric current severs the lead from the acid and you see the metal slowly branching into exquisite metallic ferns the fronds of which as they become too heavy break from their roots and fall to the bottom of the cell these experiments show that the common matter of our earthbrute matter as dr young in his night thoughts is pleased to call itwhen its atoms and molecules are permitted to bring their forces into free play arranges itself under the operation of these forces into forms which rival in beauty those of the vegetable world and what is the vegetable world itself but the result of the complex play of these molecular forces here as elsewhere throughout nature if matter moves it is force that moves it and if a certain structure vegetable or mineral is produced it is through the operation of the forces exerted between the atoms and molecules the solid matter of which our lead and silver trees were formed was in the first instance disguised in a transparent liquid the solid matter of which our woods and forests are composed is also for the most part disguised in a transparent gas which is mixed in small quantities with the air of our atmosphere this gas is formed by the union of carbon and oxygen and is called carbonic acid gas the carbonic acid of the air being subjected to an action somewhat analogous to that of the electric current in the case of our lead and silver solutions has its carbon liberated and deposited as woody fibre the watery vapour of the air is subjected to similar action its hydrogen is liberated from its oxygen and lies down side by side with the carbon in the tissues of the tree the oxygen in both cases is permitted to wander away into the atmosphere but what is it in nature that plays the part of the electric current in our experiments tearing asunder the locked atoms of carbon oxygen and hydrogen the rays of the sun the leaves of plants which absorb both the carbonic acid and the aqueous vapour of the air answer to the cells in which our decompositions took place and just as the molecular attractions of the silver and the lead found expression in those beautiful branching forms seen in our experiments so do the molecular attractions of the liberated carbon and hydrogen find expression in the architecture of grasses plants and trees in the fall of a cataract and the rush of the wind we have examples of mechanical power in the combinations of chemistry and in the formation of crystals and vegetables we have examples of molecular power you have learned how the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen rush together to form water i have not thought it necessary to dwell upon the mighty mechanical energy of their act of combination but it may be said in passing that the clashing together of 1 lb of hydrogen and 8 lbs of oxygen to form 9 lbs of aqueous vapour is greater than the shock of a weight of 1000 tons falling from a height of 20 feet against the earth now in order that the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen should rise by their mutual attractions to the velocity corresponding to this enormous mechanical effect a certain distance must exist between the particles it is in rushing over this that the velocity is attained this idea of distance between the attracting atoms is of the highest importance in our conception of the system of the world for the matter of the world may be classified under two distinct heads atoms and molecules which have already combined and thus satisfied their mutual attractions and atoms and molecules which have not yet combined and whose mutual attractions are therefore unsatisfied now as regards motive power we are entirely dependent on atoms and molecules of the latter kind their attractions can produce motion because sufficient distance intervenes between the attracting atoms and it is this atomic motion that we utilise in our machines thus we can get power out of oxygen and hydrogen by the act of their union but once they are combined and once the vibratory motion consequent on their combination has been expended no further power can be got out of their mutual attraction as dynamic agents they are dead the materials of the earths crust consist for the most part of substances whose atoms have already closed in chemical unionwhose mutual attractions are satisfied granite for instance is a widely diffused substance but granite consists in great part of silicon oxygen potassium calcium and aluminum whose atoms united long ago and are therefore dead limestone is composed of carbon oxygen and a metal called calcium the atoms of which have already closed in chemical union and are therefore finally at rest in this way we might go over nearly the whole of the materials of the earths crust and satisfy ourselves that though they were sources of power in ages past and long before any creature appeared on the earth capable of turning their power to account they are sources of power no longer and here we might halt for a moment to remark on that tendency so prevalent in the world to regard everything as made for human use those who entertain this notion hold i think an overweening opinion of their own importance in the system of nature flowers bloomed before men saw them and the quantity of power wasted before man could utilise it is all but infinite compared with what now remains we are truly heirs of all the ages but as honest men it behoves us to learn the extent of our inheritance and as brave ones not to whimper if it should prove less than we had supposed the healthy attitude of mind with reference to this subject is that of the poet who when asked whence came the rhodora joyfully acknowledged his brotherhood with the flower why thou wert there o rival of the rose i never thought to ask i never knew but in my simple ignorance supposed the selfsame power that brought me there brought you emerson a few exceptions to the general state of union of the molecules of the earths crustvast in relation to us but trivial in comparison to the total store of which they are the residuestill remain they constitute our main sources of motive power by far the most important of these are our beds of coal distance still intervenes between the atoms of carbon and those of atmospheric oxygen across which the atoms may be urged by their mutual attractions and we can utilise the motion thus produced once the carbon and the oxygen have rushed together so as to form carbonic acid their mutual attractions are satisfied and while they continue in this condition as dynamic agents they are dead our woods and forests are also sources of mechanical energy because they have the power of uniting with the atmospheric oxygen passing from plants to animals we find that the source of motive power just referred to is also the source of muscular power a horse can perform work and so can a man but this work is at bottom the molecular work of the transmuted food and the oxygen of the air we inhale this vital gas and bring it into sufficiently close proximity with the carbon and the hydrogen of the body these unite in obedience to their mutual attractions and their motion towards each other properly turned to account by the wonderful mechanism of the body becomes muscular motion one fundamental thought pervades all these statements there is one tap root from which they all spring this is the ancient maxim that out of nothing nothing comes that neither in the organic world nor in the inorganic is power produced without the expenditure of power that neither in the plant nor in the animal is there a creation of force or motion trees grow and so do men and horses and here we have new power incessantly introduced upon the earth but its source as i have already stated is the sun it is the sun that separates the carbon from the oxygen of the carbonic acid and thus enables them to recombine whether they recombine in the furnace of the steamengine or in the animal body the origin of the power they produce is the same in this sense we are all souls of fire and children of the sun but as remarked by helmholtz we must be content to share our celestial pedigree with the meanest of living things some estimable persons here present very possibly shrink from accepting these statements they may be frightened by their apparent tendency towards what is called materialisma word which to many minds expresses something very dreadful but it ought to be known and avowed that the physical philosopher as such must be a pure materialist his enquiries deal with matter and force and with them alone and whatever be the forms which matter and force assume whether in the organic world or the inorganic whether in the coalbeds and forests of the earth or in the brains and muscles of men the physical philosopher will make good his right to investigate them it is perfectly vain to attempt to stop enquiry in this direction depend upon it if a chemist by bringing the proper materials together in a retort or crucible could make a baby he would do it there is no law moral or physical forbidding him to do it at the present moment there are no doubt persons experimenting on the possibility of producing what we call life out of inorganic materials let them pursue their studies in peace it is only by such trials that they will learn the limits of their own powers and the operation of the laws of matter and force but while thus making the largest demand for freedom of investigationwhile i consider science to be alike powerful as an instrument of intellectual culture and as a ministrant to the material wants of men if you ask me whether it has solved or is likely in our day to solve the problem of this universe i must shake my head in doubt you remember the first napoleons question when the savants who accompanied him to egypt discussed in his presence the origin of the universe and solved it to their own apparent satisfaction he looked aloft to the starry heavens and said it is all very well gentlemen but who made these that question still remains unanswered and science makes no attempt to answer it as far as i can see there is no quality in the human intellect which is fit to be applied to the solution of the problem it entirely transcends us the mind of man may be compared to a musical instrument with a certain range of notes beyond which in both directions we have an infinitude of silence the phenomena of matter and force lie within our intellectual range and as far as they reach we will at all hazards push our enquiries but behind and above and around all the real mystery of this universe lies unsolved and as far as we are concerned is incapable of solution fashion this mystery as you will with that i have nothing to do but let your conception of it not be an unworthy one invest that conception with your highest and holiest thought but be careful of pretending to know more about it than is given to man to know be careful above all things of professing to see in the phenomena of the material world the evidences of divine pleasure or displeasure doubt those who would deduce from the fall of the tower of siloam the anger of the lord against those who were crushed doubt equally those who pretend to see in cholera cattleplague and bad harvests evidences of divine anger doubt those spiritual guides who in scotland have lately propounded the monstrous theory that the depreciation of railway scrip is a consequence of railway travelling on sundays let them not as far as you are concerned libel the system of nature with their ignorant hypotheses looking from the solitudes of thought into this highest of questions and seeing the puerile attempts often made to solve it well might the mightiest of living scotchmenthat strong and earnest soul who has made every soul of like nature in these islands his debtorwell i say might your noble old carlyle scornfully retort on such interpreters of the ways of god to men the builder of this universe was wise he formed all souls all systems planets particles the plan he formed his worlds and aeons by washeavenswas thy small nineandthirty articles here indeed we arrive at the barrier which needs to be perpetually pointed out alike to those who seek materialistic explanations of mental phenomena and to those who are alarmed lest such explanations may be found the last class prove by their fear almost as much as the first prove by their hope that they believe mind may possibly be interpreted in terms of matter whereas many whom they vituperate as materialists are profoundly convinced that there is not the remotest possibility of so interpreting them herbert spencer vi scientific materialism footnote presidents address to the mathematical and physical section of the british association at norwich 1868 the celebrated fichte in his lectures on the vocation of the scholar insisted on a culture which should be not onesided but allsided the scholars intellect was to expand spherically and not in a single direction only in one direction however fichte required that the scholar should apply himself directly to nature become a creator of knowledge and thus repay by original labours of his own the immense debt he owed to the labours of others it was these which enabled him to supplement the knowledge derived from his own researches so as to render his culture rounded and not onesided as regards science fichtes idea is to some extent illustrated by the constitution and labours of the british association we have here a body of men engaged in the pursuit of natural knowledge but variously engaged while sympathising with each of its departments and supplementing his culture by knowledge drawn from all of them each student amongst us selects one subject for the exercise of his own original facultyone line along which he may carry the light of his private intelligence a little way into the darkness by which all knowledge is surrounded thus the geologist deals with the rocks the biologist with the conditions and phenomena of life the astronomer with stellar masses and motions the mathematician with the relations of space and number the chemist pursues his atoms while the physical investigator has his own large field in optical thermal electrical acoustical and other phenomena the british association then as a whole faces physical nature on all sides and pushes knowledge centrifugally outwards the sum of its labours constituting what fichte might call the sphere of natural knowledge in the meetings of the association it is found necessary to resolve this sphere into its component parts which take concrete form under the respective letters of our sections mathematics and physics have been long accustomed to coalesce and here they form a single section no matter how subtle a natural phenomenon may be whether we observe it in the region of sense or follow it into that of imagination it is in the long run reducible to mechanical laws but the mechanical data once guessed or given mathematics are allpowerful as an instrument of deduction the command of geometry over the relations of space and the farreaching power which analysis confers are potent both as means of physical discovery and of reaping the entire fruits of discovery indeed without mathematics expressed or implied our knowledge of physical science would be both friable and incomplete side by side with the mathematical method we have the method of experiment here from a startingpoint furnished by his own researches or those of others the investigator proceeds by combining intuition and verication he ponders the knowledge he possesses and tries to push it further he guesses and checks his guess he conjectures and confirms or explodes his conjecture these guesses and conjectures are by no means leaps in the dark for knowledge once gained casts a faint light beyond its own immediate boundaries there is no discovery so limited as not to illuminate something beyond itself the force of intellectual penetration into this penumbral region which surrounds actual knowledge is not as some seem to think dependent upon method but upon the genius of the investigator there is however no genius so gifted as not to need control and verification the profoundest minds know best that natures ways are not at all times their ways and that the brightest flashes in the world of thought are incomplete until they have been proved to have their counterparts in the world of fact thus the vocation of the true experimentalist may be defined as the continued exercise of spiritual insight and its incessant correction and realisation his experiments constitute a body of which his purified intuitions are as it were the soul partly through mathematical and partly through experimental research physical science has of late years assumed a momentous position in the world both in a material and in an intellectual point of view it has produced and it is destined to produce immense changesvast social ameliorations and vast alterations in the popular conception of the origin rule and governance of natural things by science in the physical world miracles are wrought while philosophy is forsaking its ancient metaphysical channels and pursuing others which have been opened or indicated by scientific research this must become more and more the case as philosophical writers become more deeply imbued with the methods of science better acquainted with the facts which scientific men have established and with the great theories which they have elaborated if you look at the face of a watch you see the hour and minutehands and possibly also a secondhand moving over the graduated dial why do these hands move and why are their relative motions such as they are observed to be these questions cannot be answered without opening the watch mastering its various parts and ascertaining their relationship to each other when this is done we find that the observed motion of the hands follows of necessity from the inner mechanism of the watch when acted upon by the force invested in the spring the motion of the hands may be called a phenomenon of art but the case is similar with the phenomena of nature these also have their inner mechanism and their store of force to set that mechanism going the ultimate problem of physical science is to reveal this mechanism to discern this store and to show that from the combined action of both the phenomena of which they constitute the basis must of necessity flow i thought an attempt to give you even a brief and sketchy illustration of the manner in which scientific thinkers regard this problem would not be uninteresting to you on the present occasion more especially as it will give me occasion to say a word or two on the tendencies and limits of modern science to point out the region which men of science claim as their own and where it is futile to oppose their advance and also to define if possible the bourne between this and that other region to which the questionings and yearnings of the scientific intellect are directed in vain but here your tolerance will be needed it was the american emerson i think who said that it is hardly possible to state any truth strongly without apparent injustice to some other truth truth is often of a dual character taking the form of a magnet with two poles and many of the differences which agitate the thinking part of mankind are to be traced to the exclusiveness with which partisan reasoners dwell upon one half of the duality in forgetfulness of the other the proper course appears to be to state both halves strongly and allow each its fair share in the formation of the resultant conviction but this waiting for the statement of the two sides of a question implies patience it implies a resolution to suppress indignation if the statement of the one half should clash with our convictions and to repress equally undue elation if the halfstatement should happen to chime in with our views it implies a determination to wait calmly for the statement of the whole before we pronounce judgment in the form of either acquiescence or dissent this premised and i trust accepted let us enter upon our task there have been writers who affirmed that the pyramids of egypt were natural productions and in his early youth alexander von humboldt wrote a learned essay with the express object of refuting this notion we now regard the pyramids as the work of mens hands aided probably by machinery of which no record remains we picture to ourselves the swarming workers toiling at those vast erections lifting the inert stones and guided by the volition the skill and possibly at times by the whip of the architect placing them in their proper positions the blocks in this case were moved and posited by a power external to themselves and the final form of the pyramid expressed the thought of its human builder let us pass from this illustration of constructive power to another of a different kind when a solution of common salt is slowly evaporated the water which holds the salt in solution disappears but the salt itself remains behind at a certain stage of concentration the salt can no longer retain the liquid form its particles or molecules as they are called begin to deposit themselves as minute solidsso minute indeed as to defy all microscopic power as evaporation continues solidification goes on and we finally obtain through the clustering together of innumerable molecules a finite crystalline mass of a definite form what is this form it sometimes seems a mimicry of the architecture of egypt we have little pyramids built by the salt terrace above terrace from base to apex forming a series of steps resembling those up which the traveller in egypt is dragged by his guides the human mind is as little disposed to look without questioning at these pyramidal saltcrystals as to look at the pyramids of egypt without enquiring whence they came how then are those saltpyramids built up guided by analogy you may if you like suppose that swarming among the constituent molecules of the salt there is an invisible population controlled and coerced by some invisible master placing the atomic blocks in their positions this however is not the scientific idea nor do i think your good sense will accept it as a likely one the scientific idea is that the molecules act upon each other without the intervention of slave labour that they attract each other and repel each other at certain definite points or poles and in certain definite directions and that the pyramidal form is the result of this play of attraction and repulsion while then the blocks of egypt were laid down by a power external to themselves these molecular blocks of salt are selfposited being fixed in their places by the inherent forces with which they act upon each other i take common salt as an illustration because it is so familiar to us all but any other crystalline substance would answer my purpose equally well everywhere in fact throughout inorganic nature we have this formative power as fichte would call itthis structural energy ready to come into play and build the ultimate particles of matter into definite shapes the ice of our winters and of our polar regions is its handiwork and so also are the quartz felspar and mica of our rocks our chalkbeds are for the most part composed of minute shells which are also the product of structural energy but behind the shell as a whole lies a more remote and subtle formative act these shells are built up of little crystals of talcspar and to form these crystals the structural force had to deal with the intangible molecules of carbonate of lime this tendency on the part of matter to organise itself to grow into shape to assume definite forms in obedience to the definite action of force is as i have said allpervading it is in the ground on which you tread in the water you drink in the air you breathe incipient life as it were manifests itself throughout the whole of what we call inorganic nature the forms of the minerals resulting from this play of polar forces are various and exhibit different degrees of complexity men of science avail themselves of all possible means of exploring their molecular architecture for this purpose they employ in turn as agents of exploration light heat magnetism electricity and sound polarised light is especially useful and powerful here a beam of such light when sent in among the molecules of a crystal is acted on by them and from this action we infer with more or less clearness the manner in which the molecules are arranged that differences for example exist between the inner structure of rocksalt and that of crystallised sugar or sugarcandy is thus strikingly revealed these actions often display themselves in chromatic phenomena of great splendour the play of molecular force being so regulated as to cause the removal of some of the coloured constituents of white light while others are left with increased intensity behind and now let us pass from what we are accustomed to regard as a dead mineral to a living grain of corn when this is examined by polarised light chromatic phenomena similar to those noticed in crystals are observed and why because the architecture of the grain resembles that of the crystal in the grain also the molecules are set in definite positions and in accordance with their arrangement they act upon the light but what has built together the molecules of the corn regarding crystalline architecture i have already said that you may if you please consider the atoms and molecules to be placed in position by a power external to themselves the same hypothesis is open to you now but if in the case of crystals you have rejected this notion of an external architect i think you are bound to reject it in the case of the grain and to conclude that the molecules of the corn also are posited by the forces with which they act upon each other it would be poor philosophy to invoke an external agent in the one case and to reject it in the other instead of cutting our grain of corn into slices and subjecting it to the action of polarised light let us place it in the earth and subject it to a certain degree of warmth in other words let the molecules both of the corn and of the surrounding earth be kept in that state of agitation which we call heat under these circumstances the grain and the substances which surround it interact and a definite molecular architecture is the result a bud is formed this bud reaches the surface where it is exposed to the suns rays which are also to be regarded as a kind of vibratory motion and as the motion of common heat with which the grain and the substances surrounding it were first endowed enabled the grain and these substances to exercise their mutual attractions and repulsions and thus to coalesce in definite forms so the specific motion of the suns rays now enables the green bud to feed upon the carbonic acid and the aqueous vapour of the air the bud appropriates those constituents of both for which it has an elective attraction and permits the other constituent to return to the atmosphere thus the architecture is carried on forces are active at the root forces are active in the blade the matter of the air and the matter of the atmosphere are drawn upon and the plant augments in size we have in succession the stalk the ear the full corn in the ear the cycle of molecular action being completed by the production of grains similar to that with which the process began now there is nothing in this process which necessarily eludes the conceptive or imagining power of the human mind an intellect the same in kind as our own would if only sufficiently expanded be able to follow the whole process from beginning to end it would see every molecule placed in its position by the specific attractions and repulsions exerted between it and other molecules the whole process and its consummation being an instance of the play of molecular force given the grain and its environment with their respective forces the purely human intellect might if sufficiently expanded trace out priori every step of the process of growth and by the application of purely mechanical principles demonstrate that the cycle must end as it is seen to end in the reproduction of forms like that with which it began a necessity rules here similar to that which rules the planets in their circuits round the sun you will notice that i am stating the truth strongly as at the beginning we agreed it should be stated but i must go still further and affirm that in the eye of science the animal body is just as much the product of molecular force as the chalk and the ear of corn or as the crystal of salt or sugar many of the parts of the body are obviously mechanical take the human heart for example with its system of valves or take the exquisite mechanism of the eye or hand animal heat moreover is the same in kind as the heat of a fire being produced by the same chemical process animal motion too is as certainly derived from the food of the animal as the motion of trevethycks walkingengine from the fuel in its furnace as regards matter the animal body creates nothing as regards force it creates nothing which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature all that has been said then regarding the plant may be restated with regard to the animal every particle that enters into the composition of a nerve a muscle or a bone has been placed in its position by molecular force and unless the existence of law in these matters be denied and the element of caprice introduced we must conclude that given the relation of any molecule of the body to its environment its position in the body might be determined mathematically our difficulty is not with the quality of the problem but with its complexity and this difficulty might be met by the simple expansion of the faculties we now possess given this expansion with the necessary molecular data and the chick might be deduced as rigorously and as logically from the egg as the existence of neptune from the disturbances of uranus or as conical refraction from the undulatory theory of light you see i am not mincing matters but avowing nakedly what many scientific thinkers more or less distinctly believe the formation of a crystal a plant or an animal is in their eyes a purely mechanical problem which differs from the problems of ordinary mechanics in the smallness of the masses and the complexity of the processes involved here you have one half of our dual truth let us now glance at the other half associated with this wonderful mechanism of the animal body we have phenomena no less certain than those of physics but between which and the mechanism we discern no necessary connection a man for example can say i feel i think i love but how does consciousness infuse itself into the problem the human brain is said to be the organ of thought and feeling when we are hurt the brain feels it when we ponder or when our passions or affections are excited it is through the instrumentality of the brain let us endeavour to be a little more precise here i hardly imagine there exists a profound scientific thinker who has reflected upon the subject unwilling to admit the extreme probability of the hypothesis that for every fact of consciousness whether in the domain of sense thought or emotion a definite molecular condition of motion or structure is set up in the brain or who would be disposed even to deny that if the motion or structure be induced by internal causes instead of external the effect on consciousness will be the same let any nerve for example be thrown by morbid action into the precise state of motion which would be communicated to it by the pulses of a heated body surely that nerve will declare itself hotthe mind will accept the subjective intimation exactly as if it were objective the retina may be excited by purely mechanical means a blow on the eye causes a luminous flash and the mere pressure of the finger on the external ball produces a star of light which newton compared to the circles on a peacocks tail disease makes people see visions and dream dreams but in all such cases could we examine the organs implicated we should on philosophical grounds expect to find them in that precise molecular condition which the real objects if present would superinduce the relation of physics to consciousness being thus invariable it follows that given the state of the brain the corresponding thought or feeling might be inferred or given the thought or feeling the corresponding state of the brain might be inferred but how inferred it would be at bottom not a case of logical inference at all but of empirical association you may reply that many of the inferences of science are of this characterthe inference for example that an electric current of a given direction will deflect a magnetic needle in a definite way but the cases differ in this that the passage from the current to the needle if not demonstrable is conceivable and that we entertain no doubt as to the final mechanical solution of the problem but the passage from the physics of the brain to the corresponding facts of consciousness is inconceivable as a result of mechanics granted that a definite thought and a definite molecular action in the brain occur simultaneously we do not possess the intellectual organ nor apparently any rudiment of the organ which would enable us to pass by a process of reasoning from the one to the other they appear together but we do not know why were our minds and senses so expanded strengthened and illuminated as to enable us to see and feel the very molecules of the brain were we capable of following all their motions all their groupings all their electric discharges if such there be and were we intimately acquainted with the corresponding states of thought and feeling we should be as far as ever from the solution of the problem how are these physical processes connected with the facts of consciousness the chasm between the two classes of phenomena would still remain intellectually impassable let the consciousness of love for example be associated with a righthanded spiral motion of the molecules of the brain and the consciousness of hate with a lefthanded spiral motion we should then know when we love that the motion is in one direction and when we hate that the motion is in the other but the why would remain as unanswerable as before in affirming that the growth of the body is mechanical and that thought as exercised by us has its correlative in the physics of the brain i think the position of the materialist is stated as far as that position is a tenable one i think the materialist will be able finally to maintain this position against all attacks but i do not think in the present condition of the human mind that he can pass beyond this position i do not think he is entitled to say that his molecular groupings and motions explain everything in reality they explain nothing the utmost he can affirm is the association of two classes of phenomena of whose real bond of union he is in absolute ignorance the problem of the connection of body and soul is as insoluble in its modern form as it was in the prescientific ages phosphorus is known to enter into the composition of the human brain and a trenchant german writer has exclaimed ohne phosphor kein gedanke that may or may not be the case but even if we knew it to be the case the knowledge would not lighten our darkness on both sides of the zone here assigned to the materialist he is equally helpless if you ask him whence is this matter of which we have been discoursingwho or what divided it into molecules who or what impressed upon them this necessity of running into organic formshe has no answer science is mute in reply to these questions but if the materialist is confounded and science rendered dumb who else is prepared with a solution to whom has this arm of the lord been revealed let us lower our heads and acknowledge our ignorance priest and philosopher one and all perhaps the mystery may resolve itself into knowledge at some future day the process of things upon this earth has been one of amelioration it is a long way from the iguanodon and his contemporaries to the president and members of the british association and whether we regard the improvement from the scientific or from the theological point of viewas the result of progressive development or of successive exhibitions of creative energyneither view entitles us to assume that mans present faculties end the series that the process of amelioration ends with him a time may therefore come when this ultrascientific region by which we are now enfolded may offer itself to terrestrial if not to human investigation twothirds of the rays emitted by the sun fail to arouse the sense of vision the rays exist but the visual organ requisite for their translation into light does not exist and so from this region of darkness and mystery which surrounds us rays may now be darting which require but the development of the proper intellectual organs to translate them into knowledge as far surpassing ours as ours surpasses that of the wallowing reptiles which once held possession of this planet meanwhile the mystery is not without its uses it certainly may made a power in the human soul but it is a power which has feeling not knowledge for its base it may be will be and i hope is turned to account both in steadying and strengthening intellect and in rescuing man from that littleness to which in the struggle for existence or for precedence in the world he is continually prone musings on the matterhorn july 27 1868 hacked and hurt by time the aspect of the mountain from its higher crags saddened me hitherto the impression it made was that of savage strength here we had inexorable decay but this notion of decay implied a reference to a period when the matterhorn was in the full strength of mountainhood thought naturally ran back to its remoter origin and sculpture nor did thought halt there but wandered on through molten worlds to that nebulous haze which philosophers have regarded and with good reason as the proximate source of all material things i tried to look at this universal cloud containing within itself the prediction of all that has since occurred i tried to imagine it as the seat of those forces whose action was to issue in solar and stellar systems and all that they involve did that formless fog contain potentially the sadness with which i regarded the matterhorn did the thought which now ran back to it simply return to its primeval home if so had we not better recast our definitions of matter and force for if life and thought be the very flower of both any definition which omits life and thought must be inadequate if not untrue are questions like these warranted why not if the final goal of man has not been yet attained if his development has not been yet arrested who can say that such yearnings and questionings are not necessary to the opening of a finer vision to the budding and the growth of diviner powers when i look at the heavens and the earth at my own body at my strength and weakness even at these ponderings and ask myself is there no being or thing in the universe that knows more about these matters than i do what is my answer supposing our theologic schemes of creation condemnation and redemption to be dissipated and the warmth of denial which they excite and which as a motive force can match the warmth of affirmation dissipated at the same time would the undeflected human mind return to the meridian of absolute neutrality as regards these ultraphysical questions is such a position one of stable equilibrium the channels of thought being already formed such are the questions without replies which could run athwart consciousness during a ten minutes halt upon the

london session 196869 there is an idea regarding the nature of man which modern philosophy has sought and is still seeking to raise into clearness the idea namely of secular growth man is not a thing of yesterday nor do i imagine that the slightest controversial tinge is imported into this address when i say that he is not a thing of 6000 years ago whether he came originally from stocks or stones from nebulous gas or solar fire i know not if he had any such origin the process of his transformation is as inscrutable to you and me as that of the grand old legend according to which the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul but however obscure mans origin may be his growth is not to be denied here a little and there a little added through the ages have slowly transformed him from what he was into what he is the doctrine has been held that the mind of the child is like a sheet of white paper on which by education we can write what characters we please this doctrine assuredly needs qualification and correction in physics when an external force is applied to a body with a view of affecting its inner texture if we wish to predict the result we must know whether the external force conspires with or opposes the internal forces of the body itself and in bringing the influence of education to bear upon the newborn man his inner powers also must be taken into account he comes to us as a bundle of inherited capacities and tendencies labelled from the indefinite past to the indefinite future and he makes his transit from the one to the other through the education of the present time the object of that education is or ought to be to provide wise exercise for his capacities wise direction for his tendencies and through this exercise and this direction to furnish his mind with such knowledge as may contribute to the usefulness the beauty and the nobleness of his life how is this discipline to be secured this knowledge imparted two rival methods now solicit attentionthe one organised and equipped the labour of centuries having been expended in bringing it to its present state of perfection the other more or less chaotic but becoming daily less so and giving signs of enormous power both as a source of knowledge and as a means of discipline these two methods are the classical and the scientific method i wish they were not rivals it is only bigotry and shortsightedness that make them so for assuredly it is possible to give both of them fair play though hardly authorised to express an opinion upon the subject i nevertheless hold the opinion that the proper study of a language is an intellectual discipline of the highest kind if i except discussions on the comparative merits of popery and protestantism english grammar was the most important discipline of my boyhood the piercing through the involved and inverted sentences of paradise lost the linking of the verb to its often distant nominative of the relative to its distant antecedent of the agent to the object of the transitive verb of the preposition to the noun or pronoun which it governed the study of variations in mood and tense the transpositions often necessary to bring out the true grammatical structure of a sentenceall this was to my young mind a discipline of the highest value and a source of unflagging delight how i rejoiced when i found a great author tripping and was fairly able to pin him to a corner from which there was no escape as i speak some of the sentences which exercised me when a boy rise to my recollection for instance he that hath ears to hear let him hear where the he is left as it were floating in mid air without any verb to support it i speak thus of english because it was of real value to me i do not speak of other languages because their educational value for me was almost insensible but knowing the value of english so well i should be the last to deny or even to doubt the high discipline involved in the proper study of latin and greek that study moreover has other merits and recommendations it is as i have said organised and systematised by longcontinued use it is an instrument wielded by some of our best intellects in the education of youth and it can point to results in the achievements of our foremost men what then has science to offer which is in the least degree likely to compete with such a system i cannot better reply than by recurring to the grand old story from which i have already quoted speaking of the world and all that therein is of the sky and the stars around it the ancient writer says and god saw all that he had made and behold it was very good it is the body of things thus described which science offers to the study of man there is a very renowned argument much prized and much quoted by theologians in which the universe is compared to a watch let us deal practically with this comparison supposing a watchmaker having completed his instrument to be so satisfied with his work as to call it very good what would you understand him to mean you would not suppose that he referred to the dialplate in front and the chasing of the case behind so much as to the wheels and pinions the springs and jewelled pivots of the works withinto those qualities and powers in short which enable the watch to perform its work as a keeper of time with regard to the knowledge of such a watch he would be a mere ignoramus who would content himself with outward inspection i do not wish to say one severe word here today but i fear that many of those who are very loud in their praise of the works of the lord know them only in this outside and superficial way it is the inner works of the universe which science reverently uncovers it is the study of these that she recommends as a discipline worthy of all acceptation the ultimate problem of physics is to reduce matter by analysis to its lowest condition of divisibility and force to its simplest manifestations and then by synthesis to construct from these elements the world as it stands we are still a long way from the final solution of this problem and when the solution comes it will be more one of spiritual insight than of actual observation but though we are still a long way from this complete intellectual mastery of nature we have conquered vast regions of it have learned their polities and the play of their powers we live upon a ball of 8000 miles in diameter swathed by an atmosphere of unknown height this ball has been molten by heat chilled to a solid and sculptured by water it is made up of substances possessing distinctive properties and modes of action which offer problems to the intellect some profitable to the child others taxing the highest powers of the philosopher our native sphere turns on its axis and revolves in space it is one of a band which all do the same it is illuminated by a sun which though nearly a hundred millions of miles distant can be brought virtually into our closets and there subjected to examination it has its winds and clouds its rain and frost its light heat sound electricity and magnetism and it has its vast kingdoms of animals and vegetables to a most amazing extent the human mind has conquered these things and revealed the logic which runs through them were they facts only without logical relationship science might as a means of discipline suffer in comparison with language but the whole body of phenomena is instinct with law the facts are hung on principles and the value of physical science as a means of discipline consists in the motion of the intellect both inductively and deductively along the lines of law marked out by phenomena as regards the discipline to which i have already referred as derivable from the study of languagesthat and more is involved in the study of physical science indeed i believe it would be possible so to limit and arrange the study of a portion of physics as to render the mental exercise involved in it almost qualitatively the same as that involved in the unravelling of a language i have thus far confined myself to the purely intellectual side of this question but man is not all intellect if he were so science would i believe be his proper nutriment but he feels as well as thinks he is receptive of the sublime and beautiful as well as of the true indeed i believe that even the intellectual action of a complete man is consciously or unconsciously sustained by an undercurrent of the emotions it is vain to attempt to separate the moral and emotional from the intellectual let a man but observe himself and he will if i mistake not find that in nine cases out of ten the emotions constitute the motive force which pushes his intellect into action the reading of the works of two men neither of them imbued with the spirit of modern scienceneither of them indeed friendly to that spirithas placed me here today these men are the english carlyle and the american emerson i must ever gratefully remember that through three long cold german winters carlyle placed me in my tub even when ice was on its surface at five oclock every morningnot slavishly but cheerfully meeting each days studies with a resolute will determined whether victor or vanquished not to shrink from difficulty i never should have gone through analytical geometry and the calculus had it not been for those men i never should have become a physical investigator and hence without them i should not have been here today they told me what i ought to do in a way that caused me to do it and all my consequent intellectual action is to be traced to this purely moral source to carlyle and emerson i ought to add fichte the greatest representative of pure idealism these three unscientific men made me a practical scientific worker they called out act i hearkened to the summons taking the liberty however of determining for myself the direction which effort was to take and i may now cry act but the potency of action must be yours i may pull the trigger but if the gun be not charged there is no result we are creators in the intellectual world as little as in the physical we may remove obstacles and render latent capacities active but we cannot suddenly change the nature of man the new birth itself implies the preexistence of a character which requires not to be created but brought forth you cannot by any amount of missionary labour suddenly transform the savage into the civilised christian the improvement of man is secularnot the work of an hour or of a day but though indubitably bound by our organisations no man knows what the potentialities of any human mind may be requiring only release to be brought into action there are in the mineral world certain crystalscertain forms for instance of fluorspar which have lain darkly in the earth for ages but which nevertheless have a potency of light locked up within them in their case the potential has never become actualthe light is in fact held back by a molecular detent when these crystals are warmed the detent is lifted and an outflow of light immediately begins i know not how many of you may be in the condition of this fluorspar for aught i know every one of you may be in this condition requiring but the proper agent to be appliedthe proper word to be spokento remove a detent and to render you conscious of light and warmth within yourselves and sources of both to others the circle of human nature then is not complete without the arc of the emotions the lilies of the field have a value for us beyond their botanical onesa certain lightening of the heart accompanies the declaration that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these the sound of the village bell has a value beyond its acoustical one the setting sun has a value beyond its optical one the starry heavens as you know had for immanuel kant a value beyond their astronomical one i think it very desirable to keep this horizon of the emotions open and not to permit either priest or philosopher to draw down his shutters between you and it here the dead languages which are sure to be beaten by science in the purely intellectual fight have an irresistible claim they supplement the work of science by exalting and refining the aesthetic faculty and must on this account be cherished by all who desire to see human culture complete there must be a reason for the fascination which these languages have so long exercised upon powerful and elevated mindsa fascination which will probably continue for men of greek and roman mould to the end of time in connection with this question one very obvious danger besets many of the more earnest spirits of our daythe danger of haste in endeavouring to give the feelings repose we are distracted by systems of theology and philosophy which were taught to us when young and which now excite in us a hunger and a thirst for knowledge not proved to be attainable there are periods when the judgment ought to remain in suspense the data on which a decision might be based being absent this discipline of suspending the judgment is a common one in science but not so common as it ought to be elsewhere i walked down regent street some time ago with a man of great gifts and acquirements discussing with him various theological questions i could not accept his views of the origin and destiny of the universe nor was i prepared to enunciate any definite views of my own he turned to me at length and said you surely must have a theory of the universe that i should in one way or another have solved this mystery of mysteries seemed to my friend a matter of course i have not even a theory of magnetism was my reply we ought to learn to wait we ought assuredly to pause before closing with the advances of those expounders of the ways of god to men who offer us intellectual peace at the modest cost of intellectual life the teachers of the world ought to be its best men and for the present at all events such men must learn selftrust by the fullness and freshness of their own jives and utterances they must awaken life in others the hopes and terrors which influenced our fathers are passing away and our trust henceforth must rest on the innate strength of mans moral nature and here i think the poet will have a great part to play in the future culture of the world to him when he rightly understands his mission and does not flinch from the tonic discipline which it assuredly demands we have a right to look for that heightening and brightening of life which so many of us need to him it is given for a long time to come to fill those shores which the recession of the theologic tide has left exposed void of offence to science he may freely deal with conceptions which science shuns and become the illustrator and interpreter of that power which as jehovah jove or lord has hitherto filled and strengthened the human heart let me utter one practical word in conclusiontake care of your health there have been men who by wise attention to this point might have risen to any eminencemight have made great discoveries written great poems commanded armies or ruled states but who by unwise neglect of this point have come to nothing imagine hercules as oarsman in a rotten boat what can he do there but by the very force of his stroke expedite the ruin of his craft take care then of the timbers of your boat and avoid all practices likely to introduce either wet or dry rot amongst them and this is not to be accomplished by desultory or intermittent efforts of the will but by the formation of habits the will no doubt has sometimes to put forth its strength in order to crush the special temptation but the formation of right habits is essential to your permanent security they diminish your chance of falling when assailed and they augment your chance of recovery when overthrown

association at liverpool september 16 1870 lastly physical investigation more than anything besides helps to teach us the actual value and right use of the imaginationof that wondrous faculty which left to ramble uncontrolled leads us astray into a wilderness of perplexities and errors a land of mists and shadows but which properly controlled by experience and reflection becomes the noblest attribute of man the source of poetic genius the instrument of discovery in science without the aid of which newton would never have invented fluxions nor davy have decomposed the earths and alkalies nor would columbus have found another continentaddress to the royal society by its president sir benjamin brodie november 30 1859 i carried with me to the alps this year the burden of this evenings work save from memory i had no direct aid upon the mountains but to spur up the emotions on which so much depends as well as to nourish indirectly the intellect and will i took with me four works comprising two volumes of poetry goethes farbenlehre and the work on logic recently published by mr alexander bain in goethe so noble otherwise i chiefly noticed the selfinflicted hurts of genius as it broke itself in vain against the philosophy of newton mr bain i found for the most part learned and practical shining generally with a dry light but exhibiting at times a flush of emotional strength which proved that even logicians share the common fire of humanity he interested me most when he became the mirror of my own condition neither intellectually nor socially is it good for man to be alone and the sorrows of thought are more patiently borne when we find that they have been experienced by another from certain passages in his book i could infer that mr bain was no stranger to such sorrows speaking for example of the ebb of intellectual force which we all from time to time experience mr bain says the uncertainty where to look for the next opening of discovery brings the pain of conflict and the debility of indecision these words have in them the true ring of personal experience the action of the investigator is periodic he grapples with a subject of enquiry wrestles with it and exhausts it may be both himself and it for the time being he breathes a space and then renews the struggle in another field now this period of halting between two investigations is not always one of pure repose it is often a period of doubt and discomfortof gloom and ennui the uncertainty where to look for the next opening of discovery brings the pain of conflict and the debility of indecision it was under such conditions that i had to equip myself for the hour and the ordeal that are now come the disciplines of common life are in great part exercises in the relations of space or in the mental grouping of bodies in space and by such exercises the public mind is to some extent prepared for the reception of physical conceptions assuming this preparation on your part the wish gradually grew within me to trace and to enable you to trace some of the more occult features and operations of light and colour i wished if possible to take you beyond the boundary of mere observation into a region where things are intellectually discerned and to show you there the hidden mechanism of optical action but how are those hidden things to be revealed philosophers may be right in affirming that we cannot transcend experience we can at all events carry it a long way from its origin we can magnify diminish qualify and combine experiences so as to render them fit for purposes entirely new in explaining sensible phenomena we habitually form mental images of the ultrasensible there are tories even in science who regard imagination as a faculty to be feared and avoided rather than employed they have observed its action in weak vessels and are unduly impressed by its disasters but they might with equal justice point to exploded boilers as an argument against the use of steam with accurate experiment and observation to work upon imagination becomes the architect of physical theory newtons passage from a falling apple to a falling moon was an act of the prepared imagination without which the laws of kepler could never have been traced to their foundations out of the facts of chemistry the constructive imagination of dalton formed the atomic theory davy was richly endowed with the imaginative faculty while with faraday its exercise was incessant preceding accompanying and guiding all his experiments his strength and fertility as a discoverer is to be referred in great part to the stimulus of his imagination scientific men fight shy of the word because of its ultrascientific connotations but the fact is that without the exercise of this power our knowledge of nature would be a mere tabulation of coexistences and sequences we should still believe in the succession of day and night of summer and winter but the conception of force would vanish from our universe causal relations would disappear and with them that science which is now binding the parts of nature to an organic whole i should like to illustrate by a few simple instances the use that scientific men have already made of this power of imagination and to indicate afterwards some of the further uses that they are likely to make of it let us begin with the rudimentary experiences observe the falling of heavy raindrops into a tranquil pond each drop as it strikes the water becomes a centre of disturbance from which a series of ringripples expand outwards gravity and inertia are the agents by which this wavemotion is produced and a rough experiment will suffice to show that the rate of propagation does not amount to a foot a second a series of slight mechanical shocks is experienced by a body plunged in the water as the wavelets reach it in succession but a finer motion is at the same time set up and propagated if the head and ears be immersed in the water as in an experiment of franklins the tick of the drop is heard now this sonorous impulse is propagated not at the rate of a foot but at the rate of 4700 feet a second in this case it is not the gravity but the elasticity of the water that comes into play every liquid particle pushed against its neighbour delivers up its motion with extreme rapidity and the pulse is propagated as a thrill the incompressibility of water as illustrated by the famous florentine experiment is a measure of its elasticity and to the possession of this property in so high a degree the rapid transmission of a soundpulse through water is to be ascribed but water as you know is not necessary to the conduction of sound air is its most common vehicle and you know that when the air possesses the particular density and elasticity corresponding to the temperature of freezing water the velocity of sound in it is 1090 feet a second it is almost exactly onefourth of the velocity in water the reason being that though the greater weight of the water tends to diminish the velocity the enormous molecular elasticity of the liquid far more than atones for the disadvantage due to weight by various contrivances we can compel the vibrations of the air to declare themselves we know the length and frequency of the sonorous waves and we have also obtained great mastery over the various methods by which the air is thrown into vibration we know the phenomena and laws of vibrating rods of organpipes strings membranes plates and bells we can abolish one sound by another we know the physical meaning of music and noise of harmony and discord in short as regards sound in general we have a very clear notion of the external physical processes which correspond to our sensations in the phenomena of sound we travel a very little way from downright sensible experience still the imagination is to some extent exercised the bodily eye for example cannot see the condensations and rarefactions of the waves of sound we construct them in thought and we believe as firmly in their existence as in that of the air itself but now our experience is to be carried into a new region where a new use is to be made of it having mastered the cause and mechanism of sound we desire to know the cause and mechanism of light we wish to extend our enquiries from the auditory to the optic nerve there is in the human intellect a power of expansioni might almost call it a power of creationwhich is brought into play by the simple brooding upon facts the legend of the spirit brooding over chaos may have originated in experience of this power in the case now before us it has manifested itself by transplanting into space for the purposes of light an adequately modified form of the mechanism of sound we know intimately whereon the velocity of sound depends when we lessen the density of the aerial medium and preserve its elasticity constant we augment the velocity when we heighten the elasticity and keep the density constant we also augment the velocity a small density therefore and a great elasticity are the two things necessary to rapid propagation now light is known to move with the astounding velocity of 186000 miles a second how is such a velocity to be obtained by boldly diffusing in space a medium of the requisite tenuity and elasticity let us make such a medium our startingpoint and endowing it with one or two other necessary qualities let us handle it in accordance with strict mechanical laws let us then carry our results from the world of theory into the world of sense and see whether our deductions do not issue in the very phenomena of light which ordinary knowledge and skilled experiment reveal if in all the multiplied varieties of these phenomena including those of the most remote and entangled description this fundamental conception always brings us face to face with the truth if no contradiction to our deductions from it be found in external nature but on all sides agreement and verification if moreover as in the case of conical refraction and in other cases it actually forces upon our attention phenomena which no eye had previously seen and which no mind had previously imaginedsuch a conception must we think be something more than a mere figment of the scientific fancy in forming it that composite and creative power in which reason and imagination are united has we believe led us into a world not less real than that of the senses and of which the world of sense itself is the suggestion and to a great extent the outcome far be it from me however to wish to fix you immovably in this or in any other theoretic conception with all our belief of it it will be well to keep the theory of a luminiferous aether plastic and capable of change you may moreover urge that although the phenomena occur as if the medium existed the absolute demonstration of its existence is still wanting far be it from me to deny to this reasoning such validity as it may fairly claim let us endeavour by means of analogy to form a fair estimate of its force you believe that in society you are surrounded by reasonable beings like yourself you are perhaps as firmly convinced of this as of anything what is your warrant for this conviction simply and solely this your fellowcreatures behave as if they were reasonable the hypothesis for it is nothing more accounts for the facts to take an eminent example you believe that our president is a reasonable being why there is no known method of superposition by which any one of us can apply himself intellectually to any other so as to demonstrate coincidence as regards the possession of reason if therefore you hold our president to be reasonable it is because he behaves as if he were reasonable as in the case of the aether beyond the as if you cannot go nay i should not wonder if a close comparison of the data on which both inferences rest caused many respectable persons to conclude that the aether had the best of it this universal medium this lightaether as it is called is the vehicle not the origin of wavemotion it receives and transmits but it does not create whence does it derive the motions it conveys for the most part from luminous bodies by the motion of a luminous body i do not mean its sensible motion such as the flicker of a candle or the shooting out of red prominences from the limb of the sun i mean an intestine motion of the atoms or molecules of the luminous body but here a certain reserve is necessary many chemists of the present day refuse to speak of atoms and molecules as real things their caution leads them to stop short of the clear sharp mechanically intelligible atomic theory enunciated by dalton or any form of that theory and to make the doctrine of multiple proportions their intellectual bourne i respect the caution though i think it is here misplaced the chemists who recoil from these notions of atoms and molecules accept without hesitation the undulatory theory of light like you and me they one and all believe in an aether and its lightproducing waves let us consider what this belief involves bring your imaginations once more into play and figure a series of soundwaves passing through air follow them up to their origin and what do you there find a definite tangible vibrating body it may be the vocal chords of a human being it may be an organpipe or it may be a stretched string follow in the same manner a train of aetherwaves to their source remembering at the same time that your aether is matter dense elastic and capable of motions subject to and determined by mechanical laws what then do you expect to find as the source of a series of aetherwaves ask your imagination if it will accept a vibrating multiple proportiona numerical ratio in a state of oscillation i do not think it will you cannot crown the edifice with this abstraction the scientific imagination which is here authoritative demands as the origin and cause of a series of aetherwaves a particle of vibrating matter quite as definite though it may be excessively minute as that which gives origin to a musical sound such a particle we name an atom or a molecule i think the intellect when focussed so as to give definition without penumbral haze is sure to realise this image at the last with the view of preserving thought continuous throughout this discourse and of preventing either failure of knowledge or of memory from causing any rent in our picture i here propose to run rapidly over a bit of ground which is probably familiar to most of you but which i am anxious to make familiar to you all the waves generated in the aether by the swinging atoms of luminous bodies are of different lengths and amplitudes the amplitude is the width of swing of the individual particles of the waves in waterwaves it is the vertical height of the crest above the trough while the length of the wave is the horizontal distance between two consecutive crests the aggregate of waves emitted by the sun may be broadly divided into two classes the one class competent the other incompetent to excite vision but the lightproducing waves differ markedly among themselves in size form and force the length of the largest of these waves is about twice that of the smallest but the amplitude of the largest is probably a hundred times that of the smallest now the force or energy of the wave which expressed with reference to sensation means the intensity of the light is proportional to the square of the amplitude hence the amplitude being onehundredfold the energy of the largest lightgiving waves would be tenthousandfold that of the smallest this is not improbable i use these figures not with a view to numerical accuracy but to give you definite ideas of the differences that probably exist among the lightgiving waves and if we take the whole range of solar radiation into accountits nonvisual as well as its visual wavesi think it probable that the force or energy of the largest wave is more than a million times that of the smallest turned into their equivalents of sensation the different lightwaves produce different colours red for example is produced by the largest waves violet by the smallest while green is produced by a wave of intermediate length and amplitude on entering from air into a more highly refracting substance such as glass or water or the sulphide of carbon all the waves are retarded but the smallest ones most this furnishes a means of separating the different classes of waves from each other in other words of analysing the light sent through a refracting prism the waves of the sun are turned aside in different degrees from their direct course the red least the violet most they are virtually pulled asunder and they paint upon a white screen placed to receive them the solar spectrum strictly speaking the spectrum embraces an infinity of colours but the limits of language and of our powers of distinction cause it to be divided into seven segments red orange yellow green blue indigo violet these are the seven primary or prismatic colours separately or mixed in various proportions the solar waves yield all the colours observed in nature and employed in art collectively they give us the impression of whiteness pure unsifted solar light is white and if all the waveconstituents of such light be reduced in the same proportion the light though diminished in intensity will still be white the whiteness of snow with the sun shining upon it is barely tolerable to the eye the same snow under an overcast firmament is still white such a firmament enfeebles the light by reflecting it upwards and when we stand above a cloudfieldon an alpine summit for instance or on the top of snowdonand see in the proper direction the sun shining on the clouds below us they appear dazzlingly white ordinary clouds in fact divide the solar light impinging on them into two partsa reflected part and a transmitted part in each of which the proportions of wavemotion which produce the impression of whiteness are sensibly preserved it will be understood that the condition of whiteness would fail if all the waves were diminished equally or by the same absolute quantity they must be reduced proportionately instead of equally if by the act of reflection the waves of red light are split into exact halves then to preserve the light white the waves of yellow orange green and blue must also be split into exact halves in short the reduction must take place not by absolutely equal quantities but by equal fractional parts in white light the preponderance as regards energy of the larger over the smaller waves must always be immense were the case otherwise the visual correlative blue of the smaller waves would have the upper hand in our sensations not only are the waves of aether reflected by clouds by solids and by liquids but when they pass from light air to dense or from dense air to light a portion of the wavemotion is always reflected now our atmosphere changes continually in density from top to bottom it will help our conceptions if we regard it as made up of a series of thin concentric layers or shells of air each shell being of the same density throughout a small and sudden change of density occurring in passing from shell to shell light would be reflected at the limiting surfaces of all these shells and their action would be practically the same as that of the real atmosphere and now i would ask your imagination to picture this act of reflection what must become of the reflected light the atmospheric layers turn their convex surfaces towards the sun they are so many convex mirrors of feeble power and you will immediately perceive that the light regularly reflected from these surfaces cannot reach the earth at all but is dispersed in space light thus reflected cannot therefore be the light of the sky but though the suns light is not reflected in this fashion from the aerial layers to the earth there is indubitable evidence to show that the light of our firmament is scattered light proofs of the most cogent description could be here adduced but we need only consider that we receive light at the same time from all parts of the hemisphere of heaven the light of the firmament comes to us across the direction of the solar rays and even against the direction of the solar rays and this lateral and opposing rush of wavemotion can only be due to the rebound of the waves from the air itself or from something suspended in the air it is also evident that unlike the action of clouds the solar light is not reflected by the sky in the proportions which produce white the sky is blue which indicates an excess of the shorter waves in accounting for the colour of the sky the first question suggested by analogy would undoubtedly be is not the air blue the blueness of the air has in fact been given as a solution of the blueness of the sky but how if the air be blue can the light of sunrise and sunset which travels through vast distances of air be yellow orange or even red the passage of white solar light through a blue medium could by no possibility redden the light the hypothesis of a blue air is therefore untenable in fact the agent whatever it is which sends us the light of the sky exercises in so doing a dichroitic action the light reflected is blue the light transmitted is orange or red a marked distinction is thus exhibited between the matter of the sky and that of an ordinary cloud which exercises no such dichroitic action by the scientific use of the imagination we may hope to penetrate this mystery the cloud takes no note of size on the part of the waves of aether but reflects them all alike it exercises no selective action now the cause of this may be that the cloud particles are so large in comparison with the waves of aether as to reflect them all indifferently a broad cliff reflects an atlantic roller as easily as a ripple produced by a seabirds wing and in the presence of large reflecting surfaces the existing differences of magnitude among the waves of aether may disappear but supposing the reflecting particles instead of being very large to be very small in comparison with the size of the waves in this case instead of the whole wave being fronted and thrown back a small portion only is shivered off the great mass of the wave passes over such a particle without reflection scatter then a handful of such minute foreign particles in our atmosphere and set imagination to watch their action upon the solar waves waves of all sizes impinge upon the particles and you see at every collision a portion of the impinging wave struck off all the waves of the spectrum from the extreme red to the extreme violet being thus acted upon remembering that the red waves stand to the blue much in the relation of billows to ripples we have to consider whether those extremely small particles are competent to scatter all the waves in the same proportion if they be notand a little reflection will make it clear that they are notthe production of colour must be an incident of the scattering largeness is a thing of relation and the smaller the wave the greater is the relative size of any particle on which the wave impinges and the greater also the ratio of the portion scattered to the total wave a pebble placed in the way of the ringripples produced by heavy raindrops on a tranquil pond will scatter a large fraction of each ripple while the fractional part of a larger wave thrown back by the same pebble might be infinitesimal now we have already made it clear to our minds that to preserve the solar light white its constituent proportions must not be altered but in the act of division performed by these very small particles the proportions are altered an undue fraction of the smaller waves is scattered by the particles and as a consequence in the scattered light blue will be the predominant colour the other colours of the spectrum must to some extent be associated with the blue they are not absent but deficient we ought in fact to have them all but in diminishing proportions from the violet to the red we have here presented a case to the imagination pad assuming the undulatory theory to be a reality we have i think fairly reasoned our way to the conclusion that were particles small in comparison to the sizes of the aether waves sown in our atmosphere the light scattered by those particles would be exactly such as we observe in our azure skies when this light is analysed all the colours of the spectrum are found and they are found in the proportions indicated by our conclusion blue is not the sole but it is the predominant colour let us now turn our attention to the light which passes unscattered among the particles how must it be finally affected by its successive collisions with the particles the white light is more and more robbed of its shorter waves it therefore loses more and more of its due proportion of blue the result may be anticipated the transmitted light where short distances are involved will appear yellowish but as the sun sinks towards the horizon the atmospheric distances increase and consequently the number of the scattering particles they abstract in succession the violet the indigo the blue and even disturb the proportions of green the transmitted light under such circumstances must pass from yellow through orange to red this also is exactly what we find in nature thus while the reflected light gives us at noon the deep azure of the alpine skies the transmitted light gives us at sunset the warm crimson of the alpine snows the phenomena certainly occur as if our atmosphere were a medium rendered slightly turbid by the mechanical suspension of exceedingly small foreign particles here as before we encounter our sceptical as if it is one of the parasites of science ever at hand and ready to plant itself and sprout if it can on the weak points of our philosophy but a strong constitution defies the parasite and in our case as we question the phenomena probability grows like growing health until in the end the malady of doubt is completely extirpated the first question that naturally arises is this can small particles be really proved to act in the manner indicated no doubt of it each one of you can submit the question to an experimental test water will not dissolve resin but spirit will dissolve it and when spirit holding resin in solution is dropped into water the resin immediately separates in solid particles which render the water milky the coarseness of this precipitate depends on the quantity of the dissolved resin you can cause it to separate either in thick clots or in exceedingly fine particles professor bruecke has given us the proportions which produce particles particularly suited to our present purpose one gramme of clean mastic is dissolved in eightyseven grammes of absolute alcohol and the transparent solution is allowed to drop into a beaker containing clear water kept briskly stirred an exceedingly fine precipitate is thus formed which declares its presence by its action upon light placing a dark surface behind the beaker and permitting the light to fall into it from the top or front the medium is seen to be distinctly blue it is not perhaps so perfect a blue as may be seen on exceptional days among the alps but it is a very fair skyblue a trace of soap in water gives a tint of blue london and i fear liverpool milk makes an approximation to the same colour through the operation of the same cause and helmholtz has irreverently disclosed the fact that the deepest blue eye is simply a turbid medium the action of turbid media upon light was illustrated by goethe who though unacquainted with the undulatory theory was led by his experiments to regard the firmament as an illuminated turbid medium with the darkness of space behind it he describes glasses showing a bright yellow by transmitted and a beautiful blue by reflected light professor stokes who was probably the first to discern the real nature of the action of small particles on the waves of aether footnote this is inferred from conversation i am not aware that professor stokes has published anything upon the subject describes a glass of a similar kind footnote this glass by reflected light had a colour strongly resembling that of a decoction of horsechestnut bark curiously enough goethe refers to this very decoction man nehme einen streifen frischer rinds von der rosskastanie man stecke denselben in ein glas wasser und in der kuerzesten zeit werden wir das vollkommenste himmelblau entstehen sehengoethes werke b xxix p 24 capital specimens of such glass are to be found at salviatis in st jamess street what artists call chill is no doubt an effect of this description through the action of minute particles the browns of a picture often present the appearance of the bloom of a plum by rubbing the varnish with a silk handkerchief optical continuity is established and the chill disappears some years ago i witnessed mr hirst experimenting at zermatt on the turbid water of the visp when kept still for a day or so the grosser matter sank but the finer particles remained suspended and gave a distinctly blue tinge to the water the blueness of certain alpine lakes has been shown to be in part due to this cause professor roscoe has noticed several striking cases of a similar kind in a very remarkable paper the late principal forbes showed that steam issuing from the safetyvalve of a locomotive when favourably observed exhibits at a certain stage of its condensation the colours of the sky it is blue by reflected light and orange or red by transmitted light the same effect as pointed out by goethe is to some extent exhibited by peatsmoke more than ten years ago i amused myself by observing on a calm day at killarney the straight smokecolumns rising from the cabinchimneys it was easy to project the lower portion of a column against a dark pine and its upper portion against a bright cloud the smoke in the former case was blue being seen mainly by reflected light in the latter case it was reddish being seen mainly by transmitted light such smoke was not in exactly the condition to give us the glow of the alps but it was a step in this direction brueckes fine precipitate above referred to looks yellowish by transmitted light but by duly strengthening the precipitate you may render the white light of noon as rubycoloured as the sun when seen through liverpool smoke or upon alpine horizons i do not however point to the gross smoke arising from coal as an illustration of the action of small particles because such smoke soon absorbs and destroys the waves of blue instead of sending them to the eyes of the observer these multifarious facts and numberless others which cannot now be referred to are explained by reference to the single principle that where the scattering particles are small in comparison to the aethereal waves we have in the reflected light a greater proportion of the smaller waves and in the transmitted light a greater proportion of the larger waves than existed in the original white light the consequence as regards sensation is that in the one ease blue is predominant and in the other orange or red our best microscopes can readily reveal objects not more than 150000th of an inch in diameter this is less than the length of a wave of red light indeed a firstrate microscope would enable us to discern objects not exceeding in diameter the length of the smallest waves of the visible spectrum footnote dallinger and drysdale have recently measured cilia 1200000th of an inch in diameter 1878 by the microscope therefore we can test our particles if they be as large as the lightwaves they will infallibly be seen and if they be not so seen it is because they are smaller some months ago i placed in the hands of our president a liquid containing brueckes precipitate the liquid was milky blue and mr huxley applied to it his highest microscopic power he satisfied me that had particles of even 1100000th of an inch in diameter existed in the liquid they could not have escaped detection but no particles were seen under the microscope the turbid liquid was not to be distinguished from distilled water footnote like dr burdon sandersons pyrogen the particles of mastic passed without sensible hindrance through filteringpaper by such filtering no freedom from suspended particles is secured the application of a condensed beam to the filtrate renders this at once evident but we have it in our power to imitate far more closely than we have hitherto done the natural conditions of this problem we can generate in air artificial skies and prove their perfect identity with the natural one as regards the exhibition of a number of wholly unexpected phenomena by a continuous process of growth moreover we are able to connect skymatter if i may use the term with molecular matter on the one side and with molar matter or matter in sensible masses on the other in illustration of this i will take an experiment suggested by some of my own researches and described by m morren of marseilles at the exeter meeting of the british association sulphur and oxygen combine to form sulphurous acid gas two atoms of oxygen and one of sulphur constituting the molecule of sulphurous acid it has been recently shown that waves of aether issuing from a strong source such as the sun or the electric light are competent to shake asunder the atoms of gaseous molecules footnote see new chemical reactions produced by light vol i a chemist would call this decomposition by light but it behoves us who are examining the power and function of the imagination to keep constantly before us the physical images which underlie our terms therefore i say sharply and definitely that the components of the molecules of sulphurous acid are shaken asunder by the aetherwaves enclosing sulphurous acid in a suitable vessel placing it in a dark room and sending through it a powerful beam of light we at first see nothing the vessel containing the gas seems as empty as a vacuum soon however along the track of the beam a beautiful skyblue colour is observed which is due to light scattered by the liberated particles of sulphur for a time the blue grows more intense it then becomes whitish and ends in a more or less perfect white when the action is continued long enough the tube is filled with a dense cloud of sulphur particles which by the application of proper means may be rendered individually visible footnote m morren was mistaken in supposing that a modicum of sulphurous acid in the drying tubes had any share in the production of the actinic clouds described by me a beautiful case of molecular instability in the presence of light is furnished by peroxide of chlorine as proved by professor dewar 1878 here then our aetherwaves untie the bond of chemical affinity and liberate a bodysulphurwhich at ordinary temperatures is a solid and which therefore soon becomes an object of the senses we have first of all the free atoms of sulphur which are incompetent to stir the retina sensibly with scattered light but these atoms gradually coalesce and form particles which grow larger by continual accretion until after a minute or two they appear as skymatter in this condition they are individually invisible but collectively they send an amount of wavemotion to the retina sufficient to produce the firmamental blue the particles continue or may be caused to continue in this condition for a considerable time during which no microscope can cope with them but they grow slowly larger and pass by insensible gradations into the state of cloud when they can no longer elude the armed eye thus without solution of continuity we start with matter in the atom and end with matter in the mass skymatter being the middle term of the series of transformations instead of sulphurous acid we might choose a dozen other substances and produce the same effect with all of them in the case of someprobably in the case of allit is possible to preserve matter in the firmamental condition for fifteen or twenty minutes under the continual operation of the light during these fifteen or twenty minutes the particles constantly grow larger without ever exceeding the size requisite to the production of the celestial blue now when two vessels are placed before us each containing skymatter it is possible to state with great distinctness which vessel contains the largest particles the eye is very sensitive to differences of light when as in our experiments it is placed in comparative darkness and the wavemotion thrown against the retina is small the larger particles declare themselves by the greater whiteness of their scattered light call now to mind the observation or effort at observation made by our president when he failed to distinguish the particles of mastic in brueckes medium and when you have done this please follow me a beam of light is permitted to act upon a certain vapour in two minutes the azure appears but at the end of fifteen minutes it has not ceased to be azure after fifteen minutes its colour and some other phenomena pronounce it to be a blue of distinctly smaller particles than those sought for in vain by mr huxley these particles as already stated must have been less than 1100000th of an inch in diameter and now i want you to consider the following question here are particles which have been growing continually for fifteen minutes and at the end of that time are demonstrably smaller than those which defied the microscope of mr huxleywhat must have been the size of these particles at the beginning of their growth what notion can you form of the magnitude of such particles the distances of stellar space give us simply a bewildering sense of vastness without leaving any distinct impression on the mind and the magnitudes with which we have here to do bewilder us equally in the opposite direction we are dealing with infinitesimals compared with which the test objects of the microscope are literally immense from their perviousness to stellar light and other considerations sir john herschel drew some startling conclusions regarding the density and weight of comets you know that these extraordinary and mysterious bodies sometimes throw out tails 100000000 miles in length and 50000 miles in diameter the diameter of our earth is 8000 miles both it and the sky and a good portion of space beyond the sky would certainly be included in a sphere 10000 miles across let us fill a hollow sphere of this diameter with cometary matter and make it our unit of measure to produce a comets tail of the size just mentioned about 300000 such measures would have to be emptied into space now suppose the whole of this stuff to be swept together and suitably compressed what do you suppose its volume would be sir john herschel would probably tell you that the whole mass might be carted away at a single effort by one of your drayhorses in fact i do not know that he would require more than a small fraction of a horsepower to remove the cometary dust after this you will hardly regard as monstrous a notion i have sometimes entertained concerning the quantity of matter in our sky suppose a shell to surround the earth at a distance which would place it beyond the grosser matter that hangs in the lower regions of the airsay at the height of the matterhorn or mont blanc outside this shell we should have the deep blue firmament let the atmospheric space beyond the shell be swept clean and the skymatter properly gathered up what would be its probable amount i have sometimes thought that a ladys portmanteau would contain it all i have thought that even a gentlemans portmanteaupossibly his snuffboxmight take it in and whether the actual sky be capable of this amount of condensation or not i entertain no doubt that a sky quite as vast as ours and as good in appearance could be formed from a quantity of matter which might be held in the hollow of the hand small in mass the vastness in point of number of the particles of our sky may be inferred from the continuity of its light it is not in broken patches nor at scattered points that the heavenly azure is revealed to the observer on the summit of mont blanc the blue is as uniform and coherent as if it formed the surface of the most closegrained solid a marble dome would not exhibit a stricter continuity and mr glaisher will inform you that if our hypothetical shell were lifted to twice the height of mont blanc above the earths surface we should still have the azure overhead everywhere through the atmosphere those skyparticles are strewn they fill the alpine valleys spreading like a delicate gauze in front of the slopes of pine they sometimes so swathe the peaks with light as to abolish their definition this year i have seen the weisshorn thus dissolved in opalescent air by proper instruments the glare thrown from the skyparticles against the retina may be quenched and then the mountain which it obliterated starts into sudden definition footnote see the sky of the alps art iv sec 3 vol i its extinction in front of a dark mountain resembles exactly the withdrawal of a veil it is then the light taking possession of the eye not the particles acting as opaque bodies that interferes with the definition by day this light quenches the stars even by moonlight it is able to exclude from vision all stars between the fifth and the eleventh magnitude it may be likened to a noise and the feebler stellar radiance to a whisper drowned by the noise what is the nature of the particles which shed this light the celebrated de la rive ascribes the haze of the alps in fine weather to floating organic germs now the possible existence of germs in such profusion has been held up as an absurdity it has been affirmed that they would darken the air and on the assumed impossibility of their existence in the requisite numbers without invasion of the solar light an apparently powerful argument has been based by believers in spontaneous generation similar arguments have been used by the opponents of the germ theory of epidemic disease who have triumphantly challenged an appeal to the microscope and the chemists balance to decide the question such arguments however are founded on a defective acquaintance with the powers and properties of matter without committing myself in the least to de la rives notion to the doctrine of spontaneous generation or to the germ theory of disease i would simply draw attention to the demonstrable fact that in the atmosphere we have particles which defy both the microscope and the balance which do not darken the air and which exist nevertheless in multitudes sufficient to reduce to insignificance the israelitish hyperbole regarding the sands upon the seashore the varying judgments of men on these and other questions may perhaps be to some extent accounted for by that doctrine of relativity which plays so important a part in philosophy this doctrine affirms that the impressions made upon us by any circumstance or combination of circumstances depend upon our previous state two travellers upon the same height the one having ascended to it from the plain the other having descended to it from a higher elevation will be differently affected by the scene around them to the one nature is expanding to the other it is contracting and impressions which have two such different antecedent states are sure to differ in our scientific judgments the law of relativity may also play an important part to two men one educated in the school of the senses having mainly occupied himself with observation the other educated in the school of imagination as well and exercised in the conceptions of atoms and molecules to which we have so frequently referred a bit of matter say 150000th of an inch in diameter will present itself differently the one descends to it from his molar heights the other climbs to it from his molecular lowlands to the one it appears small to the other large so also as regards the appreciation of the most minute forms of life revealed by the microscope to one of the men these naturally appear conterminous with the ultimate particles of matter there is but a step from the atom to the organism the other discerns numberless organic gradations between both compared with his atoms the smallest vibrios and bacteria of the microscopic field are as behemoth and leviathan the law of relativity may to some extent explain the different attitudes of two such persons with regard to the question of spontaneous generation an amount of evidence which satisfies the one entirely fails to satisfy the other and while to the one the last bold defence and startling expansion of the doctrine by dr bastian will appear perfectly conclusive to the other it will present itself as merely imposing a labour of demolition on subsequent investigators footnote when these words were uttered i did not imagine that the chief labour of demolition would fall upon myself 1878 let me say here that many of our physiological observers appear to form a very inadequate estimate of the distance which separates the microscopic from the molecular limit and that as a consequence they sometimes employ a phraseology calculated to mislead when for example the contents of a cell are described as perfectly homogeneous or as absolutely structureless because the microscope fails to discover any structure or when two structures are pronounced to be without difference because the microscope can discover none then i think the microscope begins to play a mischievous part a little consideration will make it plain that the microscope can have no voice in the question of germ structure distilled water is more perfectly homogeneous than any possible organic germ what is it that causes the liquid to cease contracting at 39 degrees fahr and to expand until it freezes we have here a structural process of which the microscope can take no note nor is it likely to do so by any conceivable extension of its powers place distilled water in the field of an electromagnet and bring a microscope to bear upon it will any change be observed when the magnet is excited absolutely none and still profound and complex changes have occurred first of all the particles of water have been rendered diamagnetically polar and secondly in virtue of the structure impressed upon it by the magnetic whirl of its molecules the liquid twists a ray of light in a fashion perfectly determinate both as to quantity and direction have the diamond the amethyst and the countless other crystals formed in the laboratories of nature and of man no structure assuredly they have but what can the microscope make of it nothing it cannot be too distinctly borne in mind that between the microscopic limit and the true molecular limit there is room for infinite permutations and combinations it is in this region that the poles of the atoms are arranged that tendency is given to their powers so that when these poles and powers have free action proper stimulus and a suitable environment they determine first the germ and afterwards the complete organism this first marshalling of the atoms on which all subsequent action depends baffles a keener power than that of the microscope when duly pondered the complexity of the problem raises the doubt not of the power of our instrument for that is nil but whether we ourselves possess the intellectual elements which will ever enable us to grapple with the ultimate structural energies of nature footnote in using the expression one sort of living substance i must guard against being supposed to mean that any kind of living protoplasm is homogeneous hyaline though it may appear we are not at present able to assign any limit to its complexity of structureburdon sanderson in the british medical journal january 16 1875 we have here scientific insight and its correlative caution in fact dr sanderson s important researches are a continued illustration of the position laid down above in more senses than one mr darwin has drawn heavily upon the scientific tolerance of his age he has drawn heavily upon time in his development of species and he has drawn adventurously upon matter in his theory of pangenesis according to this theory a germ already microscopic is a world of minor germs not only is the organism as a whole wrapped up in the germ but every organ of the organism has there its special seed this i say is an adventurous draft on the power of matter to divide itself and distribute its forces but unless we are perfectly sure that he is overstepping the bounds of reason that he is unwittingly sinning against observed fact or demonstrated lawfor a mind like that of darwin can never sin wittingly against either fact or lawwe ought i think to be cautious in limiting his intellectual horizon if there be the least doubt in the matter it ought to be given in favour of the freedom of such a mind to it a vast possibility is in itself a dynamic power though the possibility may never be drawn upon it gives me pleasure to think that the facts and reasonings of this discourse tend rather towards the justification of mr darwin than towards his condemnation for they seem to show the perfect competence of matter and force as regards divisibility and distribution to bear the heaviest strain that he has hitherto imposed upon them in the case of mr darwin observation imagination and reason combined have run back with wonderful sagacity and success over a certain length of the line of biological succession guided by analogy in his origin of species he placed at the root of life a primordial germ from which he conceived the amazing variety of the organisms now upon earths surface might be deduced if this hypothesis were even true it would not be final the human mind would infallibly look behind the germ and however hopeless the attempt would enquire into the history of its genesis in this dim twilight of conjecture the searcher welcomes every gleam and seeks to augment his light by indirect incidences he studies the methods of nature in the ages and the worlds within his reach in order to shape the course of speculation in antecedent ages and worlds and though the certainty possessed by experimental enquiry is here shut out we are not left entirely without guidance from the examination of the solar system kant and laplace came to the conclusion that its various bodies once formed parts of the same undislocated mass that matter in a nebulous form preceded matter in its present form that as the ages rolled away heat was wasted condensation followed planets were detached and that finally the chief portion of the hot cloud reached by selfcompression the magnitude and density of our sun the earth itself offers evidence of a fiery origin and in our day the hypothesis of kant and laplace receives the independent countenance of spectrum analysis which proves the same substances to be common to the earth and sun accepting some such view of the construction of our system as probable a desire immediately arises to connect the present life of our planet with the past we wish to know something of our remotest ancestry on its first detachment from the central mass life as we understand it could not have been present on the earth how then did it come there the thing to be encouraged here is a reverent freedoma freedom preceded by the hard discipline which checks licentiousness in speculationwhile the thing to be repressed both in science and out of it is dogmatism and here i am in the hands of the meetingwilling to end but ready to go on i have no right to intrude upon you unasked the unformed notions which are floating like clouds or gathering to more solid consistency in the modern speculative scientific mind but if you wish me to speak plainly honestly and undisputatiously i am willing to do so on the present occasion you are ordained to call and i to come well your answer is given and i obey your call two or three years ago in an ancient london college i listened to a discussion at the end of a lecture by a very remarkable man three or four hundred clergymen were present at the lecture the orator began with the civilisation of egypt in the time of joseph pointing out the very perfect organisation of the kingdom and the possession of chariots in one of which joseph rode as proving a long antecedent period of civilisation he then passed on to the mud of the nile its rate of augmentation its present thickness and the remains of human handiwork found therein thence to the rocks which bound the nile valley and which teem with organic remains thus in his own clear way he caused the idea of the worlds age to expand itself indefinitely before the minds of his audience and he contrasted this with the age usually assigned to the world during his discourse he seemed to be swimming against a stream he manifestly thought that he was opposing a general conviction he expected resistance in the subsequent discussion so did i but it was all a mistake there was no adverse current no opposing conviction no resistance merely here and there a halfhumorous but unsuccessful attempt to entangle him in his talk the meeting agreed with all that had been said regarding the antiquity of the earth and of its life they had indeed known it all long ago and they rallied the lecturer for coming amongst them with so stale a story it was quite plain that this large body of clergymen who were i should say to be ranked amongst the finest samples of their class had entirely given up the ancient landmarks and transported the conception of lifes origin to an indefinitely distant past this leads us to the gist of our present enquiry which is this does life belong to what we call matter or is it an independent principle inserted into matter at some suitable epochsay when the physical conditions became such as to permit of the development of life let us put the question with the reverence due to a faith and culture in which we all were cradled and which are the undeniable historic antecedents of our present enlightenment i say let us put the question reverently but let us also put it clearly and definitely there are the strongest grounds for believing that during a certain period of its history the earth was not nor was it fit to be the theatre of life whether this was ever a nebulous period or merely a molten period does not signify much and if we revert to the nebulous condition it is because the probabilities are really on its side our question is this did creative energy pause until the nebulous matter had condensed until the earth had been detached until the solar fire had so far withdrawn from the earths vicinity as to permit a crust to gather round the planet did it wait until the air was isolated until the seas were formed until evaporation condensation and the descent of rain had begun until the eroding forces of the atmosphere had weathered and decomposed the molten rocks so as to form soils until the suns rays had become so tempered by distance and by waste as to be chemically fit for the decompositions necessary to vegetable life having waited through these aeons until the proper conditions had set in did it send the flat forth let there be life these questions define a hypothesis not without its difficulties but the dignity of which in relation to the worlds knowledge was demonstrated by the nobleness of the men whom it sustained modern scientific thought is called upon to decide between this hypothesis and another and public thought generally will afterwards be called upon to do the same but however the convictions of individuals here and there may be influenced the process must be slow and secular which commends the hypothesis of natural evolution to the public mind for what are the core and essence of this hypothesis strip it naked and you stand face to face with the notion that not alone the more ignoble forms of animalcular or animal life not alone the nobler forms of the horse and lion not alone the exquisite and wonderful mechanism of the human body but that the human mind itselfemotion intellect will and all their phenomenawere once latent in a fiery cloud surely the mere statement of such a notion is more than a refutation but the hypothesis would probably go even farther than this many who hold it would probably assent to the position that at the present moment all our philosophy all our poetry all our science and all our artplato shakspeare newton and raphaelare potential in the fires of the sun we long to learn something of our origin if the evolution hypothesis be correct even this unsatisfied yearning must have come to us across the ages which separate the primeval mist from the consciousness of today i do not think that any holder of the evolution hypothesis would say that i overstate or overstrain it in any way i merely strip it of all vagueness and bring before you unclothed and unvarnished the notions by which it must stand or fall surely these notions represent an absurdity too monstrous to be entertained by any sane mind but why are such notions absurd and why should sanity reject them the law of relativity of which we have previously spoken may find its application here these evolution notions are absurd monstrous and fit only for the intellectual gibbet in relation to the ideas concerning matter which were drilled into us when young spirit and matter have ever been presented to us in the rudest contrast the one as allnoble the other as allvile but is this correct upon the answer to this question all depends supposing that instead of having the foregoing antithesis of spirit and matter presented to our youthful minds we had been taught to regard them as equally worthy and equally wonderful to consider them in fact as two opposite faces of the selfsame mystery supposing that in youth we had been impregnated with the notion of the poet goethe instead of the notion of the poet young and taught to look upon matter not as brute matter but as the living garment of god do you not think that under these altered circumstances the law of relativity might have had an outcome different from its present one is it not probable that our repugnance to the idea of primeval union between spirit and matter might be considerably abated without this total revolution of the notions now prevalent the evolution hypothesis must stand condemned but in many profoundly thoughtful minds such a revolution has already taken place they degrade neither member of the mysterious duality referred to but they exalt one of them from its abasement and repeal the divorce hitherto existing between them in substance if not in words their position as regards the relation of spirit and matter is what god hath joined together let not man put asunder you have been thus led to the outer rim of speculative science for beyond the nebulae scientific thought has never hitherto ventured i have tried to state that which i considered ought in fairness to be outspoken i neither think this evolution hypothesis is to be flouted away contemptuously nor that it ought to be denounced as wicked it is to be brought before the bar of disciplined reason and there justified or condemned let us hearken to those who wisely support it and to those who wisely oppose it and let us tolerate those whose name is legion who try foolishly to do either of these things the only thing out of place in the discussion is dogmatism on either side fear not the evolution hypothesis steady yourselves in its presence upon that faith in the ultimate triumph of truth which was expressed by old gamaliel when he said if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it if it be of man it will come to nought under the fierce light of scientific enquiry it is sure to be dissipated if it possess not a core of truth trust me its existence as a hypothesis is quite compatible with the simultaneous existence of all those virtues to which the term christian has been applied it does not solveit does not profess to solvethe ultimate mystery of this universe it leaves in fact that mystery untouched for granting the nebula and its potential life the question whence they came would still remain to baffle and bewilder us at bottom the hypothesis does nothing more than transport the conception of lifes origin to an indefinitely distant past those who hold the doctrine of evolution are by no means ignorant of the uncertainty of their data and they only yield to it a provisional assent they regard the nebular hypothesis as probable and in the utter absence of any evidence to prove the act illegal they extend the method of nature from the present into the past here the observed uniformity of nature is their only guide within the long range of physical enquiry they have never discerned in nature the insertion of caprice throughout this range the laws of physical and intellectual continuity have run side by side having thus determined the elements of their curve in a world of observation and experiment they prolong that curve into an antecedent world and accept as probable the unbroken sequence of development from the nebula to the present time you never hear the really philosophical defenders of the doctrine of uniformity speaking of impossibilities in nature they never say what they are constantly charged with saying that it is impossible for the builder of the universe to alter his work their business is not with the possible but the actualnot with a world which might be but with a world that is this they explore with a courage not unmixed with reverence and according to methods which like the quality of a tree are tested by their fruits they have but one desireto know the truth they have but one fearto believe a lie and if they know the strength of science and rely upon it with unswerving trust they also know the limits beyond which science ceases to be strong they best know that questions offer themselves to thought which science as now prosecuted has not even the tendency to solve they have as little fellowship with the atheist who says there is no god as with the theist who professes to know the mind of god two things said immanuel kant fill me with awe the starry heavens and the sense of moral responsibility in man and in his hours of health and strength and sanity when the stroke of action has ceased and the pause of reflection has set in the scientific investigator finds himself overshadowed by the same awe breaking contact with the hampering details of earth it associates him with a power which gives fulness and tone to his existence but which he can neither analyse nor comprehend there is one god supreme over all gods diviner than mortals whose form is not like unto mans and as unlike his nature but vain mortals imagine that gods like themselves are begotten with human sensations and voice and corporeal members so if oxen or lions had hands and could work in mans fashion and trace out with chisel or brush their conception of godhead then would horses depict gods like horses and oxen like oxen each kind the divine with its own form and nature endowing xenophanes of colophon six centuries bc supernatural religion vol 1 ix the belfast address footnote delivered before the british association on wednesday evening august 19 1874 1 an impulse inherent in primeval man turned his thoughts and questionings betimes towards the sources of natural phenomena the same impulse inherited and intensified is the spur of scientific action today determined by it by a process of abstraction from experience we form physical theories which lie beyond the pale of experience but which satisfy the desire of the mind to see every natural occurrence resting upon a cause in forming their notions of the origin of things our earliest historic and doubtless we might add our prehistoric ancestors pursued as far as their intelligence permitted the same course they also fell back upon experience but with this differencethat the particular experiences which furnished the warp and woof of their theories were drawn not from the study of nature but from what lay much closer to themthe observation of men their theories accordingly took an anthropomorphic form to supersensual beings which however potent and invisible were nothing but a species of human creatures perhaps raised from among mankind and retaining all human passions and appetites were handed over the rule and governance of natural phenomena footnote hume natural history of religion tested by observation and reflection these early notions failed in the long run to satisfy the more penetrating intellects of our race far in the depths of history we find men of exceptional power differentiating themselves from the crowd rejecting these anthropomorphic notions and seeking to connect natural phenomena with their physical principles but long prior to these purer efforts of the understanding the merchant had been abroad and rendered the philosopher possible commerce had been developed wealth amassed leisure for travel and speculation secured while races educated under different conditions and therefore differently informed and endowed had been stimulated and sharpened by mutual contact in those regions where the commercial aristocracy of ancient greece mingled with their eastern neighbours the sciences were born being nurtured and developed by freethinking and courageous men the state of things to be displaced may be gathered from a passage of euripides quoted by hume there is nothing in the world no glory no prosperity the gods toss all into confusion mix everything with its reverse that all of us from our ignorance and uncertainty may pay them the more worship and reverence now as science demands the radical extirpation of caprice and the absolute reliance upon law in nature there grew with the growth of scientific notions a desire and determination to sweep from the field of theory this mob of gods and demons and to place natural phenomena on a basis more congruent with themselves the problem which had been previously approached from above was now attacked from below theoretic effort passed from the super to the subsensible it was felt that to construct the universe in idea it was necessary to have some notion of its constituent partsof what lucretius subsequently called the first beginnings abstracting again from experience the leaders of scientific speculation reached at length the pregnant doctrine of atoms and molecules the latest developments of which were set forth with such power and clearness at the last meeting of the british association thought no doubt had long hovered about this doctrine before it attained the precision and completeness which it assumed in the mind of democritus footnote born 460 bc a philosopher who may well for a moment arrest our attention few great men says lange a nonmaterialist in his excellent history of materialism to the spirit and to the letter of which i am equally indebted have been so despitefully used by history as democritus in the distorted images sent down to us through unscientific traditions there remains of him almost nothing but the name of the laughing philosopher while figures of immeasurably smaller significance spread themselves out at full length before us lange speaks of bacons high appreciation of democritusfor ample illustrations of which i am indebted to my excellent friend mr spedding the learned editor and biographer of bacon it is evident indeed that bacon considered democritus to be a man of weightier metal than either plato or aristotle though their philosophy was noised and celebrated in the schools amid the din and pomp of professors it was not they but genseric and attila and the barbarians who destroyed the atomic philosophy for at a time when all human learning had suffered shipwreck these planks of aristotelian and platonic philosophy as being of a lighter and more inflated substance were preserved and came down to us while things more solid sank and almost passed into oblivion the son of a wealthy father democritus devoted the whole of his inherited fortune to the culture of his mind he travelled everywhere visited athens when socrates and plato were there but quitted the city without making himself known indeed the dialectic strife in which socrates so much delighted had no charm for democritus who held that the man who readily contradicts and uses many words is unfit to learn anything truly right he is said to have discovered and educated protagoras the sophist being struck as much by the manner in which he being a hewer of wood tied up his faggots as by the sagacity of his conversation democritus returned poor from his travels was supported by his brother and at length wrote his great work entitled diakosmos which he read publicly before the people of his native town he was honoured by his countrymen in various ways and died serenely at a great age the principles enunciated by democritus reveal his uncompromising antagonism to those who deduced the phenomena of nature from the caprices of the gods they are briefly these 1 from nothing comes nothing nothing that exists can be destroyed all changes are due to the combination and separation of molecules 2 nothing happens by chance every occurrence has its cause from which it follows by necessity 3 the only existing things are the atoms and empty space all else is mere opinion 4 the atoms are infinite in number and infinitely various in form they strike together and the lateral motions and whirlings which thus arise are the beginnings of worlds 5 the varieties of all things depend upon the varieties of their atoms in number size and aggregation 6 the soul consists of fine smooth round atoms like those of fire these are the most mobile of all they interpenetrate the whole body and in their motions the phenomena of life arise the first five propositions are a fair general statement of the atomic philosophy as now held as regards the sixth democritus made his finer atoms do duty for the nervous system whose functions were then unknown the atoms of democritus are individually without sensation they combine in obedience to mechanical laws and not only organic forms but the phenomena of sensation and thought are the result of their combination that great enigma the exquisite adaptation of one part of an organism to another part and to the conditions of life more especially the construction of the human body democritus made no attempt to solve empedocles a man of more fiery and poetic nature introduced the notion of love and hate among the atoms to account for their combination and separation and bolder than democritus he struck in with the penetrating thought linked however with some wild speculation that it lay in the very nature of those combinations which were suited to their ends in other words in harmony with their environment to maintain themselves while unfit combinations having no proper habitat must rapidly disappear thus more than 2000 years ago the doctrine of the survival of the fittest which in our day not on the basis of vague conjecture but of positive knowledge has been raised to such extraordinary significance had received at all events partial enunciation footnote see lange 2nd edit p 23 epicurus footnote born 342 bc said to be the son of a poor schoolmaster at samos is the next dominant figure in the history of the atomic philosophy he mastered the writings of democritus heard lectures in athens went back to samos and subsequently wandered through various countries he finally returned to athens where he bought a garden and surrounded himself by pupils in the midst of whom he lived a pure and serene life and died a peaceful death democritus looked to the soul as the ennobling part of man even beauty without understanding partook of animalism epicurus also rated the spirit above the body the pleasure of the body being that of the moment while the spirit could draw upon the future and the past his philosophy was almost identical with that of democritus but he never quoted either friend or foe one main object of epicurus was to free the world from superstition and the fear of death death be treated with indifference it merely robs us of sensation as long as we are death is not and when death is we are not life has no more evil for him who has made up his mind that it is no evil not to live he adored the gods but not in the ordinary fashion the idea of divine power properly purified he thought an elevating one still he taught not he is godless who rejects the gods of the crowd but rather he who accepts them the gods were to him eternal and immortal beings whose blessedness excluded every thought of care or occupation of any kind nature pursues her course in accordance with everlasting laws the gods never interfering they haunt the lucid interspace of world and world where never creeps a cloud or moves a wind nor ever falls the least white star of snow nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar their sacred everlasting calm tennysons lucretius lange considers the relation of epicurus to the gods subjective the indication probably of an ethical requirement of his own nature we cannot read history with open eyes or study human nature to its depths and fail to discern such a requirement man never has been and he never will be satisfied with the operations and products of the understanding alone hence physical science cannot cover all the demands of his nature but the history of the efforts made to satisfy these demands might be broadly described as a history of errorsthe error in great part consisting in ascribing fixity to that which is fluent which varies as we vary being gross when we are gross and becoming as our capacities widen more abstract and sublime on one great point the mind of epicurus was at peace he neither sought nor expected here or hereafter any personal profit from his relation to the gods and it is assuredly a fact that loftiness and serenity of thought may be promoted by conceptions which involve no idea of profit of this kind did i not believe said a great man footnote carlyle to me once that an intelligence is at the heart of things my life on earth would be intolerable the utterer of these words is not in my opinion rendered less but more noble by the fact that it was the need of ethical harmony here and not the thought of personal happiness hereafter that prompted his observation there are persons not belonging to the highest intellectual zone nor yet to the lowest to whom perfect clearness of exposition suggests want of depth they find comfort and edification in an abstract and learned phraseology to such people epicurus who spared no pains to rid his style of every trace of haze and turbidity appeared on this very account superficial he had however a disciple who thought it no unworthy occupation to spend his days and nights in the effort to reach the clearness of his master and to whom the greek philosopher is mainly indebted for the extension and perpetuation of his fame some two centuries after the death of epicurus lucretius footnote born 99 bc wrote his great poem on the nature of things in which he a roman developed with extraordinary ardour the philosophy of his greek predecessor he wishes to win over his friend memnius to the school of epicurus and although he has no rewards in a future life to offer although his object appears to be a purely negative one he addresses his friend with the heat of an apostle his object like that of his great forerunner is the destruction of superstition and considering that men in his day trembled before every natural event as a direct monition from the gods and that everlasting torture was also in prospect the freedom aimed at by lucretius might be deemed a positive good this terror he says and darkness of mind must be dispelled not by the rays of the sun and glittering shafts of day but by the aspect and the law of nature he refutes the notion that anything can come out of nothing or that what is once begotten can be recalled to nothing the first beginnings the atoms are indestructible and into them all things can be resolved at last bodies are partly atoms and partly combinations of atoms but the atoms nothing can quench they are strong in solid singleness and by their denser combination all things can be closely packed and exhibit enduring strength he denies that matter is infinitely divisible we come at length to the atoms without which as an imperishable substratum all order in the generation and development of things would be destroyed the mechanical shock of the atoms being in his view the allsufficient cause of things he combats the notion that the constitution of nature has been in any way determined by intelligent design the interaction of the atoms throughout infinite time rendered all manner of combinations possible of these the fit ones persisted while the unfit ones disappeared not after sage deliberation did the atoms station themselves in their right places nor did they bargain what motions they should assume from all eternity they have been driven together and after trying motions and unions of every kind they fell at length into the arrangements out of which this system of things has been evolved if you will apprehend and keep in mind these things nature free at once and rid of her haughty lords is seen to do all things spontaneously of herself without the meddling of the gods footnote monros translation in his criticism of this work contemporary review 1867 dr hayman does not appear to be aware of the really sound and subtile observations on which the reasoning of lucretius though erroneous sometimes rests to meet the objection that his atoms cannot be seen lucretius describes a violent storm and shows that the invisible particles of air act in the same way as the visible particles of water we perceive moreover the different smells of things yet never see them coming to our nostrils again clothes hung up on a shore which waves break upon become moist and then get dry if spread out in the sun though no eye can see either the approach or the escape of the waterparticles a ring worn long on the finger becomes thinner a waterdrop hollows out a stone the ploughshare is rubbed away in the field the streetpavement is worn by the feet but the particles that disappear at any moment we cannot see nature acts through invisible particles that lucretius had a strong scientific imagination the foregoing references prove a fine illustration of his power in this respect is his explanation of the apparent rest of bodies whose atoms are in motion he employs the image of a flock of sheep with skipping lambs which seen from a distance presents simply a white patch upon the green hill the jumping of the individual lambs being quite invisible his vaguely grand conception of the atoms falling eternally through space suggested the nebular hypothesis to kant its first propounder far beyond the limits of our visible world are to be found atoms innumerable which have never been united to form bodies or which if once united have been again dispersedfalling silently through immeasurable intervals of time and space as everywhere throughout the all the same conditions are repeated so must the phenomena be repeated also above us below us beside us therefore are worlds without end and this when considered must dissipate every thought of a deflection of the universe by the gods the worlds come and go attracting new atoms out of limitless space or dispersing their own particles the reputed death of lucretius which forms the basis of mr tennysons noble poem is in strict accordance with his philosophy which was severe and pure 2 still earlier than these three philosophers and during the centuries between the first of them and the last the human intellect was active in other fields than theirs pythagoras had founded a school of mathematics and made his experiments on the harmonic intervals the sophists had run through their career at athens had appeared socrates plato and aristotle who ruined the sophists and whose yoke remains to some extent unbroken to the present hour within this period also the school of alexandria was founded euclid wrote his elements and made some advance in optics archimedes had propounded the theory of the lever and the principles of hydrostatics astronomy was immensely enriched by the discoveries of hipparchus who was followed by the historically more celebrated ptolemy anatomy had been made the basis of scientific medicine and it is said by draper that vivisection had begun footnote history of the intellectual development of europe p 295 in fact the science of ancient greece had already cleared the world of the fantastic images of divinities operating capriciously through natural phenomena it had shaken itself free from that fruitless scrutiny by the internal light of the mind alone which had vainly sought to transcend experience and to reach a knowledge of ultimate causes instead of accidental observation it had introduced observation with a purpose instruments were employed to aid the senses and scientific method was rendered in a great measure complete by the union of induction and experiment what then stopped its victorious advance why was the scientific intellect compelled like an exhausted soil to lie fallow for nearly two millenniums before it could regather the elements necessary to its fertility and strength bacon has already let us know one cause whewell ascribes this stationary period to four causesobscurity of thought servility intolerance of disposition enthusiasm of temper and he gives striking examples of each footnote history of the inductive sciences vol i but these characteristics must have had their antecedents in the circumstances of the time rome and the other cities of the empire had fallen into moral putrefaction christianity had appeared offering the gospel to the poor and by moderation if not asceticism of life practically protesting against the profligacy of the age the sufferings of the early christians and the extraordinary exaltation of mind which enabled them to triumph over the diabolical tortures to which they were subjected must have left traces not easily effaced footnote described with terrible vividness in renans antichrist they scorned the earth in view of that building of god that house not made with hands eternal in the heavens the scriptures which ministered to their spiritual needs were also the measure of their science when for example the celebrated question of antipodes came to be discussed the bible was with many the ultimate court of appeal augustine who flourished ad 400 would not deny the rotundity of the earth but he would deny the possible existence of inhabitants at the other side because no such race is recorded in scripture among the descendants of adam archbishop boniface was shocked at the assumption of a world of human beings out of the reach of the means of salvation thus reined in science was not likely to make much progress later on the political and theological strife between the church and civil governments so powerfully depicted by draper must have done much to stifle investigation whewell makes many wise and brave remarks regarding the spirit of the middle ages it was a menial spirit the seekers after natural knowledge had forsaken the fountain of living waters the direct appeal to nature by observation and experiment and given themselves up to the remanipulation of the notions of their predecessors it was a time when thought had become abject and when the acceptance of mere authority led as it always does in science to intellectual death natural events instead of being traced to physical were referred to moral causes while an exercise of the phantasy almost as degrading as the spiritualism of the present day took the place of scientific speculation then came the mysticism of the middle ages magic alchemy the neoplatonic philosophy with its visionary though sublime abstractions which caused men to look with shame upon their own bodies as hindrances to the absorption of the creature in the blessedness of the creator finally came the scholastic philosophy a fusion according to lange of the least mature notions of aristotle with the christianity of the west intellectual immobility was the result as a traveller without a compass in a fog may wander long imagining he is making way and find himself after hours of toil at his startingpoint so the schoolmen having tied and untied the same knots and formed and dissipated the same clouds found themselves at the end of centuries in their old position footnote whewell with regard to the influence wielded by aristotle in the middle ages and which to a less extent he still wields i would ask permission to make one remark when the human mind has achieved greatness and given evidence of extraordinary power in one domain there is a tendency to credit it with similar power in all other domains thus theologians have found comfort and assurance in the thought that newton dealt with the question of revelationforgetful of the fact that the very devotion of his powers through all the best years of his life to a totally different class of ideas not to speak of any natural disqualification tended to render him less instead of more competent to deal with theological and historic questions goethe starting from his established greatness as a poet and indeed from his positive discoveries in natural history produced a profound impression among the painters of germany when he published his farbenlehre in which he endeavoured to overthrow newtons theory of colours this theory he deemed so obviously absurd that he considered its author a charlatan and attacked him with a corresponding vehemence of language in the domain of natural history goethe had made really considerable discoveries and we have high authority for assuming that had he devoted himself wholly to that side of science he might have reached an eminence comparable with that which he attained as a poet in sharpness of observation in the detection of analogies apparently remote in the classification and organisation of facts according to the analogies discerned goethe possessed extraordinary powers these elements of scientific enquiry fall in with the disciplines of the poet but on the other hand a mind thus richly endowed in the direction of natural history may be almost shorn of endowment as regards the physical and mechanical sciences goethe was in this condition he could not formulate distinct mechanical conceptions he could not see the force of mechanical reasoning and in regions where such reasoning reigns supreme he became a mere ignis fatuus to those who followed him i have sometimes permitted myself to compare aristotle with goetheto credit the stagirite with an almost superhuman power of amassing and systematising facts but to consider him fatally defective on that side of the mind in respect to which incompleteness has been just ascribed to goethe whewell refers the errors of aristotle not to a neglect of facts but to a neglect of the idea appropriate to the facts the idea of mechanical cause which is force and the substitution of vague or inapplicable notions involving only relations of space or emotions of wonder this is doubtless true but the word neglect implies mere intellectual misdirection whereas in aristotle as in goethe it was not i believe misdirection but sheer natural incapacity which lay at the root of his mistakes as a physicist aristotle displayed what we should consider some of the worst of attributes in a modern physical investigatorindistinctness of ideas confusion of mind and a confident use of language which led to the delusive notion that he had really mastered his subject while he had as yet failed to grasp even the elements of it he put words in the place of things subject in the place of object he preached induction without practising it inverting the true order of enquiry by passing from the general to the particular instead of from the particular to the general he made of the universe a closed sphere in the centre of which he fixed the earth proving from general principles to his own satisfaction and to that of the world for near 2000 years that no other universe was possible his notions of motion were entirely unphysical it was natural or unnatural better or worse calm or violentno real mechanical conception regarding it lying at the bottom of his mind he affirmed that a vacuum could not exist and proved that if it did motion in it would be impossible he determined priori how many species of animals must exist and showed on general principles why animals must have such and such parts when an eminent contemporary philosopher who is far removed from errors of this kind remembers these abuses of the priori method he will be able to make allowance for the jealousy of physicists as to the acceptance of socalled priori truths aristotles errors of detail as shown by eucken and lange were grave and numerous he affirmed that only in man we had the beating of the heart that the left side of the body was colder than the right that men have more teeth than women and that there is an empty space at the back of every mans head there is one essential quality in physical conceptions which was entirely wanting in those of aristotle and his followersa capability of being placed as coherent pictures before the mind the germans express the act of picturing by the word vorstellen and the picture they call a vorstellung we have no word in english which comes nearer to our requirements than imagination and taken with its proper limitations the word answers very well but it is tainted by its associations and therefore objectionable to some minds compare with reference to this capacity of mental presentation the case of the aristotelian who refers the ascent of water in a pump to natures abhorrence of a vacuum with that of pascal when he proposed to solve the question of atmospheric pressure by the ascent of the puy de dme in the one case the terms of the explanation refuse to fall into place as a physical image in the other the image is distinct the descent and rise of the barometer being clearly figured beforehand as the balancing of two varying and opposing pressures 3 during the drought of the middle ages in christendom the arabian intellect as forcibly shown by draper was active with the intrusion of the moors into spain order learning and refinement took the place of their opposites when smitten with disease the christian peasant resorted to a shrine the moorish one to an instructed physician the arabs encouraged translations from the greek philosophers but not from the greek poets they turned in disgust from the lewdness of our classical mythology and denounced as an unpardonable blasphemy all connection between the impure olympian jove and the most high god draper traces still farther than whewell the arab elements in our scientific terms he gives examples of what arabian men of science accomplished dwelling particularly on alhazen who was the first to correct the platonic notion that rays of light are emitted by the eye alhazen discovered atmospheric refraction and showed that we see the sun and the moon after they have set he explained the enlargement of the sun and moon and the shortening of the vertical diameters of both these bodies when near the horizon he was aware that the atmosphere decreases in density with increase of elevation and actually fixed its height at 585 miles in the book of the balance of wisdom he sets forth the connection between the weight of the atmosphere and its increasing density he shows that a body will weigh differently in a rare and dense atmosphere and he considers the force with which plunged bodies rise through heavier media he understood the doctrine of the centre of gravity and applied it to the investigation of balances and steelyards he recognised gravity as a force though he fell into the error of assuming it to diminish simply as the distance and of making it purely terrestrial he knew the relation between the velocities spaces and times of falling bodies and had distinct ideas of capillary attraction he improved the hydrometer the determinations of the densities of bodies as given by alhazen approach very closely to our own i join says draper in the pious prayer of alhazen that in the day of judgment the allmerciful will take pity on the soul of aburraihn because he was the first of the race of men to construct a table of specific gravities if all this be historic truth and i have entire confidence in dr draper well may he deplore the systematic manner in which the literature of europe has contrived to put out of sight our scientific obligations to the mahommedans footnote intellectual development of europe p 359 the strain upon the mind during the stationary period towards ultraterrestrial things to the neglect of problems close at hand was sure to provoke reaction but the reaction was gradual for the ground was dangerous and a power was at hand competent to crush the critic who went too far to elude this power and still allow opportunity for the expression of opinion the doctrine of twofold truth was invented according to which an opinion might be held theologically and the opposite opinion philosophically footnote lange 2nd edit pp 181 182 thus in the thirteenth century the creation of the world in six days and the unchangeableness of the individual soul which had been so distinctly affirmed by st thomas aquinas were both denied philosophically but admitted to be true as articles of the catholic faith when protagoras uttered the maxim which brought upon him so much vituperation that opposite assertions are equally true he simply meant to affirm mens differences to be so great that what was subjectively true to the one might be subjectively untrue to the other the great sophist never meant to play fast and loose with the truth by saying that one of two opposite assertions made by the same individual could possibly escape being a lie it was not sophistry but the dread of theologic vengeance that generated this double dealing with conviction and it is astonishing to notice what lengths were allowed to men who were adroit in the use of artifices of this kind towards the close of the stationary period a wordweariness if i may so express it took more and more possession of mens minds christendom had become sick of the school philosophy and its verbal wastes which led to no issue but left the intellect in everlasting haze here and there was heard the voice of one impatiently crying in the wilderness not unto aristotle not unto subtle hypothesis not unto church bible or blind tradition must we turn for a knowledge of the universe but to the direct investigation of nature by observation and experiment in 1543 the epochmarking work of copernicus on the paths of the heavenly bodies appeared the total crash of aristotles closed universe with the earth at its centre followed as a consequence and the earth moves became a kind of watchword among intellectual freemen copernicus was canon of the church of frauenburg in the diocese of ermeland for threeandthirty years he had withdrawn himself from the world and devoted himself to the consolidation of his great scheme of the solar system he made its blocks eternal and even to those who feared it and desired its overthrow it was so obviously strong that they refrained for a time from meddling with it in the last year of the life of copernicus his book appeared it is said that the old man received a copy of it a few days before his death and then departed in peace the italian philosopher giordano bruno was one of the earliest converts to the new astronomy taking lucretius as his exemplar he revived the notion of the infinity of worlds and combining with it the doctrine of copernicus reached the sublime generalisation that the fixed stars are suns scattered numberless through space and accompanied by satellites which bear the same relation to them that our earth does to our sun or our moon to our earth this was an expansion of transcendent import but bruno came closer than this to our present line of thought struck with the problem of the generation and maintenance of organisms and duly pondering it he came to the conclusion that nature in her productions does not imitate the technic of man her process is one of unravelling and unfolding the infinity of forms under which matter appears was not imposed upon it by an external artificer by its own intrinsic force and virtue it brings these forms forth matter is not the mere naked empty capacity which philosophers have pictured her to be but the universal mother who brings forth all things as the fruit of her own womb this outspoken man was originally a dominican monk he was accused of heresy and had to fly seeking refuge in geneva paris england and germany in 1592 be fell into the hands of the inquisition at venice he was imprisoned for many years tried degraded excommunicated and handed over to the civil power with the request that he should be treated gently and without the shedding of blood this meant that he was to be burnt and burnt accordingly he was on february 16 1600 to escape a similar fate galileo thirtythree years afterwards abjured upon his knees with his hands upon the holy gospels the heliocentric doctrine which he knew to be true after galileo came kepler who from his german home defied the ultramontane power he traced out from preexisting observations the laws of planetary motion materials were thus prepared for newton who bound those empirical laws together by the principle of gravitation 4 in the seventeenth century bacon and descartes the restorers of philosophy appeared in succession differently educated and endowed their philosophic tendencies were different bacon held fast to induction believing firmly in the existence of an external world and making collected experiences the basis of all knowledge the mathematical studies of descartes gave him a bias towards deduction and his fundamental principle was much the same as that of protagoras who made the individual man the measure of all things i think therefore i am said descartes only his own identity was sure to him and the full development of this system would have led to an idealism in which the outer world would have been resolved into a mere phenomenon of consciousness gassendi one of descartess contemporaries of whom we shall hear more presently quickly pointed out that the fact of personal existence would be proved as well by reference to any other act as to the act of thinking i eat therefore i am or i love therefore i am would be quite as conclusive lichtenberg indeed showed that the very thing to be proved was inevitably postulated in the first two words i think and it is plain that no inference from the postulate could by any possibility be stronger than the postulate itself but descartes deviated strangely from the idealism implied in his fundamental principle he was the first to reduce in a manner eminently capable of bearing the test of mental presentation vital phenomena to purely mechanical principles through fear or love descartes was a good churchman he accordingly rejected the notion of an atom because it was absurd to suppose that god if he so pleased could not divide an atom he puts in the placeof the atoms small round particles and light splinters out of which he builds the organism he sketches with marvellous physical insight a machine with water for its motive power which shall illustrate vital actions he has made clear to his mind that such a machine would be competent to carry on the processes of digestion nutrition growth respiration and the beating of the heart it would be competent to accept impressions from the external sense to store them up in imagination and memory to go through the internal movements of the appetites and passions and the external movements of the limbs he deduces these functions of his machine from the mere arrangements of its organs as the movement of a clock or other automaton is deduced from its weights and wheels as far as these functions are concerned he says it is not necessary to conceive any other vegetative or sensitive soul nor any other principle of motion or of life than the blood and the spirits agitated by the fire which burns continually in the heart and which is in nowise different from the fires existing in inanimate bodies had descartes been acquainted with the steamengine he would have taken it instead of a fall of water as his motive power he would have shown the perfect analogy which exists between the oxidation of the food in the body and that of the coal in the furnace he would assuredly have anticipated mayer in calling the blood which the heart diffuses the oil of the lamp of life deducing all animal motions from the combustion of this oil as the motions of a steamengine are deduced from the combustion of its coal as the matter stands however and considering the circumstances of the time the boldness clearness and precision with which descartes grasped the problem of vital dynamics constitute a marvellous illustration of intellectual power footnote see huxleys admirable essay on descartes lay sermons during the middle ages the doctrine of atoms had to all appearance vanished from discussion it probably held its ground among soberminded and thoughtful men though neither the church nor the world was prepared to hear of it with tolerance once in the year 1348 it received distinct expression but retractation by compulsion immediately followed and thus discouraged it slumbered till the seventeenth century when it was revived by a contemporary and friend of hobbes of malmesbury the orthodox catholic provost of digne gassendi but before stating his relation to the epicurean doctrine it will be well to say a few words on the effect as regards science of the general introduction of monotheism among european nations were men says hume led into the apprehension of invisible intelligent power by contemplation of the works of nature they could never possibly entertain any conception but of one single being who bestowed existence and order on this vast machine and adjusted all its parts to one regular system referring to the condition of the heathen who sees a god behind every natural event thus peopling the world with thousands of beings whose caprices are incalculable lange shows the impossibility of any compromise between such notions and those of science which proceeds on the assumption of neverchanging law and causality but he continues with characteristic penetration when the great thought of one god acting as a unit upon the universe has been seized the connection of things in accordance with the law of cause and effect is not only thinkable but it is a necessary consequence of the assumption for when i see ten thousand wheels in motion and know or believe that they are all driven by one motive power then i know that i have before me a mechanism the action of every part of which is determined by the plan of the whole so much being assumed it follows that i may investigate the structure of that machine and the various motions of its parts for the time being therefore this conception renders scientific action free in other words were a capricious god at the circumference of every wheel and at the end of every lever the action of the machine would be incalculable by the methods of science but the actions of all its parts being rigidly determined by their connections and relations and these being brought into play by a single motive power then though this last prime mover may elude me i am still able to comprehend the machinery which it sets in motion we have here a conception of the relation of nature to its author which seems perfectly acceptable to some minds but perfectly intolerable to others newton and boyle lived and worked happily under the influence of this conception goethe rejected it with vehemence and the same repugnance to accepting it is manifest in carlyle footnote boyles model of the universe was the strasburg clock with an outside artificer goethe on the other hand sang ihm ziemts die welt im innern zu bewegen natur in sich sich in natur zu hegen see also carlyle past and present chap v the analytic and synthetic tendencies of the human mind are traceable throughout history great writers ranging themselves sometimes on the one side sometimes on the other men of warm feelings and minds open to the elevating impressions produced by nature as a whole whose satisfaction therefore is rather ethical than logical lean to the synthetic side while the analytic harmonises best with the more precise and more mechanical bias which seeks the satisfaction of the understanding some form of pantheism was usually adopted by the one while a detached creator working more or less after the manner of men was often assumed by the other gassendi as sketched by lange is hardly to be ranked with either having formally acknowledged god as the great first cause he immediately dropped the idea applied the known laws of mechanics to the atoms and deduced from them all vital phenomena he defended epicurus and dwelt upon his purity both of doctrine and of life true he was a heathen but so was aristotle epicurus assailed superstition and religion and rightly because he did not know the true religion he thought that the gods neither rewarded nor punished and he adored them purely in consequence of their completeness here we see says gassendi the reverence of the child instead of the fear of the slave the errors of epicurus shall be corrected and the body of his truth retained gassendi then proceeds as any heathen might have done to build up the world and all that therein is of atoms and molecules god who created earth and water plants and animals produced in the first place a definite number of atoms which constituted the seed of all things then began that series of combinations and decompositions which now goes on and which will continue in future the principle of every change resides in matter in artificial productions the moving principle is different from the material worked upon but in nature the agent works within being the most active and mobile part of the material itself thus this bold ecclesiastic without incurring the censure of the church or the world contrives to outstrip mr darwin the same cast of mind which caused him to detach the creator from his universe led him also to detach the soul from the body though to the body he ascribes an influence so large as to render the soul almost unnecessary the aberrations of reason were in his view an affair of the material brain mental disease is brain disease but then the immortal reason sits apart and cannot be touched by the disease the errors of madness are those of the instrument not of the performer it may be more than a mere result of education connecting itself probably with the deeper mental structure of the two men that the idea of gassendi above enunciated is substantially the same as that expressed by professor clerk maxwell at the close of the very able lecture delivered by him at bradford in 1873 according to both philosophers the atoms if i understand aright are prepared materials which formed once for all by the eternal produce by their subsequent interaction all the phenomena of the material world there seems to be this difference however between gassendi and maxwell the one postulates the other infers his first cause in his manufactured articles as he calls the atoms professor maxwell finds the basis of an induction which enables him to scale philosophic heights considered inaccessible by kant and to take the logical step from the atoms to their maker accepting here the leadership of kant i doubt the legitimacy of maxwells logic but it is impossible not to feel the ethic glow with which his lecture concludes there is moreover a very noble strain of eloquence in his description of the steadfastness of the atoms natural causes as we know are at work which tend to modify if they do not at length destroy all the arrangements and dimensions of the earth and the whole solar system but though in the course of ages catastrophes have occurred and may yet occur in the heavens though ancient systems may be dissolved and new systems evolved out of their ruins the molecules out of which these systems are builtthe foundation stones of the material universeremain unbroken and unworn the atomic doctrine in whole or in part was entertained by bacon descartes hobbes locke newton boyle and their successors until the chemical law of multiple proportions enabled dalton to confer upon it an entirely new significance in our day there are secessions from the theory but it still stands firm loschmidt stoney and sir william thomson have sought to determine the sizes of the atoms or rather to fix the limits between which their sizes lie while the discourses of williamson and maxwell delivered in bradford in 1873 illustrate the present hold of the doctrine upon the foremost scientific minds in fact it may be doubted whether wanting this fundamental conception a theory of the material universe is capable of scientific statement 5 ninety years subsequent to gassendi the doctrine of bodily instruments as it may be called assumed immense importance in the hands of bishop butler who in his famous analogy of religion developed from his own point of view and with consummate sagacity a similar idea the bishop still influences many superior minds and it will repay us to dwell for a moment on his views he draws the sharpest distinction between our real selves and our bodily instruments he does not as far as i remember use the word soul possibly because the term was so hackneyed in his day as it had been for many generations previously but he speaks of living powers perceiving or percipient powers moving agents ourselves in the same sense as we should employ the term soul he dwells upon the fact that limbs may be removed and mortal diseases assail the body the mind almost up to the moment of death remaining clear he refers to sleep and to swoon where the living powers are suspended but not destroyed he considers it quite as easy to conceive of existence out of our bodies as in them that we may animate a succession of bodies the dissolution of all of them having no more tendency to dissolve our real selves or deprive us of living facultiesthe faculties of perception and actionthan the dissolution of any foreign matter which we are capable of receiving impressions from or making use of for the common occasions of life this is the key of the bishops position our organised bodies are no more a part of ourselves than any other matter around us in proof of this he calls attention to the use of glasses which prepare objects for the percipient power exactly as the eye does the eye itself is no more percipient than the glass is quite as much the instrument of the true self and also as foreign to the true self as the glass is and if we see with our eyes only in the same manner as we do with glasses the like may justly be concluded from analogy of all our senses lucretius as you are aware reached a precisely opposite conclusion and it certainly would be interesting if not profitable to us all to hear what he would or could urge in opposition to the reasoning of the bishop as a brief discussion of the point will enable us to see the bearings of an important question i will here permit a disciple of lucretius to try the strength of the bishops position and then allow the bishop to retaliate with the view of rolling back if he can the difficulty upon lucretius the argument might proceed in this fashion subjected to the test of mental presentation vorstellung your views most honoured prelate would offer to many minds a great if not an insuperable difficulty you speak of living powers percipient or perceiving powers and ourselves but can you form a mental picture of any of these apart from the organism through which it is supposed to act test yourself honestly and see whether you possess any faculty that would enable you to form such a conception the true self has a local habitation in each of us thus localised must it not possess a form if so what form have you ever for a moment realised it when a leg is amputated the body is divided into two parts is the true self in both of them or in one thomas aquinas might say in both but not you for you appeal to the consciousness associated with one of the two parts to prove that the other is foreign matter is consciousness then a necessary element of the true self if so what do you say to the case of the whole body being deprived of consciousness if not then on what grounds do you deny any portion of the true self to the severed limb it seems very singular that from the beginning to the end of your admirable book and no one admires its sober strength more than i do you never once mention the brain or nervous system you begin at one end of the body and show that its parts may be removed without prejudice to the perceiving power what if you begin at the other end and remove instead of the leg the brain the body as before is divided into two parts but both are now in the same predicament and neither can be appealed to to prove that the other is foreign matter or instead of going so far as to remove the brain itself let a certain portion of its bony covering be removed and let a rhythmic series of pressures and relaxations of pressure be applied to the soft substance at every pressure the faculties of perception and of action vanish at every relaxation of pressure they are restored where during the intervals of pressure is the perceiving power i once had the discharge of a large leyden battery passed unexpectedly through me i felt nothing but was simply blotted out of conscious existence for a sensible interval where was my true self during that interval men who have recovered from lightningstroke have been much longer in the same state and indeed in cases of ordinary concussion of the brain days may elapse during which no experience is registered in consciousness where is the man himself during the period of insensibility you may say that i beg the question when i assume the man to have been unconscious that he was really conscious all the time and has simply forgotten what had occurred to him in reply to this i can only say that no one need shrink from the worst tortures that superstition ever invented if only so felt and so remembered i do not think your theory of instruments goes at all to the bottom of the matter a telegraphoperator has his instruments by means of which he converses with the world our bodies possess a nervous system which plays a similar part between the perceiving power and external things cut the wires of the operator break his battery demagnetise his needle by this means you certainly sever his connection with the world but inasmuch as these are real instruments their destruction does not touch the man who uses them the operator survives and he knows that he survives what is there i would ask in the human system that answers to this conscious survival of the operator when the battery of the brain is so disturbed as to produce insensibility or when it is destroyed altogether another consideration which you may regard as slight presses upon me with some force the brain may change from health to disease and through such a change the most exemplary man may be converted into a debauchee or a murderer my very noble and approved good master had as you know threatenings of lewdness introduced into his brain by his jealous wifes philter and sooner than permit himself to run even the risk of yielding to these base promptings he slew himself how could the hand of lucretius have been thus turned against himself if the real lucretius remained as before can the brain or can it not act in this distempered way without the intervention of the immortal reason if it can then it is a prime mover which requires only healthy regulation to render it reasonably selfacting and there is no apparent need of your immortal reason at all if it cannot then the immortal reason by its mischievous activity in operating upon a broken instrument must have the credit of committing every imaginable extravagance and crime i think if you will allow me to say so that the gravest consequences are likely to flow from your estimate of the body to regard the brain as you would a staff or an eyeglassto shut your eyes to all its mystery to the perfect correlation of its condition and our consciousness to the fact that a slight excess or defect of blood in it produces the very swoon to which you refer and that in relation to it our meat and drink and air and exercise have a perfectly transcendental value and significanceto forget all this does i think open a way to innumerable errors in our habits of life and may possibly in some cases initiate and foster that very disease and consequent mental ruin which a wiser appreciation of this mysterious organ would have avoided i can imagine the bishop thoughtful after hearing this argument he was not the man to allow anger to mingle with the consideration of a point of this kind after due reflection and having strengthened himself by that honest contemplation of the facts which was habitual with him and which includes the desire to give even adverse reasonings their due weight i can suppose the bishop to proceed thus you will remember that in the analogy of religion of which you have so kindly spoken i did not profess to prove anything absolutely and that i over and over again acknowledged and insisted on the smallness of our knowledge or rather the depth of our ignorance as regards the whole system of the universe my object was to show my deistical friends who set forth so eloquently the beauty and beneficence of nature and the ruler thereof while they had nothing but scorn for the socalled absurdities of the christian scheme that they were in no better condition than we were and that for every difficulty found upon our side quite as great a difficulty was to be found upon theirs i will now with your permission adopt a similar line of argument you are a lucretian and from the combination and separation of insensate atoms deduce all terrestrial things including organic forms and their phenomena let me tell you in the first instance how far i am prepared to go with you i admit that you can build crystalline forms out of this play of molecular force that the diamond amethyst and snowstar are truly wonderful structures which are thus produced i will go farther and acknowledge that even a tree or flower might in this way be organised nay if you can show me an animal without sensation i will concede to you that it also might be put together by the suitable play of molecular force thus far our way is clear but now comes my difficulty your atoms are individually without sensation much more are they without intelligence may i ask you then to try your hand upon this problem take your dead hydrogen atoms your dead oxygen atoms your dead carbon atoms your dead nitrogen atoms your dead phosphorus atoms and all the other atoms dead as grains of shot of which the brain is formed imagine them separate and sensationless observe them running together and forming all imaginable combinations this as a purely mechanical process is seeable by the mind but can you see or dream or in any way imagine how out of that mechanical act and from these individually dead atoms sensation thought and emotion are to rise are you likely to extract homer out of the rattling of dice or the differential calculus out of the clash of billiardballs i am not all bereft of this vorstellungskraft of which you speak nor am i like so many of my brethren a mere vacuum as regards scientific knowledge i can follow a particle of musk until it reaches the olfactory nerve i can follow the waves of sound until their tremors reach the water of the labyrinth and set the otoliths and cortis fibres in motion i can also visualise the waves of aether as they cross the eye and hit the retina nay more i am able to pursue to the central organ the motion thus imparted at the periphery and to see in idea the very molecules of the brain thrown into tremors my insight is not baffled by these physical processes what baffles and bewilders me is the notion that from those physical tremors things so utterly incongruous with them as sensation thought and emotion can be derived you may say or think that this issue of consciousness from the clash of atoms is not more incongruous than the flash of light from the union of oxygen and hydrogen but i beg to say that it is for such incongruity as the flash possesses is that which i now force upon your attention the flash is an affair of consciousness the objective counterpart of which is a vibration it is a flash only by your interpretation you are the cause of the apparent incongruity and you are the thing that puzzles me i need not remind you that the great leibnitz felt the difficulty which i feel and that to get rid of this monstrous deduction of life from death he displaced your atoms by his monads which were more or less perfect mirrors of the universe and out of the summation and integration of which he supposed all the phenomena of lifesentient intellectual and emotionalto arise your difficulty then as i see you are ready to admit is quite as great as mine you cannot satisfy the human understanding in its demand for logical continuity between molecular processes and the phenomena of consciousness this is a rock on which materialism must inevitably split whenever it pretends to be a complete philosophy of life what is the moral my lucretian you and i are not likely to indulge in illtemper in the discussion of these great topics where we see so much room for honest differences of opinion but there are people of less wit or more bigotry i say it with humility on both sides who are ever ready to mingle anger and vituperation with such discussions there are for example writers of note and influence at the present day who are not ashamed publicly to assume the deep personal sin of a great logician to be the cause of his unbelief in a theologic dogma footnote this is the aspect under which the late editor of the dublin review presented to his readers the memory of john stuart mill i can only say that i would as soon take my chance in the other world in the company of the unbeliever as in that of his jesuit detractor in dr ward we have an example of a wholesome and vigorous nature soured and perverted by a poisonous creed and there are others who hold that we who cherish our noble bible wrought as it has been into the constitution of our forefathers and by inheritance into us must necessarily be hypocritical and insincere let us disavow and discountenance such people cherishing the unswerving faith that what is good and true in both our arguments will be preserved for the benefit of humanity while all that is bad or false will disappear i hold the bishops reasoning to be unanswerable and his liberality to be worthy of imitation it is worth remarking that in one respect the bishop was a product of his age long previous to his day the nature of the soul had been so favourite and general a topic of discussion that when the students of the italian universities wished to know the leanings of a new professor they at once requested him to lecture upon the soul about the time of bishop butler the question was not only agitated but extended it was seen by the clearwitted men who entered this arena that many of their best arguments applied equally to brutes and men the bishops arguments were of this character he saw it admitted it took the consequence and boldly embraced the whole animal world in his scheme of immortality 6 bishop butler accepted with unwavering trust the chronology of the old testament describing it as confirmed by the natural and civil history of the world collected from common historians from the state of the earth and from the late inventions of arts and sciences these words mark progress and they must seem somewhat hoary to the bishops successors of today it is hardly necessary to inform you that since his time the domain of the naturalist has been immensely extendedthe whole science of geology with its astounding revelations regarding the life of the ancient earth having been created the rigidity of old conceptions has been relaxed the public mind being rendered gradually tolerant of the idea that not for six thousand nor for sixty thousand nor for six thousand thousand but for aeons embracing untold millions of years this earth has been the theatre of life and death the riddle of the rocks has been read by the geologist and palaeontologist from subcambrian depths to the deposits thickening over the seabottoms of today and upon the leaves of that stone book are as you know stamped the characters plainer and surer than those formed by the ink of history which carry the mind back into abysses of past time compared with which the periods which satisfied bishop butler cease to have a visual angle the lode of discovery once struck those petrified forms in which life was at one time active increased to multitudes and demanded classification they were grouped in genera species and varieties according to the degree of similarity subsisting between them thus confusion was avoided each object being found in the pigeonhole appropriated to it and to its fellows of similar morphological or physiological character the general fact soon became evident that none but the simplest forms of life lie lowest down that as we climb higher among the superimposed strata more perfect forms appear the change however from form to form was not continuous but by stepssome small some great a section says mr huxley a hundred feet thick will exhibit at different heights a dozen species of ammonite none of which passes beyond the particular zone of limestone or clay into the zone below it or into that above it in the presence of such facts it was not possible to avoid the question have these forms showing though in broken stages and with many irregularities this unmistakable general advance being subjected to no continuous law of growth or variation had our education been purely scientific or had it been sufficiently detached from influences which however ennobling in another domain have always proved hindrances and delusions when introduced as factors into the domain of physics the scientific mind never could have swerved from the search for a law of growth or allowed itself to accept the anthropomorphism which regarded each successive stratum as a kind of mechanics bench for the manufacture of new species out of all relation to the old biassed however by their previous education the great majority of naturalists invoked a special creative act to account for the appearance of each new group of organisms doubtless numbers of them were clearheaded enough to see that this was no explanation at allthat in point of fact it was an attempt by the introduction of a greater difficulty to account for a less but having nothing to offer in the way of explanation they for the most part held their peace still the thoughts of reflecting men naturally and necessarily simmered round the question de maillet a contemporary of newton has been brought into notice by professor huxley as one who had a notion of the modifiability of living forms the late sir benjamin brodie a man of highly philosophic mind often drew my attention to the fact that as early as 1794 charles darwins grandfather was the pioneer of charles darwin footnote zoonomia vol i pp500510 in 1801 and in subsequent years the celebrated lamarck who through the vigorous exposition of his views by the author of the vestiges of creation rendered the public mind perfectly familiar with the idea of evolution endeavoured to show the development of species out of changes of habit and external condition in 1813 dr wells the founder of our present theory of dew read before the royal society a paper in which to use the words of mr darwin he distinctly recognises the principle of natural selection and this is the first recognition that has been indicated the thoroughness and skill with which wells pursued his work and the obvious independence of his character rendered him long ago a favourite with me and it gave me the liveliest pleasure to alight upon this additional testimony to his penetration professor grant mr patrick matthew von buch the author of the vestiges dhalloy and others by the enunciation of opinions more or less clear and correct showed that the question had been fermenting long prior to the year 1858 when mr darwin and mr wallace simultaneously but independently placed their closely concurrent views before the linnean society footnote in 1855 mr herbert spencer principles of psychology 2nd edit vol i p 465 expressed the belief that life under all its forms has arisen by an unbroken evolution and through the instrumentality of what are called natural causes this was my belief also at that time these papers were followed in 1859 by the publication of the first edition of the origin of species all great things come slowly to the birth copernicus as i informed you pondered his great work for thirtythree years newton for nearly twenty years kept the idea of gravitation before his mind for twenty years also he dwelt upon his discovery of fluxions and doubtless would have continued to make it the object of his private thought had he not found leibnitz upon his track darwin for twoandtwenty years pondered the problem of the origin of species and doubtless he would have continued to do so had he not found wallace upon his track footnote the behaviour of mr wallace in relation to this subject has been dignified in the highest degree a concentrated but full and powerful epitome of his labours was the consequence the book was by no means an easy one and probably not one in every score of those who then attacked it had read its pages through or were competent to grasp their significance if they had i do not say this merely to discredit them for there were in those days some really eminent scientific men entirely raised above the heat of popular prejudice and willing to accept any conclusion that science had to offer provided it was duly backed by fact and argument who entirely mistook mr darwins views in fact the work needed an expounder and it found one in mr huxley i know nothing more admirable in the way of scientific exposition than those early articles of his on the origin of species he swept the curve of discussion through the really significant points of the subject enriched his exposition with profound original remarks and reflections often summing up in a single pithy sentence an argument which a less compact mind would have spread over pages but there is one impression made by the book itself which no exposition of it however luminous can convey and that is the impression of the vast amount of labour both of observation and of thought implied in its production let us glance at its principles it is conceded on all hands that what are called varieties are continually produced the rule is probably without exception no chick or child is in all respects and particulars the counterpart of its brother and sister and in such differences we have variety incipient no naturalist could tell how far this variation could be carried but the great mass of them held that never by any amount of internal or external change nor by the mixture of both could the offspring of the same progenitor so far deviate from each other as to constitute different species the function of the experimental philosopher is to combine the conditions of nature and to produce her results and this was the method of darwin footnote the first step only towards experimental demonstration has been taken experiments now begun might a couple of centuries hence furnish data of incalculable value which ought to be supplied to the science of the future he made himself acquainted with what could without any manner of doubt be done in the way of producing variation he associated himself with pigeonfanciersbought begged kept and observed every breed that he could obtain though derived from a common stock the diversities of these pigeons were such that a score of them might be chosen which if shown to an ornithologist and he were told that they were wild birds would certainly be ranked by him as welldefined species the simple principle which guides the pigeonfancier as it does the cattlebreeder is the selection of some variety that strikes his fancy and the propagation of this variety by inheritance with his eye still directed to the particular appearance which he wishes to exaggerate he selects it as it reappears in successive broods and thus adds increment to increment until an astonishing amount of divergence from the parent type is effected the breeder in this case does not produce the elements of the variation he simply observes them and by selection adds them together until the required result has been obtained no man says mr darwin would ever try to make a fantail till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner or a pouter until he saw a pigeon with a crop of unusual size thus nature gives the hint man acts upon it and by the law of inheritance exaggerates the deviation having thus satisfied himself by indubitable facts that the organisation of an animal or of a plant for precisely the same treatment applies to plants is to some extent plastic he passes from variation under domestication to variation under nature hitherto we have dealt with the adding together of small changes by the conscious selection of man can nature thus select mr darwins answer is assuredly she can the number of living things produced is far in excess of the number that can be supported hence at some period or other of their lives there must be a struggle for existence and what is the infallible result if one organism were a perfect copy of the other in regard to strength skill and agility external conditions would decide but this is not the case here we have the fact of variety offering itself to nature as in the former instance it offered itself to man and those varieties which are least competent to cope with surrounding conditions will infallibly give way to those that are most competent to use a familiar proverb the weakest goes to the wall but the triumphant fraction again breeds to overproduction transmitting the qualities which secured its maintenance but transmitting them in different degrees the struggle for food again supervenes and those to whom the favourable quality has been transmitted in excess will triumph as before it is easy to see that we have here the addition of increments favourable to the individual still more rigorously carried out than in the case of domestication for not only are unfavourable specimens not selected by nature but they are destroyed this is what mr darwin calls natural selection which acts by the preservation and accumulation of small inherited modifications each profitable to the preserved being with this idea he interpenetrates and leavens the vast store of facts that he and others have collected we cannot without shutting our eyes through fear or prejudice fail to see that darwin is here dealing not with imaginary but with true causes nor can we fail to discern what vast modifications may be produced by natural selection in periods sufficiently long each individual increment may resemble what mathematicians call a differential a quantity indefinitely small but definite and great changes may obviously be produced by the integration of these infinitesimal quantities through practically infinite time if darwin like bruno rejects the notion of creative power acting after human fashion it certainly is not because he is unacquainted with the numberless exquisite adaptations on which this notion of a supernatural artificer has been founded his book is a repository of the most startling facts of this description take the marvellous observation which he cites from dr krueger where a bucket with an aperture serving as a spout is formed in an orchid bees visit the flower in eager search of material for their combs they push each other into the bucket the drenched ones escaping from their involuntary bath by the spout here they rub their backs against the viscid stigma of the flower and obtain glue then against the pollen masses which are thus stuck to the back of the bee and carried away when the bee so provided flies to another flower or to the same flower a second time and is pushed by its comrades into the bucket and then crawls out by the passage the pollenmass upon its back necessarily comes first into contact with the viscid stigma which takes up the pollen and this is how that orchid is fertilised or take this other case of the catasetum bees visit these flowers in order to gnaw the labellum in doing this they inevitably touch a long tapering sensitive projection this when touched transmits a sensation or vibration to a certain membrane which is instantly ruptured setting free a spring by which the pollenmass is shot forth like an arrow in the right direction and adheres by its viscid extremity to the back of the bee in this way the fertilising pollen is spread abroad it is the mind thus stored with the choicest materials of the teleologist that rejects teleology seeking to refer these wonders to natural causes they illustrate according to him the method of nature not the technic of a manlike artificer the beauty of flowers is due to natural selection those that distinguish themselves by vividly contrasting colours from the surrounding green leaves are most readily seen most frequently visited by insects most often fertilised and hence most favoured by natural selection coloured berries also readily attract the attention of birds and beasts which feed upon them spread their manured seeds abroad thus giving trees and shrubs possessing such berries a greater chance in the struggle for existence with profound analytic and synthetic skill mr darwin investigates the cellmaking instinct of the hivebee his method of dealing with it is representative he falls back from the more perfectly to the less perfectly developed instinctfrom the hivebee to the humble bee which uses its own cocoon as a comb and to classes of bees of intermediate skill endeavouring to show how the passage might be gradually made from the lowest to the highest the saving of wax is the most important point in the economy of bees twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are said to be needed for the secretion of a single pound of wax the quantities of nectar necessary for the wax must therefore be vast and every improvement of constructive instinct which results in the saving of wax is a direct profit to the insects life the time that would otherwise be devoted to the making of wax is devoted to the gathering and storing of honey for winter food mr darwin passes from the humble bee with its rude cells through the melipona with its more artistic cells to the hivebee with its astonishing architecture the bees place themselves at equal distances apart upon the wax sweep and excavate equal spheres round the selected points the spheres intersect and the planes of intersection are built up with thin laminae hexagonal cells are thus formed this mode of treating such questions is as i have said representative the expositor habitually retires from the more perfect and complex to the less perfect and simple and carries you with him through stages of perfectingadds increment to increment of infinitesimal change and in this way gradually breaks down your reluctance to admit that the exquisite climax of the whole could be a result of natural selection mr darwin shirks no difficulty and saturated as the subject was with his own thought he must have known better than his critics the weakness as well as the strength of his theory this of course would be of little avail were his object a temporary dialectic victory instead of the establishment of a truth which he means to be everlasting but he takes no pains to disguise the weakness he has discerned nay he takes every pains to bring it into the strongest light his vast resources enable him to cope with objections started by himself and others so as to leave the final impression upon the readers mind that if they be not completely answered they certainly are not fatal their negative force being thus destroyed you are free to be influenced by the vast positive mass of evidence he is able to bring before you this largeness of knowledge and readiness of resource render mr darwin the most terrible of antagonists accomplished naturalists have levelled heavy and sustained criticisms against himnot always with the view of fairly weighing his theory but with the express intention of exposing its weak points only this does not irritate him he treats every objection with a soberness and thoroughness which even bishop butler might be proud to imitate surrounding each fact with its appropriate detail placing it in its proper relations and usually giving it a significance which as long as it was kept isolated failed to appear this is done without a trace of illtemper he moves over the subject with the passionless strength of a glacier and the grinding of the rocks is not always without a counterpart in the logical pulverisation of the objector but though in handling this mighty theme all passion has been stilled there is an emotion of the intellect incident to the discernment of new truth which often colours and warms the pages of mr darwin his success has been great and this implies not only the solidity of his work but the preparedness of the public mind for such a revelation on this head a remark of agassiz impressed me more than anything else sprung from a race of theologians this celebrated man combated to the last the theory of natural selection one of the many times i had the pleasure of meeting him in the united states was at mr winthrops beautiful residence at brookline near boston rising from luncheon we all halted as if by common consent in front of a window and continued there a discussion which had been started at table the maple was in its autumn glory and the exquisite beauty of the scene outside seemed in my case to interpenetrate without disturbance the intellectual action earnestly almost sadly agassiz turned and said to the gentlemen standing round i confess that i was not prepared to see this theory received as it has been by the best intellects of our time its success is greater than i could have thought possible 7 in our day grand generalisations have been reached the theory of the origin of species is but one of them another of still wider grasp and more radical significance is the doctrine of the conservation of energy the ultimate philosophical issues of which are as yet but dimly seenthat doctrine which binds nature fast in fate to an extent not hitherto recognised exacting from every antecedent its equivalent consequent from every consequent its equivalent antecedent and bringing vital as well as physical phenomena under the dominion of that law of causal connection which so far as the human understanding has yet pierced asserts itself everywhere in nature long in advance of all definite experiment upon the subject the constancy and indestructibility of matter had been affirmed and all subsequent experience justified the affirmation mayer extended the attribute of indestructibility to energy applying it in the first instance to inorganic and afterwards with profound insight to organic nature footnote dr berthold has shown that leibnitz had sound views regarding the conservation of energy in inorganic nature the vegetable world though drawing all its nutriment from invisible sources was proved incompetent to generate anew either matter or force its matter is for the most part transmuted gas its force transformed solar force the animal world was proved to be equally uncreative all its motive energies being referred to the combustion of its food the activity of each animal as a whole was proved to be the transferred activity of its molecules the muscles were shown to be stores of mechanical energy potential until unlocked by the nerves and then resulting in muscular contractions the speed at which messages fly to and fro along the nerves was determined by helmholtz and found to be not as had been previously supposed equal to that of light or electricity but less than the speed of soundless even than that of an eagle this was the work of the physicist then came the conquests of the comparative anatomist and physiologist revealing the structure of every animal and the function of every organ in the whole biological series from the lowest zoophyte up to man the nervous system had been made the object of profound and continued study the wonderful and at bottom entirely mysterious controlling power which it exercises over the whole organism physical and mental being recognised more and more thought could not be kept back from a subject so profoundly suggestive besides the physical life dealt with by mr darwin there is a psychical life presenting similar gradations and asking equally for a solution how are the different grades and orders of mind to be accounted for what is the principle of growth of that mysterious power which on our planet culminates in reason these are questions which though not thrusting themselves so forcibly upon the attention of the general public had not only occupied many reflecting minds but had been formally broached by one of them before the origin of species appeared with the mass of materials furnished by the physicist and physiologist in his hands mr herbert spencer twenty years ago sought to graft upon this basis a system of psychology and two years ago a second and greatly amplified edition of his work appeared those who have occupied themselves with the beautiful experiments of plateau will remember that when two spherules of oliveoil suspended in a mixture of alcohol and water of the same density as the oil are brought together they do not immediately unite something like a pellicle appears to be formed around the drops the rupture of which is immediately followed by the coalescence of the globules into one there are organisms whose vital actions are almost as purely physical as the coalescence of such drops of oil they come into contact and fuse themselves thus together from such organisms to others a shade higher from these to others a shade higher still and on through an everascending series mr spencer conducts his argument there are two obvious factors to be here taken into accountthe creature and the medium in which it lives or as it is often expressed the organism and its environment mr spencers fundamental principle is that between these two factors there is incessant interaction the organism is played upon by the environment and is modified to meet the requirements of the environment life he defines to be a continuous adjustment of internal relations to external relations in the lowest organisms we have a kind of tactual sense diffused over the entire body then through impressions from without and their corresponding adjustments special portions of the surface become more responsive to stimuli than others the senses are nascent the basis of all of them being that simple tactual sense which the sage democritus recognised 2300 years ago as their common progenitor the action of light in the first instance appears to be a mere disturbance of the chemical processes in the animal organism similar to that which occurs in the leaves of plants by degrees the action becomes localised in a few pigmentcells more sensitive to light than the surrounding tissue the eye is incipient at first it is merely capable of revealing differences of light and shade produced by bodies close at hand followed as the interception of the light commonly is by the contact of the closely adjacent opaque body sight in this condition becomes a kind of anticipatory touch the adjustment continues a slight bulging out of the epidermis over the pigmentgranules supervenes a lens is incipient and through the operation of infinite adjustments at length reaches the perfection that it displays in the hawk and eagle so of the other senses they are special differentiations of a tissue which was originally vaguely sensitive all over with the development of the senses the adjustments between the organism and its environment gradually extend in space a multiplication of experiences and a corresponding modification of conduct being the result the adjustments also extend in time covering continually greater intervals along with this extension in space and time the adjustments also increase in speciality and complexity passing through the various grades of brute life and prolonging themselves into the domain of reason very striking are mr spencers remarks regarding the influence of the sense of touch upon the development of intelligence this is so to say the mothertongue of all the senses into which they must be translated to be of service to the organism hence its importance the parrot is the most intelligent of birds and its tactual power is also greatest from this sense it gets knowledge unattainable by birds which cannot employ their feet as hands the elephant is the most sagacious of quadrupedsits tactual range and skill and the consequent multiplication of experiences which it owes to its wonderfully adaptable trunk being the basis of its sagacity feline animals for a similar cause are more sagacious than hoofed animalsatonement being to some extent made in the case of the horse by the possession of sensitive prehensile lips in the primates the evolution of intellect and the evolution of tactual appendages go hand in hand in the most intelligent anthropoid apes we find the tactual range and delicacy greatly augmented new avenues of knowledge being thus opened to the animal alan crowns the edifice here not only in virtue of his own manipulatory power but through the enormous extension of his range of experience by the invention of instruments of precision which serve as supplemental senses and supplemental limbs the reciprocal action of these is finely described and illustrated that chastened intellectual emotion to which i have referred in connection with mr darwin is not absent in mr spencer his illustrations possess at times exceeding vividness and force and from his style on such occasions it is to be inferred that the ganglia of this apostle of the understanding are sometimes the seat of a nascent poetic thrill it is a fact of supreme importance that actions the performance of which at first requires even painful effort and deliberation may by habit be rendered automatic witness the slow learning of its letters by a child and the subsequent facility of reading in a man when each group of letters which forms a word is instantly and without effort fused to a single perception instance the billiardplayer whose muscles of hand and eye when he reaches the perfection of his art are unconsciously coordinated instance the musician who by practice is enabled to fuse a multitude of arrangements auditory tactual and muscular into a process of automatic manipulation combining such facts with the doctrine of hereditary transmission we reach a theory of instinct a chick after coming out of the egg balances itself correctly runs about picks up food thus snowing that it possesses a power of directing its movements to definite ends how did the chick learn this very complex coordination of eyes muscles and beak it has not been individually taught its personal experience is nit but it has the benefit of ancestral experience in its inherited organisation are registered the powers which it displays at birth so also as regards the instinct of the hivebee already referred to the distance at which the insects stand apart when they sweep their hemispheres and build their cells is organically remembered man also carries with him the physical texture of his ancestry as well as the inherited intellect bound up with it the defects of intelligence during infancy and youth are probably less due to a lack of individual experience than to the fact that in early life the cerebral organisation is still incomplete the period necessary for completion varies with the race and with the individual as a round shot outstrips the rifled bolt on quitting the muzzle of the gun so the lower race in childhood may outstrip the higher but the higher eventually overtakes the lower and surpasses it in range as regards individuals we do not always find the precocity of youth prolonged to mental power in maturity while the dulness of boyhood is sometimes strikingly contrasted with the intellectual energy of after years newton when a boy was weakly and he showed no particular aptitude at school but in his eighteenth year he went to cambridge and soon afterwards astonished his teachers by his power of dealing with geometrical problems during his quiet youth his brain was slowly preparing itself to be the organ of those energies which he subsequently displayed by myriad blows to use a lucretian phrase the image and superscription of the external world are stamped as states of consciousness upon the organism the depth of the impression depending on the number of the blows when two or more phenomena occur in the environment invariably together they are stamped to the same depth or to the same relief and indissolubly connected and here we come to the threshold of a great question seeing that he could in no way rid himself of the consciousness of space and time kant assumed them to be necessary forms of intuition the moulds and shapes into which our intuitions are thrown belonging to ourselves and without objective existence with unexpected power and success mr spencer brings the hereditary experience theory as he holds it to bear upon this question if there exist certain external relations which are experienced by all organisms at all instants of their waking livesrelations which are absolutely constant and universalthere will be established answering internal relations that are absolutely constant and universal such relations we have in those of space and time as the substratum of all other relations of the nonego they must be responded to by conceptions that are the substrata of all other relations in the ego being the constant and infinitely repeated elements of thought they must become the automatic elements of thoughtthe elements of thought which it is impossible to get rid ofthe forms of intuition throughout this application and extension of hartleys and mills law of inseparable association mr spencer stands upon his own ground invoking instead of the experiences of the individual the registered experiences of the race his overthrow of the restriction of experience to the individual is i think complete that restriction ignores the power of organising experience furnished at the outset to each individual it ignores the different degrees of this power possessed by different races and by different individuals of the same race were there not in the human brain a potency antecedent to all experience a dog or a cat ought to be as capable of education as man these predetermined internal relations are independent of the experiences of the individual the human brain is the organised register of infinitely numerous experiences received during the evolution of life or rather during the evolution of that series of organisms through which the human organism has been reached the effects of the most uniform and frequent of these experiences have been successively bequeathed principal and interest and have slowly mounted to that high intelligence which lies latent in the brain of the infant thus it happens that the european inherits from twenty to thirty cubic inches more of brain than the papuan thus it happens that faculties as of music which scarcely exist in some inferior races become congenital in superior ones thus it happens that out of savages unable to count up to the number of their fingers and speaking a language containing only nouns and verbs arise at length our newtons and shakspeares 8 at the outset of this address it was stated that physical theories which lie beyond experience are derived by a process of abstraction from experience it is instructive to note from this point of view the successive introduction of new conceptions the idea of the attraction of gravitation was preceded by the observation of the attraction of iron by a magnet and of light bodies by rubbed amber the polarity of magnetism and electricity also appealed to the senses it thus became the substratum of the conception that atoms and molecules are endowed with attractive and repellent poles by the play of which definite forms of crystalline architecture are produced thus molecular force becomes structural footnote see art on matter and force or lectures on light no iii it required no great boldness of thought to extend its play into organic nature and to recognise in molecular force the agency by which both plants and animals are built up in this way out of experience arise conceptions which are wholly ultraexperiential none of the atomists of antiquity had any notion of this play of molecular polar force but they had experience of gravity as manifested by falling bodies abstracting from this they permitted their atoms to fall eternally through empty space democritus assumed that the larger atoms moved more rapidly than the smaller ones which they therefore could overtake and with which they could combine epicurus holding that empty space could offer no resistance to motion ascribed to all the atoms the same velocity but he seems to have overlooked the consequence that under such circumstances the atoms could never combine lucretius cut the knot by quitting the domain of physics altogether and causing the atoms to move together by a kind of volition was the instinct utterly at fault which caused lucretius thus to swerve from his own principles diminishing gradually the number of progenitors mr darwin comes at length to one primordial form but he does not say so far as i remember how he supposes this form to have been introduced he quotes with satisfaction the words of a celebrated author and divine who had i gradually learnt to see that it was just as noble a conception of the deity to believe he created a few original forms capable of selfdevelopment into other and needful forms as to believe he required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of his laws what mr darwin thinks of this view of the introduction of life i do not know but the anthropomorphism which it seemed his object to set aside is as firmly associated with the creation of a few forms as with the creation of a multitude we need clearness and thoroughness here two courses and two only are possible either let us open our doors freely to the conception of creative acts or abandoning them let us radically change our notions of matter if we look at matter as pictured by democritus and as defined for generations in our scientific textbooks the notion of conscious life coming out of it cannot be formed by the mind the argument placed in the mouth of bishop butler suffices in my opinion to crush all such materialism as this those however who framed these definitions of matter were but partial students they were not biologists but mathematicians whose labours referred only to such accidents and properties of matter as could be expressed in their formulae their science was mechanical science not the science of life with matter in its wholeness they never dealt and denuded by their imperfect definitions the gentle mother of all became the object of her childrens dread let us reverently but honestly look the question in the face divorced from matter where is life whatever our faith may say our knowledge shows them to be indissolubly joined every meal we eat and every cup we drink illustrates the mysterious control of mind by matter on tracing the line of life backwards we see it approaching more and more to what we call the purely physical condition we come at length to those organisms which i have compared to drops of oil suspended in a mixture of alcohol and water we reach the protogenes of haeckel in which we have a type distinguishable from a fragment of albumen only by its finely granular character can we pause here we break a magnet and find two poles in each of its fragments we continue the process of breaking but however small the parts each carries with it though enfeebled the polarity of the whole and when we can break no longer we prolong the intellectual vision to the polar molecules are we not urged to do something similar in the case of life is there not a temptation to close to some extent with lucretius when he affirms that nature is seen to do all things spontaneously of herself without the meddling of the gods or with bruno when he declares that matter is not that mere empty capacity which philosophers have pictured her to be but the universal mother who brings forth all things as the fruit of her own womb believing as i do in the continuity of nature i cannot stop abruptly where our microscopes cease to be of use here the vision of the mind authoritatively supplements the vision of the eye by a necessity engendered and justified by science i cross the boundary of the experimental evidence footnote this mode of procedure was not invented in belfast and discern in that matter which we in our ignorance of its latent powers and notwithstanding our professed reverence for its creator have hitherto covered with opprobrium the promise and potency of all terrestrial life if you ask me whether there exists the least evidence to prove that any form of life can be developed out of matter without demonstrable antecedent life my reply is that evidence considered perfectly conclusive by many has been adduced and that were some of us who have pondered this question to follow a very common example and accept testimony because it falls in with our belief we also should eagerly close with the evidence referred to but there is in the true man of science a desire stronger than the wish to have his beliefs upheld namely the desire to have them true and this stronger wish causes him to reject the most plausible support if he has reason to suspect that it is vitiated by error those to whom i refer as having studied this question believing the evidence offered in favour of spontaneous generation to be thus vitiated cannot accept it they know full well that the chemist now prepares from inorganic matter a vast array of substances which were some time ago regarded as the sole products of vitality they are intimately acquainted with the structural power of matter as evidenced in the phenomena of crystallisation they can justify scientifically their belief in its potency under the proper conditions to produce organisms but in reply to your question they will frankly admit their inability to point to any satisfactory experimental proof that life can be developed save from demonstrable antecedent life as already indicated they draw the line from the highest organisms through lower ones down to the lowest and it is the prolongation of this line by the intellect beyond the range of the senses that leads them to the conclusion which bruno so boldly enunciated footnote bruno was a pantheist not an atheist or a materialist the materialism here professed may be vastly different from what you suppose and i therefore crave your gracious patience to the end the question of an external world says j s mill is the great battleground of metaphysics footnote examination of hamilton p 154 mr mill himself reduces external phenomena to possibilities of sensation kant as we have seen made time and space forms of our own intuitions fichte having first by the inexorable logic of his understanding proved himself to be a mere link in that chain of eternal causation which holds so rigidly in nature violently broke the chain by making nature and all that it inherits an apparition of the mind footnote bestimmung des menschen and it is by no means easy to combat such notions for when i say i see you and that there is not the least doubt about it the obvious reply is that what i am really conscious of is an affection of my own retina and if i urge that my sight can be checked by touching you the retort would be that i am equally transgressing the limits of fact for what i am really conscious of is not that you are there but that the nerves of my hand have undergone a change all we hear and see and touch and taste and smell are it would be urged mere variations of our own condition beyond which even to the extent of a hairs breadth we cannot go that anything answering to our impressions exists outside of ourselves is not a fact but an inference to which all validity would be denied by an idealist like berkeley or by a sceptic like hume mr spencer takes another line with him as with the uneducated man there is no doubt or question as to the existence of an external world but he differs from the uneducated who think that the world really is what consciousness represents it to be our states of consciousness are mere symbols of an outside entity which produces them and determines the order of their succession but the real nature of which we can never know footnote in a paper at once popular and profound entitled recent progress in the theory of vision contained in the volume of lectures by helmholtz published by longmans this symbolism of our states of consciousness is also dwelt upon the impressions of sense are the mere signs of external things in this paper helmholtz contends strongly against the view that the consciousness of space is inborn and he evidently doubts the power of the chick to pick up grains of corn without preliminary lessons on this point he says further experiments are needed such experiments have been since made by mr spalding aided i believe in some of his observations by the accomplished and deeply lamented lady amberly and they seem to prove conclusively that the chick does not need a single moments tuition to enable it to stand run govern the muscles of its eyes and peck helmholtz however is contending against the notion of preestablished harmony and i am not aware of his views as to the organisation of experiences of race or breed in fact the whole process of evolution is the manifestation of a power absolutely inscrutable to the intellect of man as little in our day as in the days of job can man by searching find this power out considered fundamentally then it is by the operation of an insoluble mystery that life on earth is evolved species differentiated and mind unfolded from their prepotent elements in the immeasurable past the strength of the doctrine of evolution consists not in an experimental demonstration for the subject is hardly accessible to this mode of proof but in its general harmony with scientific thought from contrast moreover it derives enormous relative cogency on the one side we have a theory if it could with any propriety be so called derived as were the theories referred to at the beginning of this address not from the study of nature but from the observation of mena theory which converts the power whose garment is seen in the visible universe into an artificer fashioned after the human model and acting by broken efforts as man is seen to act on the other side we have the conception that all we see around us and all we feel within usthe phenomena physical nature as well as those of the human mindhave their unsearchable roots in a cosmical life if i dare apply the term an infinitesimal span of which is offered to the investigation of man and even this span is only knowable in part we can trace the development of a nervous system and correlate with it the parallel phenomena of sensation and thought we see with undoubting certainty that they go hand in hand but we try to soar in a vacuum the moment we seek to comprehend the connection between them an archimedean fulcrum is here required which the human mind cannot command and the effort to solve the problemto borrow a comparison from an illustrious friend of mineis like that of a man trying to lift himself by his own waistband all that has been said in this discourse is to be taken in connection with this fundamental truth when nascent senses are spoken of when the differentiation of a tissue at first vaguely sensitive all over is spoken of and when these possessions and processes are associated with the modification of an organism by its environment the same parallelism without contact or even approach to contact is implied man the object is separated by an impassable gulf from man the subject there is no motor energy in the human intellect to carry it without logical rupture from the one to the other 9 the doctrine of evolution derives man in his totality from the interaction of organism and environment through countless ages past the human understanding for examplethat faculty which mr spencer has turned so skilfully round upon its own antecedentsis itself a result of the play between organism and environment through cosmic ranges of time never surely did prescription plead so irresistible a claim but then it comes to pass that over and above his understanding there are many other things appertaining to man whose prescriptive rights are quite as strong as those of the understanding itself it is a result for example of the play of organism and environment that sugar is sweet and that aloes are bitter that the smell of henbane differs from the perfume of a rose such facts of consciousness for which by the way no adequate reason has ever been rendered are quite as old as the understanding and many other things can boast an equally ancient origin mr spencer at one place refers to that most powerful of passionsthe amatory passionas one which when it first occurs is antecedent to all relative experience whatever and we may press its claim as being at least as ancient and as valid as that of the understanding itself then there are such things woven into the texture of man as the feeling of awe reverence wonderand not alone the sexual love just referred to but the love of the beautiful physical and moral in nature poetry and art there is also that deepset feeling which since the earliest dawn of history and probably for ages prior to all history incorporated itself in the religious of the world you who have escaped from these religions into the highanddry light of the intellect may deride them but in so doing you deride accidents of form merely and fail to touch the immovable basis of the religious sentiment in the nature of man to yield this sentiment reasonable satisfaction is the problem of problems at the present hour and grotesque in relation to scientific culture as many of the religions of the world have been and aredangerous nay destructive to the dearest privileges of freemen as some of them undoubtedly have been and would if they could be againit will be wise to recognise them as the forms of a force mischievous if permitted to intrude on the region of objective knowledge over which it holds no command but capable of adding in the region of poetry and emotion inward completeness and dignity to man feeling i say again dates from as old an origin and as high a source as intelligence and it equally demands its range of play the wise teacher of humanity will recognise the necessity of meeting this demand rather than of resisting it on account of errors and absurdities of form what we should resist at all hazards is the attempt made in the past and now repeated to found upon this elemental bias of mans nature a system which should exercise despotic sway over his intellect i have no fear of such a consummation science has already to some extent leavened the world it will leaven it more and more i should look upon the mild light of science breaking in upon the minds of the youth of ireland and strengthening gradually to the perfect day as a surer check to any intellectual or spiritual tyranny which may threaten this island than the laws of princes or the swords of emperors we fought and won our battle even in the middle ages should we doubt the issue of another conflict with our broken foe the impregnable position of science may be described in a few words we claim and we shall wrest from theology the entire domain of cosmological theory all schemes and systems which thus infringe upon the domain of science must in so far as they do this submit to its control and relinquish all thought of controlling it acting otherwise proved always disastrous in the past and it is simply fatuous today every system which would escape the fate of an organism too rigid to adjust itself to its environment must be plastic to the extent that the growth of knowledge demands when this truth has been thoroughly taken in rigidity will be relaxed exclusiveness diminished things now deemed essential will be dropped and elements now rejected will be assimilated the lifting of the life is the essential point and as long as dogmatism fanaticism and intolerance are kept out various modes of leverage may be employed to raise life to a higher level science itself not unfrequently derives motive power from an ultrascientific source some of its greatest discoveries have been made under the stimulus of a nonscientific ideal this was the case among the ancients and it has been so amongst ourselves mayer joule and colding whose names are associated with the greatest of modern generalisations were thus influenced with his usual insight lange at one place remarks that it is not always the objectively correct and intelligible that helps man most or leads most quickly to the fullest and truest knowledge as the sliding body upon the brachystochrone reaches its end sooner than by the straighter road of the inclined plane so through the swing of the ideal we often arrive at the naked truth more rapidly than by the processes of the understanding whewell speaks of enthusiasm of temper as a hindrance to science but he means the enthusiasm of weak heads there is a strong and resolute enthusiasm in which science finds an ally and it is to the lowering of this fire rather than to the diminution of intellectual insight that the lessening productiveness of men of science in their mature years is to be ascribed mr buckle sought to detach intellectual achievement from moral force he gravely erred for without moral force to whip it into action the achievement of the intellect would be poor indeed it has been said by its opponents that science divorces itself from literature but the statement like so many others arises from lack of knowledge a glance at the less technical writings of its leadersof its helmholtz its huxley and its du boisreymondwould show what breadth of literary culture they command where among modern writers can you find their superiors in clearness and vigour of literary style science desires not isolation but freely combines with every effort towards the bettering of mans estate singlehanded and supported not by outward sympathy but by inward force it has built at least one great wing of the manymansioned home which man in his totality demands and if rough walls and protruding rafterends indicate that on one side the edifice is still incomplete it is only by wise combination of the parts required with those already irrevocably built that we can hope for completeness there is no necessary incongruity between what has been accomplished and what remains to be done the moral glow of socrates which we all feel by ignition has in it nothing incompatible with the physics of anaxagoras which he so much scorned but which he would hardly scorn today and here i am reminded of one among us hoary but still strong whose prophetvoice some thirty years ago far more than any other of this age unlocked whatever of life and nobleness lay latent in its most gifted mindsone fit to stand beside socrates or the maccabean eleazar and to dare and suffer all that they suffered and daredfit as he once said of fichte ito have been the teacher of the stoa and to have discoursed of beauty and virtue in the groves of academe with a capacity to grasp physical principles which his friend goethe did not possess and which even total lack of exercise has not been able to reduce to atrophy it is the worlds loss that he in the vigour of his years did not open his mind and sympathies to science and make its conclusions a portion of his message to mankind marvellously endowed as he wasequally equipped on the side of the heart and of the understandinghe might have done much towards teaching us how to reconcile the claims of both and to enable them in coming times to dwell together in unity of spirit and in the bond of peace and now the end is come with more time or greater strength and knowledge what has been here said might have been better said while worthy matters here omitted might have received fit expression but there would have been no material deviation from the views set forth as regards myself they are not the growth of a day and as regards you i thought you ought to know the environment which with or without your consent is rapidly surrounding you and in relation to which some adjustment on your part may be necessary a hint of hamlets however teaches us how the troubles of common life may be ended and it is perfectly possible for you and me to purchase intellectual peace at the price of intellectual death the world is not without refuges of this description nor is it wanting in persons who seek their shelter and try to persuade others to do the same the unstable and the weak have yielded and will yield to this persuasion and they to whom repose is sweeter than the truth but i would exhort you to refuse the offered shelter and to scorn the base reposeto accept if the choice be forced upon you commotion before stagnation the breezy leap of the torrent before the foetid stillness of the swamp in the course of this address i have touched on debatable questions and led you over what will be deemed dangerous groundand this partly with the view of telling you that as regards these questions science claims unrestricted right of search it is not to the point to say that the views of lucretius and bruno of darwin and spencer may be wrong here i should agree with you deeming it indeed certain that these views will undergo modification but the point is that whether right or wrong we claim the right to discuss them for science however no exclusive claim is here made you are not urged to erect it into an idol the inexorable advance of mans understanding in the path of knowledge and those unquenchable claims of his moral and emotional nature which the understanding can never satisfy are here equally set forth the world embraces not only a newton but a shakspearenot only a boyle but a raphaelnot only a kant but a beethovennot only a darwin but a carlyle not in each of these but in all is human nature whole they are not opposed but supplementarynot mutually exclusive but reconcilable and if unsatisfied with them all the human mind with the yearning of a pilgrim for his distant home will still turn to the mystery from which it has emerged seeking so to fashion it as to give unity to thought and faith so long as this is done not only without intolerance or bigotry of any kind but with the enlightened recognition that ultimate fixity of conception is here unattainable and that each succeeding age must be held free to fashion the mystery in accordance with its own needsthen casting aside all the restrictions of materialism i would affirm this to be a field for the noblest exercise of what in contrast with the knowing faculties may be called the creative faculties of man here however i touch a theme too great for me to handle but which will assuredly be handled by the loftiest minds when you and i like streaks of morning cloud shall have melted into the infinite azure of the past x apology for the belfast address 1874 the world has been frequently informed of late that i have raised up against myself a host of enemies and considering with few exceptions the deliverances of the press and more particularly of the religious press i am forced to admit that the statement is only too true i derive some comfort nevertheless from the reflection of diogenes transmitted to us by plutarch that he who would be saved must have good friends or violent enemies and that he is best off who possesses both this best condition i have reason to believe is mine reflecting on the fraction i have read of recent remonstrances appeals menaces and judgmentscovering not only the world that now is but that which is to comei have noticed with mournful interest how trivially men seem to be influenced by what they call their religion and how potently by that nature which it is the alleged province of religion to eradicate or subdue from fair and manly argument from the tenderest and holiest sympathy on the part of those who desire my eternal good i pass by many gradations through deliberate unfairness to a spirit of bitterness which desires with a fervour inexpressible in words my eternal ill now were religion the potent factor we might expect a homogeneous utterance from those professing a common creed while if human nature be the really potent factor we may expect utterances as heterogeneous as the characters of men as a matter of fact we have the latter suggesting to my mind that the common religion professed and defended by these different people is merely the accidental conduit through which they pour their own tempers lofty or low courteous or vulgar mild or ferocious as the case may be pure abuse however as serving no good end i have wherever possible deliberately avoided reading wishing indeed to keep not only hatred malice and uncharitableness but even every trace of irritation far away from my side of a discussion which demands not only goodtemper but largeness clearness and manysidedness of mind if it is to guide us to even provisional solutions it has been stated with many variations of note and comment that in the address as subsequently published by messrs longman i have retracted opinions uttered at belfast a roman catholic writer is specially strong upon this point startled by the deep chorus of dissent which my dazzling fallacies have evoked i am now trying to retreat this he will by no means tolerate it is too late now to seek to hide from the eyes of mankind one foul blot one ghastly deformity professor tyndall has himself told us how and where this address of his was composed it was written among the glaciers and the solitudes of the swiss mountains it was no hasty hurried crude production its every sentence bore marks of thought and care my critic intends to be severe he is simply just in the solitudes to which he refers i worked with deliberation endeavouring even to purify my intellect by disciplines similar to those enjoined by his own church for the sanctification of the soul i tried moreover in my ponderings to realise not only the lawful but the expedient and to permit no fear to act upon my mind save that of uttering a single word on which i could not take my stand either in this or in any other world still my time was so brief the difficulties arising from my isolated position were so numerous and my thought and expression so slow that in a literary point of view i halted not only behind the ideal but behind the possible hence after the delivery of the address i went over it with the desire not to revoke its principles but to improve it verbally and above all to remove any word which might give colour to the notion of crudeness hurry or haste in connection with the charge of atheism my critic refers to the preface to the second issue of the belfast address christian men i there say are proved by their writings to have their hours of weakness and of doubt as well as their hours of strength and of conviction and men like myself share in their own way these variations of mood and tense were the religious moods of many of my assailants the only alternative ones i do not know how strong the claims of the doctrine of material atheism upon my allegiance might be probably they would be very strong but as it is i have noticed during years of selfobservation that it is not in hours of clearness and vigour that this doctrine commends itself to my mind that in the presence of stronger and healthier thought it ever dissolves and disappears as offering no solution of the mystery in which we dwell and of which we form a part with reference to this honest and reasonable utterance my censor exclaims this is a most remarkable passage much as we dislike seasoning polemics with strong words we assert that this apology only tends to affix with links of steel to the name of professor tyndall the dread imputation against which be struggles here we have a very fair example of subjective religious vigour but my quarrel with such exhibitions is that they do not always represent objective fact no atheistic reasoning can i hold dislodge religion from the human heart logic cannot deprive us of life and religion is life to the religious as an experience of consciousness it is beyond the assaults of logic but the religious life is often projected in external formsi use the word in its widest senseand this embodiment of the religious sentiment will have to bear more and more as the world become more enlightened the stress of scientific tests we must be careful of projecting into external nature that which belongs to ourselves my critic commits this mistake he feels and takes delight in feeling that i am struggling and he obviously experiences the most exquisite pleasures of the muscular sense in holding me down his feelings are as real as if his imagination of what mine are were equally real his picture of my struggles is however a mere delusion i do not struggle i do not fear the charge of atheism nor should i even disavow it in reference to any definition of the supreme which he or his order would be likely to frame his links and his steel and his dread imputations are therefore even more unsubstantial than my streaks of morning cloud and they may be permitted to vanish together these minor and more purely personal matters at an end the weightier allegation remains that at belfast i misused my position by quitting the domain of science and making an unjustifiable raid into the domain of theology this i fail to see laying aside abuse i hope my accusers will consent to reason with me is it not lawful for a scientific man to speculate on the antecedents of the solar system did kant laplace and william herschel quit their legitimate spheres when they prolonged the intellectual vision beyond the boundary of experience and propounded the nebular theory accepting that theory as probable is it not permitted to a scientific man to follow up in idea the series of changes associated with the condensation of the nebulae to picture the successive detachment of planets and moons and the relation of all of them to the sun if i look upon our earth with its orbital revolution and axial rotation as one small issue of the process which made the solar system what it is will any theologian deny my right to entertain and express this theoretic view time was when a multitude of theologians would have been found to do sowhen that archenemy of science which now vaunts its tolerance would have made a speedy end of the man who might venture to publish any opinion of the kind but that time unless the world is caught strangely slumbering is for ever past as regards inorganic nature then we may traverse without let or hindrance the whole distance which separates the nebulae from the worlds of today but only a few years ago this now conceded ground of science was theological ground i could by no means regard this as the final and sufficient concession of theology and at belfast i thought it not only my right but my duty to state that as regards the organic world we must enjoy the freedom which we have already won in regard to the inorganic i could not discern the shred of a titledeed which gave any man or any class of men the right to open the door of one of these worlds to the scientific searcher and to close the other against him and i considered it frankest wisest and in the long run most conducive to permanent peace to indicate without evasion or reserve the ground that belongs to science and to which she will assuredly make good her claim i have been reminded that an eminent predecessor of mine in the presidential chair expressed a totally different view of the cause of things from that enunciated by me in doing so he transgressed the bounds of science at least as much as i did but nobody raised an outcry against him the freedom he took i claim and looking at what i must regard as the extravagances of the religious world at the very inadequate and foolish notions concerning this universe which are entertained by the majority of our authorised religious teachers at the waste of energy on the part of good men over things unworthy if i may say it without discourtesy of the attention of enlightened heathens the fight about the fripperies of ritualism and the verbal quibbles of the athanasian creed the forcing on the public view of pontigny pilgrimages the dating of historic epochs from the definition of the immaculate conception the proclamation of the divine glories of the sacred heartstanding in the midst of these chimeras which astound all thinking men it did not appear to me extravagant to claim the public tolerance for an hour and a half for the statement of more reasonable viewsviews more in accordance with the verities which science has brought to light and which many weary souls would i thought welcome with gratification and relief but to come to closer quarters the expression to which the most violent exception has been taken is this abandoning all disguise the confession i feel bound to make before you is that i prolong the vision backward across the boundary of the experimental evidence and discern in that matter which we in our ignorance and notwithstanding our professed reverence for its creator have hitherto covered with opprobrium the promise and potency of every form and quality of life to call it a chorus of dissent as my catholic critic does is a mild way of describing the storm of opprobrium with which this statement has been assailed but the first blast of passion being past i hope i may again ask my opponents to consent to reason first of all i am blamed for crossing the boundary of the experimental evidence this i reply is the habitual action of the scientific mindat least of that portion of it which applies itself to physical investigation our theories of light heat magnetism and electricity all imply the crossing of this boundary my paper on the scientific use of the imagination and my lectures on light illustrate this point in the amplest manner and in the article entitled matter and force in the present volume i have sought incidentally to make clear that in physics the experiential incessantly leads to the ultraexperiential that out of experience there always grows something finer than mere experience and that in their different powers of ideal extension consists for the most part the difference between the great and the mediocre investigator the kingdom of science then cometh not by observation and experiment alone but is completed by fixing the roots of observation and experiment in a region inaccessible to both and in dealing with which we are forced to fall back upon the picturing power of the mind passing the boundary of experience therefore does not in the abstract constitute a sufficient ground for censure there must have been something in my particular mode of crossing it which provoked this tremendous chorus of dissent let us calmly reason the point out i hold the nebular theory as it was held by kant laplace and william herschel and as it is held by the best scientific intellects of today according to it our sun and planets were once diffused through space as an impalpable haze out of which by condensation came the solar system what caused the haze to condense loss of heat what rounded the sun and planets that which rounds a tearmolecular force for aeons the immensity of which overwhelms mans conceptions the earth was unfit to maintain what we call life it is now covered with visible living things they are not formed of matter different from that of the earth around them they are on the contrary bone of its bone and flesh of its flesh how were they introduced was life implicated in the nebulaas part it may be of a vaster and wholly unfathomable life or is it the work of a being standing outside the nebula who fashioned it and vitalised it but whose own origin and ways are equally past finding out as far as the eye of science has hitherto ranged through nature no intrusion of purely creative power into any series of phenomena has ever been observed the assumption of such a power to account for special phenomena though often made has always proved a failure it is opposed to the very spirit of science and i therefore assumed the responsibility of holding up in contrast with it that method of nature which it has been the vocation and triumph of science to disclose and in the application of which we can alone hope for further light holding then that the nebulae and the solar system life included stand to each other in the relation of the germ to the finished organism i reaffirm here not arrogantly or defiantly but without a shade of indistinctness the position laid down at belfast not with the vagueness belonging to the emotions but with the definiteness belonging to the understanding the scientific man has to put to himself these questions regarding the introduction of life upon the earth he will be the last to dogmatise upon the subject for he knows best that certainty is here for the present unattainable his refusal of the creative hypothesis is less an assertion of knowledge than a protest against the assumption of knowledge which must long if not for ever lie beyond us and the claim to which is the source of perpetual confusion upon earth with a mind open to conviction he asks his opponents to show him an authority for the belief they so strenuously and so fiercely uphold they can do no more than point to the book of genesis or some other portion of the bible profoundly interesting and indeed pathetic to me are those attempts of the opening mind of man to appease its hunger for a cause but the book of genesis has no voice in scientific questions to the grasp of geology which it resisted for a time it at length yielded like potters clay its authority as a system of cosmogony being discredited on all hands by the abandonment of the obvious meaning of its writer it is a poem not a scientific treatise in the former aspect it is for ever beautiful in the latter aspect it has been and it will continue to be purely obstructive and hurtful to knowledge its value has been negative leading in rougher ages than ours to physical and even in our own free age to moral violence no incident connected with the proceedings at belfast is more instructive than the deportment of the catholic hierarchy of ireland a body usually too wise to confer notoriety upon an adversary by imprudently denouncing him the times to which i owe a great deal on the score of fair play where so much has been unfair thinks that the irish cardinal archbishops and bishops in a recent manifesto adroitly employed a weapon which i at an unlucky moment placed in their hands the antecedents of their action cause me to regard it in a different light and a brief reference to these antecedents will i think illuminate not only their proceedings regarding belfast but other doings which have been recently noised abroad before me lies a document bearing the date of november 1873 which after appearing for a moment unaccountably vanished from public view it is a memorial addressed by seventy of the students and exstudents of the catholic university in ireland to the episcopal board of the university and it constitutes the plainest and bravest remonstrance ever addressed by irish laymen to their spiritual pastors and masters it expresses the profoundest dissatisfaction with the curriculum marked out for the students of the university setting forth the extraordinary fact that the lecturelist for the faculty of science published a month before they wrote did not contain the name of a single professor of the physical or natural sciences the memorialists forcibly deprecate this and dwell upon the necessity of education in science the distinguishing mark of this age is its ardour for science the natural sciences have within the last fifty years become the chiefest study in the world they are in our time pursued with an activity unparalleled in the history of mankind scarce a year now passes without some discovery being made in these sciences which as with the touch of the magicians wand shivers to atoms theories formerly deemed unassailable it is through the physical and natural sciences that the fiercest assaults are now made on our religion no more deadly weapon is used against our faith than the facts incontestably proved by modern researches in science such statements must be the reverse of comfortable to a number of gentlemen who trained in the philosophy of thomas aquinas have been accustomed to the unquestioning submission of all other sciences to their divine science of theology but this is not all one thing seems certain say the memorialists viz that if chairs for the physical and natural sciences be not soon founded in the catholic university very many young men will have their faith exposed to dangers which the creation of a school of science in the university would defend them from for our generation of irish catholics are writhing under the sense of their inferiority in science and are determined that such inferiority shall not long continue and so if scientific training be unattainable at our university they will seek it at trinity or at the queens colleges in not one of which is there a catholic professor of science those who imagined the catholic university at kensington to be due to the spontaneous recognition on the part of the roman hierarchy of the intellectual needs of the age will derive enlightenment from this and still more from what follows for the most formidable threat remains to the picture of catholic students seceding to trinity and the queens colleges the memorialists add this darkest stroke of all they will in the solitude of their own homes unaided by any guiding advice devour the works of haeckel darwin huxley tyndall and lyell works innocuous if studied under a professor who would point out the difference between established facts and erroneous inferences but which are calculated to sap the faith of a solitary student deprived of a discriminating judgment to which he could refer for a solution of his difficulties in the light of the knowledge given by this courageous memorial and of similar knowledge otherwise derived the recent catholic manifesto did not at all strike me as a chuckle over the mistake of a maladroit adversary but rather as an evidence of profound uneasiness on the part of the cardinal the archbishops and the bishops who signed it they acted towards the students memorial however with their accustomed practical wisdom as one concession to the spirit which it embodied the catholic university at kensington was brought forth apparently as the effect of spontaneous inward force and not of outward pressure becoming too formidable to be successfully opposed the memorialists point with bitterness to the fact that the name of no irish catholic is known in connection with the physical and natural sciences but this they ought to know is the complaint of free and cultivated minds wherever a priesthood exercises dominant power precisely the same complaint has been made with respect to the catholics of germany the great national literature and the scientific achievements of that country in modern times are almost wholly the work of protestants a vanishingly small fraction of it only is derived from members of the roman church although the number of these in germany is at least as great as that of the protestants the question arises says a writer in an able german periodical what is the cause of a phenomenon so humiliating to the catholics it cannot be referred to want of natural endowment due to climate for the protestants of southern germany have contributed powerfully to the creations of the german intellect but purely to outward circumstances and these are readily discovered in the pressure exercised for centuries by the jesuitical system which has crushed out of catholics every tendency to free mental productiveness it is indeed in catholic countries that the weight of ultramontanism has been most severely felt it is in such countries that the very finest spirits who have dared without quitting their faith to plead for freedom or reform have suffered extinction the extinction however was more apparent than real and hermes hirscher and gunther though individually broken and subdued prepared the way in bavaria for the persecuted but unflinching frohschammer for doellinger and for the remarkable liberal movement of which doellinger is the head and guide though moulded for centuries to an obedience unparalleled in any other country except spain the irish intellect is beginning to show signs of independence demanding a diet more suited to its years than the pabulum of the middle ages as for the recent manifesto in which pope cardinal archbishops and bishops are united in one grand anathema its character and fate are shadowed forth by the vision of nebuchadnezzar recorded in the book of daniel it resembles the image whose form was terrible but the gold and silver and brass and iron of which rested upon feet of clay and a stone smote the feet of clay and the iron and the brass and the silver and the gold were broken in pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors and the wind carried them away monsignor capel has recently been good enough to proclaim at once the friendliness of his church towards true science and her right to determine what true science is let us dwell for a moment on the proofs of her scientific competence when halleys comet appeared in 1456 it was regarded as the harbinger of gods vengeance the dispenser of war pestilence and famine and by order of the pope the church bells of europe were rung to scare the monster away an additional daily prayer was added to the supplications of the faithful the comet in due time disappeared and the faithful were comforted by the assurance that as in previous instances relating to eclipses droughts and rains so also as regards this nefarious comet victory had been vouchsafed to the church both pythagoras and copernicus had taught the heliocentric doctrinethat the earth revolves round the sun in the exercise of her right to determine what true science is the church in the pontificate of paul v stepped in and by the mouth of the holy congregation of the index delivered on march 5 1616 the following decree and whereas it hath also come to the knowledge of the said holy congregation that the false pythagorean doctrine of the mobility of the earth and the immobility of the sun entirely opposed to holy writ which is taught by nicolas copernicus is now published abroad and received by many in order that this opinion may not further spread to the damage of catholic truth it is ordered that this and all other books teaching the like doctrine be suspended and by this decree they are all respectively suspended forbidden and condemned but why go back to 1456 and 1616 far be it from me to charge bygone sins upon monsignor capel were it not for the practices he upholds today the most applauded dogmatist and champion of the jesuits is i am informed perrone no less than thirty editions of a work of his have been scattered abroad for the healing of the nations his notions of physical astronomy are virtually those of 1456 he teaches boldly that god does not rule by universal law that when god orders a given planet to stand still he does not detract from any law passed by himself but orders that planet to move round the sun for such and such a time then to stand still and then again to move as his pleasure may be jesuitism proscribed frohschammer for questioning its favourite dogma that every human soul was created by a direct supernatural act of god and for asserting that man body and soul came from his parents this is the system that now strives for universal power it is from it as monsignor capel graciously informs us that we are to learn what is allowable in science and what is not in the face of such facts which might be multiplied at will it requires extraordinary bravery of mind or a reliance upon public ignorance almost as extraordinary to make the claims made by monsignor capel for his church before me is a very remarkable letter addressed in 1875 by the bishop of montpellier to the deans and professors of faculties of montpellier in which the writer very clearly lays down the claims of his church he had been startled by an incident occurring in a course of lectures on physiology given by a professor of whose scientific capacity there was no doubt but who it was alleged rightly or wrongly had made his course the vehicle of materialism je ne me suis point donne says the bishop la mission que je remplis au milieu de vous personne au temoignage de saint paul ne sattribue soimme un pareil honneur il y faut tre appel de dieu comme aaron et pourquoi en estil ainsi cest parse que selon le mme aptre noun devons titre les ambassadeurs de dieu et it nest pas dans les usages pas plus quil nest dans

on ne la rejette pas courageusement avant de paraitre devant dieu entraine avec soi la perte certaine de la grce et de lternit the bishop recalls those whom he addresses from the false philosophy of the present to the philosophy of the past and foresees the triumph of the latter avant que le dixneuvime sicle sachve la vieille philosophie scolastique aura repris sa place dans la juste admiration du monde il lui faudra pourtant bien du temps pour gurir les maux de tout genre causs par son indigne rivale et pendant de longues annes encore ce nom de philosophie le plus grand de la langue humaine

lower to the higher the continued effort of animated nature is to improve its condition and raise itself to a loftier level in man improvement and amelioration depend largely upon the growth of conscious knowledge by which the errors of ignorance are continually moulted and truth is organised it is the advance of knowledge that has given a materialistic colour to the philosophy of this age materialism is therefore not a thing to be mourned over but to be honestly consideredaccepted if it be wholly true rejected if it be wholly false wisely sifted and turned to account if it embrace a mixture of truth and error of late years the study of the nervous system and its relation to thought and feeling have profoundly occupied enquiring minds it is our duty not to shirkit ought rather to be our privilege to acceptthe established results of such enquiries for here assuredly our ultimate weal depends upon our loyalty to the truth instructed as to the control which the nervous system exercises over mans moral and intellectual nature we shall be better prepared not only to mend their manifold defects but also to strengthen and purify both is mind degraded by this recognition of its dependence assuredly not matter on the contrary is raised to the level it ought to occupy and from which timid ignorance would remove it but the light is dawning and it will become stronger as time goes on even the brighton church congress affords evidence of this from the manifold confusions of that assemblage my memory has rescued two items which it would fain preserve the recognition of a relation between health and religion and the address of the rev harry jones out of the conflict of vanities his words emerge wholesome and strong because undrugged by dogma coming directly from the warm brain of one who knows what practical truth means and who has faith in its vitality and inherent power of propagation i wonder whether he is less effectual in his ministry than his more embroidered colleagues it surely behoves our teachers to come to some definite understanding as to this question of health to see how by inattention to it we are defrauded negatively and positively negatively by the privation of that sweetness and light which is the natural concomitant of good health positively by the insertion into life of cynicism illtemper and a thousand corroding anxieties which good health would dissipate we fear and scorn materialism but he who knew all about it and could apply his knowledge might become the preacher of a new gospel not however through the ecstatic moments of the individual does such knowledge come but through the revelations of science in connection with the history of mankind why should the roman catholic church call gluttony a mortal sin why should fasting occupy a place in the disciplines of religion what is the meaning of luthers advice to the young clergyman who came to him perplexed with the difficulties of predestination and election if it be not that in virtue of its action upon the brain when wisely applied there is moral and religious virtue even in a hydrocarbon to use the old language food and drink are creatures of god and have therefore a spiritual value through our neglect of the monitions of a reasonable materialism we sin and suffer daily i might here point to the train of deadly disorders over which science has given modern society such controldisclosing the lair of the material enemy ensuring his destruction and thus preventing that moral squalor and hopelessness which habitually tread on the heels of epidemics in the case of the poor rising to higher spheres the visions of swedenborg and the ecstasy of plotinus and porphyry are phases of that psychical condition obviously connected with the nervous system and state of health on which is based the vedic doctrine of the absorption of the individual into the universal soul plotinus taught the devout how to pass into a condition of ecstasy porphyry complains of having been only once united to god in eightysix years while his master plotinus had been so united six times in sixty years footnote i recommend to the readers particular attention dr drapers important work entitled history of the conflict between religion and science messrs h s king and co a friend who knew wordsworth informs me that the poet in some of his moods was accustomed to seize hold of an external object to assure himself of his own bodily existence as states of consciousness such phenomena have an undisputed reality and a substantial identity but they are connected with the most heterogeneous objective conceptions the subjective experiences are similar because of the similarity of the underlying organisations but for those who wish to look beyond the practical facts there will always remain ample room for speculation take the argument of the lucretian introduced in the belfast address as far as i am aware not one of my assailants has attempted to answer it some of them indeed rejoice over the ability displayed by bishop butler in rolling back the difficulty on his opponent and they even imagine that it is the bishops own argument that is there employed but the raising of a new difficulty does not abolishdoes not even lessenthe old one and the argument of the lucretian remains untouched by anything the bishop has said or can say and here it may be permitted me to add a word to an important controversy now going on and which turns on the question do states of consciousness enter as links into the chain of antecedence and sequence which give rise to bodily actions and to other states of consciousness or are they merely byproducts which are not essential to the physical processes going on in the brain speaking for myself it is certain that i have no power of imagining states of consciousness interposed between the molecules of the brain and influencing the transference of motion among the molecules the thought eludes all mental presentation and hence the logic seems of iron strength which claims for the brain an automatic action uninfluenced by states of consciousness but it is i believe admitted by those who hold the automatontheory that states of consciousness are produced by the marshalling of the molecules of the brain and this production of consciousness by molecular motion is to me quite as inconceivable on mechanical principles as the production of molecular motion by consciousness if therefore i reject one result i must reject both i however reject neither and thus stand in the presence of two incomprehensibles instead of one incomprehensible while accepting fearlessly the facts of materialism dwelt upon in these pages i bow my head in the dust before that mystery of mind which has hitherto defied its own penetrative power and which may ultimately resolve itself into a demonstrable impossibility of selfpenetration but the secret is an open onethe practical monitions are plain enough which declare that on our dealings with matter depend our weal and woe physical and moral the state of mind which rebels against the recognition of the claims of materialism is not unknown to me i can remember a time when i regarded my body as a weed so much more highly did i prize the conscious strength and pleasure derived from moral and religious feelingwhich i may add was mine without the intervention of dogma the error was not an ignoble one but this did not save it from the penalty attached to error saner knowledge taught me that the body is no weed and that treated as such it would infallibly avenge itself am i personally lowered by this change of front not so give me their health and there is no spiritual experience of those earlier yearsno resolve of duty or work of mercy no work of selfrenouncement no solemnity of thought no joy in the life and aspects of naturethat would not still be mine and this without the least reference or regard to any purely personal reward or punishment looming in the future and now i have to utter a farewell free from bitterness to all my readers thanking my friends for a sympathy more steadfast i would fain believe if less noisy than the antipathy of my foes and commending to these a passage from bishop butler which they have either not read or failed to lay to heart it seems saith the bishop that men would be strangely headstrong and selfwilled and disposed to exert themselves with an impetuosity which would render society insupportable and the living in it impracticable were it not for some acquired moderation and selfgovernment some aptitude and readiness in restraining themselves and concealing their sense of things xi the rev james martineau and the belfast address footnote fortnightly review prior to the publication of the fifth edition of these fragments my attention had been directed by several estimable and indeed eminent persons to an essay by the rev james martineau as demanding serious consideration at my hands i tried to give the essay the attention claimed for it and published my views of it as an introduction to part 11 of the fragments i there referred and here again refer with pleasure to the accord subsisting between mr martineau and myself on certain points of biblical cosmogony in so far says he as church belief is still committed to a given cosmogony and natural history of man it lies open to scientific refutation and again it turns out that with the sun and moon and stars and in and on the earth before and after the appearance of our race quite other things have happened than those which the sacred cosmogony recites once more the whole history of the genesis of things religion must surrender to the sciences finally still more emphatically in the investigation of the genetic order of things theology is an intruder and must stand aside this expresses only in words of fuller pith the views which i ventured to enunciate in belfast the impregnable position of science i there say may be stated in a few words we claim and we shall wrest from theology the entire domain of cosmological theory thus theology so far as it is represented by mr martineau and science so far as i understand it are in absolute harmony here but mr martineau would have just reason to complain of me if by partial citation i left my readers under the impression that the agreement between us is complete at the opening of the eightyninth session of the manchester new college london on october 6 1874 he its principal delivered an address bearing the title religion as affected by modern materialism the references and general tone of which make evident the depth of its authors discontent with my previous deliverance at belfast i find it difficult to grapple with the exact grounds of this discontent indeed logically considered the impression left upon my mind by an essay of great aesthetic merit containing many passages of exceeding beauty and many sentiments which none but the pure in heart could utter as they are uttered here is vague and unsatisfactory the author appears at times so brave and liberal at times so timid and captious and at times if i dare say it so imperfectly informed regarding the position he assails at the outset of his address mr martineau states with some distinctness his sources of religious faith they are twothe scrutiny of nature and the interpretation of sacred books it would have been a theme worthy of his intelligence to have deduced from these two sources his religion as it stands but not another word is said about the sacred books having swept with the besom of science various books contemptuously away he does not define the sacred residue much less give us the reasons why he deems them sacred footnote mr martineaus use of the term sacred is unintentionally misleading in his later essays we are taught that he does not mean to restrict it to the bible he does not however mention the books beyond those of the bible to which he would apply the term 1879 his references to nature on the other hand are magnificent tirades against nature intended apparently to show the wholly abominable character of mans antecedents if the theory of evolution be true here also his mood lacks steadiness while joyfully accepting at one place the widening space the deepening vistas of time the detected marvels of physiological structure and the rapid fillingin of the missing links in the chain of organic life he falls at another into lamentation and mourning over the very theory which renders organic life a chain he claims the largest liberality for his sect and avows its contempt for the dangers of possible discovery but immediately afterwards he damages the claim and ruins all confidence in the avowal he professes sympathy with modern science and almost in the same breath he treats or certainly will be understood to treat the atomic theory and the doctrine of the conservation of energy as if they were a kind of scientific thimbleriggery his ardour moreover renders him inaccurate causing him to see discord between scientific men where nothing but harmony reigns in his celebrated address to the congress of german naturforscher delivered at leipzig three years ago du boisreymond speaks thus what conceivable connection subsists between definite movements of definite atoms in my brain on the one hand and on the other hand such primordial indefinable undeniable facts as these i feel pain or pleasure i experience a sweet taste or smell a rose or hear an organ or see something red it is absolutely and for ever inconceivable that a number of carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen atoms should be otherwise than indifferent as to their own position and motion past present or future it is utterly inconceivable how consciousness should result from their joint action this language which was spoken in 1872 mr martineau freely translates and quotes against me the act is due to misapprehension evidence is at hand to prove that i employed similar language twenty years ago it is to be found in the saturday review for 1860 but a sufficient illustration of the agreement between my friend du boisreymond and myself is furnished by the discourse on scientific materialism delivered in 1868 then widely circulated and reprinted here the reader who compares the two discourses will see that the same line of thought is pursued in both and that perfect agreement reigns between my friend and me in the very address he criticises mr martineau might have seen that precisely the same position is maintained a quotation will prove this thus far i say our way is clear but now comes my difficulty your atoms are individually without sensation much more are they without intelligence may i ask you then to try your hand upon this problem take your dead hydrogen atoms your dead oxygen atoms your dead carbon atoms your dead nitrogen atoms your dead phosphorus atoms and all the other atoms dead as grains of shot of which the brain is formed imagine them separate and sensationless observe them running together and forming all imaginable combinations this as a purely mechanical process is seeable by the mind but can you see or dream or in any way imagine how out of that mechanical act and from these individually dead atoms sensation thought and emotion are to rise are you likely to extract homer out of the rattling of dice or the differential calculus out of the clash of billiard balls i can follow a particle of musk until it reaches the olfactory nerve i can follow the waves of sound until their tremors reach the water of the labyrinth and set the otoliths and cortis fibres in motion i can also visualise the waves of aether as they cross the eye and hit the retina nay more i am able to pursue to the central organ the motion thus imparted at the periphery and to see in idea the very molecules of the brain thrown into tremors my insight is not baffled by these physical processes what baffles and bewilders me is the notion that from these physical tremors things so utterly incongruous with them as sensation thought and emotion can be derived it is only a complete misapprehension of our true relationship that could induce mr martineau to represent du boisreymond and myself as opposed to each other the affluence of illustration writes an able and sympathetic reviewer of this essay in the new york tribune in which mr martineau delights often impairs the distinctness of his statements by diverting the attention of the reader from the essential points of his discussion to the beauty of his imagery and thus diminishes their power of conviction to the beauties here referred to i bear willing testimony but the reviewer is strictly just in his estimate of their effect upon my critics logic the affluence of illustration and the heat and haze and haste generated by its reaction upon mr martineaus own mind often produce vagueness where precision is the one thing needfulpoetic fervour where we require judicial calm and practical unfairness where the strictest justice ought to be and i willingly believe is meant to be observed in one of his nobler passages mr martineau tells us how the pupils of his college have been educated hitherto they have been trained under the assumptions 1 that the universe which includes us and folds us round is the lifedwelling of an eternal mind 2 that the world of our abode is the scene of a moral government incipient but not complete and 3 that the upper zones of human affection above the clouds of self and passion take us into the sphere of a divine communion into this overarching scene it is that growing thought and enthusiasm have expanded to catch their light and fire alpine summits seem to kindle above us as we read these glowing words we see their beauty and feel their life at the close of one of the essays here printed footnote scientific use of the imagination i thus refer to the communion which mr martineau calls divine two things said immanuel kant fill me with awethe starry heavens and the sense of moral responsibility in man and in his hours of health and strength and sanity when the stroke of action has ceased and the pause of reflection has set in the scientific investigator finds himself overshadowed by the same awe breaking contact with the hampering details of earth it associates him with a power which gives fulness and tone to his existence but which he can neither analyse nor comprehend though knowledge is here disavowed the feelings of mr martineau and myself are i think very much alike he nevertheless censures mealmost denounces mefor referring religion to the region of emotion surely he is inconsistent here the foregoing words refer to an inward hue or temperature rather than to an external object of thought when i attempt to give the power which i see manifested in the universe an objective form personal or otherwise it slips away from me declining all intellectual manipulation i dare not save poetically use the pronoun he regarding it i dare not call it a mind i refuse to call it even a cause its mystery overshadows me but it remains a mystery while the objective frames which some of my neighbours try to make it fit seem to me to distort and desecrate it it is otherwise with mr martineau and hence his discontent he professes to know where i only claim to feel he could make his contention good against me if by a process of verification he would transform his assumptions into objective knowledge but he makes no attempt to do so they remain assumptions from the beginning of his address to its end and yet he frequently uses the word unverified as if it were fatal to the position oh which its incidence falls the scrutiny of nature is one of his sources of religious faith what logical foothold does that scrutiny furnish on which any one of the foregoing three assumptions could be planted nature according to his picturing is base and cruel what is the inference to be drawn regarding its author if nature be red in tooth and claw who is responsible on a mindless nature mr martineau pours the full torrent of his gorgeous invective but could the assumption of an eternal mindeven of a beneficent eternal mindrender the world objectively a whit less mean and ugly than it is not an iota it is mans feelings and not external phenomena that are influenced by the assumption it adds not a ray of light nor a strain of music to the objective sum of things it does not touch the phenomena of physical naturestorm flood or firenor diminish by a pang the bloody combats of the animal world but it does add the glow of religious emotion to the human soul as represented by mr martineau beyond this i defy him to go and yet he rashlyit might be said petulantlykicks away the only philosophic foundation on which it is possible for him to build his religion he twits incidentally the modern scientific interpretation of nature because of its want of cheerfulness let the new future he says preach its own gospel and devise if it can the means of making the tidings glad this is a common argument if you only knew the comfort of belief my reply is that i choose the nobler part of emerson when after various disenchantments he exclaimed i covet truth the gladness of true heroism visits the heart of him who is really competent to say this besides gladness is an emotion and mr martineau theoretically scorns the emotional i am not however acquainted with a writer who draws more largely upon this source while mistaking it for something objective to reach the cause he says there is no need to go into the past as though being missed here he could be found there but when once he has been apprehended by the proper organs of divine apprehension the whole life of humanity is recognised as the scene of his agency that mr martineau should have lived so long thought so much and failed to recognise the entirely subjective character of this creed is highly instructive his proper organs of divine apprehension given we must assume to mr martineau and his pupils but denied to many of the greatest intellects and noblest men in this and other ageslie at the very core of his emotions in fact it is when mr martineau is most purely emotional that he scorns the emotions it is when he is most purely subjective that he rejects subjectivity he pays a just and liberal tribute to the character of john stuart mill but in the light of mills philosophy benevolence honour purity having shrunk into mere unaccredited subjective susceptibilities have lost all support from omniscient approval and all presumable accordance with the reality of things if mr martineau had given them any inkling of the process by which he renders the subjective susceptibilities objective or how he arrives at an objective ground of omniscient approval gratitude from his pupils would have been his just meed but as it is he leaves them lost in an iridescent cloud of words after exciting a desire which he is incompetent to appease we are he says in another place for ever shaping our representations of invisible things into forms of definite opinion and throwing them to the front as if they were the photographic equivalent of our real faith it is a delusion which affects us all yet somehow the essence of our religion never finds its way into these frames of theory as we put them together it slips away and if we turn to pursue it still retreats behind ever ready to work with the will to unbind and sweeten the affections and bathe the life with reverence but refusing to be seen or to pass from a divine hue of thinking into a human pattern of thought this is very beautiful and mainly so because the man who utters it obviously brings it all out of the treasury of his own heart but the hue and pattern here so finely spoken of the former refusing to pass into the latter are neither more nor less than that emotion on the one hand and that objective knowledge on the other which have drawn this suicidal fire from mr martineaus battery i now come to one of the most serious portions of mr martineaus pamphletserious far less on account of its personal errors than of its intrinsic gravity though its author has thought fit to give it a witty and sarcastic tone he analyses and criticises the materialist doctrine which in our time is proclaimed with so much pomp and resisted with so much passion matter is all i want says the physicist give me its atoms alone and i will explain the universe it is thought even by mr martineaus intimate friends that in this pamphlet he is answering me i must therefore ask the reader to contrast the foregoing travesty with what i really do say regarding atoms i do not think that he the materialist is entitled to say that his molecular groupings and motions explain everything in reality they explain nothing the utmost he can affirm is the association of two classes of phenomena of whose real bond of union he is in absolute ignorance footnote address on scientific materialism this is very different from saying give me its atoms alone and i will explain the universe mr martineau continues his dialogue with the physicist good he says take as many atoms as you please see that they have all that is requisite to body a metaphysical b being homogeneous extended solids that is not enough his physicist replies it might do for democritus and the mathematicians but i must have something more the atoms must not only be in motion and of various shapes but also of as many kinds as there are chemical elements for how could i ever get water if i had only hydrogen elements to work with so be it mr martineau consents to answer only this is a considerable enlargement of your specified datum where and by whom specifiedin fact a conversion of it into several yet even at the cost of its monism put into it by mr martineau your scheme seems hardly to gain its end for by what manipulation of your resources will you for example educe consciousness this reads like pleasantry but it deals with serious things for the last seven years the question here proposed by mr martineau and my answer to it have been accessible to all the question in my words is briefly this a man can say i feel i think i love but how does consciousness infuse itself into the problem and here is my answer the passage from the physics of the brain to the corresponding facts of consciousness is unthinkable granted that a definite thought and a definite molecular action in the brain occur simultaneously we do not possess the intellectual organ nor apparently any rudiment of the organ which would enable us to pass by a process of reasoning from the one to the other they appear together but we do not know why were our minds and senses so expanded strengthened and illuminated as to enable us to see and feel the very molecules of the brain were we capable of following all their motions all their groupings all their electric discharges if such there be and were we intimately acquainted with the corresponding states of thought and feeling we should be as far as ever from the solution of the problem how are these physical processes connected with the facts of consciousness the chasm between the two classes of phenomena would still remain intellectually impassable footnote bishop butlers reply to the lucretian in the belfast address is all in the same strain compare this with the answer which mr martineau puts into the mouth of his physicist and with which i am generally credited by mr martineaus readers both in england and americait the problem of consciousness does not daunt me at all of course you understand that all along my atoms have been affected by gravitation and polarity and now i have only to insist with fechner on a difference among molecules there are the inorganic which can change only their place like the particles in an undulation and there are the organic which can change their order as in a globule that turns itself inside out with an adequate number of these our problem will be manageable likely enough we may say entirely unlikely say i seeing how careful you are to provide for all emergencies and if any hitch should occur in the next step where you will have to pass from mere sentiency to thought and will you can again look in upon your atoms and fling among them a handful of leibnitzs monads to serve as souls in little and be ready in a latent form with that vorstellungsfaehigkeit which our picturesque interpreters of nature so much prize but surely continues mr martineau you must observe that this matter of yours alters its style with every change of service starting as a beggar with scarce a rag of property to cover its bones it turns up as a prince when large undertakings are wanted we must radically change our notions of matter says professor tyndall and then he ventures to believe it will answer all demands carrying the promise and potency of all terrestrial life if the measure of the required change in our notions had been specified the proposition would have had a real meaning and been susceptible of a test it is easy travelling through the stages of such an hypothesis you deposit at your bank a round sum ere you start and drawing on it piecemeal at every pause complete your grand tour without a debt the last paragraph of this argument is forcibly and ably stated on it i am willing to try conclusions with mr martineau i may say in passing that i share his contempt for the picturesque interpretation of nature if accuracy of vision be thereby impaired but the term vorstellungsfaehigkeit as used by me means the power of definite mental presentation of attaching to words the corresponding objects of thought and of seeing these in their proper relations without the interior haze and soft penumbral borders which the theologian loves to this mode of interpreting nature i shall to the best of my ability now adhere neither of us i trust will be afraid or ashamed to begin at the alphabet of this question our first effort must be to understand each other and this mutual understanding can only be ensured by beginning low down physically speaking however we need not go below the sealevel let us then travel in company to the caribbean sea and halt upon the heated water what is that sea and what is the sun that heats it answering for myself i say that they are both matter i fill a glass with the seawater and expose it on the deck of the vessel after some time the liquid has all disappeared and left a solid residue of salt in the glass behind we have mobility invisibilityapparent annihilation in virtue of the glad and secret aid the sun unto the ocean paid the water has taken to itself wings and flown off as vapour from the whole surface of the caribbean sea such vapour is rising and now we must follow itnot upon our legs however nor in a ship nor even in a balloon but by the minds eyein other words by that power of vorstellung which mr martineau knows so well and which he so justly scorns when it indulges in loose practices compounding then the northward motion of the vapour with the earths axial rotation we track our fugitive through the higher atmospheric regions obliquely across the atlantic ocean to western europe and on to our familiar alps here another wonderful metamorphosis occurs floating on the cold calm air and in presence of the cold firmament the vapour condenses not only to particles of water but to particles of crystalline water these coalesce to stars of snow which fall upon the mountains in forms so exquisite that when first seen they never fail to excite rapture as to beauty indeed they put the work of the lapidary to shame while as to accuracy they render concrete the abstractions of the geometer are these crystals matter without presuming to dogmatise i answer for myself in the affirmative still a formative power has obviously here come into play which did not manifest itself in either the liquid or the vapour the question now is was not the power potential in both of them requiring only the proper conditions of temperature to bring it into action again i answer for myself in the affirmative i am however quite willing to discuss with mr martineau the alternative hypothesis that an imponderable formative soul unites itself with the substance after its escape from the liquid state if he should espouse this hypothesis then i should demand of him an immediate exercise of that vorstellungsfaehigkeit with which in my efforts to think clearly i can never dispense i should ask at what moment did the soul come in did it enter at once or by degrees perfect from the first or growing and perfecting itself contemporaneously with its own handiwork i should also ask whether it is localised or diffused does it move about as a lonely builder putting the bits of solid water in their places as soon as the proper temperature has set in or is it distributed through the entire mass of the crystal if the latter then the soul has the shape of the crystal but if the former then i should enquire after its shape has it legs or arms if not i would ask it to be made clear to me how a thing without these appliances can act so perfectly the part of a builder i insist on definition and ask unusual questions if haply i might thereby banish unmeaning words what were the condition and residence of the soul before it joined the crystal what becomes of it when the crystal is dissolved why should a particular temperature be needed before it can exercise its vocation finally is the problem before us in any way simplified by the assumption of its existence i think it probable that after a full discussion of the question mr martineau would agree with me in ascribing the building power displayed in the crystal to the bits of water themselves at all events i should count upon his sympathy so far as to believe that he would consider any one unmannerly who would denounce me for rejecting this notion of a separate soul and for holding the snowcrystal to be matter but then what an astonishing addition is here made to the powers of matter who would have dreamt without actually seeing its work that such a power was locked up in a drop of water all that we needed to make the action of the liquid intelligible was the assumption of mr martineaus homogeneous extended atomic solids smoothly gliding over one another but had we supposed the water to be nothing more than this we should have ignorantly defrauded it of an intrinsic architectural power which the art of man even when pushed to its utmost degree of refinement is incompetent to imitate i would invite mr martineau to consider how inappropriate his figure of a fictitious bank deposit becomes under these circumstances the account current of matter receives nothing at my hands which could be honestly kept back from it if then democritus and the mathematicians so defined matter as to exclude the powers here proved to belong to it they were clearly wrong and mr martineau instead of twitting me with my departure from them ought rather to applaud me for correcting them footnote definition implies previous examination of the object defined and is open to correction or modification as knowledge of the object increases such increased knowledge has radically changed our conceptions of the luminiferous aether converting its vibrations from longitudinal into transverse such changes also mr martineaus conceptions of matter are doomed to undergo the reader of my small contributions to the literature which deals with the overlapping margins of science and theology will have noticed how frequently i quote mr emerson i do so mainly because in him we have a poet and a profoundly religious man who is really and entirely undaunted by the discoveries of science past present or prospective in his case poetry with the joy of a bacchanal takes her graver brother science by the hand and cheers him with immortal laughter by emerson scientific conceptions are continually transmuted into the finer forms and warmer hues of an ideal world our present theme is touched upon in the lines the journeying atoms primordial wholes firmly draw firmly drive by their animate poles as regards veracity and insight these few words outweigh in my estimation all the formal learning expended by mr martineau in those disquisitions on force where he treats the physicist as a conjuror and speaks so wittily of atomic polarity in fact without this notion of polaritythis drawing and drivingthis attraction and repulsion we stand as stupidly dumb before the phenomena of crystallisation as a bushman before the phenomena of the solar system the genesis and growth of the notion i have endeavoured to make clear in my third lecture on light and in the article on matter and force published in this volume our further course is here foreshadowed a sunday or two ago i stood under an oak planted by sir john moore the hero of corunna on the ground near the tree little oaklets were successfully fighting for life with the surrounding vegetation the acorns had dropped into the friendly soil and this was the result of their interaction what is the acorn what the earth and what the sun without whose heat and light the tree could not become a tree however rich the soil and however healthy the seed i answer for myself as beforeall matter and the heat and light which here play so potent a part are acknowledged to be motions of matter by taking something much lower down in the vegetable kingdom than the oak we might approach much more nearly to the case of crystallisation already discussed but this is not now necessary if instead of conceding the sufficiency of matter here mr martineau should fly to the hypothesis of a vegetative soul all the questions before asked in relation to the snowstar become pertinent i would invite him to go over them one by one and consider what replies he will make to them he may retort by asking me who infused the principle of life into the tree i say in answer that our present question is not this but anothernot who made the tree but what is it is there anything besides matter in the tree if so what and where mr martineau may have begun by this time to discern that it is not picturesqueness but cold precision that my vorstellungsfaehigkeit demands how i would ask is this vegetative soul to be presented to the mind where did it flourish before the tree grew and what will become of it when the tree is sawn into planks or consumed in fire possibly mr martineau may consider the assumption of this soul to be as untenable and as useless as i do but then if the power to build a tree be conceded to pure matter what an amazing expansion of our notions of the potency of matter is implied in the concession think of the acorn of the earth and of the solar light and heatwas ever such necromancy dreamt of as the production of that massive trunk those swaying boughs and whispering leaves from the interaction of these three factors in this interaction moreover consists what we call life it will be seen that i am not in the least insensible to the wonder of the tree nay i should not be surprised if in the presence of this wonder i feel more perplexed and overwhelmed than mr martineau himself consider it for a moment there is an experiment first made by wheatstone where the music of a piano is transferred from its soundboard through a thin wooden rod across several silent rooms in succession and poured out at a distance from the instrument the strings of the piano vibrate not singly but ten at a time every string subdivides yielding not one note but a dozen all these vibrations and subvibrations are crowded together into a bit of deal not more than a quarter of a square inch in section yet no note is lost each vibration asserts its individual rights and all are at last shaken forth into the air by a second soundboard against which the distant end of the rod presses thought ends in amazement when it seeks to realise the motions of that rod as the music flows through it i turn to my tree and observe its roots its trunk its branches and its leaves as the rod conveys the music and yields it up to the distant air so does the trunk convey the matter and the motionthe shocks and pulses and other vital actionswhich eventually emerge in the umbrageous foliage of the tree i went some time ago through the greenhouse of a friend he had ferns from ceylon the branches of which were in some cases not much thicker than an ordinary pinhard smooth and cylindricaloften leafless for a foot or more but at the end of every one of them the unsightly twig unlocked the exuberant beauty hidden within it and broke forth into a mass of fronds almost large enough to fill the arms we stand here upon a higher level of the wonderful we are conscious of a music subtler than that of the piano passing unheard through these tiny boughs and issuing in what mr martineau would opulently call the clustered magnificence of the leaves does it lessen my amazement to know that every cluster and every leaftheir form and texturelie like the music in the rod in the molecular structure of these apparently insignificant stems not so mr martineau weeps for the beauty of the flower fading into a necessity i care not whether it comes to me through necessity or through freedom my delight in it is all the same i see what he sees with a wonder superadded to me as to him not even solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these i have spoken above as if the assumption of a soul would save mr martineau from the inconsistency of crediting pure matter with the astonishing building power displayed in crystals and trees this however would not be the necessary result for it would remain to be proved that the soul assumed is not itself matter when a boy i learnt from dr watts that the souls of conscious brutes are mere matter and the man who would claim for matter the human soul itself would find himself in very orthodox company all that is erected says fauste a famous french bishop of the fifth century is matter the soul occupies a place it is enclosed in a body it quits the body at death and returns to it at the resurrection as in the case of lazarus the distinction between hell and heaven between eternal pleasures and eternal pains proves that even after death souls occupy a place and are corporeal god only is incorporeal tertullian moreover was quite a physicist in the definiteness of his conceptions regarding the soul the materiality of the soul he says is evident from the evangelists a human soul is there expressly pictured as suffering in hell it is placed in the middle of a flame its tongue feels a cruel agony and it implores a drop of water at the hands of a happier soul wanting materiality adds tertullian all this would be without meaning footnote the foregoing extracts which m alglave recently brought to light for the benefit of the bishop of orleans are taken from the sixth lecture of the cours dhistoire moderns of that most orthodox of statesmen m guizot i could multiply continues m guizot these citations to infinity and they prove that in the first centuries of our era the materiality of the soul was an opinion not only permitted but dominant dr moriarty and the synod which he recently addressed obviously forget their own antecedents their boasted succession from the early church renders them the direct offspring of a materialism more brutal than any ever enunciated by me i have glanced at inorganic natureat the sea and the sun and the vapour and the snowflake and at organic nature as represented by the fern and the oak that same sun which warmed the water and liberated the vapour exerts a subtler power on the nutriment of the tree it takes hold of matter wholly unfit for the purposes of nutrition separates its nutritive from its nonnutritive portions gives the former to the vegetable and carries the others away planted in the earth bathed by the air and tended by the sun the tree is traversed by its sap the cells are formed the woody fibre is spun and the whole is woven to a texture wonderful even to the naked eye but a millionfold more so to microscopic vision does consciousness mix in any way with these processes no man can tell our only ground for a negative conclusion is the absence of those outward manifestations from which feeling is usually inferred but even these are not entirely absent in the greenhouses of kew we may see that a leaf can close in response to a proper stimulus as promptly as the human fingers themselves and while there dr hooker will tell us of the wondrous flycatching and flydevouring power of the dionaea no man can say that the feelings of the animal are not represented by a drowsier consciousness in the vegetable world at all events no line has ever been drawn between the conscious and the unconscious for the vegetable shades into the animal by such fine gradations that is impossible to say where the one ends and the other begins in all such enquiries we are necessarily limited by our own powers we observe what our senses armed with the aids furnished by science enable us to observe nothing more the evidences as to consciousness in the vegetable world depend wholly upon our capacity to observe and weigh them alter the capacity and the evidence would alter too would that which to us is a total absence of any manifestation of consciousness be the same to a being with our capacities indefinitely multiplied to such a being i can imagine not only the vegetable but the mineral world responsive to the proper irritants the response differing only in degree from those exaggerated manifestations which in virtue of their magnitude appeal to our weak powers of observation our conclusion however must be based not on powers that we imagine but upon those that we possess what do they reveal as the earth and atmosphere offer themselves as the nutriment of the vegetable world so does the latter which contains no constituent not found in inorganic nature offer itself to the animal world mixed with certain inorganic substanceswater for examplethe vegetable constitutes in the long run the sole sustenance of the animal animals may be divided into two classes the first of which can utilise the vegetable world immediately having chemical forces strong enough to cope with its most refractory parts the second class use the vegetable world mediately that is to say after its finer portions have been extracted and stored up by the first but in neither class have we an atom newly created the animal world is so to say a distillation through the vegetable world from inorganic nature from this point of view all three worlds would constitute a unity in which i picture life as immanent everywhere nor am i anxious to shut out the idea that the life here spoken of may be but a subordinate part and function of a higher life as the living moving blood is subordinate to the living man i resist no such idea as long as it is not dogmatically imposed left for the human mind freely to operate upon the idea has ethical vitality but stiffened into a dogma the inner force disappears and the outward yoke of a usurping hierarchy takes its place the problem before us is at all events capable of definite statement we have on the one hand strong grounds for concluding that the earth was once a molten mass we now find it not only swathed by an atmosphere and covered by a sea but also crowded with living things the question is how were they introduced certainty may be as unattainable here as bishop butler held it to be in matters of religion but in the contemplation of probabilities the thoughtful mind is forced to take a side the conclusion of science which recognises unbroken causal connection between the past and the present would undoubtedly be that the molten earth contained within it elements of life which grouped themselves into their present forms as the planet cooled the difficulty and reluctance encountered by this conception arise solely from the fact that the theologic conception obtained a prior footing in the human mind did the latter depend upon reasoning alone it could not hold its ground for an hour against its rival but it is warmed into life and strength by associated hopes and fearsand not only by these which are more or less mean but by that loftiness of thought and feeling which lifts its possessor above the atmosphere of self and which the theologic idea in its nobler forms has engendered in noble minds were not mans origin implicated we should accept without a murmur the derivation of animal and vegetable life from what we call inorganic nature the conclusion of pure intellect points this way and no other but the purity is troubled by our interests in this life and by our hopes and fears regarding the life to come reason is traversed by the emotions anger rising in the weaker heads to the height of suggesting that the suppression of the enquirer by the arm of the law would be an act agreeable to god and serviceable to man but this foolishness is more than neutralised by the sympathy of the wise and in england at least so long as the courtesy which befits an earnest theme is adhered to such sympathy is ever ready for an honest man none of us here need shrink from saying all that he has a right to say we ought however to remember that it is not only a band of jesuits weaving their schemes of intellectual slavery under the innocent guise of education that we are opposing our foes are to some extent of our own household including not only the ignorant and the passionate but a minority of minds of high calibre and culture lovers of freedom moreover who though its objective bull be riddled by logic still find the ethic life of their religion unimpaired but while such considerations ought to influence the form of our argument and prevent it from ever slipping out of the region of courtesy into that of scorn or abuse its substance i think ought to be maintained and presented in unmitigated strength in the year 1855 the chair of philosophy in the university of munich happened to be filled by a catholic priest of great critical penetration great learning and great courage who had borne the brunt of battle long before doellinger his jesuit colleagues he knew inculcated the belief that every human soul is sent into the world from god by a separate and supernatural act of creation in a work entitled the origin of the human soul professor frohschammer the philosopher here alluded to was hardy enough to question this doctrine and to affirm that man body and soul comes from his parents the act of creation being therefore mediate and secondary only the jesuits keep a sharp look out on all temerities of this kind and their organ the civilit cattolica immediately pounced upon frohschammer his book was branded as pestilent placed in the index and stamped with the condemnation of the church footnote king maximilian ii brought liebig to munich he helped helmholtz in his researches and loved to liberate and foster science but through his liberal concession of power to the jesuits in the schools he did far more damage to the intellectual freedom of his country than his superstitious predecessor ludwig i priding himself on being a german prince ludwig would not tolerate the interference of the roman party with the political affairs of bavaria the jesuit notion does not err on the score of indefiniteness according to it the power whom goethe does not dare to name and whom gassendi and clerk maxwell present to us under the guise of a manufacturer of atoms turns out annually for england and wales alone a quarter of a million of new souls taken in connection with the dictum of mr carlyle that this annual increment to our population are mostly fools but little profit to the human heart seems derivable from this mode of regarding the divine operations but if the jesuit notion be rejected what are we to accept physiologists say that every human being comes from an egg not more than the 1120th of an inch in diameter is this egg matter i hold it to be so as much as the seed of a fern or of an oak nine months go to the making of it into a man are the additions made during this period of gestation drawn from matter i think so undoubtedly if there be anything besides matter in the egg or in the infant subsequently slumbering in the womb what is it the questions already asked with reference to the stars of snow may be here repeated mr martineau will complain that i am disenchanting the babe of its wonder but is this the case i figure it growing in the womb woven by a something not itself without conscious participation on the part of either father or mother and appearing in due time a living miracle with all its organs and all their implications consider the work accomplished during these nine months in forming the eye alonewith its lens and its humours and its miraculous retina behind consider the ear with its tympanum cochlea and cortis organan instrument of three thousand strings built adjacent to the brain and employed by it to sift separate and interpret antecedent to all consciousness the sonorous tremors of the external world all this has been accomplished not only without mans contrivance but without his knowledge the secret of his own organisation having been withheld from him since his birth in the immeasurable past until these latter days matter i define as that mysterious thing by which all this is accomplished how it came to have this power is a question on which i never ventured an opinion if then matter starts as a beggar it is in my view because the jacobs of theology have deprived it of its birthright mr martineau need fear no disenchantment theories of evolution go but a short way towards the explanation of this mystery the ages let us hope will at length give us a poet competent to deal with it aright there are men and they include amongst them some of the best of the race of man upon whose minds this mystery falls without producing either warmth or colour the dry light of the intellect suffices for them and they live their noble lives untouched by a desire to give the mystery shape or expression there are on the other hand men whose minds are warmed and coloured by its presence and who under its stimulus attain to moral heights which have never been overtopped different spiritual climates are necessary for the healthy existence of these two classes of men and different climates must be accorded them the history of humanity however proves the experience of the second class to illustrate the most pervading need the world will have religion of some kind even though it should fly for it to the intellectual whoredom of spiritualism what is really wanted is the lifting power of an ideal element in human life but the free play of this power must be preceded by its release from the practical materialism of the present as well as from the torn swaddling bands of the past it is now in danger of being stupefied by the one or strangled by the other i look however forward to a time when the strength insight and elevation which now visit us in mere hints and glimpses during moments of clearness and vigour shall be the stable and permanent possession of purer and mightier minds than ourspurer and mightier partly because of their deeper knowledge of matter and their more faithful conformity to its laws xii fermentation its bearings on surgery medicine footnote a discourse delivered before the glasgow science lectures association october 19 1876 one of the most remarkable characteristics of the age in which we live is its desire and tendency to connect itself organically with preceding agesto ascertain how the state of things that now is came to be what it is and the more earnestly and profoundly this problem is studied the more clearly comes into view the vast and varied debt which the world of today owes to that foreworld in which man by skill valour and welldirected strength first replenished and subdued the earth our prehistoric fathers may have been savages but they were clever and observant ones they founded agriculture by the discovery and development of seeds whose origin is now unknown they tamed and harnessed their animal antagonists and sent them down to us as ministers instead of rivals in the fight for life later on when the claims of luxury added themselves to those of necessity we find the same spirit of invention at work we have no historic account of the first brewer but we glean from history that his art was practised and its produce relished more than two thousand years ago theophrastus who was born nearly four hundred years before christ described beer as the wine of barley it is extremely difficult to preserve beer in a hot country still egypt was the land in which it was first brewed the desire of man to quench his thirst with this exhilarating beverage overcoming all the obstacles which a hot climate threw in the way of its manufacture our remote ancestors had also learned by experience that wine maketh glad the heart of man noah we are informed planted a vineyard drank of the wine and experienced the consequences but though wine and beer possess so old a history a very few years ago no man knew the secret of their formation indeed it might be said that until the present year no thorough and scientific account was ever given of the agencies which come into play in the manufacture of beer of the conditions necessary to its health and of the maladies and vicissitudes to which it is subject hitherto the art and practice of the brewer have resembled those of the physician both being founded on empirical observation by this is meant the observation of facts apart from the principles which explain them and which give the mind an intelligent mastery over them the brewer learnt from long experience the conditions not the reasons of success but he had to contend and has still to contend against unexplained perplexities over and over again his care has been rendered nugatory his beer has fallen into acidity or rottenness and disastrous losses have been sustained of which he has been unable to assign the cause it is the hidden enemies against which the physician and the brewer have hitherto contended that recent researches are dragging into the light of day thus preparing the way for their final extermination let us glance for a moment at the outward and visible signs of fermentation a few weeks ago i paid a visit to a private still in a swiss chalet and this is what i saw in the peasants bedroom was a cask with a very large bunghole carefully closed the cask contained cherries which had lain in it for fourteen days it was not entirely filled with the fruit an airspace being left above the cherries when they were put in i had the bung removed and a small lamp dipped into this space its flame was instantly extinguished the oxygen of the air had entirely disappeared its place being taken by carbonic acid gas footnote the gas which is exhaled from the lungs after the oxygen of the air has done its duty in purifying the blood the same also which effervesces from soda water and champagne i tasted the cherries they were very sour though when put into the cask they were sweet the cherries and the liquid associated with them were then placed in a copper boiler to which a copper head was closely fitted from the head proceeded a copper tube which passed straight through a vessel of cold water and issued at the other side under the open end of the tube was placed a bottle to receive the spirit distilled the flame of small woodsplinters being applied to the boiler after a time vapour rose into the head passed through the tube was condensed by the cold of the water and fell in a liquid fillet into the bottle on being tasted it proved to be that fiery and intoxicating spirit known in commerce as kirsch or kirschwasser the cherries it should be remembered were left to themselves no ferment of any kind being added to them in this respect what has been said of the cherry applies also to the grape at the vintage the fruit of the vine is placed in proper vessels and abandoned to its own action it ferments producing carbonic acid its sweetness disappears and at the end of a certain time the unintoxicating grapejuice is converted into intoxicating wine here as in the case of the cherries the fermentation is spontaneousin what sense spontaneous will appear more clearly byandby it is needless for me to tell a glasgow audience that the beerbrewer does not set to work in this way in the first place the brewer deals not with the juice of fruits but with the juice of barley the barley having been steeped for a sufficient time in water it is drained and subjected to a temperature sufficient to cause the moist grain to germinate after which it is completely dried upon a kiln it then receives the name of malt the malt is crisp to the teeth and decidedly sweeter to the taste than the original barley it is ground mashed up in warm water then boiled with hops until all the soluble portions have been extracted the infusion thus produced being called the wort this is drawn off and cooled as rapidly as possible then instead of abandoning the infusion as the winemaker does to its own action the brewer mixes yeast with his wort and places it in vessels each with only one aperture open to the air soon after the addition of the yeast a brownish froth which is really new yeast issues from the aperture and falls like a cataract into troughs prepared to receive it this frothing and foaming of the wort is a proof that the fermentation is active whence comes the yeast which issues so copiously from the fermenting tub what is this yeast and how did the brewer become possessed of it examine its quantity before and after fermentation the brewer introduces say 10 cwts of yeast he collects 40 or it may be 50 cwts the yeast has therefore augmented from four to five fold during the fermentation shall we conclude that this additional yeast has been spontaneously generated by the wort are we not rather reminded of that seed which fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some thirty fold some sixty fold some an hundred fold on examination this notion of organic growth turns out to be more than a mere surmise in the year 1680 when the microscope was still in its infancy leeuwenhoek turned the instrument upon this substance and found it composed of minute globules suspended in a liquid thus knowledge rested until 1835 when cagniard de la tour in france and schwann in germany independently but animated by it common thought turned microscopes of improved definition and heightened powers upon yeast and found it budding and sprouting before their eyes the augmentation of the yeast alluded to above was thus proved to arise from the growth of a minute plant now called torula or saccharomyces cerevisiae spontaneous generation is therefore out of the question the brewer deliberately sows the yeastplant which grows and multiplies in the wort as its proper soil this discovery marks an epoch in the history of fermentation but where did the brewer find his yeast the reply to this question is similar to that which must be given if it were asked where the brewer found his barley he has received the seeds of both of them from preceding generations could we connect without solution of continuity the present with the past we should probably be able to trace back the yeast employed by my friend sir fowell buxton today to that employed by some egyptian brewer two thousand years ago but you may urge that there must have been a time when the first yeastcell was generated grantedexactly as there was a time when the first barleycorn was generated let not the delusion lay hold of you that a living thing is easily generated because it is small both the yeastplant and the barleyplant lose themselves in the dim twilight of antiquity and in this our day there is no more proof of the spontaneous generation of the one than there is of the spontaneous generation of the other i stated a moment ago that the fermentation of grapejuice was spontaneous but i was careful to add in what sense spontaneous will appear more clearly byandby now this is the sense meant the winemaker does not like the brewer and distiller deliberately introduce either yeast or any equivalent of yeast into his vats he does not consciously sow in them any plant or the germ of any plant indeed he has been hitherto in ignorance whether plants or germs of any kind have had anything to do with his operations still when the fermented grapejuice is examined the living torula concerned in alcoholic fermentation never fails to make its appearance how is this if no living germ has been introduced into the winevat whence comes the life so invariably developed there you may be disposed to reply with turpin and others that in virtue of its own inherent powers the grapejuice when brought into contact with the vivifying atmospheric oxygen runs spontaneously and of its own accord into these low forms of life i have not the slightest objection to this explanation provided proper evidence can be adduced in support of it but the evidence adduced in its favour as far as i am acquainted with it snaps asunder under the strain of scientific criticism it is as far as i can see the evidence of men who however keen and clever as observers are not rigidly trained experimenters these alone are aware of the precautions necessary in investigations of this delicate kind in reference then to the life of the winevat what is the decision of experiment when carried out by competent men let a quantity of the clear filtered must of the grape be so boiled as to destroy such germs as it may have contracted from the air or otherwise in contact with germless air the uncontaminated must never ferments all the materials for spontaneous generation are there but so long as there is no seed sown there is no life developed and no sign of that fermentation which is the concomitant of life nor need you resort to a boiled liquid the grape is sealed by its own skin against contamination from without by an ingenious device pasteur has extracted from the interior of the grape its pure juice and proved that in contact with pure air it never acquires the power to ferment itself nor to produce fermentation in other liquids footnote the liquids of the healthy animal body are also sealed from external contamination pure blood for example drawn with due precautions from the veins will never ferment or putrefy in contact with pure air it is not therefore in the interior of the grape that the origin of the life observed in the vat is to be sought what then is its true origin this is pasteurs answer which his wellproved accuracy renders worthy of all confidence at the time of the vintage microscopic particles are observed adherent both to the outer surface of the grape and of the twigs which support the grape brush these particles into a capsule of pure water it is rendered turbid by the dust examined by a microscope some of these minute particles are seen to present the appearance of organisedcells instead of receiving them in water let them be brushed into the pure inert juice of the grape fortyeight hours after this is done our familiar torula is observed budding and sprouting the growth of the plant being accompanied by all the other signs of active fermentation what is the inference to be drawn from this experiment obviously that the particles adherent to the external surface of the grape include the germs of that life which after they have been sown in the juice appears in such profusion wine is sometimes objected to on the ground that fermentation is artificial but we notice here the responsibility of nature the ferment of the grape clings like a parasite to the surface of the grape and the art of the winemaker from time immemorial has consisted in bringingand it may be added ignorantly bringingtwo things thus closely associated by nature into actual contact with each other for thousands of years what has been done consciously by the brewer has been done unconsciously by the winegrower the one has sown his leaven just as much as the other nor is it necessary to impregnate the beerwort with yeast to provoke fermentation abandoned to the contact of our common air it sooner or later ferments but the chances are that the produce of that fermentation instead of being agreeable would be disgusting to the taste by a rare accident we might get the true alcoholic fermentation but the odds against obtaining it would be enormous pure air acting upon a lifeless liquid will never provoke fermentation but our ordinary air is the vehicle of numberless germs which act as ferments when they fall into appropriate infusions some of them produce acidity some putrefaction the germs of our yeastplant are also in the air but so sparingly distributed that an infusion like beerwort exposed to the air is almost sure to be taken possession of by foreign organisms in fact the maladies of beer are wholly due to the admixture of these objectionable ferments whose forms and modes of nutrition differ materially from those of the true leaven working in an atmosphere charged with the germs of these organisms you can understand how easy it is to fall into error in studying the action of any one of them indeed it is only the most accomplished experimenter who moreover avails himself of every means of checking his conclusions that can walk without tripping through this land of pitfalls such a man the french chemist pasteur has hitherto proved himself to be he has taught us how to separate the commingled ferments of our air and to study their pure individual action guided by him let us fix our attention more particularly upon the growth and action of the true yeastplant under different conditions let it be sown in a fermentable liquid which is supplied with plenty of pure air the plant will flourish in the aerated infusion and produce large quantities of carbonic acid gasa compound as you know of carbon and oxygen the oxygen thus consumed by the plant is the free oxygen of the air which we suppose to be abundantly supplied to the liquid the action is so far similar to the respiration of animals which inspire oxygen and expire carbonic acid if we examine the liquid even when the vigour of the plant has reached its maximum we hardly find in it a trace of alcohol the yeast has grown and flourished but it has almost ceased to act as a ferment and could every individual yeastcell seize without any impediment free oxygen from the surrounding liquid it is certain that it would cease to act as a ferment altogether what then are the conditions under which the yeastplant must be placed so that it may display its characteristic quality reflection on the facts already referred to suggests a reply and rigid experiment confirms the suggestion consider the alpine cherries in their closed vessel consider the beer in its barrel with a single small aperture open to the air through which it is observed not to imbibe oxygen but to pour forth carbonic acid whence come the volumes of oxygen necessary to the production of this latter gas the small quantity of atmospheric air dissolved in the wort and overlying it would be totally incompetent to supply the necessary oxygen in no other way can the yeastplant obtain the gas necessary for its respiration than by wrenching it from surrounding substances in which the oxygen exists not free but in a state of combination it decomposes the sugar of the solution in which it grows produces heat breathes forth carbonic acid gas and one of the liquid products of the decomposition is our familiar alcohol the act of fermentation then is a result of the effort of the little plant to maintain its respiration by means of combined oxygen when its supply of free oxygen is cut off as defined by pasteur fermentation is life without air but here the knowledge of that thorough investigator comes to our aid to warn us against errors which have been committed over and over again it is not all yeastcells that can thus live without air and provoke fermentation they must be young cells which have caught their vegetative vigour from contact with free oxygen but once possessed of this vigour the yeast may be transplanted into a saccharine infusion absolutely purged of air where it will continue to live at the expense of the oxygen carbon and other constituents of the infusion under these new conditions its life as a plant will be by no means so vigorous as when it had a supply of free oxygen but its action as a ferment will be indefinitely greater does the yeastplant stand alone in its power of provoking alcoholic fermentation it would be singular if amid the multitude of low vegetable forms no other could be found capable of acting in a similar way and here again we have occasion to marvel at that sagacity of observation among the ancients to which we owe so vast a debt not only did they discover the alcoholic ferment of yeast but they had to exercise a wise selection in picking it out from others and giving it special prominence place an old boot in a moist place or expose common paste or a pot of jam to the air it soon becomes coated with a bluegreen mould which is nothing else than the fructification of a little plant called penicillium glaucum do not imagine that the mould has sprung spontaneously from boot or paste or jam its germs which are abundant in the air have been sown and have germinated in as legal and legitimate a way as thistleseeds wafted by the wind to a proper soil let the minute spores of penicillium be sown in a fermentable liquid which has been previously so boiled as to kill all other spores or seeds which it may contain let pure air have free access to the mixture the penicillium will grow rapidly striking long filaments into the liquid and fructifying at its surface test the infusion at various stages of the plants growth you will never find in it a trace of alcohol but forcibly submerge the little plant push it down deep into the liquid where the quantity of free oxygen that can reach it is insufficient for its needs it immediately begins to act as a ferment supplying itself with oxygen by the decomposition of the sugar and producing alcohol as one of the results of the decomposition many other low microscopic plants act in a similar manner in aerated liquids they flourish without any production of alcohol but cut off from free oxygen they act as ferments producing alcohol exactly as the real alcoholic leaven produces it only less copiously for the right apprehension of all these facts we are indebted to pasteur in the cases hitherto considered the fermentation is proved to be the invariable correlative of life being produced by organisms foreign to the fermentable substance but the substance itself may also have within it to some extent the motive power of fermentation the yeastplant as we have learned is an assemblage of living cells but so at bottom as shown by schleiden and schwann are all living organisms cherries apples peaches pears plums and grapes for example are composed of cells each of which is a living unit and here i have to direct your attention to a point of extreme interest in 1821 the celebrated french chemist brard established the important fact that all ripening fruit exposed to the free atmosphere absorbed the oxygen of the atmosphere and liberated an approximately equal volume of carbonic acid he also found that when ripe fruits were placed in a confined atmosphere the oxygen of the atmosphere was first absorbed and an equal volume of carbonic acid given out but the process did not end here after the oxygen had vanished carbonic acid in considerable quantities continued to be exhaled by the fruits which at the same time lost a portion of their sugar becoming more acid to the taste though the absolute quantity of acid was not augmented this was an observation of capital importance and brard had the sagacity to remark that the process might be regarded as a kind of fermentation thus the living cells of fruits can absorb oxygen and breathe out carbonic acid exactly like the living cells of the leaven of beer supposing the access of oxygen suddenly cut off will the living fruitcells as suddenly die or will they continue to live as yeast lives by extracting oxygen from the saccharine juices round them this is a question of extreme theoretic significance it was first answered affirmatively by the able and conclusive experiments of lechartier and bellamy and the answer was subsequently confirmed and explained by the experiments and the reasoning of pasteur brard only showed the absorption of oxygen and the production of carbonic acid lechartier and bellamy proved the production of alcohol thus completing the evidence that it was a case of real fermentation though the common alcoholic ferment was absent so full was pasteur of the idea that the cells of a fruit would continue to live at the expense of the sugar of the fruit that once in his laboratory while conversing on these subjects with m dumas he exclaimed i will wager that if a grape be plunged into an atmosphere of carbonic acid it will produce alcohol and carbonic acid by the continued life of its own cellsthat they will act for a time like the cells of the true alcoholic leaven he made the experiment and found the result to be what he had foreseen he then extended the enquiry placing under a belljar twentyfour plums he filled the jar with carbonic acid gas beside it he placed twentyfour similar plums uncovered at the end of eight days he removed the plums from the jar and compared them with the others the difference was extraordinary the uncovered fruits had become soft watery and very sweet the others were firm and hard their fleshy portions being not at all watery they had moreover lost a considerable quantity of their sugar they were afterwards bruised and the juice was distilled it yielded six and a half grammes of alcohol or one per cent of the total weight of the plums neither in these plums nor in the grapes first experimented on by pasteur could any trace of the ordinary alcoholic leaven be found as previously proved by lechartier and bellamy the fermentation was the work of the living cells of the fruit itself after air had been denied to them when moreover the cells were destroyed by bruising no fermentation ensued the fermentation was the correlative of a vital act and it ceased when life was extinguished luedersdorf was the first to show by this method that yeast acted not as liebig had assumed in virtue of its organic but in virtue of its organised character he destroyed the cells of yeast by rubbing them on a ground glass plate and found that with the destruction of the organism though its chemical constituents remained the power to act as a ferment totally disappeared one word more in reference to liebig may find a place here to the philosophic chemist thoughtfully pondering these phenomena familiar with the conception of molecular motion and the changes produced by the interactions of purely chemical forces nothing could be more natural than to see in the process of fermentation a simple illustration of molecular instability the ferment propagating to surrounding molecular groups the overthrow of its own tottering combinations broadly considered indeed there is a certain amount of truth in this theory but liebig who propounded it missed the very kernel of the phenomena when he overlooked or contemned the part played in fermentation by microscopic life he looked at the matter too little with the eye of the body and too much with the spiritual eye he practically neglected the microscope and was unmoved by the knowledge which its revelations would have poured in upon his mind his hypothesis as i have said was naturalnay it was a striking illustration of liebigs power to penetrate and unveil molecular actions but it was an error and as such has proved an ignis fatuus instead of a pharos to some of his followers i have said that our air is full of the germs of ferments differing from the alcoholic leaven and sometimes seriously interfering with the latter they are the weeds of this microscopic garden which often overshadow and choke the flowers let us take an illustrative case expose milk to the air it will after a time turn sour separating like blood into clot and serum place a drop of this sour milk under a powerful microscope and watch it closely you see the minute butterglobules animated by that curious quivering motion called the brownian motion but let not this attract your attention too much for it is another motion that we have now to seek here and there you observe a greater disturbance than ordinary among the globules keep your eye upon the place of tumult and you will probably see emerging from it a long eellike organism tossing the globules aside and wriggling more or less rapidly across the field of the microscope familiar with one sample of this organism which from its motions receives the name of vibrio you soon detect numbers of them it is these organisms and other analogous though apparently motionless ones which by decomposing the milk render it sour and putrid they are the lactic and putrid ferments as the yeastplant is the alcoholic ferment of sugar keep them and their germs out of your milk and it will continue sweet but milk may become putrid without becoming sour examine such putrid milk microscopically and you find it swarming with shorter organisms sometimes associated with the vibrios sometimes alone and often manifesting a wonderful alacrity of motion keep these organisms and their germs out of your milk and it will never putrify expose a muttonchop to the air and keep it moist in summer weather it soon stinks place a drop of the juice of the fetid chop under a powerful microscope it is seen swarming with organisms resembling those in the putrid milk these organisms which receive the common name of bacteria footnote doubtless organisms exhibiting grave specific differences are grouped together under this common name are the agents of all putrefaction keep them and their germs from your meat and it will remain for ever sweet thus we begin to see that within the world of life to which we ourselves belong there is another living world requiring the microscope for its discernment but which nevertheless has the most important bearing on the welfare of the higher lifeworld and now let us reason together as regards the origin of these bacteria a granular powder is placed in your hands and you are asked to state what it is you examine it and have or have not reason to suspect that seeds of some kind are mixed up in it to determine this point you prepare a bed in your garden sow in it the powder and soon after find a mixed crop of docks and thistles sprouting from your bed until this powder was sown neither docks nor thistles ever made their appearance in your garden you repeat the experiment once twice ten times fifty times from fifty different beds after the sowing of the powder you obtain the same crop what will be your response to the question proposed to you i am not in a condition you would say to affirm that every grain of the powder is a dockseed or a thistleseed but i am in a condition to affirm that both dock and thistleseeds form at all events part of the powder supposing a succession of such powders to be placed in your hands with grains becoming gradually smaller until they dwindle to the size of impalpable dust particles assuming that you treat them all in the same way and that from every one of them in a few days you obtain a definite cropmay be clover it may be mustard it may be mignonette it may be a plant more minute than any of these smallness of the particles or of the plants that spring from them does not affect the validity of the conclusion without a shadow of misgiving you would conclude that the powder must have contained the seeds or germs of the life observed there is not in the range of physical science an experiment more conclusive nor an inference safer than this one supposing the powder to be light enough to float in the air and that you are enabled to see it there just as plainly as you saw the heavier powder in the palm of hand if the dust sown by the air instead of by the hand produce a definite living crop with the same logical rigour you would conclude that the germs of this crop must be mixed with the dust to take an illustration the spores of the little plant penicillium glaucum to which i have already referred are light enough to float in the air a cut apple a pear a tomato a slice of vegetable marrow or as already mentioned an old moist boot a dish of paste or a pot of jam constitutes a proper soil for the penicillium now if it could be proved that the dust of the air when sown in this soil produces this plant while wanting the dust neither the air nor the soil nor both together can produce it it would be obviously just as certain in this case that the floating dust contains the germs of penicillium as that the powders sown in your garden contained the germs of the plants which sprung from them but how is the floating dust to be rendered visible in this way build a little chamber and provide it with a door windows and windowshutters let an aperture be made in one of the shutters through which a sunbeam can pass close the door and windows so that no light shall enter save through the hole in the shutter the track of the sunbeam is at first perfectly plain and vivid in the air of the room if all disturbance of the air of the chamber be avoided the luminous track will become fainter and fainter until at last it disappears absolutely and no trace of the beam is to be seen what rendered the beam visible at first the floating dust of the air which thus illuminated and observed is as palpable to sense as dust or powder placed on the palm of the hand in the still air the dust gradually sinks to the floor or sticks to the walls and ceiling until finally by this selfcleansing process the air is entirely freed from mechanically suspended matter thus far i think we have made our footing sure let us proceed chop up a beefsteak and allow it to remain for two or three hours just covered with warm water you thus extract the juice of the beef in a concentrated form by properly boiling the liquid and filtering it you can obtain from it a perfectly transparent beeftea expose a number of vessels containing this tea to the moteless air of your chamber and expose a number of vessels containing precisely the same liquid to the dustladen air in three days every one of the latter stinks and examined with the microscope every one of them is found swarming with the bacteria of putrefaction after three months or three years the beeftea within the chamber is found in every case as sweet and clear and as free from bacteria as it was at the moment when it was first put in there is absolutely no difference between the air within and that without save that the one is dustless and the other dustladen clinch the experiment thus open the door of your chamber and allow the dust to enter it in three days afterwards you have every vessel within the chamber swarming with bacteria and in a state of active putrefaction here also the inference is quite as certain as in the case of the powder sown in your garden multiply your proofs by building fifty chambers instead of one and by employing every imaginable infusion of wild animals and tame of flesh fish fowl and viscera of vegetables of the most various kinds if in all these cases you find the dust infallibly producing its crop of bacteria while neither the dustless air nor the nutritive infusion nor both together are ever able to produce this crop your conclusion is simply irresistible that the dust of the air contains the germs of the crop which has appeared in your infusions i repeat there is no inference of experimental science more certain than this one in the presence of such facts to use the words of a paper lately published in the philosophical transactions it would be simply monstrous to affirm that these swarming crops of bacteria are spontaneously generated is there then no experimental proof of spontaneous generation i answer without hesitation none but to doubt the experimental proof of a fact and to deny its possibility are two different things though some writers confuse matters by making them synonymous in fact this doctrine of spontaneous generation in one form or another falls in with the theoretic beliefs of some of the foremost workers of this age but it is exactly these men who have the penetration to see and the honesty to expose the weakness of the evidence adduced in its support and here observe how these discoveries tally with the common practices of life heat kills the bacteria colds numbs them when my housekeeper has pheasants in charge which she wishes to keep sweet but which threaten to give way she partially cooks the birds kills the infant bacteria and thus postpones the evil day by boiling her milk she also extends its period of sweetness some weeks ago in the alps i made a few experiments on the influence of cold upon ants though the sun was strong patches of snow still maintained themselves on the mountain slopes the ants were found in the warm grass and on the warm rocks adjacent transferred to the snow the rapidity of their paralysis was surprising ina few seconds a vigorous ant after a few languid struggles would wholly lose its power of locomotion and lie practically dead upon the snow transferred to the warm rock it would revive to be again smitten with deathlike numbness when retransferred to the snow what is true of the ant is specially true of our bacteria their active life is suspended by cold and with it their power of producing or continuing putrefaction this is the whole philosophy of the preservation of meat by cold the fishmonger for example when he surrounds his very assailable wares by lumps of ice stays the process of putrefaction by reducing to numbness and inaction the organisms which produce it and in the absence of which his fish would remain sweet and sound it is the astonishing activity into which these bacteria are pushed by warmth that renders a single summers day sometimes so disastrous to the great butchers of london and glasgow the bodies of guides lost in the crevasses of alpine glaciers have come to the surface forty years after their interment without the flesh showing any sign of putrefaction but the most astonishing case of this kind is that of the hairy elephant of siberia which was found incased in ice it had been buried for ages but when laid bare its flesh was sweet and for some time afforded copious nutriment to the wild beasts which fed upon it beer is assailable by all the organisms here referred to some of which produce acetic some lactic and some butyric acid while yeast is open to attack from the bacteria of putrefaction in relation to the particular beverage the brewer wishes to produce these foreign ferments have been properly called ferments of disease the cells of the true leaven are globules usually somewhat elongated the other organisms are more or less rodlike or eellike in shape some of them being beaded so as to resemble necklaces each of these organisms produces a fermentation and a flavour peculiar to itself keep them out of your beer and it remains for ever unaltered never without them will your beer contract disease but their germs are in the air in the vessels employed in the brewery even in the yeast used to impregnate the wort consciously or unconsciously the art of the brewer is directed against them his aim is to paralyze if he cannot annihilate them for beer moreover the question of temperature is one of supreme importance indeed the recognised influence of temperature is causing on the continent of europe a complete revolution in the manufacture of beer when i was a student in berlin in 1851 there were certain places specially devoted to the sale of bavarian beer which was then making its way into public favour this beer is prepared by what is called the process of low fermentation the name being given partly because the yeast of the beer instead of rising to the top and issuing through the bunghole falls to the bottom of the cask but partly also because it is produced at a low temperature the other and older process called high fermentation is far more handy expeditious and cheap in high fermentation eight days suffice for the production of the beer in low fermentation ten fifteen even twenty days are found necessary vast quantities of ice moreover are consumed in the process of low fermentation in the single brewery of dreher of vienna a hundred million pounds of ice are consumed annually in cooling the wort and beer notwithstanding these obvious and weighty drawbacks the low fermentation is rapidly displacing the high upon the continent here are some statistics which show the number of breweries of both kinds existing in bohemia in 1860 1865 and 1870 1860 1865 1870 high fermentation 281 81 18 low fermentation 135 459 831 thus in ten years the number of highfermentation breweries fell from 281 to 18 while the number of lowfermentation breweries rose from 135 to 831 the sole reason for this vast changea change which involves a great expenditure of time labour and moneyis the additional command which it gives the brewer over the fortuitous ferments of disease these ferments which it is to be remembered are living organisms have their activity suspended by temperatures below 10c and as long as they are reduced to torpor the beer remains untainted either by acidity or putrefaction the beer of low fermentation is brewed in winter and kept in cool cellars the brewer being thus enabled to dispose of it at his leisure instead of forcing its consumption to avoid the loss involved in its alteration if kept too long hops it may be remarked act to some extent as an antiseptic to beer the essential oil of the hop is bactericidal hence the strong impregnation with hop juice of all beer intended for exportation these low organisms which one might be disposed to regard as the beginnings of life were we not warned that the microscope precious and perfect as it is has no power to show us the real beginnings of life are by no means purely useless or purely mischievous in the economy of nature they are only noxious when out of their proper place they exercise a useful and valuable function as the burners and consumers of dead matter animal and vegetable reducing such matter with a rapidity otherwise unattainable to innocent carbonic acid and water furthermore they are not all alike and it is only restricted classes of them that are really dangerous to man one difference in their habits is worthy of special reference here air or rather the oxygen of the air which is absolutely necessary to the support of the bacteria of putrefaction is according to pasteur absolutely deadly to the vibrios which provoke the butyric acid fermentation this has been illustrated by the following beautiful observation a drop of the liquid containing those small organisms is placed upon glass and on the drop is placed a circle of exceedingly thin glass for to magnify them sufficiently it is necessary that the objectglass of the microscope should come very close to the organisms round the edge of the circular plate of glass the liquid is in contact with the air and incessantly absorbs it including the oxygen here if the drop be charged with bacteria we have a zone of very lively ones but through this living zone greedy of oxygen and appropriating it the vivifying gas cannot penetrate to the centre of the film in the middle therefore the bacteria die while their peripheral colleagues continue active if a bubble of air chance to be enclosed in the film round it the bacteria will pirouette and wabble until its oxygen has been absorbed after which all their motions cease precisely the reverse of all this occurs with the vibrios of butyric acid in their case it is the peripheral organisms that are first killed the central ones remaining vigorous while ringed by a zone of dead pasteur moreover filled two vessels with a liquid containing these vibrios through one vessel be led air and killed its vibrios in half an hour through the other he led carbonic acid and after three hours found the vibrios fully active it was while observing these differences of deportment fifteen years ago that the thought of life without air and its bearing upon the theory of fermentation flashed upon the mind of this admirable investigator we now approach an aspect of this question which concerns us still more closely and will be best illustrated by an actual fact a few years ago i was bathing in an alpine stream and returning to my clothes from the cascade which had been my showerbath i slipped upon a block of granite the sharp crystals of which stamped themselves into my naked shin the wound was an awkward one but being in vigorous health at the time i hoped for a speedy recovery dipping a clean pockethandkerchief into the stream i wrapped it round the wound limped home and remained for four or five days quietly in bed there was no pain and at the end of this time i thought myself quite fit to quit my room the wound when uncovered was found perfectly clean uninflamed and entirely free from matter placing over it a bit of goldbeatersskin i walked about all day towards evening itching and heat were felt a large accumulation of matter followed and i was forced to go to bed again the waterbandage was restored but it was powerless to check the action now set up arnica was applied but it made matters worse the inflammation increased alarmingly until finally i had to be carried on mens shoulders down the mountain and transported to geneva where thanks to the kindness of friends i was immediately placed in the best medical hands on the morning after my arrival in geneva dr gautier discovered an abscess in my instep at a distance of five inches from the wound the two were connected by a channel or sinus as it is technically called through which he was able to empty the abscess without the application of the lance by what agency was that channel formedwhat was it that thus tore asunder the sound tissue of my instep and kept me for six weeks a prisoner in bed in the very room where the water dressing had been removed from my wound and the goldbeatersskin applied to it i opened this year a number of tubes containing perfectly clear and sweet infusions of fish flesh and vegetable these hermetically sealed infusions had been exposed for weeks both to the sun of the alps and to the warmth of a kitchen without showing the slightest turbidity or sign of life but two days after they were opened the greater number of them swarmed with the bacteria of putrefaction the germs of which had been contracted from the dustladen air of the room and had the matter from my abscess been examined my memory of its appearance leads me to infer that it would have been found equally swarming with these bacteriathat it was their germs which got into my incautiously opened wound and that they were the subtile workers that burrowed down my shin dug the abscess in my instep and produced effects which might easily have proved fatal this apparent digression brings us face to face with the labours of a man who combines the penetration of the true theorist with the skill and conscientiousness of the true experimenter and whose practice is one continued demonstration of the theory that the putrefaction of wounds is to be averted by the destruction of the germs of bacteria not only from his own reports of his cases but from the reports of eminent men who have visited his hospital and from the opinions expressed to me by continental surgeons do i gather that one of the greatest steps ever made in the art of surgery was the introduction of the antiseptic system of treatment introduced by professor lister the interest of this subject does not slacken as we proceed we began with the cherrycask and beervat we end with the body of man there are persons born with the power of interpreting natural facts as there are others smitten with everlasting incompetence in regard to such interpretation to the former class in an eminent degree belonged the illustrious philosopher robert boyle whose words in relation to this subject have in them the forecast of prophecy and let me add writes boyle in his essay on the pathological part of physic that he that thoroughly understands the nature of ferments and fermentations shall probably be much better able than he that ignores them to give a fair account of divers phenomena of several diseases as well fevers as others which will perhaps be never properly understood without an insight into the doctrine of fermentations two hundred years have passed since these pregnant words were written and it is only in this our day that men are beginning to fully realise their truth in the domain of surgery the justice of boyles surmise has been most strictly demonstrated but we now pass the bounds of surgery proper and enter the domain of epidemic disease including those fevers so sagaciously referred to by boyle the most striking analogy between a contagium and a ferment is to be found in the power of indefinite selfmultiplication possessed and exercised by both you know the exquisitely truthful figures regarding leaven employed in the new testament a particle hid in three measures of meal leavens it all a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump in a similar manner a particle of contagium spreads through the human body and may be so multiplied as to strike down whole populations consider the effect produced upon the system by a microscopic quantity of the virus of smallpox that virus is to all intents and purposes a seed it is sown as yeast is sown it grows and multiplies as yeast grows and multiplies and it always reproduces itself to pasteur we are indebted for a series of masterly researches wherein he exposes the looseness and general baselessness of prevalent notions regarding the transmutation of one ferment into another he guards himself against saying it is impossible the true investigator is sparing in the use of this word though the use of it is unsparingly ascribed to him but as a matter of fact pasteur has never been able to effect the alleged transmutation while he has been always able to point out the open doorways through which the affirmers of such transmutations had allowed error to march in upon them footnote those who wish for an illustration of the care necessary in these researches and of the carelessness with which they have in some cases been conducted will do well to consult the rev w h dallingers excellent notes on heterogenesis in the october number of the popular science review the great source of error here has been already alluded to in this discourse the observers worked in an atmosphere charged with the germs of different organisms the mere accident of first possession rendering now one organism now another triumphant in different stages moreover of its fermentative or putrefactive changes the same infusion may so alter as to be successively taken possession of by different organisms such cases have been adduced to show that the earlier organisms must have been transformed into the later ones whereas they are simply cases in which different germs because of changes in the infusion render themselves valid at different times by teaching us how to cultivate each ferment in its purityin other words by teaching us how to rear the individual organism apart from all otherspasteur has enabled us to avoid all these errors and where this isolation of a particular organism has been duly effected it grows and multiplies indefinitely but no change of it into another organism is ever observed in pasteurs researches the bacterium remained a bacterium the vibrio a vibrio the penicillium a penicillium and the torula a torula sow any of these in a state of purity in an appropriate liquid you get it and it alone in the subsequent crop in like manner sow smallpox in the human body your crop is smallpox sow there scarlatina and your crop is scarlatina sow typhoid virus your crop is typhoidcholera your crop is cholera the disease bears as constant a relation to its contagium as the microscopic organisms just enumerated do to their germs or indeed as a thistle does to its seed no wonder then with analogies so obvious and so striking that the conviction is spreading and growing daily in strength that reproductive parasitic life is at the root of epidemic diseasethat living ferments finding lodgment in the body increase there and multiply directly ruining the tissue on which they subsist or destroying life indirectly by the generation of poisonous compounds within the body this conclusion which comes to us with a presumption almost amounting to demonstration is clinched by the fact that virulently infective diseases have been discovered with which living organisms are as closely and as indissolubly associated as the growth of torula is with the fermentation of beer and here if you will permit me i would utter a word of warning to wellmeaning people we have now reached a phase of this question when it is of the very last importance that light should once for all be thrown upon the manner in which contagious and infectious diseases take root and spread to this end the action of various ferments upon the organs and tissues of the living body must be studied the habitat of each special organism concerned in the production of each specific disease must be determined and the mode by which its germs are spread abroad as sources of further infection it is only by such rigidly accurate enquiries that we can obtain final and complete mastery over these destroyers hence while abhorring cruelty of all kinds while shrinking sympathetically from all animal sufferingsuffering which my own pursuits never call upon me to inflictan unbiassed survey of the field of research now opening out before the physiologist causes me to conclude that no greater calamity could befall the human race than the stoppage of experimental enquiry in this direction a lady whose philanthropy has rendered her illustrious said to me some time ago that science was becoming immoral that the researches of the past unlike those of the present were carried on without cruelty i replied to her that the science of kepler and newton to which she referred dealt with the laws and phenomena of inorganic nature but that one great advance made by modern science was in the direction of biology or the science of life and that in this new direction scientific enquiry though at the outset pursued at the cost of some temporary suffering would in the end prove a thousand times more beneficent than it had ever hitherto been i said this because i saw that the very researches which the lady deprecated were leading us to such a knowledge of epidemic diseases as will enable us finally to sweep these scourges of the human race from the face of the earth this is a point of such capital importance that i should like to bring it home to your intelligence by a single trustworthy illustration in 1850 two distinguished french observers mm davainne and rayer noticed in the blood of animals which had died of the virulent disease called splenic fever small microscopic organisms resembling transparent rods but neither of them at that time attached any significance to the observation in 1861 pasteur published a memoir on the fermentation of butyric acid wherein he described the organism which provoked it and after reading this memoir it occurred to davainne that splenic fever might be a case of fermentation set up within the animal body by the organisms which had been observed by him and rayer this idea has been placed beyond all doubt by subsequent research observations of the highest importance have also been made on splenic fever by pollender and brauell two years ago dr burdon sanderson gave us a very clear account of what was known up to that time of this disorder with regard to the permanence of the contagium it had been proved to hang for years about localities where it had once prevailed and this seemed to show that the rodlike organisms could not constitute the contagium because their infective power was found to vanish in a few weeks but other facts established an intimate connection between the organisms and the disease so that a review of all the facts caused dr sanderson to conclude that the contagium existed in two distinct forms the one fugitive and visible as transparent rods the other permanent but latent and not yet brought within the grasp of the microscope at the time that dr sanderson was writing this report a young german physician named koch footnote this i believe was the first reference to the researches of koch made in this country 1879 occupied with the duties of his profession in an obscure country district was already at work applying during his spare time various original and ingenious devices to the investigation of splenic fever he studied the habits of the rodlike organisms and found the aqueous humour an oxs eye to be particularly suitable for their nutria with a drop of the aqueous humour he mixed tiniest speck of a liquid containing the rods placed the drop under his microscope warmed it suitably and observed the subsequent action during the first two hours hardly any change was noticeable but at the end of this time the rods began to lengthen and the action was so rapid that at the end of three or four hours they attained from ten to twenty times their original length at the end of a few additional hours they had formed filaments in many cases a hundred times the length of the original rods the same filament in fact was frequently observed to stretch through several fields of the microscope sometimes they lay in straight lines parallel to each other in other cases they were bent twisted and coiled into the most graceful figures while sometimes they formed knots of such bewildering complexity that it was impossible for the eye to trace the individual filaments through the confusion had the observation ended here an interesting scientific fact would have been added to our previous store but the addition would have been of little practical value koch however continued to watch the filaments and after a time noticed little dots appearing within them these dots became more and more distinct until finally the whole length of the organism was studded with minute ovoid bodies which lay within the outer integument like peas within their shell byandby the integument fell to pieces the place of the organisms being taken by a long row of seeds or spores these observations which were confirmed in all respects by the celebrated naturalist cohn of breslau are of the highest importance they clear up the existing perplexity regarding the latent and visible contagia of splenic fever for in the most conclusive manner koch proved the spores as distinguished from the rods to constitute the contagium of the fever in its most deadly and persistent form how did he reach this important result mark the answer there was but one way open to him to test the activity of the contagium and that was the inoculation with it of living animals he operated upon guineapigs and rabbits but the vast majority of his experiments were made upon mice inoculating them with the fresh blood of an animal suffering from splenic fever they invariably died of the same disease within twenty or thirty hours after inoculation he then sought to determine how the contagium maintained its vitality drying the infectious blood containing the rodlike organisms in which however the spores were not developed he found the contagium to be that which dr sanderson calls fugitive it maintained its power of infection for five weeks at the furthest he then dried blood containing the fullydeveloped spores and posed the substance to a variety of conditions he permitted the dried blood to assume the form of dust wetted this dust allowed it to dry again permitted it to remain for an indefinite time in the midst of putrefying matter and subjected it to various other tests after keeping the sporecharged blood which had been treated in this fashion for four years he inoculated a number of mice with it and found its action as fatal as that of blood fresh from the veins of an animal suffering from splenic fever there was no single escape from death after inoculation by this deadly contagium uncounted millions of these spores are developed in the body of every animal which has died of splenic fever and every spore of these millions is competent to produce the disease the name of this formidable parasite is bacillus anthracis footnote koch found that to produce its characteristic effects the contagium of splenic fever must enter the blood the virulently festive spleen of a diseased animal may be eaten with impunity by mice on the other hand the disease refuses to be communicated by inoculation to dogs partridges or sparrows in their blood bacillus anthracis ceases to act as a ferment pasteur announced more than six years ago the propagation of the vibrios of the silkworm disease called flacherie both by fission and by spores he also made some remarkable experiments on the permanence of the contagium in the form of spores see etudes sur la maladie des vers soie pp 168 and 256 now the very first step towards the extirpation of these contagia is the knowledge of their nature and the knowledge brought to us by dr koch will render as certain the stamping out of splenic fever as the stoppage of the plague of pbrine by the researches of pasteur footnote surmising that the immunity enjoyed by birds might arise from the heat of their blood which destroyed the bacillus pasteur lowered their temperature artificially inoculated them and killed them he also raised the temperature of guineapigs after inoculation and saved them it is needless to dwell for a moment on the importance of this experiment one small item of statistics will show what this implies in the single district of novgorod in russia between the years 1867 and 1870 over fiftysix thousand cases of death by splenic fever among horses cows and sheep were recorded nor did its ravages confine themselves to the animal world for during the time and in the district referred to five hundred and twentyeight human beings perished in the agonies of the same disease a description of the fever will help you to come to a right decision on the point which i wish to submit to your consideration an animal says dr burdon sanderson which perhaps for the previous day has declined food and shown signs of general disturbance begins to shudder and to have twitches of the muscles of the back and soon after becomes weak and listless in the meantime the respiration becomes frequent and often difficult and the temperature rises three or four degrees above the normal but soon convulsions affecting chiefly the muscles of the back and loins usher in the final collapse of which the progress is marked by the loss of all power of moving the trunk or extremities diminution of temperature mucous and sanguinolent alvine evacuations and similar discharges from the mouth and nose in a single district of russia as above remarked fiftysix thousand horses cows and sheep and five hundred and twentyeight men and women perished in this way during a period of two or three years what the annual fatality is throughout europe i have no means of knowing doubtless it must be very great the question then which i wish to submit to your judgment is this is the knowledge which reveals to us the nature and which assures the extirpation of a disorder so virulent and so vile worth the price paid for it it is exceedingly important that assemblies like the present should see clearly the issues at stake in such questions as this and that the properly informed sense of the community should temper if not restrain the rashness of those who meaning to be tender become agents of cruelty by the imposition of shortsighted restrictions upon physiological investigations it is a modern instance of zeal for god but not according to knowledge the excesses of which must be corrected by an instructed public opinion and now let us cast a backward glance on the field we have traversed and try to extract from our labours such further profit as they can yield for more than two thousand years the attraction of light bodies by amber was the sum of human knowledge regarding electricity and for more than two thousand years fermentation was effected without any knowledge of its cause in science one discovery grows out of another and cannot appear without its proper antecedent thus before fermentation could be understood the microscope had to be invented and brought to a considerable degree of perfection note the growth of knowledge leeuwenhoek in 1680 found yeast to be a mass of floating globules but he had no notion that the globules were alive this was proved in 1835 by cagniard de la tour and schwann then came the question as to the origin of such microscopic organisms and in this connection the memoir of pasteur published in the annales de chimie for 1862 is the inauguration of a new epoch on that investigation all pasteurs subsequent labours were based ravages had over and over again occurred among french wines there was no guarantee that they ould not become acid or bitter particularly when exported the commerce in wines was thus restricted and disastrous losses were ften inflicted on the winegrower every one of these diseases was traced to the life of an organism pasteur ascertained the temperature which killed these ferments of disease proving it to be so low as to be perfectly harmless to the wine by the simple expedient of heating the wine to a temperature of fifty degrees centigrade he rendered it inalterable and thus saved his country the loss of millions he then went on to vinegarvin aigre acid winewhich he proved to be produced by a fermentation set up by a little fungus called mycoderma aceti torula in fact converts the grape juice into alcohol and mycoderma aceti converts the alcohol into vinegar here also frequent failures occurred and severe losses were sustained through the operation of unknown causes the vinegar often became unfit for use sometimes indeed falling into utter putridity it had been long known that mere exposure to the air was sufficient to destroy it pasteur studied all these changes traced them to their living causes and showed that the permanent health of the vinegar was ensured by the destruction of this life he passed from the diseases of vinegar to the study of a malady which a dozen years ago had all but ruined the silk husbandry of france this plague which received the name of pbrine was the product of a parasite which first took possession of the intestinal canal of the silkworm spread throughout its body and filled the sack which ought to contain the viscid matter of the silk thus smitten the worm would go automatically through the process of spinning when it had nothing to spin pasteur followed this parasitic destroyer from year to year and led by his singular power of combining facts with the logic of facts discovered eventually the precise phase in the development of the insect when the disease which assailed it could with certainty be stamped out pasteurs devotion to this enquiry cost him dear he restored to france her silk husbandry rescued thousands of her population from ruin set the looms of italy also to work but emerged from his labours with one of his sides permanently paralysed his last investigation is embodied in a work entitled studies on beer in which he describes a method of rendering beer permanently unchangeable that method is not so simple as those found effectual with wine and vinegar but the principles which it involves are sure to receive extensive application at some future day there are other reflections connected with this subject which even were they now passed over without remark would sooner or later occur to every thoughtful mind in this assembly i have spoken of the floating dust of the air of the means of rendering it visible and of the perfect immunity from putrefaction which accompanies the contact of germless infusions and moteless air consider the woes which these wafted particles during historic and prehistoric ages have inflicted on mankind consider the loss of life in hospitals from putrefying wounds consider the loss in places where there are plenty of wounds but no hospitals and in the ages before hospitals were anywhere founded consider the slaughter which has hitherto followed that of the battlefield when those bacterial destroyers are let loose often producing a mortality far greater than that of the battle itself add to this the other conception that in times of epidemic disease the selfsame floating matter has frequently if not always mingled with it the special germs which produce the epidemic being thus enabled to sow pestilence and death over nations and continentsconsider all this and you will come with me to the conclusion that all the havoc of war ten times multiplied would be evanescent if compared with the ravages due to atmospheric dust this preventible destruction is going on today and it has been permitted to go on for ages without a whisper of information regarding its cause being vouchsafed to the suffering sentient world we have been scourged by invisible thongs attacked from impenetrable ambuscades and it is only today that the light of science is being let in upon the murderous dominion of our foes facts like these excite in me the thought that the rule and governance of this universe are different from what we in our youth supposed them to bethat the inscrutable power at once terrible and beneficent in whom we live and move and have our being and our end is to be propitiated by means different to those usually resorted to the first requisite towards such propitiation is knowledge the second is action shaped and illuminated by that knowledge of knowledge we already see the dawn which will open out byandby to perfect day while the action which is to follow has its unfailing source and stimulus in the moral and emotional nature of manin his desire for personal wellbeing in his sense of duty in his compassionate sympathy with the sufferings of his fellowmen how often says dr william budd in his celebrated work on typhoid fever how often have i seen in past days in the single narrow chamber of the daylabourers cottage the father in the coffin the mother in the sickbed in muttering delirium and nothing to relieve the desolation of the children but the devotion of some poor neighbour who in too many cases paid the penalty of kindness in becoming herself the victim of the same disorder from the vantage ground already won i look forward with confident hope to the triumph of medical art over scenes of misery like that here described the cause of the calamity being once clearly revealed not only to the physician but to the public whose intelligent cooperation is absolutely essential to success the final victory of humanity is only a question of time we have already a foretaste of that victory in the triumphs f surgery as practised at your doors xiii spontaneous generation footnote the nineteenth century january 1878 within ten minutes walk of a little cottage which i have recently built in the alps there is a small lake fed by the melted snows of the upper mountains during the early weeks of summer no trace of life is to be discerned in this water but invariably towards the end of july or the beginning of august swarms of tailed organisms are seen enjoying the suns warmth along the shallow margins of the lake and rushing with audible patter into deeper water at the approach of danger the origin of this periodic crowd of living things is by no means obvious for years i had never noticed in the lake either an adult frog or the smallest fragment of frog spawn so that were i not otherwise informed i should have found the conclusion of mathiole a natural one namely that tadpoles are generated in lake mud by the vivifying action of the sun the checks which experience alone can furnish being absent the spontaneous generation of creatures quite as high as the frog in the scale of being was assumed for ages to be a fact here as elsewhere the dominant mind of aristotle stamped its notions on the world at large for nearly twenty centuries after him men found no difficulty in believing in cases of spontaneous generation which would now be rejected as monstrous by the most fanatical supporter of the doctrine shellfish of all kinds were considered to be without parental origin eels were supposed to spring spontaneously from the fat ooze of the nile caterpillars were the spontaneous products of the leaves on which they fed while winged insects serpents rats and mice were all thought capable of being generated without sexual intervention the most copious source of this life without an ancestry was putrefying flesh and lacking the checks imposed by fuller investigation the conclusion that flesh possesses and exerts this generative power is a natural one i well remember when a child of ten or twelve seeing a joint of imperfectly salted beef cut into and coils of maggots laid bare within the mass without a moments hesitation i jumped to the conclusion that these maggots had been spontaneously generated in the meat i had no knowledge which could qualify or oppose this conclusion and for the time it was irresistible the childhood of the individual typifies that of the race and the belief here enunciated was that of the world for nearly two thousand years to the examination of this very point the celebrated francesco redi physician to the grand dukes ferdinand ii and cosmo iii of tuscany and a member of the academy del cimento addressed himself in 1668 he had seen the maggots of putrefying flesh and reflected on their possible origin but he was not content with mere reflection nor with the theoretic guesswork which his predecessors had founded upon their imperfect observations watching meat during its passage from freshness to decay prior to the appearance of maggots he invariably observed flies buzzing round the meat and frequently alighting on it the maggots he thought might be the halfdeveloped progeny of these flies the inductive guess precedes experiment by which however it must be finally tested redi knew this and acted accordingly placing fresh meat in a jar and covering the mouth with paper he found that though the meat putrefied in the ordinary way it never bred maggots while the same meat placed in open jars soon swarmed with these organisms for the paper cover he then substituted fine gauze through which the odour of the meat could rise over it the flies buzzed and on it they laid their eggs but the meshes being too small to permit the eggs to fall through no maggots were generated in the meat they were on the contrary hatched upon the gauze by a series of such experiments redi destroyed the belief in the spontaneous generation of maggots in meat and with it doubtless many related beliefs the combat was continued by vallisneri schwammerdam and raumur who succeeded in banishing the notion of spontaneous generation from the scientific minds of their day indeed as regards such complex organisms as those which formed the subject of their researches the notion was banished for ever but the discovery and improvement of the microscope though giving a deathblow to much that had been previously written and believed regarding spontaneous generation brought also into view a world of life formed of individuals so minuteso close as it seemed to the ultimate particles of matteras to suggest an easy passage from atoms to organisms animal and vegetable infusions exposed to the air were found clouded and crowded with creatures far beyond the reach of unaided vision but perfectly visible to an eye strengthened by the microscope with reference to their origin these organisms were called infusoria stagnant pools were found full of them and the obvious difficulty of assigning a germinal origin to existences so minute furnished the precise condition necessary to give new play to the notion of heterogenesis or spontaneous generation the scientific world was soon divided into two hostile camps the leaders of which only can here be briefly alluded to on the one side we have buffon and needham the former postulating his organic molecules and the latter assuming the existence of a special vegetative force which drew the molecules together so as to form living things on the other side we have the celebrated abb lazzaro spallanzani who in 1777 published results counter to those announced by needham in 1748 and obtained by methods so precise as to completely overthrow the convictions based upon the labours of his predecessor charging his flasks with organic infusions he sealed their necks with the blowpipe subjected them in this condition to the heat of boiling water and subsequently exposed them to temperatures favourable to the development of life the infusions continued unchanged for months and when the flasks were subsequently opened no trace of life was found here i may forestall matters so far as to say that the success of spallanzanis experiments depended wholly on the locality in which he worked the air around him must have been free from the more obdurate infusorial germs for otherwise the process he followed would as was long afterwards proved by wyman have infallibly yielded life but his refutation of the doctrine of spontaneous generation is not the less valid on this account nor is it in any way upset by the fact that others in repeating his experiments obtained life where he obtained none rather is the refutation strengthened by such differences given two experimenters equally skilful and equally careful operating in different places on the same infusion in the same way and assuming the one to obtain life while the other fails to obtain it then its wellestablished absence in the one case proves that some ingredient foreign to the infusion must be its cause in the other spallanzanis sealed flasks contained but small quantities of air and as oxygen was afterwards shown to be generally essential to life it was thought that the absence of life observed by spallanzani might have been due to the lack of this vitalising gas to dissipate this doubt schulze in 1836 half filled a flask with distilled water to which animal and vegetable matters were added first boiling his infusion to destroy whatever life it might contain schulze sucked daily into his flask air which had passed through a series of bulbs containing concentrated sulphuric acid where all germs of life suspended in the air were supposed to be destroyed from may to august this process was continued without any development of infusorial life here again the success of schulze was due to his working in comparatively pure air but even in such air his experiment is a very risky one germs will pass unwetted and unscathed through sulphuric acid unless the most special care is taken to detain them i have repeatedly failed by repeating schulzes experiments to obtain his results others have failed likewise the air passes in bubbles through the bulbs and to render the method secure the passage of the air must be so slow as to cause the whole of its floating matter even to the very core of each bubble to touch the surrounding liquid but if this precaution be observed water will be found quite as effectual as sulphuric acid by the aid of an airpump in a highly infective atmosphere i have thus drawn air for weeks without intermission first through bulbs containing water and afterwards through vessels containing organic infusions without any appearance of life the germs were not killed by the water but they were effectually intercepted while the objection that the air had been injured by being brought into contact with strongly corrosive substances was avoided the brief paper of schulze published in poggendorfs annalen for 1836 was followed in 1837 by another short and pregnant communication by schwann redi as we have seen traced the maggots of putrefying flesh to the eggs of flies but he did not and he could not know the meaning of putrefaction itself he had not the instrumental means to inform him that it also is a phenomenon attendant on the development of life this was first proved in the paper now alluded to schwann placed flesh in a flask filled to onethird of its capacity with water sterilised the flask by boiling and then supplied it for months with calcined air throughout this time there appeared no mould no infusoria no putrefaction the flesh remained unaltered while the liquid continued as clear as it was immediately after boiling schwann then varied his experimental argument with no alteration in the result his final conclusion was that putrefaction is due to decompositions of organic matter attendant on the multiplication therein of minute organisms these organisms were derived not from the air but from something contained in the air which was destroyed by a sufficiently high temperature there never was a more determined opponent of the doctrine of spontaneous generation than schwann though a strange attempt was made a year and a half ago to enlist him and others equally opposed to it on the side of the doctrine the physical character of the agent which produces putrefaction was further revealed by helmholtz in 1843 by means of a membrane he separated a sterilised putrescible liquid from a putrefying one the sterilised infusion remained perfectly intact hence it was not the liquid of the putrefying massfor that could freely diffuse through the membranebut something contained in the liquid and which was stopped by the membrane that caused the putrefaction in 1854 schroeder and von dusch struck into this enquiry which was subsequently followed up by schroeder alone these able experimenters employed plugs of cottonwool to filter the air supplied to their infusions fed with such air in the great majority of cases the putrescible liquids remained perfectly sweet after boiling milk formed a conspicuous exception to the general rule it putrefied after boiling though supplied with carefully filtered air the researches of schroeder bring us up to the year 1859 in that year a book was published which seemed to overturn some of the best established facts of previous investigators its title was htrognie and its author was f a pouchet director of the museum of natural history at rouen ardent laborious learned full not only of scientific but of metaphysical fervour he threw his whole energy into the enquiry never did a subject require the exercise of the cold critical faculty more than this onecalm study in the unravelling of complex phenomena care in the preparation of experiments care in their execution skilful variation of conditions and incessant questioning of results until repetition had placed them beyond doubt or question to a man of pouchets temperament the subject was full of dangerdanger not lessened by the theoretic bias with which he approached it this is revealed by the opening words of his preface lorsque par la meditation it fut evident pour moi que la generation spontane tait encore fun des moyens quemploie la nature pour la reproduction des tres je mappliquai dcouvrir par quell procds on pouvait parvenir en mettre les phnomnes en evidence it is needless to say that such a prepossession required a strong curb pouchet repeated the experiments of schulze and schwann with results diametrically opposed to theirs he heaped experiment upon experiment and argument upon argument spicing with the sarcasm of the advocate the logic of the man of science in view of the multitudes required to produce the observed results he ridiculed the assumption of atmospheric germs this was one of his strongest points si les protoorganismes que nous voyons pulluler partout et dans tout avaient leurs germes dissembles dans latmosphre dans la proportion mathmatiquement indispensable a cet effet lair en serait totalement obscurci car ill devraient s y trouver beaucoup plus serrs que les globules deau qui forment nos nuages pais il ny a pas l la moindre exagration recurring to the subject he exclaims lair dans lequel noun vivons aurait presque la densit du fer there is often a virulent contagion in a confident tone and this hardihood of argumentative assertion was sure to influence minds swayed not by knowledge but by authority had pouchet known that the blue ethereal sky is formed of suspended particles through which the sun freely shines he would hardly have ventured upon this line of argument pouchets pursuit of this enquiry strengthened the conviction with which he began it and landed him in downright credulity in the end i do not question his ability as an observer but the enquiry needed a disciplined experimenter this latter implies not mere ability to look at things as nature offers them to our inspection but to force her to show herself under conditions prescribed by the experimenter himself here pouchet lacked the necessary discipline yet the vigour of his onset raised clouds of doubt which for a time obscured the whole field of enquiry so difficult indeed did the subject seem and so incapable of definite solution that when pasteur made known his intention to take it up his friends biot and dumas expressed their regret earnestly exhorting him to set a definite and rigid limit to the time he purposed spending in this apparently unprofitable field footnote je ne conseillerais personne said dumas to his already famous pupil de rester trop longtemps dans ce sujetannales de chimie et de physique 1862 vol lxiv p 22 since that time the illustrious perpetual secretary of the academy of sciences has had good reason to revise this counsel schooled by his education as a chemist and by special researches on the closely related question of fermentation pasteur took up this subject under particularly favourable conditions his work and his culture had given strength and finish to his natural aptitudes in 1862 accordingly he published a paper on the organised corpuscles existing in the atmosphere which must for ever remain classical by the most ingenious devices he collected the floating particles of the air surrounding his laboratory in the rue dulm and subjected them to microscopic examination many of them he found to be organised particles sowing them in sterilised infusions he obtained abundant crops of microscopic organisms by more refined methods he repeated and confirmed the experiments of schwann which had been contested by pouchet montegazza joly and musset he also confirmed the experiments of schroeder and von dusch he showed that the cause which communicated life to his infusions was not uniformly diffused through the air that there were aerial interspaces which possessed no power to generate life standing on the mer de glace near the montanvert he snipped off the ends of a number of hermetically sealed flasks containing organic infusions one out of twenty of the flasks thus supplied with glacier air showed signs of life afterwards while eight out of twenty of the same infusions supplied with the air of the plains became crowded with life he took his flasks into the caves under the observatory of paris and found the still air in these caves devoid of generative power these and other experiments carried out with a severity perfectly obvious to the instructed scientific reader and accompanied by a logic equally severe restored the conviction that even in these lower raches of the scale of being life does not appear without the operation of antecedent life the main position of pasteur has been strengthened by practical researches of the most momentous kind he has applied the knowledge won from his enquiries to the preservation of wine and beer to the manufacture of vinegar to the staying of the plague which threatened utter destruction of the silk husbandry of france and to the examination of other formidable diseases which assail the higher animals including man his relation to the improvements which professor lister has introduced into surgery is shown by a letter quoted in his etudes sur la bire footnote 1 p 43 professor lister there expressly thanks pasteur for having given him the only principle which could have conducted the antiseptic system to a successful issue the strictures regarding defects of reasoning to which we have been lately accustomed throw abundant light upon their author but no shade upon pasteur redi as we have seen proved the maggots of putrefying flesh to be derived from the eggs of flies schwann proved putrefaction itself to be the concomitant of far lower forms of life than those dealt with by redi our knowledge here as elsewhere in connection with this subject has been vastly extended by professor cohn of breslau no putrefaction he says can occur in a nitrogenous substance if its bacteria be destroyed and new ones prevented from entering it putrefaction begins as soon as bacteria even in the smallest numbers are admitted either accidentally or purposely it progresses in direct proportion to the multiplication of the bacteria it is retarded when they exhibit low vitality and is stopped by all influences which either hinder their development or kill them all bactericidal media are therefore antiseptic and disinfecting footnote in his last excellent memoir cohn expresses himself thus wer noch heut die faeulniss von einer spontanen dissociation der proteinmolecule oder von einem unorganisirten ferment ableitet oder gar aus stickstoffsplittern die balken zur stuetze seiner faeulnisstheorie zu zimmern versucht hat zuerst den satz keine faeulniss ohne bacterium termo zu widerlegen it was these organisms acting in wound and abscess which so frequently converted our hospitals into charnelhouses and it is their destruction by the antiseptic system that now renders justifiable operations which no surgeon would have attempted a few years ago the gain is immenseto the practising surgeon as well as to the patient practised upon contrast the anxiety of never feeling sure whether the most brilliant operation might not be rendered nugatory by the access of a few particles of unseen hospital dust with the comfort derived from the knowledge that all power of mischief on the part of such dust has been surely and certainly annihilated but the action of living contagia extends beyond the domain of the surgeon the power of reproduction and indefinite selfmultiplication which is characteristic of living things coupled with the undeviating fact of contagia breeding true has given strength and consistency to a belief long entertained by penetrating minds that epidemic diseases generally are the concomitants of parasitic life there begins to be faintly visible to us a vast and destructive laboratory of nature wherein the diseases which are most fatal to animal life and the changes to which dead organic matter passively liable appear bound together by what must least be called a very close analogy of causation footnote report of the medical officer of the privy council 1874 p 5 according to this view which as i have said is daily gaining converts a contagious disease may be defined a conflict between the person smitten by it and a specific organism which multiplies at his expense appropriating his air and moisture disintegrating his tissues or poisoning him by the decompositions incident to its growth during the ten years extending from 1859 to 1869 researches on radiant heat in its relations to the gaseous form of matter occupied my continual attention when air was experimented on i had to cleanse it effectually of floating matter and while doing so i was surprised to notice that at the ordinary rate of transfer such matter passed freely through alkalis acids alcohols and ethers the eye being kept sensitive by darkness a concentrated beam of light was found to be a most searching test for suspended matter both in water and in aira test indeed indefinitely more searching and severe than that furnished by the most powerful microscope with the aid of such a beam i examined air filtered by cottonwool air long kept free from agitation so as to allow the floating matter to subside calcined air and air filtered by the deeper cells of the human lungs in all cases the correspondence between my experiments and those of schroeder pasteur and lister in regard to spontaneous generation was perfect the air which they found inoperative was proved by the luminous beam to be optically pure and therefore germless having worked at the subject both by experiment and reflection on friday evening january 21 1870 i brought it before the members of the royal institution two or three months subsequently for sufficient practical reasons i ventured to direct public attention to the subject in a letter to the times such was my first contact with this important question this letter i believe gave occasion for the first public utterance of dr bastian in relation to this subject he did me the honour to inform me as others had informed pasteur that the subject pertains to the biologist and physician he expressed amazement at my reasoning and warned me that before what i had done could be undone much irreparable mischief might be occasioned with far less preliminary experience to guide and warn him the english heterogenist was far bolder than pouchet in his experiments and far more adventurous in his conclusions with organic infusions he obtained the results of his celebrated predecessor but he did much morethe atoms and molecules of inorganic liquids passing under his manipulation into those more complex chemical compounds which we dignify by calling them living organisms footnote it is further held that bacteria or allied organisms are prone to be engendered as correlative products coming into existence in the several fermentations just as independently as other less complex chemical compoundsbastian trans of pathological society vol xxvi 258 as regards the public who take an interest in such things and apparently also as regards a large portion of the medical profession our clever countryman succeeded in restoring the subject to a state of uncertainty similar to that which followed the publication of pouchets volume in 1859 it is desirable that this uncertainty should be removed from all minds and doubly desirable on practical grounds that it should be removed from the minds of medical men in the present article therefore i propose discussing this question face to face with some eminent and fairminded member of the medical profession who as regards spontaneous generation entertains views adverse to mine such a one it would be easy to name but it is perhaps better to rest in the impersonal i shall therefore simply call my proposed coenquirer my friend with him at my side i shall endeavour to the best of my ability so to conduct this discussion that he who runs may read and that he who reads may understand let us begin at the beginning i ask my friend to step into the laboratory of the royal institution where i place before him a basin of thin turnip slices barely covered with distilled water kept a temperature of 120 fahr after digesting the turnip for four or five hours we pour off the liquid boil it filter it and obtain an infusion as clear as filtered drinking water we cool the infusion test its specific gravity and find it to be 1006 or higherwater being 1000 a number of small clean empty flasks of the shape shown on the margin are before us one of them is slightly warmed with a spiritlamp and its open end is then dipped into the turnip infusion the warmed glass is afterwards chilled the air within the flasks cools contracts and is followed in its contraction by the infusion thus we get a small quantity of liquid into the flask we now heat this liquid carefully steam is produced which issues from the open neck carrying the air of the flask along with it after a few seconds ebullition the open neck is again plunged into the infusion the steam within the flask condenses the liquid enters to supply its place and in this way we fill our little flask to about fourfifths of its volume this description is typical we may thus fill a thousand flasks with a thousand different infusions i now ask my friend to notice a trough made of sheet copper with two rows of handy little bunsen burners underneath it this trough or bath is nearly filled with oil a piece of thin plank constitutes a kind of lid for the oilbath the wood is perforated with circular apertures wide enough to allow our small flask to pass through and plunge itself in the oil which has been heated say to 250 fahr clasped all round by the hot liquid the infusion in the flask rises to its boiling point which is not sensibly over 212 fahr steam issues from the open neck of the flask and the boiling is continued for five minutes with a pair of small brass tongs an assistant now seizes the neck near its junction with the flask and partially lifts the latter out of the oil the steam does not cease to issue but its violence is abated with a second pair of tongs held in one hand the neck of the flask is seized close to its open end while with the other hand a bunsens flame or an ordinary spirit flame is brought under the middle of the neck the glass reddens whitens softens and as it is gently drawn out the neck diminishes in diameter until the canal is completely blocked up the tongs with the fragment of severed neck being withdrawn the flask with its contents diminished by evaporation is lifted from the oilbath perfectly sealed hermetically sixty such flasks filled boiled and sealed in the manner described and containing strong infusions of beef mutton turnip and cucumber are carefully packed in sawdust and transported to the alps thither to an elevation of about 7000 feet above the sea i invite my coenquirer to accompany me it is the month of july and the weather is favourable to putrefaction we open our box at the belalp and count out fiftyfour flasks with their liquids as clear as filtered drinking water in six flasks however the infusion is found muddy we closely examine these and discover that every one of them has had its fragile end broken off in the transit from london air has entered the flasks and the observed muddiness is the result my colleague knows as well as i do what this means examined with a pocketlens or even with a microscope of insufficient power nothing is seen in the muddy liquid but regarded with a magnifying power of a thousand diameters or so what an astonishing appearance does it present leeuwenhoek estimated the population of a single drop of stagnant water at 500000000 probably the population of a drop of our turbid infusion would be this many times multiplied the field of the microscope is crowded with organisms some wabbling slowly others shooting rapidly across the microscopic field they dart hither and thither like a rain of minute projectiles they pirouette and spin so quickly round that the retention of the retinal impression transforms the little living rod into a twirling wheel and yet the most celebrated naturalists tell us they are vegetables from the rodlike shape which they so frequently assume these organisms are called bacteriaa term be it here remarked which covers organisms of very diverse kinds has this multitudinous life been spontaneously generated in these six flasks or is it the progeny of living germinal matter carried into the flasks by the entering air if the infusions have a selfgenerative power how are the sterility and consequent clearness of the fiftyfour uninjured flasks to be accounted for my colleague may urgeand fairly urgethat the assumption of germinal matter is by no means necessary that the air itself may be the one thing needed to wake up the dormant infusions we will examine this point immediately but meanwhile i would remind him that i am working on the exact lines laid down by our most conspicuous heterogenist he distinctly affirms that the withdrawal of the atmospheric pressure above the infusion favours the production of organisms and he accounts for their absence in tins of preserved meat fruit and vegetables by the hypothesis that fermentation has begun in such tins that gases have been generated the pressure of which has stifled the incipient life and stopped its further development footnote beginnings of life vol i this is the new theory of preserved meats had its author pierced a tin of preserved meat fruit or vegetable under water with the view of testing its truth he would have found it erroneous in wellpreserved tins he would have found not an outrush of gas but an inrush of water i have noticed this recently in tins which have lain perfectly good for sixtythree years in the royal institution modern tins subjected to the same test yielded the same result from time to time moreover during the last two years i have placed glass tubes containing clear infusions of turnip hay beef and mutton in iron bottles and subjected them to airpressures varying from ten to twentyseven atmospherespressures it is needless to say far more than sufficient to tear a preserved meat tin to shreds after ten days these infusions were taken from their bottles rotten with putrefaction and teeming with life thus collapses an hypothesis which had no rational foundation and which could never have seen the light had the slightest attempt been made to verify it our fiftyfour vacuous and pellucid flasks also declare against the heterogenist we expose them to a warm alpine sun by day and at night we suspend them in a warm kitchen four of them have been accidentally broken but at the end of a month we find the fifty remaining ones as clear as at the commencement there is no sign of putrefaction or of life in any of them we divide these flasks into two groups of twentythree and twentyseven respectively an accident of counting rendered the division uneven the question now is whether the admission of air can liberate any generative energy in the infusions our next experiment will answer this question and something more we carry the flasks to a hayloft and there with a pair of steel pliers snip off the sealed ends of the group of threeandtwenty each snipping off is of course followed by an inrush of air we now carry our twentyseven flasks our pliers and a spiritlamp to a ledge overlooking the aletsch glacier about 200 feet above the hayloft from which ledge the mountain falls almost precipitously to the northeast for about a thousand feet a gentle wind blows towards us from the northeastthat is across the crests and snowfields of the oberland mountains we are therefore bathed by air which must have been for a good while out of practical contact with either animal or vegetable life i stand carefully to leeward of the flasks for no dust or particle from my clothes or body must be blown towards them an assistant ignites the spiritlamp into the flame of which i plunge the pliers thereby destroying all attached germs or organisms then i snip off the sealed end of the flask prior to every snipping the same process is gone through no flask being opened without the previous cleansing of the pliers by the flame in this way we charge our sevenandtwenty flasks with clean vivifying mountain air we place the fifty flasks with their necks open over a kitchen stove in a temperature varying from 50 to 90 fahr and in three days find twentyone out of the twentythree flasks opened on the hayloft invaded by organismstwo only of the group remaining free from them after three weeks exposure to precisely the same conditions not one of the twentyseven flasks opened in free air had given way no germ from the kitchen air had ascended the narrow necks the flasks being shaped to produce this result they are still in the alps as clear i doubt not and as free from life as they were when sent off from london footnote an actual experiment made at the bel alp is here described what is my colleagues conclusion from the experiment before us twentyseven putrescible infusions first in vacuo and afterwards supplied with the most invigorating air have shown no sign of putrefaction or of life and as to the others i almost shrink from asking him whether the hayloft has rendered them spontaneously generative is not the inference here imperative that it is not the air of the loftwhich is connected through a constantly open door with the general atmospherebut something contained in the air that has produced the effects observed what is this something a sunbeam entering through a chink in the roof or wall and traversing the air of the loft would show it to be laden with suspended dust particles indeed the dust is distinctly visible in the diffused daylight can it have been the origin of the observed life if so are we not bound by all antecedent experience to regard these fruitful particles as the germs of the life observed the name of baron liebig has been constantly mixed up with these discussions we have it is said his authority for assuming that dead decaying matter can produce fermentation true but with liebig fermentation was by no means synonymous with life it meant according to him the shaking asunder by chemical disturbance of unstable molecules does the life of our flasks then proceed from dead particles if my coenquirer should reply yes then i would ask him what warrant does nature offer for such an assumption where amid the multitude of vital phenomena in which her operations have been clearly traced is the slightest countenance given to the notion that the sowing of dead particles can produce a living crop with regard to baron liebig had he studied the revelations of the microscope in relation to these questions a mind so penetrating could never have missed the significance of the facts revealed he however neglected the microscope and fell into errorbut not into error so gross as that in support of which his authority has been invoked were he now alive he would i doubt not repudiate the use often made of his nameliebigs view of fermentation was at least a scientific one founded on profound conceptions of molecular instability but this view by no means involves the notion that the planting of dead particlesstickstoffsplittern as cohn contemptuously calls themis followed by the sprouting of infusorial life let us now return to london and fix our attention on the dust of its air suppose a room in which the housemaid has just finished her work to be completely closed with the exception of an aperture in a shutter through which a sunbeam enters and crosses the room the floating dust reveals the track of the light let a lens be placed in the aperture to condense the beam its parallel rays are now converged to a cone at the apex of which the dust is raised to almost unbroken whiteness by the intensity of its illumination defended from all glare the eye is peculiarly sensitive to this scattered light the floating dust of london rooms is organic and may be burned without leaving visible residue the action of a spiritlamp flame upon the floating matter has been elsewhere thus described in a cylindrical beam which strongly illuminated the dust of our laboratory i placed an ignited spiritlamp mingling with the flame and round its rim were seen curious wreaths of darkness resembling an intensely black smoke on placing the flame at some distance below the beam the same dark masses stormed upwards they were blacker than the blackest smoke ever seen issuing from the funnel of a steamer and their resemblance to smoke was so perfect as to prompt the conclusion that the apparently pure flame of the alcohollamp required but a beam of sufficient intensity to reveal its clouds of liberated carbon but is the blackness smoke this question presented itself in a moment and was thus answered a redhot poker was placed underneath the beam from it the black wreaths also ascended a large hydrogen flame which emits no smoke was next employed and it also produced with augmented copiousness those whirling masses of darkness smoke being out of the question what is the blackness it is simply that of stellar space that is to say blackness resulting from the absence from the track of the beam of all matter competent to scatter its light when the flame was placed below the beam the floating matter was destroyed in situ and the heated air freed from this matter rose into the beam jostled aside the illuminated particles and substituted for their light the darkness due to its own perfect transparency nothing could more forcibly illustrate the invisibility of the agent which renders all things visible the beam crossed unseen the black chasm formed by the transparent air while at both sides of the gap the thickstrewn particles shone out like a luminous solid under the powerful illumination footnote see fragment on dust and disease vol i supposing an infusion intrinsically barren but readily susceptible of putrefaction when exposed to common air to be brought into contact with this unilluminable air what would be the result it would never putrefy it might however be urged that the air is spoiled by its violent calcination oxygen passed through a spiritlamp flame is it may be thought no longer the oxygen suitable for the development and maintenance of life we have an easy escape from this difficulty which is based however upon the unproved assumption that the air has been affected by the flame let a condensed beam be sent through a large flask or bolthead containing common air the track of the beam is seen within the flaskthe dust revealing the light and the light revealing the dust cork the flask stuff its neck with cottonwool or simply turn it mouth downwards and leave it undisturbed for a day or two examined afterwards with the luminous beam no track is visible the light passes through the flask as through a vacuum the floating matter has abolished itself being now attached to the interior surface of the flask were it our object as it will be subsequently to effectually detain the dirt we might coat that surface with some sticky substance here then without torturing the air in any way we have found a means of ridding it or rather of enabling it to rid itself of floating matter we have now to devise a means of testing the action of such spontaneously purified air upon putrescible infusions wooden chambers or cases are accordingly constructed having glass fronts sidewindows and backdoors through the bottoms of the chambers testtubes pass airtight their open ends for about onefifth of the length of the tubes being within the chambers provision is made for a free connection rough sinuous channels between the inner and the outer air through such channels though open no dust will reach the chamber the top of each chamber is perforated by a circular hole two inches in diameter closed airtight by a sheet of indiarubber this is pierced in the middle by a pin and through the pinhole is pushed the shank of a long pipette ending above in a small funnel the shank also passes through a stuffingbox of cottonwool moistened with glycerine so that tightly clasped by the rubber and wool the pipette is not likely in its motions up and down to carry any dust into the chamber the annexed woodcut shows a chamber with six testtubes its sidewindows w w its pipette p c and its sinuous channels a b which connect the air of the chamber with the outer air the chamber is carefully closed and permitted to remain quiet for two or three days examined at the beginning by a beam sent through its windows the air is found laden with floating matter which in three days has wholly disappeared to prevent its ever rising again the internal surface of the chamber was at the outset coated with glycerine the fresh but putrescible liquid is introduced into the six tubes in succession by means of the pipette permitted to remain without further precaution every one of the tubes would putrefy and fill itself with life the liquid has been in contact with the dustladen air outside by which it has been infected and the infection must be destroyed this is done by plunging the six tubes into a bath of heated oil and boiling the infusion the time requisite to destroy the infection depends wholly upon its nature two minutes boiling suffices to destroy some contagia whereas two hundred minutes boiling fails to destroy others after the infusion has been sterilised the oilbath is withdrawn and the liquid whose putrescibility has been in no way affected by the boiling is abandoned to the air of the chamber with such chambers i tested in the autumn and winter of 18756 infusions of the most various kinds embracing natural animal liquids the flesh and viscera of domestic animals game fish and vegetables more than fifty chambers each with its series of infusions were tested many of them repeatedly there was no shade of uncertainty in any of the results in every instance we had within the chamber perfect limpidity and sweetness which in some cases lasted for more than a yearwithout the chamber with the same infusion putridity and its characteristic smells in no instance was the least countenance lent to the notion that an infusion deprived by heat of its inherent life and placed in contact with air cleansed of its visibly suspended matter has any power to generate life anew remembering then the number and variety of the infusions employed and the strictness of our adherence to the rules of preparation laid down by the heterogenists themselves remembering that we have operated upon the very substances recommended by them as capable of furnishing even in untrained hands easy and decisive proofs of spontaneous generation and that we have added to their substances many others of our ownif this pretended generative power were a reality surely it must have manifested itself somewhere speaking roundly i should say that in such closed chambers at least five hundred chances have been given to it but it has nowhere appeared the argument is now to be clenched by an experiment which will remove every residue of doubt as to the ability of the infusions here employed to sustain life we open the back doors of our sealed chambers and permit the common air with its floating particles to have access to our tubes for three months they have remained pellucid and sweetflesh fish and vegetable extracts purer than ever cook manufactured three days exposure to the dusty air suffices to render them muddy fetid and swarming with infusorial life the liquids are thus proved one and all ready for putrefaction when the contaminating agent is applied i invite my colleague to reflect on these facts how will he account for the absolute immunity of a liquid exposed for months in a warm room to optically pure air and its infallible putrefaction in a few days when exposed to dustladen air he must i submit bow to the conclusion that the dustparticles are the cause of putrefactive life and unless he accepts the hypothesis that these particles being dead in the air are in the liquid miraculously kindled into living things he must conclude that the life we have observed springs from germs or organisms diffused through the atmosphere the experiments with hermetically sealed flasks have reached the number of 940 a sample group of 130 of them were laid before the royal society on january 13 1876 they were utterly free from life having been completely sterilised by three minutes boiling special care had been taken that the temperatures to which the flasks were exposed should include those previously alleged to be efficient the conditions laid down by the heterogenist were accurately copied but there was no corroboration of his results stress was then laid on the question of warmth thirty degrees being suddenly added to the temperatures with which both of us had previously worked waiving all protest against the caprice thus manifested i met this new requirement also the sealed tubes which had proved barren in the royal institution were suspended in perforated boxes and placed under the supervision of an intelligent assistant in the turkish bath in jermyn street from two to six days had been allowed for the generation of organisms in hermetically sealed tubes mine remained in the washingroom of the bath for nine days thermometers placed in the boxes and read off twice or three times a day showed the temperature to vary from a minimum of 101 to a maximum of 112 fahr at the end of nine days the infusions were as clear as at the beginning they were then removed to a warmer position a temperature of 115 had been mentioned as particularly favourable to spontaneous generation for fourteen days the temperature of the turkish bath hovered about this point falling once as low as 106 reaching 116 on three occasions 118 on one and 119 on two the result was quite the same as that just recorded the higher temperatures proved perfectly incompetent to develope life taking the actual experiment we have made as a basis of calculation if our 940 flasks were opened on the hayloft of the bel alp 858 of them would become filled with organisms the escape of the remaining 82 strengthens our case proving as it does conclusively that not in the air nor in the infusions nor in anything continuous diffused through the air but in discrete particles suspended in the air and nourished by the infusions we are to seek the cause of life our experiment proves these particles to be in some cases so far apart on the hayloft as to permit 10 per cent of our flasks to take in air without contracting contamination a quarter of a century ago pasteur proved the cause of socalled spontaneous generation to be discontinuous i have already referred to his observation that 12 out of 20 flasks opened on the plains escaped infection while 19 out of 20 flasks opened on the mer de glace escaped our own experiment at the bel alp is a more emphatic instance of the same kind 90 per cent of the flasks opened in the hayloft being smitten while not one of those opened on the free mountain ledge was attacked the power of the air as regards putrefactive infection is incessantly changing through natural causes and we are able to alter it at will of a number of flasks opened in 1876 in the laboratory of the royal institution 42 per cent were smitten while 58 per cent escaped in 1877 the proportion in the same laboratory was 68 per cent smitten to 32 intact the greater mortality so to speak of the infusions in 1877 was due to the presence of hay which diffused its germinal dust in the laboratory air causing it to approximate as regards infective virulence to the air of the alpine loft i would ask my friend to bring his scientific penetration to bear upon all the foregoing facts they do not prove spontaneous generation to be impossible my assertions however relate not to possibilities but to proofs and the experiments just described do most distinctly prove the evidence on which the heterogenist relies to be written on waste paper my colleague will not i am persuaded dispute these results but he may be disposed to urge that other able and honourable men working at the same subject have arrived at conclusions different from mine most freely granted but let me here recur to the remarks already made in speaking of the experiments of spallanzani to the effect that the failure of others to confirm his results by no means upsets their evidence to fix the ideas let us suppose that my colleague comes to the laboratory of the royal institution repeats there my experiments and obtains confirmatory results and that he then goes to university or kings college where operating with the same infusions he obtains contradictory results will he be disposed to conclude that the selfsame substance is barren in albemarle street and fruitful in gower street or the strand his alpine experience has already made known to him the literally infinite differences existing between different samples of air as regards their capacity for putrefactive infection and possessing this knowledge will he not substitute for the adventurous conclusion that an organic infusion is barren at one place and spontaneously generative at another the more rational and obvious one that the atmospheres of the two localities which have had access to the infusion are infective in different degrees as regards workmanship moreover he will not fail to bear in mind that fruitfulness may be due to errors of manipulation while barrenness involves the presumption of correct experiment it is only the careful worker that can secure the latter while it is open to every novice to obtain the former barrenness is the result at which the conscientious experimenter whatever his theoretic convictions may be ought to aim omitting no pains to secure it and resorting only when there is no escape from it to the conclusion that the life observed comes from no source which correct experiment could neutralise or avoid let us again take a definite case supposing my colleague to operate with the same apparent care on 100 infusionsor rather on 100 samples of the same infusionand that 50 of them prove fruitful and 50 barren are we to say that the evidence for and against heterogeny is equally balanced there are some who would not only say this but who would treasure up the 50 fruitful flasks as positive results and lower the evidential value of the 50 barren flasks by labelling them negative results this as shown by dr william roberts is an exact inversion of the true order of the terms positive and negative footnote see his truly philosophical remarks on this head in the british medical journal 1876 p 282 not such i trust would be the course pursued by my friend as regards the 50 fruitful flasks he would i doubt not repeat the experiment with redoubled care and scrutiny and not by one repetition only but by many assure himself that he had not fallen into error such faithful scrutiny fully carried out would infallibly lead him to the conclusion that here as in all other cases the evidence in favour of spontaneous generation crumbles in the grasp of the competent enquirer the botanist knows that different seeds possess different powers of resistance to heat footnote i am indebted to dr thiselton dyer for various illustrations of such differences it is however surprising that a subject of such high scientific importance should not have been more thoroughly explored here the scoundrels who deal in killed seeds might be able to add to our knowledge some are killed by a momentary exposure to the boiling temperature while others withstand it for several hours most of our ordinary seeds are rapidly killed while pouchet made known to the paris academy of sciences in 1866 that certain seeds which had been transported in fleeces of wool from brazil germinated after four hours boiling the germs of the air vary as much among themselves as the seeds of the botanist in some localities the diffused germs are so tender that boiling for five minutes or even less would be sure to destroy them all in other localities the diffused germs are so obstinate that many hours boiling would be requisite to deprive them of their power of germination the absence or presence of a truss of desiccated hay would produce differences as great as those here described the greatest endurance that i have ever observedand i believe it is the greatest on recordwas a case of survival after eight hours boiling as regards their power of resisting heat the infusorial germs of our atmosphere might be classified under the following and intermediate heads killed in five minutes not killed in five minutes but killed in fifteen not killed in fifteen minutes but killed in thirty not killed in thirty minutes but killed in an hour not killed in an hour but killed in two hours not killed in two but killed in three hours not killed in three but killed in four hours i have had several cases of survival after four and five hours boiling some survivals after six and one after eight hours boiling thus far has experiment actually reached but there is no valid warrant for fixing upon even eight hours as the extreme limit of vital resistance probably more extended researches though mine have been very extensive would reveal germs more obstinate still it is also certain that we might begin earlier and find germs which are destroyed by a temperature far below that of boiling water in the presence of such facts to speak of a deathpoint of bacteria and their germs would be unmeaningbut of this more anon what present warrant it has been asked is there for supposing that a naked or almost naked speck of protoplasm can withstand four six or eight hours boiling regarding naked specks of protoplasm i make no assertion i know nothing about them save as the creatures of fancy but i do affirm not as a supposition nor an assumption nor a probable guess nor as a wild hypothesis but as a matter of the most undoubted fact that the spores of the hay bacillus when thoroughly desiccated by age have withstood the ordeal mentioned and i further affirm that these obdurate germs under the guidance of the knowledge that they are germs can be destroyed by five minutes boiling or even less this needs explanation the finished bacterium perishes at a temperature far below that of boiling water and it is fair to assume that the nearer the germ is to its final sensitive condition the more readily will it succumb to heat seeds soften before and during germination this premised the simple description of the following process will suffice to make its meaning understood an infusion infected with the most powerfully resistent germs but otherwise protected against the floating matters of the air is gradually raised to its boilingpoint such germs as have reached the soft and plastic state immediately preceding their development into bacteria are thus destroyed the infusion is then put aside in a warm room for ten or twelve hours if for twentyfour we might have the liquid charged with welldeveloped bacteria to anticipate this at the end of ten or twelve hours we raise the infusion a second time to the boiling temperature which as before destroys all germs then approaching their point of final development the infusion is again put aside for ten or twelve hours and the process of heating is repeated we thus kill the germs in order of their resistance and finally kill the last of them no infusion can withstand this process if it be repeated a sufficient number of times artichoke cucumber and turnip infusions which had proved specially obstinate when infected with the germs of desiccated hay were completely broken down by this method of discontinuous heating three minutes being found sufficient to accomplish what three hundred minutes continuous boiling failed to accomplish i applied the method moreover to infusions of various kinds of hay including those most tenacious of life not one of them bore the ordeal these results were clearly foreseen before they were realised so that the germ theory fulfils the test of every true theory that test being the power of prevision when naked or almost naked specks of protoplasm are spoken of the imagination is drawn upon not the objective truth of nature such words sound like the words of knowledge where knowledge is really nil the possibility of a thin covering is conceded by those who speak in this way such a covering may however exercise a powerful protective influence a thin pellicle of indiarubber for example surrounding a pea keeps it hard in boiling water for a time sufficient to reduce an uncovered pea to a pulp the pellicle prevents imbibition diffusion and the consequent disintegration a greasy or oily surface or even the layer of air which clings to certain bodies would act to some extent in a similar way the singular resistance of green vegetables to sterilisation says dr william roberts appears to be due to some peculiarity of the surface perhaps their smooth glistening epidermis which prevented complete wetting of their surfaces i pointed out in 1876 that the process by which an atmospheric germ is wetted would be an interesting subject of investigation a dry microscope coveringglass may be caused to float on water for a year a sewingneedle may be similarly kept floating though its specific gravity is nearly eight times that of water were it not for some specific relation between the matter of the germ and that of the liquid into which it falls wetting would be simply impossible antecedent to all development there must be an interchange of matter between the germ and its environment and this interchange must obviously depend upon the relation of the germ to its encompassing liquid anything that hinders this interchange retards the destruction of the germ in boiling water in my paper published in the philosophical transactions for 1877 i add the following remark it is not difficult to see that the surface of a seed or germ may be so affected by desiccation and other causes as practically to prevent contact between it and the surrounding liquid the body of a germ moreover may be so indurated by time and dryness as to resist powerfully the insinuation of water between its constituent molecules it would be difficult to cause such a germ to imbibe the moisture necessary to produce the swelling and softening which precede its destruction in a liquid of high temperature however this may bewhatever be the state of the surface or of the body of the spores of bacillus subtilis they do as a matter of certainty resist under some circumstances exposure for hours to the heat of boiling water no theoretic scepticism can successfully stand in the way of this fact established as it has been by hundreds if not thousands of rigidly conducted experiments we have now to test one of the principal foundations of the doctrine of spontaneous generation as formulated in this country with this view i place before my friend and coenquirer two liquids which have been kept for six months in one of our sealed chambers exposed to optically pure air the one is a mineral solution containing in proper proportions all the substances which enter into the composition of bacteria the other is an infusion of turnipit might be any one of a hundred other infusions animal or vegetable both liquids are as clear as distilled water and there is no trace of life in either of them they are in fact completely sterilised a muttonchop over which a little water has been poured to keep its juices from drying up has lain for three days upon a plate in our warm room it smells offensively placing a drop of the fetid muttonjuice under a microscope it is found swarming with the bacteria of putrefaction with a speck of the swarming liquid i inoculate the clear mineral solution and the clear turnip infusion as a surgeon might inoculate an infant with vaccine lymph in fourandtwenty hours the transparent liquids have become turbid throughout and instead of being barren as at first they are teeming with life the experiment may be repeated a thousand times with the same invariable result to the naked eye the liquids at the beginning were alike being both equally transparentto the naked eye they are alike at the end being both equally muddy instead of putrid muttonjuice we might take as a source of infection any one of a hundred other putrid liquids animal or vegetable so long as the liquid contains living bacteria a speck of it communicated either to the clear mineral solution or to the clear turnip infusion produces in twentyfour hours the effect here described we now vary the experiment thus opening the backdoor of another closed chamber which has contained for months the pure mineral solution and the pure turnip infusion side by side i drop into each of them a small pinch of laboratory dust the effect here is tardier than when the speck of putrid liquid was employed in three days however after its infection with the dust the turnip infusion is muddy and swarming as before with bacteria but what about the mineral solution which in our first experiment behaved in a manner undistinguishable from the turnipjuice at the end of three days there is not a bacterium to be found in it at the end of three weeks it is equally innocent of bacterial life we may repeat the experiment with the solution and the infusion a hundred times with the same invariable result always in the case of the latter the sowing of the atmospheric dust yields a crop of bacterianever in the former does the dry germinal matter kindle into active life footnote this is the deportment of the mineral solution as described by others my own experiments would lead me to say that the development of the bacteria though exceedingly slow and difficult is not impossible what is the inference which the reflecting mind must draw from this experiment is it not as clear as day that while both liquids are able to feed the bacteria and to enable them to increase and multiply after they have been once fully developed only one of the liquids is able to develope into active bacteria the germinal dust of the air i invite my friend to reflect upon this conclusion he will i think see that there is no escape from it he may if he prefers hold the opinion which i consider erroneous that bacteria exist in the air not as germs but as desiccated organisms the inference remains that while the one liquid is able to force the passage from the inactive to the active state the other is not but this is not at all the inference which has been drawn from experiments with the mineral solution seeing its ability to nourish bacteria when once inoculated with the living active organism and observing that no bacteria appeared in the solution after long exposure to the air the inference was drawn that neither bacteria nor their germs existed in the air throughout germany the ablest literature of the subject even that opposed to heterogeny is infected with this error while heterogenists at home and abroad have based upon it a triumphant demonstration of their doctrine it is proved they say by the deportment of the mineral solution that neither bacteria nor their germs exist in the air hence if on exposing a thoroughly sterilised turnip infusion to the air bacteria appear they must of necessity have been spontaneously generated in the words of dr bastian we can only infer that whilst the boiled saline solution is quite incapable of engendering bacteria such organisms are able to arise de novo in the boiled organic infusion footnote proceedings of the royal society vol xxi p 130 i would ask my eminent colleague what he thinks of this reasoning now the datum isa mineral solution exposed to common air does not develope bacteria the inference istherefore if a turnip infusion similarly exposed develope bacteria they must be spontaneously generated the inference on the face of it is an unwarranted one but while as matter of logic it is inconclusive as matter of fact it is chimerical london air is as surely charged with the germs of bacteria as london chimneys are with smoke the inference just referred to is completely disposed of by the simple question why when your sterilised organic infusion is exposed to optically puree air should this generation of life de novo utterly cease why should i be able to preserve my turnipjuice side by side with your saline solution for the three hundred and sixtyfive days of the year in free connection with the general atmosphere on the sole condition that the portion of that atmosphere in contact with the juice shall be visibly free from floating dust while three days exposure to that dust fills it with bacteria am i over sanguine in hoping that as regards the argument here set forth he who runs may read and he who reads may understand we now proceed to the calm and thorough consideration of another subject more important if possible than the foregoing one but like it somewhat difficult to seize by reason of the very opulence of the phraseology logical and rhetorical in which it has been set forth the subject now to be considered relates to what has been called the deathpoint of bacteria those who happen to be acquainted with the modern english literature of the question will remember how challenge after challenge has been issued to panspermatists in general and to one or two home workers in particular to come to close quarters on this cardinal point it is obviously the stronghold of the english heterogenist water he says is boiling merrily over a fire when some luckless person upsets the vessel so that the heated fluid exercises its scathing influence upon an uncovered portion of the bodyhand arm or face here at all events there is no room for doubt boiling water unquestionably exercises a most pernicious and rapidly destructive effect upon the living matter of which we are composed footnote bastian evolution p 133 and lest it should be supposed that it is the high organisation which in this case renders the body susceptible to heat he refers to the action of boiling water on the hens egg to dissipate the notion the conclusion he says would seem to force itself upon us that there is something intrinsically deleterious in the action of boiling water upon living matterwhether this matter be of high or of low organisation footnote bastian evolution p 135 again at another place it has been shown that the briefest exposure to the influence of boiling water is destructive of all living matter footnote ibid p 46 the experiments already recorded plainly show that there is a marked difference between the dry bacterial matter of the air and the wet soft and active bacteria of putrefying organic liquids the one can be luxuriantly bred in the saline solution the others refuse to be born there while both of them are copiously developed in a sterilised turnip infusion inferences as we have already seen founded on the deportment of the one liquid cannot with the warrant of scientific logic be extended to the other but this is exactly what the heterogenist has done thus repeating as regards the deathpoint of bacteria the error into which he fell concerning the germs of the air let us boil our muddy mineral solution with its swarming bacteria for five minutes in the soft succulent condition in which they exist in the solution not one of them escapes destruction the same is true of the turnip infusion if it be inoculated with the living bacteria onlythe aerial dust being carefully excluded in both cases the dead organisms sink to the bottom of the liquid and without reinoculation no fresh organisms will arise but the case is entirely different when we inoculate our turnip infusion with the desiccated germinal matter afloat in the air the deathpoint of bacteria is the maximum temperature at which they can live or the minimum temperature at which they cease to live if for example they survive a temperature of 140 and do not survive a temperature of 150 the deathpoint lies somewhere between these two temperatures vaccine lymph for example is proved by messrs braidwood and vacher to be deprived of its power of infection by brief exposure to a temperature between 140 and 150 fahr this may be regarded as the deathpoint of the lymph or rather of the particles diffused in the lymph which constitute the real contagium if no time however be named for the application of the heat the term deathpoint is a vague one an infusion for example which will resist five hours continuous exposure to the boiling temperature will succumb to five days exposure to a temperature 50 fahr below that of boiling the fully developed soft bacteria of putrefying liquids are not only killed by five minutes boiling but by less than a single minutes boilingindeed they are slain at about the same temperature as the vaccine the same is true of the plastic active bacteria of the turnip infusion footnote in my paper in the philosophical transactions for 1876 i pointed out and illustrated experimentally the difference as regards rapidity of development between watergerms and airgerms the growth from the already softened watergerms proving to be practically as rapid as from developed bacteria this preparedness of the germ for rapid development is associated with its preparedness for rapid destruction but instead of choosing a putrefying liquid for inoculation let us prepare and employ our inoculating substance in the following simple waylet a small wisp of hay desiccated by age be washed in a glass of water and let a perfectly sterilised turnip infusion be inoculated with the washing liquid after three hours continuous boiling the infusion thus infected will often develope luxuriant bacterial life precisely the same occurs if a turnip infusion be prepared in an atmosphere well charged with desiccated haygerms the infusion in this case infects itself without special inoculation and its subsequent resistance to sterilisation is often very great on the 1st of march last i purposely infected the air of our laboratory with the germinal dust of a sapless kind of hay mown in 1875 ten groups of flasks were charged with turnip infusion prepared in the infected laboratory and were afterwards subjected to the boiling temperature for periods varying from 15 minutes to 240 minutes out of the ten groups only one was sterilisedthat namely which had been boiled for four hours every flask of the nine groups which had been boiled for 15 30 45 60 75 90 105 120 and 180 minutes respectively bred organisms afterwards the same is true of other vegetable infusions on the 28th of february last for example i boiled six flasks containing cucumber infusion prepared in an infected atmosphere for periods of 15 30 45 60 120 and 180 minutes every flask of the group subsequently developed organisms on the same day in the case of three flasks the boiling was prolonged to 240 300 and 360 minutes and these three flasks were completely sterilised animal infusions which under ordinary circumstances are rendered infallibly barren by five minutes boiling behave like the vegetable infusions in an atmosphere infected with haygerms on the 30th of march for example five flasks were charged with a clear infusion of beef and boiled for 60 minutes 120 minutes 180 minutes 240 minutes and 300 minutes respectively every one of them became subsequently crowded with organisms and the same happened to a perfectly pellucid mutton infusion prepared at the same time the cases are to be numbered by hundreds in which similar powers of resistance were manifested by infusions of the most diverse kinds in the presence of such facts i would ask my colleague whether it is necessary to dwell for a single instant on the onesidedness of the evidence which led the conclusion that all living matter has its life destroyed by the briefest exposure to the influence of boiling water an infusion proved to be barren by six months exposure to moteless air maintained at a temperature of 90 fahr when inoculated with fullgrown active bacteria fills itself in two days with organisms so sensitive as to be killed by a few minutes exposure to a temperature much below that of boiling water but the extension of this result to the desiccated germinal matter of the air is without warrant or justification this is obvious without going beyond the argument itself but we have gone far beyond the argument and proved by multiplied experiment the alleged destruction of all living matter by the briefest exposure to the influence of boiling water to be a defusion the whole logical edifice raised upon this basis falls therefore to the ground and the argument that bacteria and their germs being destroyed at 140 must if they appear after exposure to 212 be spontaneously generated is i trust silenced for ever through the precautions variations and repetitions observed and executed with the view of rendering its results secure the separate vessels employed in this enquiry have mounted up in two years to nearly ten thousand besides the philosophic interest attaching to the problem of lifes origin which will be always immense there are the practical interests involved in the application of the doctrines here discussed to surgery and medicine the antiseptic system at which i have already glanced illustrates the manner in which beneficent results of the gravest moment follow in the wake of clear theoretic insight surgery was once a noble art it is now as well a noble science prior to the introduction of the antiseptic system the thoughtful surgeon could not have failed to learn empirically that there was something in the air which often defeated the most consummate operative skill that something the antiseptic treatment destroys or renders innocuous at kings college mr lister operates and dresses while a fine shower of mixed carbolic acid and water produced in the simplest manner falls upon the wound the lint and gauze employed in the subsequent dressing being duly saturated with the antiseptic at st bartholomews mr callender employs the dilute carbolic acid without the spray but as regards the real point aimed atthe preventing of the wound from becoming a nidus for the propagation of septic bacteriathe practice in both hospitals is the same commending itself as it does to the scientifically trained mind the antiseptic system has struck deep root in germany had space allowed it would have given me pleasure to point out the present position of the germ theory in reference to the phenomena of infectious disease distinguishing arguments based on analogywhich however are terribly strongfrom those based on actual observation i should have liked to follow up the account i have already given footnote fortnightly review november 1876 see article fermentation of the truly excellent researches of a young and an unknown german physician named koch on splenic fever by an account of what pasteur has recently done with reference to the same subject here we have before us a living contagium of the most deadly power which we can follow from the beginning to the end of its life cycle footnote dallinger and drysdale had previously shown what skill and patience can accomplish by their admirable observations on the life history of the monads we find it in the blood or spleen of a smitten animal in the state say of short motionless rods when these rods are placed in a nutritive liquid on the warm stage of the microscope we soon see them lengthening into filaments which lie in some cases side by side forming in others graceful loops or becoming coiled into knots of a complexity not to be unravelled we finally see those filaments resolving themselves into innumerable spores each with death potentially housed within it yet not to be distinguished microscopically from the harmless germs of bacillus subtilis the bacterium of splenic fever is called bacillus anthracis this formidable organism was shown to me by m pasteur in paris last july his recent investigations regarding the part it plays pathologically certainly rank amongst the most remarkable labours of that remarkable man observer after observer had strayed and fallen in this land of pitfalls a multitude of opposing conclusions and mutually destructive theories being the result in association with a younger physiological colleague m joubert pasteur struck in amidst the chaos and soon reduced it to harmony they proved among other things that in cases where previous observers in france had supposed themselves to be dealing solely with splenic fever another equally virulent factor was simultaneously active splenic fever was often overmastered by septicaemia and results due solely to the latter had been frequently made the ground of pathological inferences regarding the character and cause of the former combining duly the two factors all the previous irregularities disappeared every result obtained receiving the fullest explanation on studying the account of this masterly investigation the words wherewith pasteur himself feelingly alludes to the difficulties and dangers of the experimenters art came home to me with especial force jai tant de fois prouv que dans cet art difficile de lexprimentation les plus habiles bronchent chaque pas et que linterprtation des faits nest

attracts iron but when we analyse the effect we learn that the metal is not only attracted but repelled the final approach to the magnet being due to the difference of two unequal and opposing forces social progress is for the most part typified by this duplex or polar action as a general rule every advance is balanced by a partial retreat every amelioration is associated more or less with deterioration no great mechanical improvement for example is introduced for the benefit of society at large that does not bear hardly upon individuals science like other things is subject to the operation of this polar law what is good for it under one aspect being bad for it under another science demands above all things personal concentration its home is the study of the mathematician the quiet laboratory of the experimenter and the cabinet of the meditative observer of nature different atmospheres are required by the man of science as such and the man of action thus the facilities of social and international intercourse the railway the telegraph and the postoffice which are such undoubted boons to the man of action react to some extent injuriously on the man of science their tendency is to break up that concentrativeness which as i have said is an absolute necessity to the scientific investigator the men who have most profoundly influenced the world from the scientific side have habitually sought isolation faraday at a certain period of his career formally renounced dining out darwin lives apart from the bustle of the world in his quiet home in kent mayer and joule dealt in unobtrusive retirement with the weightiest scientific questions there is however one motive power in the world which no man be he a scientific student or otherwise can afford to treat with indifference and that is the cultivation of right relations with his fellowmenthe performance of his duty not as an isolated individual but as a member of society it is duty in this aspect overcoming alike the sense of possible danger and the desire for repose that has placed me in your presence here tonight to look at his picture as a whole a painter requires distance and to judge of the total scientific achievement of any age the standpoint of a succeeding age is desirable we may however transport ourselves in idea into the future and thus survey with more or less completeness the science of our time we sometimes hear it decried and contrasted to its disadvantage with the science of other times i do not think that this will be the verdict of posterity i think on the contrary that posterity will acknowledge that in the history of science no higher samples of intellectual conquest are recorded than those which this age has made its own one of the most salient of these i propose with your permission to make the subject of our consideration during the coming hour it is now generally admitted that the man of today is the child and product of incalculable antecedent time his physical and intellectual textures have been woven for him during his passage through phases of history and forms of existence which lead the mind back to an abysmal past one of the qualities which he has derived from that past is the yearning to let in the light of principles on the otherwise bewildering flux of phenomena he has been described by the german lichtenberg as das rastlose ursachenthierthe restless causeseeking animalin whom facts excite a kind of hunger to know the sources from which they spring never i venture to say in the history of the world has this longing been more liberally responded to both among men of science and the general public than during the last thirty or forty years i say the general public because it is a feature of our time that the man of science no longer limits his labours to the society of his colleagues and his peers but shares as far as it is possible to share with the world at large the fruits of enquiry the celebrated robert boyle regarded the universe as a machine mr carlyle prefers regarding it as a tree he loves the image of the umbrageous igdrasil better than that of the strasburg clock a machine may be defined as an organism with life and direction outside a tree may be defined as an organism with life and direction within in the light of these definitions i close with the conception of carlyle the order and energy of the universe i hold to be inherent and not imposed from without the expression of fixed law and not of arbitrary will exercised by what carlyle would call an almighty clockmaker but the two conceptions are not so much opposed to each other after all in one fundamental particular they at all events agree they equally imply the interdependence and harmonious interaction of parts and the subordination of the individual powers of the universal organism to the working of the whole never were the harmony and interdependence just referred to so clearly recognised as now our insight regarding them is not that vague and general insight to which our fathers had attained and which in early times was more frequently affirmed by the synthetic poet than by the scientific man the interdependence of our day has become quantitativeexpressible by numbersleading it must be added directly into that inexorable reign of law which so many gentle people regard with dread in the domain now under review men of science had first to work their way from darkness into twilight and from twilight into day there is no solution of continuity in science it is not given to any man however endowed to rise spontaneously into intellectual splendour without the parentage of antecedent thought great discoveries grow here as in other cases we have first the seed then the ear then the full corn in the ear the last member of the series implying the first thus as regards the discovery of gravitation with which the name of newton is identified notions more or less clear concerning it had entered many minds before newtons transcendent mathematical genius raised it to the level of a demonstration the whole of his deductions moreover rested upon the inductions of kepler newton shot beyond his predecessors but his thoughts were rooted in their thoughts and a just distribution of merit would assign to them a fair portion of the honour of discovery scientific theories sometimes float like rumours in the air before they receive complete expression the doom of a doctrine is often practically sealed and the truth of one is often practically accepted long prior to the demonstration of either the error or the truth perpetual motion was discarded before it was proved to be opposed to natural law and as regards the connection and interaction of natural forces intimations of modern discoveries are strewn through the writings of leibnitz boyle hooke locke and others confining ourselves to recent times dr ingleby has pointed out to me some singularly sagacious remarks bearing upon this question which were published by an anonymous writer in 1820 rogets penetration was conspicuous in 1829 mohr had grasped in 1837 some deeplying truth the writings of faraday furnish frequent illustrations of his profound belief in he unity of nature i have long he writes in 1845 held an opinion almost amounting to conviction in common i believe with other lovers of natural knowledge that the various forms under which the forces of matter are made manifest have one common origin or in other words are so directly related and mutually dependent that they are convertible as it were one into another and possess equivalence of power in their action his own researches on magnetoelectricity on electrochemistry and on the magnetisation of light led him directly to this belief at an early date mr justice grove made his mark upon this question colding though starting from a metaphysical basis grasped eventually the relation between heat and mechanical work and sought to determine it experimentally and here let me say that to him who has only the truth at heart and who in his dealings with scientific history keeps his soul unwarped by envy hatred or malice personal or national every fresh accession to historic knowledge must be welcome for every newcomer of proved merit more especially if that merit should have been previously overlooked he makes ready room in his recognition or his reverence but no retrospect of scientific literature has as yet brought to light a claim which can sensibly affect the positions accorded to two great pathhewers as the germans call them whose names in relation to this subject are linked in indissoluble association these names are julius robert mayer and james prescott joule in his essay on circles mr emerson if i remember rightly pictured intellectual progress as rhythmic at a given moment knowledge is surrounded by a barrier which marks its limit it gradually gathers clearness and strength until byandby some thinker of exceptional power bursts the barrier and wins a wider circle within which thought once more entrenches itself but the internal force again accumulates the new barrier is in its turn broken and the mind finds itself surrounded by a still wider horizon thus according to emerson knowledge spreads by intermittent victories instead of progressing at a uniform rate when dr joule first proved that a weight of one pound falling through a height of seven hundred and seventytwo feet generated an amount of heat competent to warm a pound of water one degree fahrenheit and that in lifting the weight so much heat exactly disappeared he broke an emersonian circle releasing by the act an amount of scientific energy which rapidly overran a vast domain and embodied itself in the great doctrine known as the conservation of energy this doctrine recognises in the material universe a constant sum of power made up of items among which the most protean fluctuations are incessantly going on it is as if the body of nature were alive the thrill and interchange of its energies resembling those of an organism the parts of the stupendous whole shift and change augment and diminish appear and disappear while the total of which they are the parts remains quantitatively immutable immutable because when change occurs it is always polarplus accompanies minus gain accompanies loss no item varying in the slightest degree without an absolutely equal change of some other item in the opposite direction the sun warms the tropical ocean converting a portion of its liquid into vapour which rises in the air and is recondensed on mountain heights returning in rivers to the ocean from which it came up to the point where condensation begins an amount of heat exactly equivalent to the molecular work of vaporisation and the mechanical work of lifting the vapour to the mountaintops has disappeared from the universe what is the gain corresponding to this loss it will seem when mentioned to be expressed in a foreign currency the loss is a loss of heat the gain is a gain of distance both as regards masses and molecules water which was formerly at the sealevel has been lifted to a position from which it can fall molecules which have been locked together as a liquid are now separate as vapour which can recondense after condensation gravity comes into effectual play pulling the showers down upon the hills and the rivers thus created through their gorges to the sea every raindrop which smites the mountain produces its definite amount of heat every river in its course develops heat by the clash of its cataracts and the friction of its bed in the act of condensation moreover the molecular work of vaporisation is accurately reversed compare then the primitive loss of solar warmth with the heat generated by the condensation of the vapour and by the subsequent fall of the water from cloud to sea they are mathematically equal to each other no particle of vapour was formed and lifted without being paid for in the currency of solar heat no particle returns as water to the sea without the exact quantitative restitution of that heat there is nothing gratuitous in physical nature no expenditure without equivalent gain no gain without equivalent expenditure with inexorable constancy the one accompanies the other leaving no nook or crevice between them for spontaneity to mingle with the pure and necessary play of natural force has this uniformity of nature ever been broken the reply is not to the knowledge of science what has been here stated regarding heat and gravity applies to the whole of inorganic nature let us take an illustration from chemistry the metal zinc may be burnt in oxygen a perfectly definite amount of heat being produced by the combustion of a given weight of the metal but zinc may also be burnt in a liquid which contains a supply of oxygenin water for example it does not in this case produce flame or fire but it does produce heat which is capable of accurate measurement but the heat of zinc burnt in water falls short of that produced in pure oxygen the reason being that to obtain its oxygen from the water the zinc must first dislodge the hydrogen it is in the performance of this molecular work that the missing heat is absorbed mix the liberated hydrogen with oxygen and cause them to recombine the heat developed is mathematically equal to the missing heat thus in pulling the oxygen and hydrogen asunder an amount of heat is consumed which is accurately restored by their reunion this leads up to a few remarks upon the voltaic battery it is not my design to dwell upon the technical features of this wonderful instrument but simply by means of it to show what varying shapes a given amount of energy can assume while maintaining unvarying quantitative stability when that form of power which we call an electric current passes through groves battery zinc is consumed in acidulated water and in the battery we are able so to arrange matters that when no current passes no zinc shall be consumed now the current whatever it may be possesses the power of generating heat outside the battery we can fuse with it iridium the most refractory of metals or we can produce with it the dazzling electric light and that at any terrestrial distance from the battery itself we will now however content ourselves with causing the current to raise a given length of platinum wire first to a bloodheat then to redness and finally to a white heat the heat under these circumstances generated in the battery by the combustion of a fixed quantity of zinc is no longer constant but it varies inversely as the heat generated outside if the outside heat be nil the inside heat is a maximum if the external wire be raised to a bloodheat the internal heat falls slightly short of the maximum if the wire be rendered redhot the quantity of missing heat within the battery is greater and if the external wire be rendered whitehot the defect is greater still add together the internal and external heat produced by the combustion of a given weight of zinc and you have an absolutely constant total the heat generated without is so much lost within the heat generated within is so much lost without the polar changes already adverted to coming here conspicuously into play thus in a variety of ways we can distribute the items of a nevervarying sum but even the subtle agency of the electric current places no creative power in our hands instead of generating external heat we may cause the current to effect chemical decomposition at a distance from the battery let it for example decompose water into oxygen and hydrogen the heat generated in the battery under these circumstances by the combustion of a given weight of zinc falls short of what is produced when there is no decomposition how far short the question admits of a perfectly exact answer when the oxygen and hydrogen recombine the heat absorbed in the decomposition is accurately restored and it is exactly equal in amount to that missing in the battery we may if we like bottle up the gases carry in this form the heat of the battery to the polar regions and liberate it there the battery in fact is a hearth on which fuel is consumed but the heat of the combustion instead of being confined in the usual manner to the hearth itself may be first liberated at the other side of the world and here we are able to solve an enigma which long perplexed scientific men and which could not be solved until the bearing of the mechanical theory of heat upon the phenomena of the voltaic battery was understood the puzzle was that a single cell could not decompose water the reason is now plain enough the solution of an equivalent of zinc in a single cell develops not much more than half the amount of heat required to decompose an equivalent of water and the single cell cannot cede an amount of force which it does not possess but by forming a battery of two cells instead of one we develop an amount of heat slightly in excess of that needed for the decomposition of the water the twocelled battery is therefore rich enough to pay for that decomposition and to maintain the excess referred to within its own cells similar reflections apply to the thermoelectric pile an instrument usually composed of small bars of bismuth and antimony soldered alternately together the electric current is here evoked by warming the soldered junctions of one face of the pile like the voltaic current the thermoelectric current can heat wires produce decomposition magnetise iron and deflect a magnetic needle at any distance from its origin you will be disposed and rightly disposed to refer those distant manifestations of power to the heat communicated to the face of the pile but the case is worthy of closer examination in 1826 thomas seebeck discovered thermoelectricity and six years subsequently peltier made an observation which comes with singular felicity to our aid in determining the material used up in the formation of the thermoelectric current he found that when a weak extraneous current was sent from antimony to bismuth the junction of the two metals was always heated but that when the direction was from bismuth to antimony the junction was chilled now the current in the thermopile itself is always from bismuth to antimony across the heated junctiona direction in which it cannot possibly establish itself without consuming the heat imparted to the junction this heat is the nutriment of the current thus the heat generated by the thermocurrent in a distant wire is simply that originally imparted to the pile which has been first transmuted into electricity and then retransmuted into its first form at a distance from its origin as water in a state of vapour passes from a boiler to a distant condenser and there assumes its primitive form without gain or loss so the heat communicated to the thermopile distils into the subtler electric current which is as it were recondensed into heat in the distant platinum wire in my youth i thought an electromagnetic engine which was shown to me a veritable perpetual motiona machine that is to say which performed work without the expenditure of power let us consider the action of such a machine suppose it to be employed to pump water from a lower to a higher level on examining the battery which works the engine we find that the zinc consumed does not yield its full amount of heat the quantity of heat thus missing within is the exact thermal equivalent of the mechanical work performed without let the water fall again to the lower level it is warmed by the fall add the heat thus produced to that generated by the friction mechanical and magnetical of the engine we thus obtain the precise amount of heat missing in the battery all the effects obtained from the machine are thus strictly paid for this payment for results being i would repeat the inexorable method of nature no engine however subtly devised can evade this law of equivalence or perform on its own account the smallest modicum of work the machine distributes but it cannot create is the animal body then to be classed among machines when i lift a weight or throw a stone or climb a mountain or wrestle with my comrade am i not conscious of actually creating and expending force let us look at the antecedents of this force we derive the muscle and fat of our bodies from what we eat animal heat you know to be due to the slow combustion of this fuel my arm is now inactive and the ordinary slow combustion of my blood and tissue is going on for every grain of fuel thus burnt a perfectly definite amount of heat has been produced i now contract my biceps muscle without causing it to perform external work the combustion is quickened and the heat is increased this additional heat being liberated in the muscle itself i lay hold of a 56 lb weight and by the contraction of my biceps lift it through the vertical space of a foot the blood and tissue consumed during this contraction have not developed in the muscle their due amount of heat a quantity of heat is at this moment missing in my muscle which would raise the temperature of an ounce of water somewhat more than one degree fahrenheit i liberate the weight it falls to the earth and by its collision generates the precise amount of heat missing in the muscle my muscular heat is thus transferred from its local hearth to external space the fuel is consumed in my body but the heat of combustion is produced outside my body the case is substantially the same as that of the voltaic battery when it performs external work or produces external heat all this points to the conclusion that the force we employ in muscular exertion is the force of burning fuel and not of creative will in the light of these facts the body is seen to be as incapable of generating energy without expenditure as the solids and liquids of the voltaic battery the body in other words falls into the catagory of machines we can do with the body all that we have already done with the batteryheat platinum wires decompose water magnetise iron and deflect a magnetic needle the combustion of muscle may be made to produce all these effects as the combustion of zinc may be caused to produce them by turning the handle of a magnetoelectric machine a coil of wire may be caused to rotate between the poles of a magnet as long as the two ends of the coil are unconnected we have simply to overcome the ordinary inertia and friction of the machine in turning the handle but the moment the two ends of the coil are united by a thin platinum wire a sudden addition of labour is thrown upon the turning arm when the necessary labour is expended its equivalent immediately appears the platinum wire glows you can readily maintain it at a white heat or even fuse it this is a very remarkable result from the muscles of the arm with a temperature of 100 degrees we extract the temperature of molten platinum which is nearly four thousand degrees the miracle here is the reverse of that of the burning bush mentioned in exodus there the bush burned but was not consumedhere the body is consumed but does not burn the similarity of the action with that of the voltaic battery when it heats an external wire is too obvious to need pointing out when the machine is used to decompose water the heat of the muscle like that of the battery is consumed in molecular work being fully restored when the gases recombine as before also the transmuted heat of the muscles may be bottled up carried to the polar regions and there restored to its pristine form the matter of the human body is the same as that of the world around us and here we find the forces of the human body identical with those of inorganic nature just as little as the voltaic battery is the animal body a creator of force it is an apparatus exquisite and effectual beyond all others in transforming and distributing the energy with which it is supplied but it possesses no creative power compared with the notions previously entertained regarding the play of vital force this is a great result the problem of vital dynamics has been described by a competent authority as the grandest of all i subscribe to this opinion and honour correspondingly the man who first successfully grappled with the problem he was no pope in the sense of being infallible but he was a man of genius whose work will be held in honour as long as science endures i have already named him in connection with our illustrious countryman dr joule other eminent men took up this subject subsequently and independently but all that has been done hitherto enhances instead of diminishing the merits of dr mayer consider the vigour of his reasoning beyond the power of generating internal heat the animal organism can generate heat external to itself a blacksmith by hammering can warm a nail and a savage by friction can heat wood to its point of ignition unless then we abandon the physiological axiom that the animal body cannot create heat out of nothing we are driven to the conclusion that it is the total heat within and without that ought to be regarded as the real calorific effect of the oxidation within the body mayer however not only states the principle but illustrates numerically the transfer of muscular heat to external space a bowler who imparts a velocity of 30 feet to an 8lb ball consumes in the act 01 of a grain of carbon the heat of the muscle is here distributed over the track of the ball being developed there by mechanical friction a man weighing 150 lbs consumes in lifting his own body to a height of 8 feet the heat of a grain of carbon jumping from this height the heat is restored the consumption of 2 oz 4 drs 20 grs of carbon would place the same man on the summit of a mountain 10000 feet high in descending the mountain an amount of heat equal to that produced by the combustion of the foregoing amount of carbon is restored the muscles of a labourer whose weight is 150 lbs weigh 64 lbs when dried they are reduced to 15 lbs were the oxidation corresponding to a daylabourers ordinary work exerted on the muscles alone they would be wholly consumed in 80 days were the oxidation necessary to sustain the hearts action concentrated on the heart itself it would be consumed in 8 days and if we confine our attention to the two ventricles their action would consume the associated muscular tissue in 31 days with a fulness and precision of which this is but a sample did mayer between 1842 and 1845 deal with the great question of vital dynamics in direct opposition moreover to the foremost scientific authorities of that day with liebig at their head this solitary heilbronn worker was led by his calculations to maintain that the muscles in the main played the part of machinery converting the fat which had been previously considered a mere heatproducer into the motive power of the organism mayers prevision has been justified by events for the scientific world is now upon his side we place then food in our stomachs as so much combustible matter it is first dissolved by purely chemical processes and the nutritive fluid is poured into the blood here it comes into contact with atmospheric oxygen admitted by the lungs it unites with the oxygen as wood or coal might unite with it in a furnace the matterproducts of the union if i may use the term are the same in both cases viz carbonic acid and water the forceproducts are also the sameheat within the body or heat and work outside the body thus far every action of the organism belongs to the domain either of physics or of chemistry but you saw me contract the muscle of my arm what enabled me to do so was it or was it not the direct action of my will the answer is the action of the will is mediate not direct over and above the muscles the human organism is provided with long whitish filaments of medullary matter which issue from the spinal column being connected by it on the one side with the brain and on the other side losing themselves in the muscles those filaments or cords are the nerves which you know are divided into two kinds sensor and motor or if you like the terms better afferent and efferent nerves the former carry impressions from the external world to the brain the latter convey the behests of the brain to the muscles here as elsewhere we find ourselves aided by the sagacity of mayer who was the first clearly to formulate the part played by the nerves in the organism mayer saw that neither nerves nor brain nor both together possessed the energy necessary to animal motion but he also saw that the nerve could lift a latch and open a door by which floods of energy are let loose as an engineer he says with admirable lucidity by the motion of his finger in opening a valve or loosening a detent can liberate an amount of mechanical energy almost infinite compared with its exciting cause so the nerves acting on the muscles can unlock an amount of power out of all proportion to the work done by the nerves themselves the nerves according to mayer pull the trigger but the gunpowder which they ignite is stored in the muscles this is the view now universally entertained the quickness of thought has passed into a proverb and the notion that any measurable time elapsed between the infliction of a wound and the feeling of the injury would have been rejected as preposterous thirty years ago nervous impressions notwithstanding the results of haller were thought to be transmitted if not instantaneously at all events with the rapidity of electricity hence when helmholtz in 1851 affirmed as the result of experiment nervous transmission to be a comparatively sluggish process very few believed him his experiments may now be made in the lectureroom sound in air moves at the rate of 1100 feet a second sound in water moves at the rate of 5000 feet a second light in aether moves at the rate of 186000 miles a second and electricity in free wires moves probably at the same rate but the nerves transmit their messages at the rate of only 70 feet a second a progress which in these quick times might well be regarded as inordinately slow your townsman mr gore has produced by electrolysis a kind of antimony which exhibits an action strikingly analogous to that of nervous propagation a rod of this antimony is in such a molecular condition that when you scratch or heat one end of the rod the disturbance propagates itself before your eyes to the other end the onward march of the disturbance being announced by the development of heat and fumes along the line of propagation in some such way the molecules of the nerves are successively overthrown and if mr gore could only devise some means of winding up his exhausted antimony as the nutritive blood winds up exhausted nerves the comparison would be complete the subject may be summed up as du boisreymond has summed it up by reference to the case of a whale struck by a harpoon in the tail if the animal were 70 feet long a second would elapse before the disturbance could reach the brain but the impression after its arrival has to diffuse itself and throw the brain into the molecular condition necessary to consciousness then and not till then the command to the tail to defend itself is shot through the motor nerves another second must elapse before the command can reach the tail so that more than two seconds transpire between the infliction of the wound and the muscular response of the part wounded the interval required for the kindling of consciousness would probably more than suffice for the destruction of the brain by lightning or even by a riflebullet before the organ can arrange itself it may therefore be destroyed and in such a case we may safely conclude that death is painless the experiences of common life supply us with copious instances of the liberation of vast stores of muscular power by an infinitesimal priming of the muscles by the nerves we all know the effect produced on a nervous organisation by a slight sound which causes affright an arial wave the energy of which would not reach a minute fraction of that necessary to raise the thousandth of a grain through the thousandth of an inch can throw the whole human frame into a powerful mechanical spasm followed by violent respiration and palpitation the eye of course may be appealed to as well as the ear of this the lamented lange gives the following vivid illustration a merchant sits complacently in his easy chair not knowing whether smoking sleeping newspaper reading or the digestion of food occupies the largest portion of his personality a servant enters the room with a telegram bearing the words antwerp c jonas and co have failed tell james to harness the horses the servant flies upstairs the merchant wide awake makes a dozen paces through the room descends to the countinghouse dictates letters and forwards despatches he jumps into his carriage the horses snort and their driver is immediately at the bank on the bourse and among his commercial friends before an hour has elapsed he is again at home where he throws himself once more into his easy chair with a deepdrawn sigh thank god i am protected against the worst and now for further reflection this complex mass of action emotional intellectual and mechanical is evoked by the impact upon the retina of the infinitesimal waves of light coming from a few pencil marks on a bit of paper we have as lange says terror hope sensation calculation possible ruin and victory compressed into a moment what caused the merchant to spring out of his chair the contraction of his muscles what made his muscles contract an impulse of the nerves which lifted the proper latch and liberated the muscular power whence this impulse from the centre of the nervous system but how did it originate there this is the critical question to which some will reply that it had its origin in the human soul the aim and effort of science is to explain the unknown in terms of the known explanation therefore is conditioned by knowledge you have probably heard the story of the german peasant who in early railway days was taken to see the performance of a locomotive he had never known carriages to be moved except by animal power every explanation outside of this conception lay beyond his experience and could not be invoked after long reflection therefore and seeing no possible escape from the conclusion he exclaimed confidently to his companion es muessen doch pferde darin sein there must be horses inside amusing as this locomotive theory may seem it illustrates a deeplying truth with reference to our present question some may be disposed to press upon me such considerations as these your motor nerves are so many speakingtubes through which messages are sent from the man to the world and your sensor nerves are so many conduits through which the whispers of the world are sent back to the man but you have not told us where is the man who or what is it that sends and receives those messages through the bodily organism do not the phenomena point to the existence of a self within the self which acts through the body as through a skilfully constructed instrument you picture the muscles as hearkening to the commands sent through the motor nerves and you picture the sensor nerves as the vehicles of incoming intelligence are you not bound to supplement this mechanism by the assumption of an entity which uses it in other words are you not forced by tour own exposition into the hypothesis of a free human soul this is fair reasoning now and at a certain stage of the worlds knowledge it might well have been deemed conclusive adequate reflection however shows that instead of introducing light into our minds this hypothesis considered scientifically increases our darkness you do not in this case explain the unknown in terms of the known which as stated above is the method of science but you explain the unknown in terms of the more unknown try to mentally visualise this soul as an entity distinct from the body and the difficulty immediately appears from the side of science all that we are warranted in stating is that the terror hope sensation and calculation of langes merchant are psychical phenomena produced by or associated with the molecular processes set up by waves of light in a previously prepared brain when facts present themselves let us dare to face them but let the man of science equally dare to confess ignorance where it prevails what then is the causal connection if any between the objective and subjectivebetween molecular motions and states of consciousness my answer is i do not see the connection nor have i as yet met anybody who does it is no explanation to say that the objective and subjective effects are two sides of one and the same phenomenon why should the phenomenon have two sides this is the very core of the difficulty there are plenty of molecular motions which do not exhibit this twosidedness does water think or feel when it runs into frostferns upon a windowpane if not why should the molecular motion of the brain be yoked to this mysterious companionconsciousness we can form a coherent picture of the physical processesthe stirring of the brain the thrilling of the nerves the discharging of the muscles and all the subsequent mechanical motions of the organism but we can present to our minds no picture of the process whereby consciousness emerges either as a necessary link or as an accidental byproduct of this series of actions yet it certainly does emergethe prick of a pin suffices to prove that molecular motion can produce consciousness the reverse process of the production of motion by consciousness is equally unpresentable to the mind we are here in fact upon the boundary line of the intellect where the ordinary canons of science fail to extricate us from our difficulties if we are true to these canons we must deny to subjective phenomena all influence on physical processes observation proves that they interact but in passing from one to the other we meet a blank which mechanical deduction is unable to fill frankly stated we have here to deal with facts almost as difficult to seize mentally as the idea of a soul and if you are content to make your soul a poetic rendering of a phenomenon which refuses the yoke of ordinary physical laws i for one would not object to this exercise of ideality amid all our speculative uncertainty however there is one practical point as clear as the day namely that the brightness and the usefulness of life as well as its darkness and disaster depend to a great extent upon our own use or abuse of this miraculous organ accustomed as i am to harsh language i am quite prepared to hear my poetic rendering branded as a falsehood and a fib the vituperation is unmerited for poetry or ideality and untruth are assuredly very different things the one may vivify while the other kills when st john extends the notion of a soul to souls washed in the blood of christ does he fib indeed if the appeal to ideality is censurable christ himself ought not to have escaped censure nor did he escape it how can this man give us his flesh to eat expressed the sceptical flouting of unpoetic natures such are still amongst us cardinal manning would doubtless tell any protestant who rejects the doctrine of transubstantiation that he fibs away the plain words of his saviour when he reduces the body of the lord in the sacrament to a mere figure of speech though misuse may render it grotesque or insincere the idealisation of ancient conceptions when done consciously and above board has in my opinion an important future we are not radically different from our historic ancestors and any feeling which affected them profoundly requires only appropriate clothing to affect us the world will not lightly relinquish its heritage of poetic feeling and metaphysic will be welcomed when it abandons its pretensions to scientific discovery and consents to be ranked as a kind of poetry a good symbol says emerson is a missionary to persuade thousands the vedas the edda the koran are each remembered by its happiest figure there is no more welcome gift to men than a new symbol they assimilate themselves to it deal with it in all ways and it will last a hundred years then comes a new genius and brings another our ideas of god and the soul are obviously subject to this symbolic mutation they are not now what they were a century ago they will not be a century hence what they are now such ideas constitute a kind of central energy in the human mind capable like the energy of the physical universe of assuming various shapes and undergoing various transformations they baffle and elude the theological mechanic who would carve them to dogmatic forms they offer themselves freely to the poet who understands his vocation and whose function is or ought to be to find local habitation for thoughts woven into our subjective life but which refuse to be mechanically defined we now stand face to face with the final problem it is this are the brain and the moral and intellectual processes known to be associated with the brainand as far as our experience goes indissolubly associatedsubject to the laws which we find paramount in physical nature is the will of man in other words free or are it and nature equally bound fast in fate from this latter conclusion after he had established it to the entire satisfaction of his understanding the great german thinker fichte recoiled you will find the record of this struggle between head and heart in his book entitled die bestimmung des menschenthe vocation of man footnote translated by dr william smith of edinburgh truebner 1873 fichte was determined at all hazards to maintain his freedom but the price he paid for it indicates the difficulty of the task to escape from the iron necessity seen everywhere reigning in physical nature he turned defiantly round upon nature and law and affirmed both of them to be the products of his own mind he was not going to be the slave of a thing which he had himself created there is a good deal to be said in favour of this view but few of us probably would be able to bring into play the solvent transcendentalism whereby fichte melted his chains why do some regard this notion of necessity with terror while others do not fear it at all has not carlyle somewhere said that a belief in destiny is the bias of all earnest minds it is not nature says fichte it is freedom itself by which the greatest and most terrible disorders incident to our race are produced man is the cruellest enemy of man but the question of moral responsibility here emerges and it is the possible loosening of this responsibility that so many of us dread the notion of necessity certainly failed to frighten bishop butler he thought it untrue even absurdbut he did not fear its practical consequences he showed on the contrary in the analogy that as far as human conduct is concerned the two theories of freewill and necessity would come to the same in the end what is meant by freewill does it imply the power of producing events without antecedentsof starting as it were upon a creative tour of occurrences without any impulse from within or from without let us consider the point if there be absolutely or relatively no reason why a tree should fall it will not fall and if there be absolutely or relatively no reason why a man should act he will not act it is true that the united voice of this assembly could not persuade me that i have not at this moment the power to lift my arm if i wished to do so within this range the conscious freedom of my will cannot be questioned but what about the origin of the wish are we or are we not complete masters of the circumstances which create our wishes motives and tendencies to action adequate reflection will i think prove that we are not what for example have i had to do with the generation and development of that which some will consider my total being and others a most potent factor of my total beingthe living speaking organism which now addresses you as stated at the beginning of this discourse my physical and intellectual textures were woven for me not by me processes in the conduct or regulation of which i had no share have made me what i am here surely if anywhere we are as clay in the hands of the potter it is the greatest of delusions to suppose that we come into this world as sheets of white paper on which the age can write anything it likes making us good or bad noble or mean as the age pleases the age can stunt promote or pervert preexistent capacities but it cannot create them the worthy robert owen who saw in external circumstances the great moulders of human character was obliged to supplement his doctrine by making the man himself one of the circumstances it is as fatal as it is cowardly to blink facts because they are not to our taste how many disorders ghostly and bodily are transmitted to us by inheritance in our courts of law whenever it is a question whether a crime has been committed under the influence of insanity the best guidance the judge and jury can have is derived from the parental antecedents of the accused if among these insanity be exhibited in any marked degree the presumption in the prisoners favour is enormously enhanced because the experience of life has taught both judge and jury that insanity is frequently transmitted from parent to child i met some years ago in a railway carriage the governor of one of our largest prisons he was evidently an observant and reflective man possessed of wide experience gathered in various parts of the world and a thorough student of the duties of his vocation he told me that the prisoners in his charge might be divided into three distinct classes the first class consisted of persons who ought never to have been in prison external accident and not internal taint had brought them within the grasp of the law and what had happened to them might happen to most of us they were essentially men of sound moral stamina though wearing the prison garb then came the largest class formed of individuals possessing no strong bias moral or immoral plastic to the touch of circumstances which could mould them into either good or evil members of society thirdly came a classhappily not a large onewhom no kindness could conciliate and no discipline tame they were sent into this world labelled incorrigible wickedness being stamped as it were upon their organisations it was an unpleasant truth but as a truth it ought to be faced for such criminals the prison over which he ruled was certainly not the proper place if confined at all their prison should be on a desert island where the deadly contagium of their example could not taint the moral air but the sea itself he was disposed to regard as a cheap and appropriate substitute for the island it seemed to him evident that the state would benefit if prisoners of the first class were liberated prisoners of the second class educated and prisoners of the third class put compendiously under water it is not however from the observation of individuals that the argument against freewill as commonly understood derives its principal force it is as already hinted indefinitely strengthened when extended to the race most of you have been forced to listen to the outcries and denunciations which rang discordant through the land for some years after the publication of mr darwins origin of species well the worldeven the clerical worldfor the most part settled down in the belief that mr darwins book simply reflects the truth of nature that we who are now foremost in the files of time have come to the front through almost endless stages of promotion from lower to higher forms of life if to any one of us were given the privilege of looking back through the aeons across which life has crept towards its present outcome his vision according to darwin would ultimately reach a point when the progenitors of this assembly could not be called human from that humble society through the interaction of its members and the storing up of their best qualities a better one emerged from this again a better still until at length by the integration of infinitesimals through ages of amelioration we came to be what we are today we of this generation had no conscious share in the production of this grand and beneficent result any and every generation which preceded us had just as little share the favoured organisms whose garnered excellence constitutes our present store owed their advantages first to what we in our ignorance are obliged to call accidental variation and secondly to a law of heredity in the passing of which our suffrages were not collected with characteristic felicity and precision mr matthew arnold lifts this question into the free air of poetry but not out of the atmosphere of truth when he ascribes the process of amelioration to a power not ourselves which makes for righteousness if then our organisms with all their tendencies and capacities are given to us without our being consulted and if while capable of acting within certain limits in accordance with our wishes we are not masters of the circumstances in which motives and wishes originate if finally our motives and wishes determine our actionsin what sense can these actions be said to be the result of freewill here again we are confronted with the question of moral responsibility which as it has been much talked of lately it is desirable to meet with the view of removing the fear of our falling back into the condition of the ape and tiger so sedulously excited by certain writers i propose to grapple with this question in its rudest form and in the most uncompromising way if says the robber the ravisher or the murderer i act because i must act what right have you to hold me responsible for my deeds the reply is the right of society to protect itself against aggressive and injurious forces whether they be bond or free forces of nature or forces of man then retorts the criminal you punish me for what i cannot help let it be granted says society but had you known that the treadmill or the gallows was certainly in store for you you might have helped let us reason the matter fully and frankly out we may entertain no malice or hatred against you it is enough that with a view to our own safety and purification we are determined that you and such as you shall not enjoy liberty of evil action in our midst you who have behaved as a wild beast we claim the right to cage or kill as we should a wild beast the public safety is a matter of more importance than the very limited chance of your moral renovation while the knowledge that you have been hanged by the neck may furnish to others about to do as you have done the precise motive which will hold them back if your act be such as to invoke a minor penalty then not only others but yourself may profit by the punishment which we inflict on the homely principle that a burnt child dreads the fire it will make you think twice before venturing on a repetition of your crime observe finally the consistency of our conduct you offend you say because you cannot help offending to the public detriment we punish is our reply because we cannot help punishing for the public good practically then as bishop butler predicted we act as the world acted when it supposed the evil deeds of its criminals to be the products of freewill footnote an eminent church dignitary describes all this not unkindly as truculent logic i think it worthy of his graces graver consideration what i have heard it argued is the use of preaching about duty if a mans predetermined position in the moral world renders him incapable of profiting by advice who knows that he is incapable the preachers last word is a factor in the mans conduct and it may be a most important factor unlocking moral energies which might otherwise remain imprisoned and unused if the preacher thoroughly feel that words of enlightenment courage and admonition enter into the list of forces employed by nature herself for mans amelioration since she gifted man with speech he will suffer no paralysis to fall upon his tongue dung the figtree hopefully and not until its barrenness has been demonstrated beyond a doubt let the sentence go forth cut it down why cumbereth it the ground i remember when a youth in the town of halifax some twoandthirty years ago attending a lecture given by a young man to a small but select audience the aspect of the lecturer was earnest and practical and his voice soon rivetted attention he spoke of duty defining it as a debt owed and there was a kindling vigour in his words which must have strengthened the sense of duty in the minds of those who heard him no speculations regarding the freedom of the will could alter the fact that the words of that young man did me good his name was george dawson he also spoke if you will allow me to allude to it of a social subject much discussed at the timethe chartist subject of levelling suppose he says two men to be equal at night and that one rises at six while the other sleeps till nine next morning what becomes of your levelling and in so speaking be made himself the mouthpiece of nature which as we have seen secures advance not by the reduction of all to a common level but by the encouragement and conservation of what is best it may be urged that in dealing as above with my hypothetical criminal i am assuming a state of things brought about by the influence of religions which include the dogmas of theology and the belief in freewilla state namely in which a moral majority control and keep in awe an immoral minority the heart of man is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked withdraw then our theologic sanctions including the belief in freewill and the condition of the race will be typified by the samples of individual wickedness which have been above adduced we shall all that is become robbers and ravishers and murderers from much that has been written of late it would seem that this astounding inference finds houseroom in many minds possibly the people who hold such views might be able to illustrate them by individual instances the fear of hells a hangmans whip to keep the wretch in order remove the fear and the wretch following his natural instinct may become disorderly but i refuse to accept him as a sample of humanity let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die is by no means the ethical consequence of a rejection of dogma to many of you the name of george jacob holyoake is doubtless familiar and you are probably aware that at no man in england has the term atheist been more frequently pelted there are moreover really few who have more completely liberated themselves from theologic notions among workingclass politicians mr holyoake is a leader does he exhort his followers to eat and drink for tomorrow we die not so in the august number of the nineteenth century you will find these words from his pen the gospel of dirt is bad enough but the gospel of mere material comfort is much worse he contemptuously calls the comtist championship of the working man the championship of the trencher he would place the leanest liberty which brought with it the dignity and power of selfhelp higher than any prospect of a full plate without it such is the moral doctrine taught by this atheistic leader and no christian i apprehend need be ashamed of it most heartily do i recognise and admire the spiritual radiance if i may use the term shed by religion on the minds and lives of many personally known to me at the same time i cannot but observe how signally as regards the production of anything beautiful religion fails in other cases its professor and defender is sometimes at bottom a brawler and a clown these differences depend upon primary distinctions of character which religion does not remove it may comfort some to know that there are amongst us many whom the gladiators of the pulpit would call atheists and materialists whose lives nevertheless as tested by any accessible standard of morality would contrast more than favourably with the lives of those who seek to stamp them with this offensive brand when i say offensive i refer simply to the intention of those who use such terms and not because atheism or materialism when compared with many of the notions ventilated in the columns of religious newspapers has any particular offensiveness for me if i wished to find men who are scrupulous in their adherence to engagements whose words are their bond and to whom moral shiftiness of any kind is subjectively unknown if i wanted a loving father a faithful husband an honourable neighbour and a just citizeni should seek him and find him among the band of atheists to which i refer i have known some of the most pronounced among them not only in life but in death seen them approaching with open eyes the inexorable goal with no dread of a hangmans whip with no hope of a heavenly crown and still as mindful of their duties and as faithful in the discharge of them as if their eternal future depended upon their latest deeds in letters addressed to myself and in utterances addressed to the public faraday is often referred to as a sample of the association of religious faith with moral elevation i was locally intimate with him for fourteen or fifteen years of my life and had thus occasion to observe how nearly his character approached what might without extravagance be called perfection he was strong but gentle impetuous but selfrestrained a sweet and lofty courtesy marked his dealings with men and women and though he sprang from the body of the people a nature so fine might well have been distilled from the flower of antecedent chivalry not only in its broader sense was the christian religion necessary to faradays spiritual peace but in what many would call the narrow sense held by those described by faraday himself as a very small and despised sect of christians known if known at all as sandemanians it constituted the light and comfort of his days were our experience confined to such cases it would furnish an irresistible argument in favour of the association of dogmatic religion with moral purity and grace but as already intimated our experience is not thus confined in further illustration of this point we may compare with faraday a philosopher of equal magnitude whose character including gentleness and strength candour and simplicity intellectual power and moral elevation singularly resembles that of the great sandemanian but who has neither shared the theologic views nor the religious emotions which formed so dominant a factor in faradays life i allude to mr charles darwin the abraham of scientific mena searcher as obedient to the command of truth as was the patriarch to the command of god i cannot therefore as so many desire look upon faradays religious belief as the exclusive source of qualities shared so conspicuously by one uninfluenced by that belief to a deeper virtue belonging to human nature in its purer forms i am disposed to refer the excellence of both superstition may be defined as constructive religion which has grown incongruous with intelligence we may admit with fichte that superstition has unquestionably constrained its subjects to abandon many pernicious practices and to adopt many useful ones the real loss accompanying its decay at the present day has been thus clearly stated by the same philosopher in so far as these lamentations do not proceed from the priests themselveswhose grief at the loss of their dominion over the human mind we can well understandbut from the politicians the whole matter resolves itself into this that government has thereby become more difficult and expensive the judge was spared the exercise of his own sagacity and penetration when by threats of relentless damnation he could compel the accused to make confession the evil spirit formerly performed without reward services for which in later times judges and policemen have to be paid no man ever felt the need of a high and ennobling religion more thoroughly than this powerful and fervid teacher who by the way did not escape the brand of atheist but fichte asserted emphatically the power and sufficiency of morality in its own sphere let us consider he says the highest which man can possess in the absence of religioni mean pure morality the moral man obeys the law of duty in his breast absolutely because it is a law unto him and he does whatever reveals itself to him as his duty simply because it is duty let not the impudent assertion be repeated that such an obedience without regard for consequences and without desire for consequences is in itself impossible and opposed to human nature so much for fichte faraday was equally distinct i have no intention he says of substituting anything for religion but i wish to take that part of human nature which is independent of it morality philosophy commerce the various institutions and habits of society are independent of religion and may exist without it these were the words of his youth but they expressed his latest convictions i would add that the muse of tennyson never reached a higher strain than when it embodied the sentiment of duty in aenone and because right is right to follow right were wisdom in the scorn of consequence not in the way assumed by our dogmatic teachers has the morality of human nature been built up the power which has moulded us thus far has worked with stern tools upon a very rigid stuff what it has done cannot be so readily undone and it has endowed us with moral constitutions which take pleasure in the noble the beautiful and the true just as surely as it has endowed us with sentient organisms which find aloes bitter and sugar sweet that power did not work with delusions nor will it stay its hand when such are removed facts rather than dogmas have been its ministershunger and thirst heat and cold pleasure and pain fervour sympathy aspiration shame pride love hate terror awesuch were the forces whose interaction and adjustment throughout an immeasurable past wove the triplex web of mans physical intellectual and moral nature and such are the forces that will be effectual to the end you may retort that even on my own showing the power which makes for righteousness has dealt in delusions for it cannot be denied that the beliefs of religion including the dogmas of theology and the freedom of the will have had some effect in moulding the moral world granted but i do not think that this goes to the root of the matter are you quite sure that those beliefs and dogmas are primary and not derivedthat they are not the products instead of being the creators of mans moral nature i think it is in one of the latterday pamphlets that carlyle corrects a reasoner who deduced the nobility of man from a belief in heaven by telling him that he puts the cart before the horse the real truth being that the belief in heaven is derived from the nobility of man the birds instinct to weave its nest is referred to by emerson as typical of the force which built cathedrals temples and pyramids knowest thou what wove yon woodbirds nest of leaves and feathers from her breast or how the fish outbuilt its shell painting with morn each annual cell such and so grew these holy piles while love and terror laid the tiles earth proudly wears the parthenon as the best gem upon her zone and morning opes with haste her lids to gaze upon the pyramids oer englands abbeys bends the sky as on its friends with kindred eye for out of thoughts interior sphere these wonders rose to upper air and nature gladly gave them place adopted them into her race and granted them an equal date with andes and with ararat surely many utterances which have been accepted as descriptions ought to be interpreted as aspirations or as having their roots in aspiration instead of in objective knowledge does the song of the herald angels glory to god in the highest and on earth peace goodwill toward men express the exaltation and the yearning of a human soul or does it describe an optical and acoustical facta visible host and an audible song if the former the exaltation and the yearning are mans imperishable possessiona ferment long confined to individuals but which may byandby become the leaven of the race if the latter then belief in the entire transaction is wrecked by nonfulfilment look to the east at the present moment as a comment on the promise of peace on earth and goodwill toward men that promise is a dream ruined by the experience of eighteen centuries and in that ruin is involved the claim of the heavenly host to prophetic vision but though the mechanical theory proves untenable the immortal song and the feelings it expresses are still ours to be incorporated let us hope in purer and less shadowy forms in the poetry philosophy and practice of the future thus following the lead of physical science we are brought without solution of continuity into the presence of problems which as usually classified lie entirely outside the domain of physics to these problems thoughtful and penetrative minds are now applying those methods of research which in physical science have proved their truth by their fruits there is on all hands a growing repugnance to invoke the supernatural in accounting for the phenomena of human life and the thoughtful minds just referred to finding no trace of evidence in favour of any other origin are driven to seek in the interaction of social forces the genesis and development of mans moral nature if they succeed in their searchand i think they are sure to succeedsocial duty will be raised to a higher level of significance and the deepening sense of social duty will it is to be hoped lessen if not obliterate the strifes and heartburnings which now beset and disfigure our social life towards this great end it behoves us one and all to work and devoutly wishing its consummation i have the honour ladies and gentlemen to bid you a friendly farewell xv professor virchow and evolution this world of ours has on the whole been an inclement region for the growth of natural truth but it may be that the plant is all the hardier for the bendings and buffetings it has undergone the torturing of a shrub within certain limits strengthens it through the struggles and passions of the brute man reaches his estate through savagery and barbarism his civilisation and through illusion and persecution his knowledge of nature including that of his own frame the bias towards natural truth must have been strong to have withstood and overcome the opposing forces feeling appeared in the world before knowledge and thoughts conceptions and creeds founded on emotion had before the dawn of science taken root in man such thoughts conceptions and creeds must have met a deep and general want otherwise their growth could not have been so luxuriant nor their abiding power so strong this general needthis hunger for the ideal and wonderfulled eventually to the differentiation of a caste whose vocation it was to cultivate the mystery of life and its surroundings and to give shape name and habitation to the emotions which that mystery aroused even the savage lived not by bread alone but in a mental world peopled with forms answering to his capacities and needs as time advancedin other words as the savage opened out into civilised manthese forms were purified and ennobled until they finally emerged in the mythology and art of greece where still the magic robe of poesy wound itself lovingly around the truth footnote da der dichtung zauberische huelle sich noch lieblich um die wahrheit wandschiller as poets the priesthood would have been justified their deities celestial and otherwise with all their retinue and appliances being more or less legitimate symbols and personifications of the aspects of nature and the phases of the human soul the priests however or those among them who were mechanics and not poets claimed objective validity for their conceptions and tried to base upon external evidence that which sprang from the innermost need and nature of man it is against this objective rendering of the emotionsthis thrusting into the region of fact and positive knowledge of conceptions essentially ideal and poeticthat science consciously or unconsciously wages war religious feeling is as much a verity as any other part of human consciousness and against it on its subjective side the waves of science beat in vain but when manipulated by the constructive imagination mixed with imperfect or inaccurate historic data and moulded by misapplied logic this feeling makes claims which traverse our knowledge of nature science as in duty bound stands as a hostile power in its path it is against the mythologic scenery if i may use the term rather than against the life and substance of religion that science enters her protest sooner or later among thinking people that scenery will be taken for what it is worthas an effort on the part of man to bring the mystery of life and nature within the range of his capacities as a temporary and essentially fluxional rendering in terms of knowledge of that which transcends all knowledge and admits only of ideal approach the signs of the times i think point in this direction it is for example the obvious aim of mr matthew arnold to protect amid the wreck of dogma the poetic basis of religion and it is to be remembered that under the circumstances poetry may be the purest accessible truth in other influential quarters a similar spirit is at work in a remarkable article published by professor knight of st andrews in the september number of the nineteenth century amid other free utterances we have this one if matter is not eternal its first emergence into being is a miracle beside which all others dwindle into absolute insignificance but as has often been pointed out the process is unthinkable the sudden apocalypse of a material world out of blank nonentity cannot be imagined footnote professor knight will have to reckon with the english marriage service one of whose collects begins thus o god who by thy mighty power halt made all things of nothing its emergence into order out of chaos when without form and void of life is merely a poetic rendering of the doctrine of its slow evolution these are all bold words to be spoken before the moral philosophy class of a scotch university while those i have underlined show a remarkable freedom of dealing with the sacred text they repeat in terser language what i ventured to utter four years ago regarding the book of genesis profoundly interesting and indeed pathetic to me are those attempts of the opening mind of man to appease its hunger for a cause but the book of genesis has no voice in scientific questions it is a poem not a scientific treatise in the former aspect it is for ever beautiful in the latter it has been and it will continue to be purely obstructive and hurtful my agreement with professor knight extends still further does the vital he asks proceed by a still remoter development from the nonvital or was it created by a fiat of volition orand here he emphasises his questionhas it always existed in some form or other as an eternal constituent of the universe i do not see he replies how we can escape from the last alternative with the whole force of my conviction i say nor do i though our modes of regarding the eternal constituent may not be the same when matter was defined by descartes he deliberately excluded the idea of force or motion from its attributes and from his definition extension only was taken into account and inasmuch as the impotence of matter to generate motion was assumed its observed motions were referred to an external cause god resident outside of matter gave the impulse in this connection the argument in youngs night thoughts will occur to most readers who motion foreign to the smallest grain shot through vast masses of enormous weight who bid brute matters restive lump assume such various forms and gave it wings to fly against this notion of descartes the great deist john toland whose ashes lie unmarked in putney churchyard strenuously contended he affirmed motion to be an inherent attribute of matterthat no portion of matter was at rest and that even the most quiescent solids were animated by a motion of their ultimate particles the success of his contention according to the learned and laborious dr berthold footnote john toland und der monismus der gegenwart heidelberg carl winter entitles toland to be regarded as the founder of that monistic doctrine which is now so rapidly spreading it seems to me that the idea of vitality entertained in our day by professor knight closely resembles the idea of motion entertained by his opponents in tolands day motion was then virtually asserted to be a thing sui generis distinct from matter and incapable of being generated out of matter hence the obvious inference when matter was observed to move it was the vehicle of an energy not its ownthe repository of forces impressed on it from withoutthe purely passive recipient of the shock of the divine the logical form continues but the subjectmatter is changed the evolution of nature says professor knight may be a fact a daily and hourly apocalypse but we have no evidence of the nonvital passing into the vital spontaneous generation is as yet an imaginative guess unverified by scientific tests and matter is not itself alive vitality whether seen in a single cell of protoplasm or in the human brain is a thing sui generis distinct from matter and incapable of being generated out of matter it may be however that in process of time vitality will follow the example of motion and after the necessary antecedent wrangling take its place among the attributes of that universal mother who has been so often misdefined that matter is not itself alive professor knight seems to regard as an axiomatic truth let us place in contrast with this the notion entertained by the philosopher ueberweg one of the subtlest heads that germany has produced what occurs in the brain says ueberweg would in my opinion not be possible if the process which here appears in its greatest concentration did not obtain generally only in a vastly diminished degree take a pair of mice and a cask of flour by copious nourishment the animals increase and multiply and in the same proportion sensations and feelings augment the quantity of these latter possessed by the first pair is not simply diffused among their descendants for in that case the last must feel more feebly than the first the sensations and feelings must necessarily be referred back to the flour where they exist weak and pale it is true and not concentrated as they are in the brain footnote letter to lange geschichte des materialismus zweite aufl vol ii p 521 we may not be able to taste or smell alcohol in a tub of fermented cherries but by distillation we obtain from them concentrated kirschwasser hence ueberwegs comparison of the brain to a still which concentrates the sensation and feeling preexisting but diluted in the food definitions says mr holyoake footnote nineteenth century september 1878 grow as the horizon of experience expands they are not inventions but descriptions of the state of a question no man sees all through a discovery at once thus descartess notion of matter and his explanation of motion would be put aside as trivial by a physiologist or a crystallographer of the present day they are not descriptions of the state of the question and yet a desire sometimes shows itself in distinguished quarters to bind us own to conceptions which passed muster in the infancy of knowledge but which are wholly incompatible with our present enlightenment mr martineau i think errs when he seeks to hold me to views enunciated by democritus and the mathematicians that definitions should change as knowledge advances is in accordance both with sound sense and scientific practice when for example the undulatory theory was started it was not imagined that the vibrations of light could be transverse to the direction of propagation the example of sound was at hand which was a case of longitudinal vibration now the substitution of transverse for longitudinal vibrations in the case of light involved a radical change of conception as to the mechanical properties of the luminiferous medium but though this change went so far as to fill space with a substance possessing the properties of a solid rather than those of a gas the change was accepted because the newly discovered facts imperatively demanded it following mr martineaus example the opponent of the undulatory theory might effectually twit the holder of it on his change of front this aether of yours he might say alters its style with every change of service starting as a beggar with scarce a rag of property to cover its bones it turns up as a prince when large undertakings are wanted you had some show of reason when with the case of sound before you you assumed your aether to be a gas in the last extremity of attenuation but now that new service is rendered necessary by new facts you drop the beggars rags and accomplish an undertaking great and princely enough in all conscience for it implies that not only planets of enormous weight but comets with hardly any weight at all fly through your hypothetical solid without perceptible loss of motion this would sound very cogent but it would be very vain equally vain in my opinion is mr martineaus contention that we are not justified in modifying in accordance with advancing knowledge our notions of matter before parting from professor knight let me commend his courage as well as his insight we have heard much of late of the peril to morality involved in the decay of religious belief what mr knight says under this head is worthy of all respect and attention i admit he writes that were it proved that the moral faculty was derived as well as developed its present decisions would not be invalidated the child of experience has a father whose teachings are grave peremptory and august and an earthborn rule may be as stringent as any derived from a celestial source it does not even follow that a belief in the material origin of spiritual existence accompanied by a corresponding decay of belief in immortality must necessarily lead to a relaxation of the moral fibre of the race footnote is this really certain instead of standing in the relation of cause and effect may not the decay and relaxation be merely coexistent both perhaps flowing from common historic antecedents it is certain that it has often done so but it is equally certain that there have been individuals and great historical communities in which the absence of the latter belief has neither weakened moral earnestness nor prevented devotional fervour i have elsewhere stated that some of the best men of my acquaintancemen lofty in thought and beneficent in actbelong to a class who assiduously let the belief referred to alone they derive from it neither stimulus nor inspiration whilei say it with regretwere i in quest of persons who in regard to the finer endowments of human character are to be ranked with the unendowed i should find some characteristic samples among the noisier defenders of the orthodox belief these however are but handspecimens on both sides the wider data referred to by professor knight constitute therefore a welcome corroboration of my experience again my excellent critic professor blackie describes buddha as being a great deal more than a prophet a rare exceptional and altogether transcendental incarnation of moral perfection footnote natural history of atheism p 136 and yet what buddha preached was a gospel of pure human ethics divorced not only from brahma and the brahminic trinity but even from the existence of god footnote natural history of atheism p 125 these civilised and gallant voices from the north contrast pleasantly with the barbarous whoops which sometimes come to us along the same meridian looking backwards from my present standpoint over the earnest past a boyhood fond of play and physical action but averse to schoolwork lies before me the aversion did not arise from intellectual apathy or want of appetite for knowledge but simply from the fact that my earliest teachers lacked the power of imparting vitality to what they taught athwart all play and amusement however a thread of seriousness ran through my character and many a sleepless night of my childhood has been passed fretted by the question who made god i was well versed in scripture for i loved the bible and was prompted by that love to commit large portions of it to memory later on i became adroit in turning my scriptural knowledge against the church of rome but the characteristic doctrines of that church marked only for a time the limits of enquiry the eternal sonship of christ for example as enunciated in the athanasian creed perplexed me the resurrection of the body was also a thorn in my mind and here i remember that a passage in blairs grave gave me momentary rest sure the same power that reard the piece at first and took it down can reassemble the loose scatterd parts and put them as they were the conclusion seemed for the moment entirely fair but with further thought my difficulties came back to me i had seen cows and sheep browsing upon churchyard grass which sprang from the decaying mould of dead men the flesh of these animals was undoubtedly a modification of human flesh and the persons who fed upon them were as undoubtedly in part a more remote modification of the same substance i figured the selfsame molecules as belonging first to one body and afterwards to a different one and i asked myself how two bodies so related could possibly arrange their claims at the day of resurrection the scattered parts of each were to be reassembled and set as they were but if handed over to the one how could they possibly enter into the composition of the other omnipotence itself i concluded could not reconcile the contradiction thus the plank which blairs mechanical theory of the resurrection brought momentarily into sight disappeared and i was again cast abroad on the waste ocean of speculation at the same time i could by no means get rid of the idea that the aspects of nature and the consciousness of man implied the operation of a power altogether beyond my graspan energy the thought of which raised the temperature of the mind though it refused to accept shape personal or otherwise from the intellect perhaps the able critics of the saturday review are justified in speaking as they sometimes do of mr carlyle they owe him nothing and have a right to announce the fact in their own way i however owe him a great deal and am also in honour bound to acknowledge the debt few perhaps who are privileged to come into contact with that illustrious man have shown him a sturdier front than i have or in discussing modern science have more frequently withstood him but i could see that his contention at bottom always was that the human soul has claims and yearnings which physical science cannot satisfy england to come will assuredly thank him for his affirmation of the ethical and ideal side of human nature be this as it may at the period now reached in my story the feeling referred to was indefinitely strengthened my whole life being at the same time rendered more earnest resolute and laborious by the writings of carlyle others also ministered to this result emerson kindled me while fichte powerfully stirred my moral pulse footnote the reader will find in the seventeenth lecture of fichtes course on the characteristics of the present age a sample of the vital power of this philosopher in this relation i cared little for political theories or philosophic systems but a great deal for the propagated life and strength of pure and powerful minds in my later schooldays under a clever teacher some knowledge of mathematics and physics had been picked up my stock of both was however scanty and i resolved to augment it but it was really with the view of learning whether mathematics and physics could help me in other spheres rather than with the desire of acquiring distinction in either science that i ventured in 1848 to break the continuity of my life and devote the meagre funds then at my disposal to the study of science in germany but science soon fascinated me on its own account to carry it duly and honestly out moral qualities were incessantly invoked there was no room allowed for insincerityno room even for carelessness the edifice of science had been raised by men who had unswervingly followed the truth as it is in nature and in doing so had often sacrificed interests which are usually potent in this world among these rationalistic men of germany i found conscientiousness in work as much insisted on as it could be among theologians and why since they had not the rewards or penalties of the theologian to offer to their disciples because they assumed and were justified in assuming that those whom they addressed had that within them which would respond to their appeal if germany should ever change for something less noble the simple earnestness and fidelity to duty which in those days characterised her teachers and through them her sons generally it will not be because of rationalism such a decadent germany might coexist with the most rampant rationalism without their standing to each other in the relation of cause and effect my first really laborious investigation conducted jointly with my friend professor knoblauch landed me in a region which harmonised with my speculative tastes it was essentially an enquiry in molecular physics having reference to the curious and then perplexing phenomena exhibited by crystals when freely suspended in the magnetic field i here lived amid the most complex operations of magnetism in its twofold aspect of an attractive and a repellent force iron was attracted by a magnet bismuth was repelled and the crystals operated on ranged themselves under these two heads faraday and pluecker had worked assiduously at the subject and had invoked the aid of new forces to account for the phenomena it was soon however found that the displacement in a crystal of an atom of the iron class by an atom of the bismuth class involving no change of crystalline form produced a complete reversal of the phenomena the lines through the crystal which were in the one case drawn towards the poles of the magnet were driven in the other case from these poles by such instances and the reasoning which they suggested magnecrystallic action was proved to be due not to the operation of new forces but to the modification of the old ones by molecular arrangement whether diamagnetism like magnetism was a polar force was in those days a subject of the most lively contention it was finally proved to be so and the most complicated cases of magnecrystallic action were immediately shown to be simple mechanical consequences of the principle of diamagnetic polarity these early researches which occupied in all five years of my life and throughout which the molecular architecture of crystals was an incessant subject of mental contemplation gave a tinge and bias to my subsequent scientific thought and their influence is easily traced in my subsequent enquiries for example during nine years of labour on the subject of radiation heat and light were handled throughout by me not as ends but as instruments by the aid of which the mind might perchance lay hold upon the ultimate particles of matter scientific progress depends mainly upon two factors which incessantly interactthe strengthening of the mind by exercise and the illumination of phenomena by knowledge there seems no limit to the insight regarding physical processes which this interaction carries in its train through such insight we are enabled to enter and explore that subsensible world into which all natural phenomena strike their roots and from which they derive nutrition by it we are enabled to place before the minds eye atoms and atomic motions which lie far beyond the range of the senses and to apply to them reasoning as stringent as that applied by the mechanician to the motions and collisions of sensible masses but once committed to such conceptions there is a risk of being irresistibly led beyond the bounds of inorganic nature even in those early stages of scientific growth i found myself more and more compelled to regard not only crystals but organic structures the body of man inclusive as cases of molecular architecture infinitely more complex it is true than those of inorganic nature but reducible in the long run to the same mechanical laws in ancient journals i find recorded ponderings and speculations relating to these subjects and attempts made by reference to magnetic and crystalline phenomena to present some satisfactory image to the mind of the way in which plants and animals are built up perhaps i may be excused for noting a sample of these early speculations already possibly known to a few of my readers but which here finds a more suitable place than that which it formerly occupied sitting in the summer of 1855 with my friend dr rebus under the shadow of a massive elm on the bank of a river in normandy the current of our thoughts and conversation was substantially this we regarded the tree above us in opposition to gravity its molecules had ascended diverged into branches and budded into innumerable leaves what caused them to do soa power external to themselves or an inherent force science rejects the outside builder let us therefore consider from the other point of view the experience of the present year a low temperature had kept back for weeks the life of the vegetable world but at length the sun gained poweror rather the cloudscreen which our atmosphere had drawn between him and us was removedand life immediately kindled under his warmth but what is life and how can solar light and heat thus affect it near our elm was a silver birch with its leaves rapidly quivering in the morning air we had here motion but not the motion of life each leaf moved as a mass under the influence of an outside force while the motion of life was inherent and molecular how are we to figure this molecular motionthe forces which it implies and the results which flow from them suppose the leaves to be shaken from the tree and enabled to attract and repel each other to fix the ideas suppose the point of each leaf to repel all the other points and to attract the roots and the root of each leaf to repel all other roots but to attract the points the leaves would then resemble an assemblage of little magnets abandoned freely to the interaction of their own forces in obedience to these they would arrange themselves and finally assume positions of rest forming a coherent mass let us suppose the breeze which now causes them to quiver to disturb the assumed equilibrium as often as disturbed there would be a constant effort on the part of the leaves to reestablish it and in making this effort the mass of leaves would pass through different shapes and forms if other leaves moreover were at hand endowed with similar forces the attraction would extend to thema growth of the mass of leaves being the consequence we have strong reason for assuming that the ultimate particles of matterthe atoms and molecules of which it is made upare endowed with forces coarsely typified by those here ascribed to the leaves the phenomena of crystallisation load of necessity to this conception of molecular polarity under the operation of such forces the molecules of a seed like our fallen leaves in the first instance take up positions from which they would never move if undisturbed by an external impulse but solar light and heat which come to us as waves through space are the great agents of molecular disturbance on the inert molecules of seed and soil these waves impinge disturbing the atomic equilibrium which there is an immediate effort to restore the effort incessantly defeatedfor the waves continue to pour inis incessantly renewed in the molecular struggle matter is gathered from the soil and from the atmosphere and built in obedience to the forces which guide the molecules into the special form of the tree in a general way therefore the life of the tree might be defined as an unceasing effort to restore a disturbed equilibrium in the building of crystals nature makes her first structural effort we have here the earliest groping of the socalled vital force and the manifestations of this force in plants and animals though as already stated indefinitely more complex are to be regarded of the same mechanical quality as those concerned in the building of the crystal consider the cycle of operations by which the seed produces the plant the plant the flower the flower again the seed the causal line returning with the fidelity of a planetary orbit to its original point of departure who or what planned this molecular rhythm we do not knowscience fails even to inform us whether it was ever planned at all yonder butterfly has a spot of orange on its wing and if we look at a drawing made a century ago of one of the ancestors of that butterfly we probably find the selfsame spot upon the wing for a century the molecules have described their cycles butterflies have been begotten have been born and have died still we find the molecular architecture unchanged who or what determined this persistency of recurrence we do not know but we stand within our intellectual range when we say that there is probably nothing in that wing which may not yet find its newton to prove that the principles involved in its construction are qualitatively the same as those brought into play in the formation of the solar system we may even take a step further and affirm that the brain of manthe organ of his reasonwithout which he can neither think nor feel is also an assemblage of molecules acting and reacting according to law here however the methods pursued in mechanical science come to an end and if asked to deduce from the physical interaction of the brain molecules the least of the phenomena of sensation or thought i acknowledge my helplessness the association of both with the matter of the brain may be as certain as the association of light with the rising of the sun but whereas in the latter case we have unbroken mechanical connection between the sun and our organs in the former case logical continuity disappears between molecular mechanics and consciousness is interposed a fissure over which the ladder of physical reasoning is incompetent to carry us we must therefore accept the observed association as an empirical fact without being able to bring it under the yoke of priori deduction such were the ponderings which ran habitually through my mind in the days of my scientific youth they illustrate two thingsa determination to push physical considerations to their utmost legitimate limit and an acknowledgment that physical considerations do not lead to the final explanation of all that we feel and know this acknowledgment be it said in passing was by no means made with the view of providing room for the play of considerations other than physical the same intellectual duality if i may use the phrase manifests itself in the following extract from an article entitled physics and metaphysics published in the saturday review for august 4 1860 the philosophy of the future will assuredly take more account than that of the past of the dependence of thought and feeling on physical processes and it may be that the qualities of the mind will be studied through organic combinations as we now study the character of a force through the affections of ordinary matter we believe that every thought and every feeling has its definite mechanical correlativethat it is accompanied by a certain breaking up and remarshalling of the atoms of the brain this latter process is purely physical and were the faculties we now possess sufficiently expanded without the creation of any new faculty it would doubtless be within the range of our augmented powers to infer from the molecular state of the brain the character of the thought acting on it and conversely to infer from the thought the exact molecular condition of the brain we do not sayand this as will be seen is allimportantthat the inference here referred to would be an priori one but by observing with the faculties we assume the state of the brain and the associated mental affections both might be so tabulated side by side that if one were given a mere reference to the table would declare the other our present powers it is true shrivel into nothingness when brought to bear on such a problem but it is because of its complexity and our limits that this is the case the quality of the problem and of our powers are we believe so related that a mere expansion of the latter would enable them to cope with the former why then in scientific speculation should we turn our eyes exclusively to the past may it not be that a time is comingages no doubt distant but still advancingwhen the dwellers upon this fair earth starting from the gross human brain of today as a rudiment may be able to apply to these mighty questions faculties of commensurate extent given the requisite expansibility to the present senses and intelligence of mangiven also the time necessary for their expansionand this high goal may be attained development is all that is required and not a change of quality there need be no absolute breach of continuity between us and our loftier brothers yet to come we have guarded ourselves against saying that the inferring of thought from material combinations and arrangements would be an inference priori the inference meant would be the same in kind as that which the observation of the effects of food and drink upon the mind would enable us to make differing only from the latter in the degree of analytical insight which we suppose attained given the masses and distances of the planets we can infer the perturbations consequent on their mutual attractions given the nature of a disturbance in water air or aetherknowing the physical qualities of the medium we can infer how its particles will be affected in all this we deal with physical laws the mind runs with certainty along the line of thought which connects the phenomena and from beginning to end there is no break in the chain but when we endeavour to pass by a similar process from the phenomena of physics to those of thought we meet a problem which transcends any conceivable expansion of the powers which we now possess we may think over the subject again and again but it eludes all intellectual presentation we stand at length face to face with the incomprehensible the territory of physics is wide but it has its limits from which we look with vacant gaze into the region beyond let us follow matter to its utmost bounds let us claim it in all its formseven in the muscles blood and brain of man himselfas ours to experiment with and to speculate upon casting the term vital force from our vocabulary let us reduce if we can the visible phenomena of life to mechanical attractions and repulsions having thus exhausted physics and reached its very rim a mighty mystery still looms beyond us we have in fact made no step towards its solution and thus it will ever loom compelling the philosophies of successive ages to confess that we are such stuff as dreams are made of and our little life is rounded by a sleep in my work on heat published in 1863 and republished many times since i employ the precise language thus extracted from the saturday review the distinction is here clearly brought out which i had resolved at all hazards to drawthat namely between what men knew or might know and what they could never hope to know impart simple magnifying power to our present vision and the atomic motions of the brain itself might be brought into view compare these motions with the corresponding states of consciousness and an empirical nexus might be established but we try to soar in a vacuum when we endeavour to pass by logical deduction from the one to the other among these braineffects a new product appears which defies mechanical treatment we cannot deduce motion from consciousness or consciousness from motion as we deduce one motion from another nevertheless observation is open to us and by it relations may be established which are at least as valid as those of the deductive reason the difficulty may really lie in the attempt to convert a datum into an inferencean ultimate fact into a product of logic my desire for the moment however is not to theorise but to let facts speak in reply to accusation the most materialistic speculation for which i was responsible prior to the belfast address is embodied in the following extract from a brief article written as far back as 1865 supposing the molecules of the human body instead of replacing others and thus renewing a preexisting form to be gathered firsthand from nature and placed in the exact relative positions which they occupy in the body supposing them to have the same forces and distribution of forces the same motions and distribution of motionswould this organised concourse of molecules stand before us as a sentient thinking being there seems no valid reason to assume that it would not or supposing a planet carved from the sun set spinning round an axis and sent revolving round the sun at a distance equal to that of our earth would one consequence of the refrigeration of the mass be the development of organic forms i lean to the affirmative this is plain speaking but it is without dogmatism an opinion is expressed a belief a leaningnot an established doctrine the burthen of my writings in this connection is as much a recognition of the weakness of science as an assertion of its strength in 1867 i told the working men of dundee that while making the largest demand for freedom of investigation while considering science to be alike powerful as an instrument of intellectual culture and as a ministrant to the material wants of men if asked whether science has solved or is likely in our day to solve the problem of the universe i must shake my head in doubt i compare the mind of man to a musical instrument with a certain range of notes beyond which in both directions exists infinite silence the phenomena of matter and force come within our intellectual range but behind and above and around us the real mystery of the universe lies unsolved and as far as we are concerned is incapable of solution while refreshing my mind on these old themes i appear to myself as a person possessing one idea which so overmasters him that he is never weary of repeating it that idea is the polar conception of the grandeur and the littleness of manthe vastness of his range in some respects and directions and his powerlessness to take a single step in others in 1868 before the mathematical and physical section of the british association then assembled at norwich i repeat the same wellworn note in thus affirming the growth of the human body to be mechanical and thought as exercised by us to have its correlative in the physics of the brain the position of the materialist as far as that position is tenable is stated i think the materialist will be able finally to maintain this position against all attacks but i do not think he can pass beyond it the problem of the connection of body and soul is as insoluble in its modern form as it was in the prescientific ages phosphorus is a constituent of the human brain and a trenchant german writer has exclaimed ohne phosphor kein gedanke that may or may not be the case but even if we knew it to be the case the knowledge would not lighten our darkness on both sides of the zone here assigned to the materialist he is equally helpless if you ask him whence is this matter of which we have been discoursingwho or what divided it into molecules and impressed upon them this necessity of running into organic formshe has no answer science is also mute in regard to such questions but if the materialist is confounded and science is rendered dumb who else is prepared with an answer let us lower our heads and acknowledge our ignorance priest and philosopher one and all the roll of echoes which succeeded the lecture delivered by professor virchow at munich on september 22 1877 was long and loud the times published a nearly full translation of the lecture and it was eagerly commented on in other journals glances from it to an address delivered by me before the midland institute in the autumn of 1877 and published in this volume were very frequent professor virchow was held up to me in some quarters as a model of philosophic caution who by his reasonableness reproved my rashness and by his depth reproved my shallowness with true theologic courtesy i was sedulously emptied not only of the principles of scientific thought but of common modesty and common sense and though i am indebted to professor clifford for recalling in the nineteenth century for april the public mind in this connection from heated fancy to sober fact i do not think a brief additional examination of virchows views and of my relation to them will be out of place here the keynote of his position is struck in the preface to the excellent english translation of his lecturea preface written expressly by himself nothing he says was farther from his intention than any wish to disparage the great services rendered by mr darwin to the advancement of biological science of which no one has expressed more admiration than himself on the other hand it seemed high time to him to enter an energetic protest against the attempts that are made to proclaim the problems of research as actual facts and the opinions of scientists as established science on the ground among others that it promotes the pernicious delusions of the socialist virchow considers the theory of evolution dangerous but his fidelity to truth is so great that he would brave the danger and teach the theory if it were only proved however dangerous the state of things might be let the confederates be as mischievous as they might still i do not hesitate to say that from the moment when we had become convinced that the evolution theory was a perfectly established doctrineso certain that we could pledge our oath to it so sure that we could say thus it isfrom that moment we could not dare to feel any scruple about introducing it into our actual life so as not only to communicate it to every educated man but to impart it to every child to make it the foundation of our whole ideas of the world of society and the state and to base upon it our whole system of education this i hold to be a necessity it would be interesting to know the persons designated by the pronoun we in the first sentence of the foregoing quotation no doubt professor haeckel would accept this canon in all its fulness and found on it his justification he would say without hesitation i am convinced that the theory of evolution is a perfectly established doctrine and hence on your own showing i am justified in urging its introduction into our schools it is plain however that professor virchow would not accept this retort as valid his we must cover something more than professor haeckel it would probably cover more even than the audience he addressed for he would hardly affirm even if every one of his hearers accepted the theory of evolution that that would be a sufficient warrant for forcing it upon the public at large his we i submit needs definition if he means that the theory of evolution ought to be introduced into our schools not when experts are agreed as to its truth but when the community is prepared for its introduction then i think he is right and that as a matter of social policy dr haeckel would be wrong in seeking to antedate the period of its introduction in dealing with the community great changes must have timeliness as well as truth upon their side but if the mouths of thinkers be stopped the necessary social preparation will be impossible an unwholesome divorce will be established between the expert and the public and the slow and natural process of leavening the social lump by discovery and discussion will be displaced by something far less safe and salutary the burthen however of this celebrated lecture is a warning that a marked distinction ought to be made between that which is experimentally proved and that which is still in the region of speculation as to the latter virchow by no means imposes silence he is far too sagacious a man to commit himself at the present time of day to any such absurdity but he insists that it ought not to be put on the same evidential level as the former it ought as he poetically expresses it i to be written in small letters under the text the audience ought to be warned that the speculative matter is only possible not actual truththat it belongs to the region of belief and not to that of demonstration as long as a problem continues in this speculative stage it would be mischievous he considers to teach it in our schools we ought not he urges to represent our conjecture as a certainty nor our hypothesis as a doctrine this is inadmissible with regard to the connection between physical processes and mental phenomena he says i will indeed willingly grant that we can find certain gradations certain definite points at which we trace a passage from mental processes to processes purely physical or of a physical character throughout this discourse i am not asserting that it will never be possible to bring psychical processes into an immediate connection with those that are physical all i say is that we have at present no right to set up this possible connection as a doctrine of science in the next paragraph be reiterates his position with reference to the introduction of such topics into school teaching we must draw he says a strict distinction between what we wish to teach and what we wish to search for the objects of our research are expressed as problems or hypotheses we need not keep them to ourselves we are ready to communicate them to all the world and say there is the problem that is what we strive for the investigation of such problems in which the whole nation may be interested cannot be restricted to any one this is freedom of enquiry but the problem or hypothesis is not without further debate to be made a doctrine he will not concede to dr haeckel that it is a question for the schoolmasters to decide whether the darwinian theory of mans descent should be at once laid down as the basis of instruction and the protoplastic soul be assumed as the foundation of all ideas concerning spiritual being the professor concludes his lecture thus with perfect truth did bacon say of old scientia est potentia but he also defined that knowledge and the knowledge he meant was not speculative knowledge not the knowledge of hypotheses but it was objective and actual knowledge gentlemen i think we should be abusing our power we should be imperilling our power unless in our teaching we restrict ourselves to this perfectly safe and unassailable domain from this domain we may make incursions into the field of problems and i am sure that every venture of that kind will then find all needful security and support i have emphasised by italics two sentences in the foregoing series of quotations the other italics are the authors own virchows position could not be made clearer by any comments of mine than he has here made it himself that position is one of the highest practical importance throughout our whole german fatherland he says men are busied in renovating extending and developing the system of education and in inventing fixed forms in which to mould it on the threshold of coming events stands the prussian law of education in all the german states larger schools are being built new educational establishments are set up the universities are extended higher and middle schools are founded finally comes the question what is to be the chief substance of the teaching what virchow thinks it ought and ought not to be is disclosed by the foregoing quotations there ought to be a clear distinction made between science in the state of hypothesis and science in the state of fact in school teaching the former ought to be excluded and as he assumes it to be still in its hypothetical stage the ban of exclusion ought he thinks to fall upon the theory of evolution i now freely offer myself for judgment before the tribunal whose law is here laid down first and foremost then i have never advocated the introduction of the theory of evolution into our schools i should even be disposed to resist its introduction before its meaning had been better understood and its utility more fully recognised than it is now by the great body of the community the theory ought i think to bide its time until the free conflict of discovery argument and opinion has won for it this recognition a necessary condition here however is that free discussion should not be prevented either by the ferocity of reviewers or the arm of the law otherwise as i said before the work of social preparation cannot go on on this count then i claim acquittal being for the moment on the side of virchow besides the duties of the chair which i have been privileged to occupy in london for more than a quarter of a century and which never involved a word on my part pro or con in reference to the theory of evolution i have had the honour of addressing audiences in liverpool belfast and birmingham and in these addresses the theory of evolution and the connected doctrine of spontaneous generation have been more or less touched upon let us now examine whether in my references i have departed from the views of virchow or not in the liverpool discourse after speaking of the theory of evolution when applied to the primitive condition of matter as belonging to the dim twilight of conjecture and affirming that the certainty of experimental enquiry is here shut out i sketch the nebular theory as enunciated by kant and laplace and afterwards proceed thus accepting some such view of the construction of our system as probable a desire immediately arises to connect the present life of our planet with the past we wish to know something of our remotest ancestry on its first detachment from the sun life as we understand it could not have been present on the earth how then did it come there the thing to be encouraged here is a reverent freedoma freedom preceded by the hard discipline which checks licentiousness in speculationwhile the thing to be repressed both in science and out of it is dogmatism and here i am in the hands of the meeting willing to end but ready to go on i have no right to intrude upon you unasked the unformed notions which are floating like clouds or gathering to more solid consistency in the modern speculative mind i then notice more especially the basis of the theory those who hold the doctrine of evolution are by no means ignorant of the uncertainty of their data and they only yield to it a provisional assent they regard the nebular hypothesis as probable and in the utter absence of any proof of the illegality of the act they prolong the method of nature from the present into the past here the observed uniformity of nature is their only guide having determined the elements of their curve in a world of observation and experiment they prolong that curve into an antecedent world and accept as probable the unbroken sequence of development from the nebula to the present time thus it appears that long antecedent to the publication of his advice i did exactly what professor virchow recommends showing myself as careful as he could be not to claim for a scientific doctrine a certainty which did not belong to it i now pass on to the belfast address and will cite at once from it the passage which has given rise to the most violent animadversion believing as i do in the continuity of nature i cannot stop abruptly where our microscopes cease to be of use at this point the vision of the mind authoritatively supplements that of the eye by an intellectual necessity i cross the boundary of the experimental evidence and discern in that matter which we in our ignorance of its latent powers and notwithstanding our professed reverence for its creator have hitherto covered with opprobrium the promise and potency of all terrestrial life without halting for a moment i go on to do the precise thing which professor virchow declares to be necessary if you ask me i say whether there exists the least evidence to prove that any form of life can be developed out of matter independently of antecedent life my reply is that evidence considered perfectly conclusive by many has been adduced and that were we to follow a common example and accept testimony because it falls in with our belief we should eagerly close with the evidence referred to but there is in the true man of science a desire stronger than the wish to have his beliefs upheld namely the desire to have them true and those to whom i refer as having studied this question believing the evidence offered in favour of spontaneous generation to be vitiated by error cannot accept it they know full well that the chemist now prepares from inorganic matter a vast array of substances which were some time ago regarded as the products solely of vitality they are intimately acquainted with the structural power of matter as evidenced in the phenomena of crystallisation they can justify scientifically their belief in its potency under the proper conditions to produce organisms but in reply to your question they will frankly admit their inability to point to any satisfactory experimental proof that life can be developed save from demonstrable antecedent life footnote quoted by clifford nineteenth century 3 p 726 comparing the theory of evolution with other theories i thus express myself the basis of the doctrine of evolution consists not in an experimental demonstrationfor the subject is hardly accessible to this mode of proofbut in its general harmony with scientific thought from contrast moreover it derives enormous relative strength on the one side we have a theory which converts the power whose garment is seen in the visible universe into an artificer fashioned after the human model and acting by broken efforts as man is seen to act on the other side we have the conception that all we see around us and feel within usthe phenomena of physical nature as well as those of the human mindhave their unsearchable roots in a cosmical life if i dare apply the term an infinitesimal span of which is offered to the investigation of man among thinking people in my opinion this last conception has a higher ethical value than that of a personal artificer be that as it may i make here no claim for the theory of evolution which can reasonably be refused ten years have elapsed said dr hooker at norwich in 1868 footnote presidents address to the british association since the publication of the origin of species by natural selection and it is therefore not too early now to ask what progress that bold theory has made in scientific estimation since the origin appeared it has passed through four english editions footnote published by mr john murray the english publisher of virchows lecture bane and antidote are thus impartially distributed by the same hand two american two german two french several russian a dutch and an italian edition so far from natural selection being a thing of the past the athenaeum had stated it to be so it is an accepted doctrine with almost every philosophical naturalist including it will always be understood a considerable proportion who are not prepared to admit that it accounts for all mr darwin assigns to it in the following year at innsbruck helmholtz took up the same ground footnote noch besteht lebhafter streit um die wahrheit oder wahrscheinlichkeit von darwins theorie er dreht sich aber doch eigentlich nur um die grenzen welche wir fuer die veraenderlichkeit der arten annehmen duerfen dass innerhalb derselben species erbliche racenverschiedenheiten auf die von darwin beschriebene weise zu kommen koennen ja dass viele der bisher als verschiedene species derselben gattung betrachteten formen von derselben urform abstammen werden auch seine gegner kaum leugnenpopulaere vortraege another decade has now passed and he is simply blind who cannot see the enormous progress made by the theory during that time some of the outward and visible signs of this advance are readily indicated the hostility and fear which so long prevented the recognition of mr darwin by his own university have vanished and this year cambridge amid universal acclamation conferred on him her doctors degree the academy of sciences in paris which had so long persistently closed its doors against mr darwin has also yielded at last while sermons lectures and published articles plainly show that even the clergy have to a great extent become acclimatised to the darwinian air my brief reference to mr darwin in the birmingham address was based upon the knowledge that such changes had been accomplished and were still going on that the lecture of professor virchow can to any practical extent disturb this progress of public faith in the theory of evolution i do not believe that the special lessons of caution which he inculcates were exemplified by me years before his voice was heard upon this subject has been proved in the foregoing pages in point of fact if he had preceded me instead of following me and if my desire had been to incorporate his wishes in my words i could not have accomplished this more completely it is possible moreover to draw the coincident lines still further for most of what he has said about spontaneous generation might have been uttered by me i share his opinion that the theory of evolution in its complete form involves the passage from matter which we now hold to be inorganic into organised matter in other words involves the assumption that at some period or other of the earths history there occurred what would be now called spontaneous generation i agree with him that the proofs of it are still wanting whoever he says recalls to mind the lamentable failure of all the attempts made very recently to discover a decided support for the generatio aequivoca in the lower forms of transition from the inorganic to the organic world will feel it doubly serious to demand that this theory so utterly discredited should be in any way accepted as the basis of all our views of life i hold with virchow that the failures have been lamentable that the doctrine is utterly discredited but my position here is so well known that i need not dwell upon it further with one special utterance of professor virchow his translator connects me by name i have no objection observes the professor to your saying that atoms of carbon also possess mind or that in their connection with the plastidule company they acquire mind only i do not know how i am to perceive this this is substantially what i had said seventeen years previously in the saturday review the professor continues if i explain attraction and repulsion as exhibitions of mind as psychical phenomena i simply throw the psyche out of the window and the psyche ceases to be a psyche i may say in passing that the psyche that could be cast out of the window is not worth houseroom at this point the translator who is evidently a man of culture strikes in with a footnote as an illustration of professor virchows meaning we may quote the conclusion at which doctor tyndall arrives respecting the hypothesis of a human soul offered as an explanation or a simplification of a series of obscure phenomenapsychical phenomena as he calls them if you are content to make your soul a poetic rendering of a phenomenon which refuses the yoke of ordinary physical laws i for one would not object to this exercise of ideality footnote presidential address delivered before the birmingham and midland institute october 1 1877 fortnightly review nov 1 1877 p 60 professor virchows meaning i admit required illustration but i do not clearly see how the quotation from me subserves this purpose i do not even know whether i am cited as meriting praise or deserving opprobrium in a far coarser fashion this utterance of mine has been dealt with in other places it may therefore be worth while to spend a few words upon it the sting of a wasp at the fingerend announces itself to the brain as pain the impression made by the sting travels in the first place with comparative slowness along the nerves affected and only when it reaches the brain have we the fact of consciousness those who think most profoundly on this subject hold that a chemical change which strictly interpreted is atomic motion is in such a case propagated along the nerve and communicated to the brain again on feeling the sting i flap the insect violently away what has caused this motion of my hand the command from the brain to remove the insect travels along the motor nerves to the proper muscles and their force being unlocked they perform the work demanded of them but what moved the nerve molecules which unlocked the muscle the sense of pain it may be replied but how can a sense of pain or any other state of consciousness make matter move not all the sense of pain or pleasure in the world could lift a stone or move a billiardball why should it stir a molecule try to express the motion numerically in terms of the sensation and the difficulty immediately appears hence the idea long ago entertained by philosophers but lately brought into special prominence that the physical processes are complete in themselves and would go on just as they do if consciousness were not at all implicated consciousness on this view is a kind of byproduct inexpressible in terms of force and motion and unessential to the molecular changes going on in the brain four years ago i wrote thus do states of consciousness enter as links into the chain of antecedence and sequence which gives rise to bodily actions speaking for myself it is certain that i have no power of imagining such states interposed between the molecules of the brain and influencing the transference of motion among the molecules the thing eludes all mental presentation hence an iron strength seems to belong to the logic which claims for the brain an automatic action uninfluenced by consciousness but it is i believe admitted by those who hold the automaton theory that states of consciousness are produced by the motion of the molecules of the brain and this production of consciousness by molecular motion is to me quite as unpresentable to the mental vision as the production of molecular motion by consciousness if i reject one result i must reject both i however reject neither and thus stand in the presence of two incomprehensibles instead of one incomprehensible here i secede from the automaton theory though maintained by friends who have all my esteem and fall back upon the avowal which occurs with such wearisome iteration throughout the foregoing pages namely my own utter incapacity to grasp the problem this avowal is repeated with emphasis in the passage to which professor virchows translator draws attention what i there ask is the causal connection between the objective and the subjectivebetween molecular motions and states of consciousness my answer is i do not see the connection nor am i acquainted with anybody who does it is no explanation to say that the objective and subjective are two sides of one and the same phenomenon why should the phenomenon have two sides this is the very core of the difficulty there are plenty of molecular motions which do exhibit this twosidedness does water think or feel when it runs into frostferns upon a window pane if not why should the molecular motion of the brain be yoked to this mysterious companionconsciousness we can form a coherent picture of all the purely physical processesthe stirring of the brain the thrilling of the nerves the discharging of the muscles and all the subsequent motions of the organism we are here dealing with mechanical problems which are mentally presentable but we can form no picture of the process whereby consciousness emerges either as a necessary link or as an accidental byproduct of this series of actions the reverse process of the production of motion by consciousness is equally unpresentable to the mind we are here in fact on the boundary line of the intellect where the ordinary canons of science fail to extricate us if we are true to these canons we must deny to subjective phenomena all influence on physical processes the mechanical philosopher as such will never place a state of consciousness and a group of molecules in the relation of mover and moved observation proves them to interact but in passing from the one to the other we meet a blank which the logic of deduction is unable to fill this the reader will remember is the conclusion at which i had arrived more than twenty years ago i lay bare unsparingly the central difficulty of the materialist and tell him that the facts of observation which he considers so simple are almost as difficult to be seized mentally as the idea of a soul i go further and say in effect to those who wish to retain this idea if you abandon the interpretations of grosser minds who image the soul as a psyche which could be thrown out of the windowan entity which is usually occupied we know not how among the molecules of the brain but which on due occasion such as the intrusion of a bullet or the blow of a club can fly away into other regions of spaceif abandoning this heathen notion you consent to approach the subject in the only way in which approach is possibleif you consent to make your soul a poetic rendering of a phenomenon which as i have taken more pains than anybody else to show you refuses the yoke of ordinary physical lawsthen i for one would not object to this exercise of ideality i say it strongly but with good temper that the theologian or the defender of theology who hacks and scourges me for putting the question in this light is guilty of black ingratitude notwithstanding the agreement thus far pointed out there are certain points in professor virchows lecture to which i should feel inclined to take exception i think it was hardly necessary to associate the theory of evolution with socialism it may be even questioned whether it was correct to do so as lange remarks the aim of socialism or of its extreme leaders is to overthrow the existing systems of government and anything that helps them to this end is welcomed whether it be atheism or papal infallibility for long years the socialists saw church and state united against them and both were therefore regarded with a common hatred but no sooner does a serious difference arise between church and state than a portion of the socialists begin immediately to dally with the former footnote geschichte des materialismus 2e auflage vol ii p 538 the experience of the last german elections illustrates langes position far nobler and truer to my mind than this fear of promoting socialism by a scientific theory which the best and soberest heads in the world have substantially accepted is the position assumed by helmholtz who in his popular lectures describes darwins theory as embracing an essentially new creative thought einen wesentlich neuen schoepferischen gedanken and who illustrates the greatness of this thought by copious references to the solutions previously undreamt of which it offers of the enigmas of life and organisation he points to the clouds of error and confusion which it has already dispersed and shows how the progress of discovery since its first enunciation is simply a record of the approach of the theory towards complete demonstration one point in this popular exposition deserves especial mention here helmholtz refers to the dominant position acquired by germany in physiology and medicine while other nations have kept abreast of her in the investigation of inorganic nature he claims for german men the credit of pursuing with unflagging and selfdenying industry with purely ideal aims and without any immediate prospect of practical utility the cultivation of pure science but that which has determined german superiority in the fields referred to was in his opinion something different from this enquiries into the nature of life are intimately connected with psychological and ethical questions and he claims for his countrymen a greater fearlessness of the consequences which a full knowledge of the truth may here carry along with it than reigns among the enquirers of other nations and why is this the case england and france he says possess distinguished investigatorsmen competent to follow up and illustrate with vigorous energy the methods of natural science but they have hitherto been compelled to bend before social and theological prejudices and could only utter their convictions under the penalty of injuring their social influence and usefulness germany has gone forward more courageously she has cherished the trust which has never been deceived that complete truth carries with it the antidote against the bane and danger which follow in the train of half knowledge a cheerfully laborious and temperate peoplea people morally strongcan well afford to look truth full in the face nor are they to be ruined by the enunciation of onesided theories even when these may appear to threaten the bases of society these words of helmholtz are in my opinion wiser and more applicable to the condition of germany at the present moment than those which express the fears of professor virchow it will be remembered that at the time of his lecture his chief anxieties were directed towards france but france has since that time given ample evidence of her ability to crush not only socialists but antisocialists who would impose on her a yoke which she refuses to bear in close connection with these utterances of helmholtz i place another utterance not less noble which i trust was understood and appreciated by those to whom it was addressed if said the president of the british association in his opening address in dublin we could lay down beforehand the precise limits of possible knowledge the problem of physical science would be already half solved but the question to which the scientific explorer has often to address himself is not merely whether he is able to solve this or that problem but whether he can so far unravel the tangled threads of the matter with which he has to deal as to weave them into a definite problem at all if his eye seem dim he must look steadfastly and with hope into the misty vision until the very clouds wreathe themselves into definite forms if his ear seem dull he must listen patiently and with sympathetic trust to the intricate whisperings of naturethe goddess as she has been called of a hundred voicesuntil here and there he can pick out a few simple notes to which his own powers can resound if then at a moment when he finds himself placed on a pinnacle from which he is called upon to take a perspective survey of the range of science and to tell us what he can see from his vantage ground if at such a moment after straining his gaze to the very verge of the horizon and after describing the most distant of welldefined objects he should give utterance also to some of the subjective impressions which he is conscious of receiving from regions beyond if he should depict possibilities which seem opening to his view if he should explain why he thinks this a mere blind alley and that an open path then the fault and the loss would be alike ours if we refused to listen calmly and temperately to form our own judgment on what we hear then assuredly it is we who would be committing the error of confounding matters of fact with matters of opinion if we failed to discriminate between the various elements contained in such a discourse and assumed that they had been all put on the same footing while largely agreeing with him i cannot quite accept the setting in which professor virchow places the confessedly abortive attempts to secure an experimental basis for the doctrine of spontaneous generation it is not a doctrine so discredited that some of the scientific thinkers of england accept as the basis of all their views of life their induction is by no means thus limited they have on their side more than the reasonable probability deemed sufficient by bishop butler for practical guidance in the gravest affairs that the members of the solar system which are now discrete once formed a continuous mass that in the course of untold ages during which the work of condensation through the waste of heat in space went on the planets were detached and that our present sun is the residual nucleus of the flocculent or gaseous ball from which the planets were successively separated life as we define it was not possible for aeons subsequent to this separation when and how did it appear i have already pressed this question but have received no answer footnote in the apology for the belfast address the question is reasoned out if with professor knight we regard the bible account of the introduction of life upon the earth as a poem not as a statement of fact where are we to seek for guidance as to the fact there does not exist a barrier possessing the strength of a cobweb to oppose to the hypothesis which ascribes the appearance of life to that potency of matter which finds expression in natural evolution footnote we feel it an undeniable necessity says professor virchow not to sever the organic world from the whole as if it were something disjoined from the whole this grave statement cannot be weakened by the subsequent pleasantry regarding carbon co this hypothesis is not without its difficulties but they vanish when compared with those which encumber its rivals there are various facts in science obviously connected and whose connections we are unable to trace but we do not think of filling the gap between them by the intrusion of a separable spiritual agent in like manner though we are unable to trace the course of things from the nebula when there was no life in our sense to the present earth where life abounds the spirit and practice of science pronounce against the intrusion of an anthropomorphic creator theologians must liberate and refine their conceptions or be prepared for the rejection of them by thoughtful minds it is they not we who lay claim to knowledge never given to man our refusal of the creative hypothesis is less an assertion of knowledge than a protest against the assumption of knowledge which must long if not always lie beyond us and the claim to which is a source of perpetual confusion at the same time when i look with strenuous gaze into the whole problem as far as my capacities allow overwhelming wonder is the predominant feeling this wonder has come to me from the ages just as much as my understanding and it has an equal right to satisfaction hence i say if abandoning your illegitimate claim to knowledge you place with job your forehead in the dust and acknowledge the authorship of this universe to be past finding outif having made this confession and relinquished the views of the mechanical theologian you desire for the satisfaction of feelings which i admit to be in great part those of humanity at large to give ideal form to the power that moves all thingsit is not by me that you will find objections raised to this exercise of ideality if it be only consciously and worthily carried out again i think professor virchows position in regard to the question of contagium animatum is not altogether that of true philosophy he points to the antiquity of the doctrine it is lost he says in the darkness of the middle ages we have received this name from our forefathers and it already appears distinctly in the sixteenth century we possess several works of that time which put forward contagium animatum as a scientific doctrine with the same confidence with the same sort of proof with which the plastidulic soul is now set forth these speculations of our forefathers will appeal differently to different minds by some they will be dismissed with a sneer to others they will appeal as proofs of genius on the part of those who enunciated them there are men and by no means the minority who however wealthy in regard to facts can never rise into the region of principles and they are sometimes intolerant of those who can they are formed to plod meritoriously on the lower levels of thought unpossessed of the pinions necessary to reach the heights they cannot realise the mental actthe act of inspiration it might well be calledby which a man of genius after long pondering and proving reaches a theoretic conception which unravels and illuminates the tangle of centuries of observation and experiment there are minds it may be said in passing who at the present moment stand in this relation to mr darwin for my part i should be inclined to ascribe to penetration rather than to presumption the notion of a contagium animatum he who invented the term ought i think to be held in esteem for he had before him the quantity of fact and the measure of analogy that would justify a man of genius in taking a step so bold nevertheless says professor virchow no one was able throughout a long time to discover these living germs of disease the sixteenth century did not find them nor did the seventeenth nor the eighteenth but it may be urged in reply to this that the theoretic conjecture often legitimately comes first it is the forecast of genius which anticipates the fact and constitutes a spur towards its discovery if instead of being a spur the theoretic guess rendered men content with imperfect knowledge it would be a thing to be deprecated but in modern investigation this is distinctly not the case darwins theory for example like the undulatory theory has been a motive power and not an anodyne at last continues professor virchow in the nineteenth century we have begun little by little really to find contagia animata so much the more honour i infer is due to those who three centuries in advance so put together the facts and analogies of contagious disease as to divine its root and character professor virchow seems to deprecate the obstinacy with which this notion of a contagium vivum emerged here i should not be inclined to follow him because i do not know nor does he tell me how much the discovery of facts in the nineteenth century is indebted to the stimulus derived from the theoretic discussions of preceding centuries the genesis of scientific ideas is a subject of profound interest and importance he would be but a poor philosopher who would sever modern chemistry from the efforts of the alchemists who would detach modern atomic doctrines from the speculations of lucretius and his predecessors or who would claim for our present knowledge of contagia an origin altogether independent of the efforts of our forefathers to penetrate this enigma finally i do not know that i should agree with professor virchow as to what a theory is or ought to be i call a theory a principle or conception of the mind which accounts for observed facts and which helps us to look for and predict facts not yet observed every new discovery which fits into a theory strengthens it the theory is not a thing complete from the first but a thing which grows as it were asymptotically towards certainty darwins theory as pointed out nine and ten years ago by helmholtz and hooker was then exactly in this condition of growth and had they to speak of the subject today they would be able to announce an enormous strengthening of the theoretic fibre fissures in continuity which then existed and which left little hope of being ever spanned have been since filled in so that the further the theory is tested the more fully does it harmonise with progressive experience and discovery we shall probably never fill all the gaps but this will not prevent a profound belief in the truth of the theory from taking root in the general mind much less will it justify a total denial of the theory the man of science who assumes in such a case the position of a denier is sure to be stranded and isolated the proper attitude in my opinion is to give to the theory during the phases of its growth as nearly as possible a proportionate assent and if it be a theory which influences practice our wisdom is to follow its probable suggestions where more than probability is for the moment unattainable i write thus with the theory of contagium vivum more especially in my mind and must regret the attitude of denial assumed by professor virchow towards that theory i must beg my friend klebs to pardon me he says if notwithstanding the late advances made by the doctrine of infectious fungi i still persist in my reserve so far as to admit only the fungus which is really proved while i deny all other fungi so long as they are not actually brought before me professor virchow that is to say will continue to deny the germ theory however great the probabilities on its side however numerous be the cases of which it renders a just account until it has ceased to be a theory at all and has become a congeries of sensible facts had he said as long as a single fungus of disease remains to be discovered it is your bounden duty to search for it i should cordially agree with him but by his unreserved denial he quenches the light of probability which ought to guide the practice of the medical man both here and in relation to the theory of evolution excess upon one side has begotten excess upon the other noteas might have been expected professor virchow shows himself in practice far too sound a philosopher to be restricted by the canon laid down in his critique of dr haeckel in his recent discourse upon the plague he asks and answers the question what is the contagium in the following words et questce que le contagium a mon avis lanalogie de la peste aver le charbon contagieux me parat si grande quil me semble possible de trouver un organisme microscopique qui contient le germe de laffection mais jusqu prsent on a peu cherch trouver cet organismerevue scientifique march 1879 xvi the electric light footnote a discourse delivered at the royal institution of great britain on friday january 17 1879 and introduced here as the latest fragment the subject of this evenings discourse was proposed by our late honorary secretary footnote mr william spottiswoode now president of the royal society that word late has for me its own connotations it implies among other things the loss of a comrade by whose side i have worked for thirteen years on the other hand regret is not without its opposite in the feeling with which i have seen him rise by sheer intrinsic merit moral and intellectual to the highest official position which it is in the power of english science to bestow well he whose constant desire and practice were to promote the interests and extend the usefulness of this institution thought that at a time when the electric light occupied so much of public attention a few sound notions regarding it on the more purely scientific side might to use his own pithy expression be planted in the public mind i am here tonight with the view of trying to the best of my ability to realise the idea of our friend in the year 1800 volta announced his immortal discovery of the pile whetted to eagerness by the previous conflict between him and galvani the scientific men of the age flung themselves with ardour upon the new discovery repeating voltas experiments and extending them in many ways the light and heat of the voltaic circuit attracted marked attention and in the innumerable tests and trials to which this question was subjected the utility of platinum and charcoal as means of exalting the light was on all hands recognised mr children with a battery surpassing in strength all its predecessors fused platinum wires eighteen inches long while points of charcoal produced a light so vivid that the sunshine compared with it appeared feeble footnote davy chemical philosophy p 110 such effects reached their culmination when in 1808 through the liberality of a few members of the royal institution davy was enabled to construct a battery of two thousand pairs of plates with which he afterwards obtained calorific and luminous effects far transcending anything previously observed the arc of flame between the carbon terminals was four inches long and by its heat quartz sapphire magnesia and lime were melted like wax in a candle flame while fragments of diamond and plumbago rapidly disappeared as if reduced to vapour footnote in the concluding lecture at the royal institution in june 1810 davy showed the action of this battery he then fused iridium the alloy of iridium and osmium and other refractory substances philosophical magazine vol xxxv p 463 quetelet assigns the first production of the spark between coalpoints to curtet in 1802 davy certainly in that year showed the carbon light with a battery of 150 pairs of plates in the theatre of the royal institution jour roy inst vol i p 166 the first condition to be fulfilled in the development of heat and light by the electric current is that it shall encounter and overcome resistance flowing through a perfect conductor no matter what the strength of the current might be neither heat nor light could be developed a rod of unresisting copper carries away uninjured and unwarmed an atmospheric discharge competent to shiver to splinters a resisting oak i send the selfsame current through a wire composed of alternate lengths of silver and platinum the silver offers little resistance the platinum offers much the consequence is that the platinum is raised to a white heat while the silver is not visibly warmed the same holds good with regard to the carbon terminals employed for the production of the electric light the interval between them offers a powerful resistance to the passage of the current and it is by the gathering up of the force necessary to burst across this interval that the voltaic current is able to throw the carbon into that state of violent intestine commotion which we call heat and to which its effulgence is due the smallest interval of air usually suffices to stop the current but when the carbon points are first brought together and then separated there occurs between them a discharge of incandescent matter which carries or may carry the current over a considerable space the light comes almost wholly from the incandescent carbons the space between them is filled with a blue flame which being usually bent by the earths magnetism receives the name of the voltaic arc footnote the part played by resistance is strikingly illustrated by the deportment of silver and thallium when mixed together and volatilised in the arc the current first selects as its carrier the most volatile metal which in this case is thallium while it continues abundant the passage of the current is so freethe resistance to it is so smallthat the heat generated is incompetent to volatilise the silver as the thallium disappears the current is forced to concentrate its power it presses the silver into its service and finally fills the space between the carbons with a vapour which as long as the necessary resistance is absent it is incompetent to produce i have on a former occasion drawn attention to a danger which besets the spectroscopist when operating upon a mixture of constituents volatile in different degrees when in 1872 i first observed the effect here described had i not known that silver was present i should have inferred its absence for seventy years then we have been in possession of this transcendent light without applying it to the illumination of our streets and houses such applications suggested themselves at the outset but there were grave difficulties in their way the first difficulty arose from the waste of the carbons which are dissipated in part by ordinary combustion and in part by the electric transfer of matter from the one carbon to the other to keep the carbons at the proper distance asunder regulators were devised the earliest i believe by staite and the most successful by duboscq foucault and serrin who have been succeeded by holmes siemens browning carr gramme lontin and others by such arrangements the first difficulty was practically overcome but the second a graver one is probably inseparable from the construction of the voltaic battery it arises from the operation of that inexorable law which throughout the material universe demands an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth refusing to yield the faintest glow of heat or glimmer of light without the expenditure of an absolutely equal quantity of some other power hence in practice the desirability of any transformation must depend upon the value of the product in relation to that of the power expended the metal zinc can be burnt like paper it might be ignited in a flame but it is possible to avoid the introduction of all foreign heat and to burn the zinc in air of the temperature of this room this is done by placing zinc foil at the focus of a concave mirror which concentrates to a point the divergent electric beam but which does not warm the air the zinc burns at the focus with a violet flame and we could readily determine the amount of heat generated by its combustion but zinc can be burnt not only in air but in liquids it is thus burnt when acidulated water is poured over it it is also thus burnt in the voltaic battery here however to obtain the oxygen necessary for its combustion the zinc has to dislodge the hydrogen with which the oxygen is combined the consequence is that the heat due to the combustion of the metal in the liquid falls short of that developed by its combustion in air by the exact quantity necessary to separate the oxygen from the hydrogen fully fourfifths of the total heat are used up in this molecular work only onefifth remaining to warm the battery it is upon this residue that we must now fix our attention for it is solely out of it that we manufacture our electric light before you are two small voltaic batteries of ten cells each the two ends of one of them are united by a thick copper wire while into the circuit of the other a thin platinum wire is introduced the platinum glows with a white heat while the copper wire is not sensibly warmed now an ounce of zinc like an ounce of coal produces by its complete combustion in air a constant quantity of heat the total heat developed by an ounce of zinc through its union with oxygen in the battery is also absolutely invariable let our two batteries then continue in action until an ounce of zinc in each of them is consumed in the one case the heat generated is purely domestic being liberated on the hearth where the fuel is burnt that is to say in the cells of the battery itself in the other case the heat is in part domestic and in part foreignin part within the battery and in part outside one of the fundamental truths to be borne in mind is that the sum of the foreign and domesticof the external and internalheats is fixed and invariable hence to have heat outside you must draw upon the heat within these remarks apply to the electric light by the intermediation of the electric current the moderate warmth of the battery is not only carried away but concentrated so as to produce at any distance from its origin a heat next in order to that of the sun the current might therefore be defined as the swift carrier of heat loading itself here with invisible power by a process of transmutation which outstrips the dreams of the alchemist it can discharge its load in the fraction of a second as light and heat at the opposite side of the world thus the light and heat produced outside the battery are derived from the metallic fuel burnt within the battery and as zinc happens to be an expensive fuel though we have possessed the electric light for more than seventy years it has been too costly to come into general use but within these walls in the autumn of 1831 faraday discovered a new source of electricity which we have now to investigate on the table before me lies a coil of covered copper wire with its ends disunited i lift one side of the coil from the table and in doing so exert the muscular effort necessary to overcome the simple weight of the coil i unite its two ends and repeat the experiment the effort now required if accurately measured would be found greater than before in lifting the coil i cut the lines of the earths magnetic force such cutting as proved by faraday being always accompanied in a closed conductor by the production of an induced electric current which as long as the ends of the coil remained separate had no circuit through which it could pass the current here evoked subsides immediately as heat this heat being the exact equivalent of the excess of effort just referred to as over and above that necessary to overcome the simple weight of the coil when the coil is liberated it falls back to the table and when its ends are united it encounters a resistance over and above that of the air it generates an electric current opposed in direction to the first and reaches the table with a diminished shock the amount of the diminution is accurately represented by the warmth which the momentary current developer in the coil various devices were employed to exalt these induced currents among which the instruments of pixii clarke and saxton were long conspicuous faraday indeed foresaw that such attempts were sure to be made but he chose to leave them in the hands of the mechanician while he himself pursued the deeper study of facts and principles i have rather he writes in 1831 been desirous of discovering new facts and new relations dependent on magnetoelectric induction than of exalting the force of those already obtained being assured that the latter would find their full development hereafter for more than twenty years magnetoelectricity had subserved its first and noblest purpose of augmenting our knowledge of the powers of nature it had been discovered and applied to intellectual ends its application to practical ends being still unrealised the drummond light had raised thoughts and hopes of vast improvements in public illumination many inventors tried to obtain it cheaply and in 1853 an attempt was made to organise a company in paris for the purpose of procuring through the decomposition of water by a powerful magnetoelectric machine constructed by m nollet the oxygen and hydrogen necessary for the lime light the experiment failed but the apparatus by which it was attempted suggested to mr holmes other and more hopeful applications abandoning the attempt to produce the lime light with persevering skill holmes continued to improve the apparatus and to augment its power until it was finally able to yield a magnetoelectric light comparable to that of the voltaic battery judged by later knowledge this first machine would be considered cumbrous and defective in the extreme but judged by the light of antecedent events it marked a great step forward faraday was profoundly interested in the growth of his own discovery the elder brethren of the trinity house had had the wisdom to make him their scientific adviser and it is interesting to notice in his reports regarding the light the mixture of enthusiasm and caution which characterised him enthusiasm was with him a motive power guided and controlled by a disciplined judgment he rode it as a charger holding it in by a strong rein while dealing with holmes he states the case of the light pro and con he checks the ardour of the inventor and as regards cost rejecting sanguine estimates he insists over and over again on the necessity of continued experiment for the solution of this important question his matured opinion was however strongly in favour of the light with reference to an experiment made at the south foreland on the 20th of april 1859 he thus expresses himself the beauty of the light was wonderful at a mile off the apparent streams of light issuing from the lantern were twice as long as those from the lower lighthouse and apparently three or four times as bright the horizontal plane in which they chiefly took their way made all above or below it black the tops of the bills the churches and the houses illuminated by it were striking in their effect upon the eye further on in his report he expresses himself thus in fulfilment of this part of my duty i beg to state that in my opinion professor holmes has practically established the fitness and sufficiency of the magnetoelectric light for lighthouse purposes so far as its nature and management are concerned the light produced is powerful beyond any other that i have yet seen so applied and in principle may be accumulated to any degree its regularity in the lantern is great its management easy and its care there may be confided to attentive keepers of the ordinary degree of intellect and knowledge finally as regards the conduct of professor holmes during these memorable experiments it is only fair to add the following remark with which faraday closes the report submitted to the elder brethren of the trinity house on the 29th of april 1859 i must bear my testimony he says to the perfect openness candour and honour of professor holmes he has answered every question concealed no weak point explained every applied principle given every reason for a change either in this or that direction during several periods of close questioning in a manner that was very agreeable to me whose duty it was to search for real faults or possible objections in respect both of the present time and the future footnote holmess first offer of his machine to the trinity house bears date february 2 1857 soon afterwards the elder brethren of the trinity house had the intelligent courage to establish the machines of holmes permanently at dungeness where the magnetoelectric light continued to shine for many years the magnetoelectric machine of the alliance company soon succeeded to that of holmes being in various ways a very marked improvement on the latter its currents were stronger and its light was brighter than those of its predecessor in it moreover the commutator the flashing and destruction of which were sources of irregularity and deterioration in the machine of holmes was at the suggestion of m masson entirely abandoned alternating currents instead of the direct current being employed footnote du moncel lelectricit august 1878 p 150 m serrin modified his excellent lamp with the express view of enabling it to cope with alternating currents during the international exhibition of 1862 where the machine was shown m berlioz offered to dispose of the invention to the elder brethren of the trinity house they referred the matter to faraday and he replied as follows i am not aware that the trinity house authorities have advanced so far as to be able to decide whether they will require more magnetoelectric machines or whether if they should require them they see reason to suppose the means of their supply in this country from the source already open to them would not be sufficient therefore i do not see that at present they want to purchase a machine faraday was obviously swayed by the desire to protect the interests of holmes who had borne the burden and heat which fall upon the pioneer the alliance machines were introduced with success at cape la hve near havre and the elder brethren of the trinity house determined to have the best available apparatus decided in 1868 on the introduction of machines on the alliance principle into the lighthouses at souter point and the south foreland these machines were constructed by professor holmes and they still continue in operation with regard then to the application of electricity to lighthouse purposes the course of events was this the dungeness light was introduced on january 31 1862 the light at la hve on december 26 1863 or nearly two years later but faradays experimental trial at the south foreland preceded the lighting of dungeness by more than two years the electric light was afterwards established at cape grisnez the light was started at souter point on january 11 1871 and at the south foreland on january 1 1872 at the lizard which enjoys the newest and most powerful development of the electric light it began to shine on january 1 1878 i have now to revert to a point of apparently small moment but which really constitutes an important step in the development of this subject i refer to the form given in 1857 to the rotating armature by dr werner siemens of berlin instead of employing coils wound transversely round cores of iron as in the machine of saxton siemens after giving a bar of iron the proper shape wound his wire longitudinally round it and obtained thereby greatly augmented effects between suitably placed magnetic poles such an armature is employed in the small magnetoelectric machine which i now introduce to your notice and for which the institution is indebted to mr henry wilde of manchester there are here sixteen permanent horseshoe magnets placed parallel to each other and between their poles a siemens armature the two ends of the wire which surrounds the armature are now disconnected in turning the handle and causing the armature to rotate i simply overcome ordinary mechanical friction but the two ends of the armature coil can be united in a moment and when this is done i immediately experience a greatly increased resistance to rotation something over and above the ordinary friction of the machine is now to be overcome and by the expenditure of an additional amount of muscular force i am able to overcome it the excess of labour thus thrown upon my arm has its exact equivalent in the electric currents generated and the heat produced by their subsidence in the coil of the armature a portion of this heat may be rendered visible by connecting the two ends of the coil with a thin platinum wire when the handle of the machine is rapidly turned the wire glows first with a red heat then with a white heat and finally with the heat of fusion the moment the wire melts the circuit round the armature is broken an instant relief from the labour thrown upon the arm being the consequence clearly realise the equivalent of the heat here developed during the period of turning the machine a certain amount of combustible substance was oxidised or burnt in the muscles of my arm had it done no external work the matter consumed would have produced a definite amount of heat now the muscular heat actually developed during the rotation of the machine fell short of this definite amount the missing heat being reproduced to the last fraction in the glowing platinum wire and the other parts of the machine here then the electric current intervenes between my muscles and the generated heat exactly as it did a moment ago between the voltaic battery and its generated heat the electric current is to all intents and purposes a vehicle which transports the heat both of muscle and battery to any distance from the hearth where the fuel is consumed not only is the current a messenger but it is also an intensifier of magical power the temperature of my arm is in round numbers 100 fahr and it is by the intensification of this heat that one of the most refractory of metals which requires a heat of 3600 fahr to fuse it has been reduced to the molten condition zinc as i have said is a fuel far too expensive to permit of the electric light produced by its combustion being used for the common purposes of life and you will readily perceive that the human muscles or even the muscles of a horse would be more expensive still here however we can employ the force of burning coal to turn our machine and it is this employment of our cheapest fuel rendered possible by faradays discovery which opens out to us the prospect of being able to apply the electric light to public use in 1866 a great step in the intensification of induced currents and the consequent augmentation of the magnetoelectric light was taken by mr henry wilde it fell to my lot to report upon them to the royal society but before doing so i took the trouble of going to manchester to witness mr wildes experiments he operated in this way starting from a small machine like that worked in your presence a moment ago he employed its current to excite an electromagnet of a peculiar shape between whose poles rotated a siemens armature footnote page and moigno had previously shown that the magnetoelectric current could produce powerful electromagnets from this armature currents were obtained vastly stronger than those generated by the small magnetoelectric machine these currents might have been immediately employed to produce the electric light but instead of this they were conducted round a second electromagnet of vast size between whose poles rotated a siemens armature of corresponding dimensions three armatures therefore were involved in this series of operations first the armature of the small magnetoelectric machine secondly the armature of the first electromagnet which was of considerable size and thirdly the armature of the second electromagnet which was of vast dimensions with the currents drawn from this third armature mr wilde obtained effects both as regards heat and light enormously transcending those previously known footnote mr wildes paper is published in the philosophical transactions for 1867 p 89 my opinion regarding wildes machine was briefly expressed in a report to the elder brethren of the trinity house on may 17 1866 it gives me pleasure to state that the machine is exceedingly effective and that it far transcends in power all other apparatus of the kind but the discovery which above all others brought the practical question to the front is now to be considered on the 4th of february 1867 a paper was received by the royal society from dr william siemens bearing the title on the conversion of dynamic into electrical force without the use of permanent magnetism footnote a paper on the same subject by dr werner siemens was read on january 17 1867 before the academy of sciences in berlin in a letter to engineering no 622 p 45 mr robert sabine states that professor wheatstones machines were constructed by mr stroh in the months of july and august 1866 i do not doubt mr sabines statement still it would be dangerous in the highest degree to depart from the canon in asserting which faraday was specially strenuous that the date of a discovery is the date of its publication towards the end of december 1866 mr alfred varley also lodged a provisional specification which i believe is a sealed document embodying the principles of the dynamoelectric machine but some years elapsed before he made anything public his brother mr cromwell varlet when writing on this subject in 1867 does not mention him proc roy soc march 14 1867 it probably marks a national trait that sealed communications though allowed in france have never been recognised by the scientific societies of england on the 14th of february a paper from sir charles wheatstone was received bearing the title on the augmentation of the power of a magnet by the reaction thereon of currents induced by the magnet itself both papers which dealt with the same discovery and which were illustrated by experiments were read upon the same night viz the 14th of february it would be difficult to find in the whole field of science a more beautiful example of the interaction of natural forces than that set forth in these two papers you can hardly find a bit of ironyou can hardly pick up an old horseshoe for examplethat does not possess a trace of permanent magnetism and from such a small beginning siemens and wheatstone have taught us to rise by a series of interactions between magnet and armature to a magnetic intensity previously unapproached conceive the siemens armature placed between the poles of a suitable electromagnet suppose this latter to possess at starting the faintest trace of magnetism when the armature rotates currents of infinitesimal strength are generated in its coil let the ends of that coil be connected with the wire surrounding the electromagnet the infinitesimal current generated in the armature will then circulate round the magnet augmenting its intensity by an infinitesimal amount the strengthened magnet instantly reacts upon the coil which feeds it producing a current of greater strength this current again passes round the magnet which immediately brings its enhanced power to bear upon the coil by this play of mutual give and take between magnet and armature the strength of the former is raised in a very brief interval from almost nothing to complete magnetic saturation such a magnet and armature are able to produce currents of extraordinary power and if an electric lamp be introduced into the common circuit of magnet and armature we can readily obtain a most powerful light footnote in 1867 mr ladd introduced the modification of dividing the armature into two separate coils one of which fed the electromagnets while the other yielded the induced currents by this discovery then we are enabled to avoid the trouble and expense involved in the employment of permanent magnets we are also enabled to drop the exciting magnetoelectric machine and the duplication of the electromagnets by it in short the electric generator is so far simplified and reduced in cost as to enable electricity to enter the lists as the rival of our present means of illumination soon after the announcement of their discovery by siemens and wheatstone mr holmes at the instance of the elder brethren of the trinity house endeavoured to turn this discovery to account for lighthouse purposes already in the spring of 1869 he had constructed a machine which though hampered with defects exhibited extraordinary power the light was developed in the focus of a dioptric apparatus placed on the trinity wharf at blackwall and witnessed by the elder brethren mr douglass and myself from an observatory at charlton on the opposite side of the thames falling upon the suspended haze the light illuminated the atmosphere for miles all round anything so sunlike in splendour had not i imagine been previously witnessed the apparatus of holmes however was rapidly distanced by the safer and more powerful machines of siemens and gramme as regards lighthouse illumination the next step forward was taken by the elder brethren of the trinity house in 187677 having previously decided on the establishment of the electric light at the lizard in cornwall they instituted at the time referred to an elaborate series of comparative experiments wherein the machines of holmes of the alliance company of siemens and of gramme were pitted against each other the siemens and the gramme machines delivered direct currents while those of holmes and the alliance company delivered alternating currents the light of the latter was of the same intensity in all azimuths that of the former was different in different azimuths the discharge being so regulated as to yield a

observations in which the external resistance was abolished and previous to which the lightkeepers had become more skilled in the management of the direct current showed the differences recorded in the table a close inspection of these powerful lights at the south foreland caused my face to peel as if it had been irritated by an alpine sun these determinations were made with extreme care and accuracy by mr douglass the engineerinchief and mr ayres the assistant engineer of the trinity house it is practically impossible to compare photometrically and directly the flame of the candle with these sunlike lights a light of intermediate intensitythat of the sixwick trinity oil lampwas therefore in the first instance compared with the electric light the candle power of the oil lamp being afterwards determined the intensity of the electric light became known the numbers given in the table prove the superiority of the alliance machine over that of holmes they prove the great superiority both of the gramme machine and of the small siemens machine over the alliance the large siemens machine is shown to yield a light far exceeding all the others while the coupling of two grammes or of two siemens together here effected for the first time was followed by a very great augmentation of the light rising in the one case from 6663 candles to 11396 and in the other case from 6864 candles to 14134 where the arc is single and the external resistance small great advantages attach to the siemens light after this contest which was conducted throughout in the most amicable manner siemens machines of type no 2 were chosen for the lizard footnote as the result of a recent trial by mr schwendler they have been also chosen for india we have machines capable of sustaining a single light and also machines capable of sustaining several lights the gramme machine for example which ignites the jablochkoff candles on the thames embankment and at the holborn viaduct delivers four currents each passing through its own circuit in each circuit are five lamps through which the current belonging to the circuit passes in succession the lights correspond to so many resisting spaces over which as already explained the current has to leap the force which accomplishes the leap being that which produces the light whether the current is to be competent to pass through five lamps in succession or to sustain only a single lamp depends entirely upon the will and skill of the maker of the machine he has to guide him definite laws laid down by ohm half a century ago by which he must abide ohm has taught us how to arrange the elements of a voltaic battery so as to augment indefinitely its electromotive forcethat force namely which urges the current forward and enables it to surmount external obstacles we have only to link the cells together so that the current generated by each cell shall pass through all the others and add its electromotive force to that of all the others we increase it is true at the same time the resistance of the battery diminishing thereby the quantity of the current from each cell but we augment the power of the integrated current to overcome external hindrances the resistance of the battery itself may indeed be rendered so great that the external resistance shall vanish in comparison what is here said regarding the voltaic battery is equally true of magnetoelectric machines if we wish our current to leap over five intervals and produce five lights in succession we must invoke a sufficient electromotive force this is done through multiplying by the use of thin wires the convolutions of the rotating armature as a moment ago we augmented the cells of our voltaic battery each additional convolution like each additional cell adds its electromotive force to that of all the others and though it also adds its resistance thereby diminishing the quantity of current contributed by each convolution the integrated current becomes endowed with the power of leaping across the successive spaces necessary for the production of a series of lights in its course the current is as it were rendered at once thinner and more piercing by the simultaneous addition of internal resistance and electromotive power the machines on the other hand which produce only a single light have a small internal resistance associated with a small electromotive force in such machines the wire of the rotating armature is comparatively short and thick copper riband instead of wire being commonly employed such machines deliver a large quantity of electricity of low tensionin other words of low leaping power hence though competent when their power is converged upon a single interval to produce one splendid light their currents are unable to force a passage when the number of intervals is increased thus by augmenting the convolutions of our machines we sacrifice quantity and gain electromotive force while by lessening the number of the convolutions we sacrifice electromotive force and gain quantity whether we ought to choose the one form of machine or the other depends entirely upon the external work the machine has to perform if the object be to obtain a single light of great splendour machines of low resistance and large quantity must be employed if we want to obtain in the same circuit several lights of moderate intensity machines of high internal resistance and of correspondingly high electromotive power must be invoked when a coil of covered wire surrounds a bar of iron the two ends of the coil being connected together every alteration of the magnetism of the bar is accompanied by the development of an induced current in the coil the current is only excited during the period of magnetic change no matter how strong or how weak the magnetism of the bar may be as long as its condition remains permanent no current is developed conceive then the pole of a magnet placed near one end of the bar to be moved along it towards the other end during the time of the poles motion there will be an incessant change in the magnetism of the bar and accompanying this change we shall have an induced current in the surrounding coil if instead of moving the magnet we move the bar and its surrounding coil past the magnetic pole a similar alteration of the magnetism of the bar will occur and a similar current will be induced in the coil you have here the fundamental conception which led m gramme to the construction of his beautiful machine footnote comptes rendus 1871 p 176 see also gaugain on the gramme machine ann de chem et de phys vol xxviii p 324 he aimed at giving continuous motion to such a bar as we have here described and for this purpose he bent it into a continuous ring which by a suitable mechanism he caused to rotate rapidly close to the poles of a horseshoe magnet the direction of the current varied with the motion and with the character of the influencing pole the result was that the currents in the two semicircles of the coil surrounding the ring flowed in opposite directions but it was easy by the mechanical arrangement called a commutator to gather up the currents and cause them to flow in the same direction the first machines of gramme therefore furnished direct currents similar to those yielded by the voltaic pile m gramme subsequently so modified his machine as to produce alternating currents such alternating machines are employed to produce the lights now exhibited on the holborn viaduct and the thames embankment another machine of great alleged merit is that of m lontin it resembles in shape a toothed iron wheel the teeth being used as cores round which are wound coils of copper wire the wheel is caused to rotate between the opposite poles of powerful electromagnets on passing each pole the core or tooth is strongly magnetised and instantly evokes in its surrounding coil an induced current of corresponding strength the currents excited in approaching to and retreating from a pole and in passing different poles move in opposite directions but by means of a commutator these conflicting electric streams are gathered up and caused to flow in a common bed the bobbins in which the currents are induced can be so increased in number as to augment indefinitely the power of the machine to excite his electromagnets m lontin applies the principle of mr wilde a small machine furnishes a direct current which is carried round the electromagnets of a second and larger machine wildes principle it may be added is also applied on the thames embankment and the holborn viaduct a small gramme machine being used in each case to excite the electromagnets of the large one the farmerwallace machine is also an apparatus of great power it consists of a combination of bobbins for induced currents and of inducing electromagnets the latter being excited by the method discovered by siemens and wheatstone in the machines intended for the production of the electric light the electromotive force is so great as to permit of the introduction of several lights in the same circuit a peculiarly novel feature of the farmerwallace system is the shape of the carbons instead of rods two large plates of carbons with bevelled edges are employed one above the other the electric discharge passes from edge to edge and shifts its position according as the carbon is dissipated the duration of the light in this case far exceeds that obtainable with rods i have myself seen four of these lights in the same circuit in mr ladds workshop in the city and they are now i believe employed at the liverpool street station of the metropolitan railway the farmerwallace quantity machine pours forth a flood of electricity of low tension it is unable to cross the interval necessary for the production of the electric light but it can fuse thick copper wires when sent through a short bar of iridium this refractory metal emits a light of extraordinary splendour footnote the iridium light was shown by mr ladd it brilliantly illuminated the theatre of the royal institution the machine of m de mritens which he has generously brought over from paris for our instruction is the newest of all in its construction he falls back upon the principle of the magnetoelectric machine employing permanent magnets as the exciters of the induced currents using the magnets of the alliance company by a skilful disposition of his bobbins m de mritens produces with eight magnets a light equal to that produced by forty magnets in the alliance machines while the space occupied is only onefifth the cost is little more than onefourth of the latter in the de mritens machine the commutator is abolished the internal heat is hardly sensible and the absorption of power in relation to the effects produced is small with his larger machines m de mritens maintains a considerable number of lights in the same circuit footnote the small machine transforms oneandaquarter horsepower into heat and light yielding about 1900 candles the large machine transforms fivehorse power yielding about 9000 candles in relation to this subject inventors fall into two classes the contrivers of regulators and the constructors of machines m rapieff has hitherto belonged to inventors of the first class but i have reason to know that he is engaged on a machine which when complete will place him in the other class also instead of two single carbon rods m rapieff employs two pairs of rods each pair forming a v the light is produced at the common junction of the four carbons the device for regulating the light is of the simplest character at the bottom of the stand which supports the carbons are two small electromagnets one of them when the current passes draws the carbons together and in so doing throws itself out of circuit leaving the control of the light to the other the carbons are caused to approach each other by a descending weight which acts in conjunction with the electromagnet through the liberality of the proprietors of the times every facility has been given to m rapieff to develope and simplify his invention at printing house square the illumination of the pressroom which i had the pleasure of witnessing under the guidance of m rapieff himself is extremely effectual and agreeable to the eye there are i believe five lamps in the same circuit and the regulators are so devised that the extinction of any lamp does not compromise the action of the others m rapieff has lately improved his regulator many other inventors might here be named and fresh ones are daily crowding in mr werdermann has been long known in connection with this subject employing as negative carbon a disc and as positive carbon a rod he has i am assured obtained very satisfactory results the small resistances brought into play by his minute arcs enable mr werdermann to introduce a number of lamps into a circuit traversed by a current of only moderate electromotive power m reynier is also the inventor of a very beautiful little lamp in which the point of a thin carbon rod properly adjusted is caused to touch the circumference of a carbon wheel which rotates underneath the point the light is developed at the place of contact of rod and wheel one of the last steps though i am informed not quite the last in the improvement of regulators is this the positive carbon wastes more profusely than the negative and this is alleged to be due to the greater heat of the former it occurred to mr william siemens to chill the negative artificially with the view of diminishing or wholly preventing its waste this he accomplishes by making the negative pole a hollow cone of copper and by ingeniously discharging a small jet of cold water against the interior of the cone his negative copper is thus caused to remain fixed in space for it is not dissipated the positive carbon only needing control i have seen this lamp in action and can bear witness to its success i might go on to other inventions achieved or projected indeed there is something bewildering in the recent rush of constructive talent into this domain of applied electricity the question and its prospects are modified from day to day a steady advance being made towards the improvement both of machines and regulators with regard to our public lighting i strongly lean to the opinion that the electric light will at no distant day triumph over gas i am not so sure that it will do so in our private houses as however i am anxious to avoid dropping a word here that could influence the share market in the slightest degree i limit myself to this general statement of opinion to one inventor in particular belongs the honour of the idea and the realisation of the idea of causing the carbon rods to burn away like a candle it is needless to say that i here refer to the young russian officer m jablochkoff he sets two carbon rods upright at a small distance apart and fills the space between them with an insulating substance like plaster of paris the carbon rods are fixed in metallic holders a momentary contact is established between the two carbons by a little crosspiece of the same substance placed horizontally from top to top this crosspiece is immediately dissipated or removed by the current the passage of which once established is afterwards maintained the carbons gradually waste while the substance between them melts like the wax of a candle the comparison however only holds good for the act of melting for as regards the current the insulating plaster is practically inert indeed as proved by m rapieff and mr wilde the plaster may be dispensed with altogether the current passing from point to point between the naked carbons m de mritens has recently brought out a new candle in which the plaster is abandoned while between the two principal carbons is placed a third insulated rod of the same material with the small de mritens machine two of these candles can be lighted before you they produce a very brilliant light footnote the machine of m de mritens and the farmerwallace machine were worked by an excellent gasengine lent for the occasion by the messrs crossley of manchester the siemens machine was worked by steam in the jablochkoff candle it is necessary that the carbons should be consumed at the same rate hence the necessity for alternating currents by which this equal consumption is secured it will be seen that m jablochkoff has abolished regulators altogether introducing the candle principle in their stead in my judgment the performance of the jablochkoff candle on the thames embankment and the holborn viaduct is highly creditable notwithstanding a considerable waste of light towards the sky the jablochkoff lamps it may be added would be more effective in a street where their light would be scattered abroad by the adjacent houses than in the positions which they now occupy in london it was my custom some years ago whenever i needed a new and complicated instrument to sit down beside its proposed constructor and to talk the matter over with him the study of the inventors mind which this habit opened out was always of the highest interest to me i particularly well remember the impression made upon me on such occasions by the late mr darker a philosophical instrument maker in lambeth this mans life was a struggle and the reason of it was not far to seek no matter how commercially lucrative the work upon which he was engaged might be he would instantly turn aside from it to seize and realise the ideas of a scientific man he had an inventors power and an inventors delight in its exercise the late mr becker possessed the same power in a very considerable degree on the continent froment breguet sauerwald and others might be mentioned as eminent instances of ability of this kind such minds resemble a liquid on the point of crystallisation stirred by a hint crystals of constructive thought immediately shoot through them that mr edison possesses this intuitive power in no common measure is proved by what he has already accomplished he has the penetration to seize the relationship of facts and principles and the art to reduce them to novel and concrete combinations hence though he has thus far accomplished nothing that we can recognise as new in relation to the electric light an adverse opinion as to his ability to solve the complicated problem on which he is engaged would be unwarranted i will endeavour to illustrate in a simple manner mr edisons alleged mode of electric illumination taking advantage of what ohm has taught us regarding the laws of the current and what joule has taught us regarding the relation of resistance to the development of light and heat from one end of a voltaic battery runs a wire dividing at a certain point into two branches which reunite in a single wire connected with the other end of the battery from the positive end of the battery the current passes first through the single wire to the point of junction where it divides itself between the branches according to a wellknown law if the branches be equally resistant the current divides itself equally between them if one branch be less resistant than the other more than half the current will choose the freer path the strict law is that the quantity of current is inversely proportional to the resistance a clear image of the process is derived from the deportment of water when a river meets an island it divides passing right and left of the obstacle and afterwards reuniting if the two branch beds be equal in depth width and inclination the water will divi de itself equally between them if they be unequal the larger quantity of water will flow through the more open course and as in the case of the water we may have an indefinite number of islands producing an indefinite subdivision of the trunk stream so in the case of electricity we may have instead of two branches any number of branches the current dividing itself among them in accordance with the law which fixes the relation of flow to resistance let us apply this knowledge suppose an insulated copper rod which we may call an electric main to be laid down along one of our streets say along the strand let this rod be connected with one end of a powerful voltaic battery a good metallic connection being established between the other end of the battery and the waterpipes under the street as long as the electric main continues unconnected with the waterpipes the circuit is incomplete and no current will flow but if any part of the main however distant from the battery be connected with the adjacent waterpipes the circuit will be completed and the current will flow supposing our battery to be at charing cross and our rod of copper to be tapped opposite somerset house a wire can be carried from the rod into the building and the current passing through the wire may be subdivided into any number of subordinate branches which reunite afterwards and return through the waterpipes to the battery the branch currents may be employed to raise to vivid incandescence a refractory metal like iridium or one of its alloys instead of being tapped at one point our main may be tapped at one hundred points the current will divide in strict accordance with law its power to produce light being solely limited by its strength the process of division closely resembles the circulation of the blood the electric main carrying the outgoing current representing a great artery the waterpipes carrying the return current representing a great vein while the intermediate branches represent the various vessels by which the blood is distributed through the system this if i understand aright is mr edisons proposed mode of illumination the electric force is at hand metals sufficiently refractory to bear being raised to vivid incandescence are also at hand the principles which regulate the division of the current and the development of its light and heat are perfectly well known there is no room for a discovery in the scientific sense of the term but there is ample room for the exercise of that mechanical ingenuity which has given us the sewing machine and so many other useful inventions knowing something of the intricacy of the practical problem i should certainly prefer seeing it in mr edisons hands to having it in mine footnote more than thirty years ago the radiation from incandescent platinum was admirably investigated by dr draper of new york it is sometimes stated as a recommendation to the electric light that it is light without heat but to disprove this it is only necessary to point to the experiments of davy which show that the heat of the voltaic arc transcends that of any other terrestrial source the emission from the carbon points is capable of accurate analysis to simplify the subject we will take the case of a platinum wire at first slightly warmed by the current and then gradually raised to a white heat when first warmed the wire sends forth rays which have no power on the optic nerve they are what we call invisible rays and not until the temperature of the wire has reached nearly 1000 fahr does it begin to glow with a faint red light the rays which it emits prior to redness are all invisible rays which can warm the hand but cannot excite vision when the temperature of the wire is raised to whiteness these dark rays not only persist but they are enormously augmented in intensity they constitute about 95 per cent of the total radiation from the whitehot platinum wire they make up nearly 90 per cent of the emission from a brilliant electric light you can by no means have the light of the carbons without this invisible emission as an accompaniment the visible radiation is as it were built upon the invisible as its necessary foundation it is easy to illustrate the growth in intensity of these invisible rays as the visible ones enter the radiation and augment in power the transparency of the elementary gases and metalloidsof oxygen hydrogen nitrogen chlorine iodine bromine sulphur phosphorus and even of carbon for the invisible heat rays is extraordinary dissolved in a proper vehicle iodine cuts the visible radiation sharply off but allows the invisible free transmission by dissolving iodine in sulphur professor dewar has recently added to the number of our effectual rayfilters the mixture may be made as black as pitch for the visible while remaining transparent for the invisible rays by such filters it is possible to detach the invisible rays from the total radiation and to watch their augmentation as the light increases expressing the radiation from a platinum wire when it first feels warm to the touchwhen therefore all its rays are invisibleby the number 1 the invisible radiation from the same wire raised to a white heat may be 500 or more footnote see article radiation vol i it is not then by the diminution or transformation of the nonluminous emission that we obtain the luminous the heat rays maintain their ground as the necessary antecedents and companions of the light rays when detached and concentrated these powerful heat rays can produce all the effects ascribed to the mirrors of archimedes at the siege of syracuse while incompetent to produce the faintest glimmer of light or to affect the most delicate airthermometer they will inflame paper burn up wood and even ignite combustible metals when they impinge upon a metal refractory enough to bear their shock without fusion they can raise it to a heat so white and luminous as to yield when analysed all the colours of the spectrum in this way the dark rays emitted by the incandescent carbons are converted into light rays of all colours still so powerless are these invisible rays to excite vision that the eye has been placed at a focus competent to raise platinum foil to bright redness without experiencing any visual impression light for light no doubt the amount of heat imparted by the incandescent carbons to the air is far less than that imparted by gas flames it is less because of the smaller size of the carbons and of the comparative smallness of the quantity of fuel consumed in a given time it is also less because the air cannot penetrate the carbons as it penetrates a flame the temperature of the flame is lowered by the admixture of a gas which constitutes fourfifths of our atmosphere and which while it appropriates and diffuses the heat does not aid in the combustion and this lowering of the temperature by the inert atmospheric nitrogen renders necessary the combustion of a greater amount of gas to produce the necessary light in fact though the statement may appear paradoxical it is entirely because of its enormous actual temperature that the electric light seems so cool it is this temperature that renders the proportion of luminous to nonluminous heat greater in the electric light than in our brightest flames the electric light moreover requires no air to sustain it it glows in the most perfect air vacuum its light and heat are therefore not purchased at the expense of the vitalising constituent of the atmosphere two orders of minds have been implicated in the development of this subject first the investigator and discoverer whose object is purely scientific and who cares little for practical ends secondly the practical mechanician whose object is mainly industrial it would be easy and probably in many cases true to say that the one wants to gain knowledge while the other wishes to make money but i am persuaded that the mechanician not unfrequently merges the hope of profit in the love of his work members of each of these classes are sometimes scornful towards those of the other there is for example something superb in the disdain with which cuvier hands over the discoveries of pure science to those who apply them your grand practical achievements are only the easy application of truths not sought with a practical intenttruths which their discoverers pursued for their own sake impelled solely by an ardour for knowledge those who turned them into practice could not have discovered them while those who discovered them had neither the time nor the inclination to pursue them to a practical result your rising workshops your peopled colonies your vessels which furrow the seas this abundance this luxury this tumultthis commotion he would have added were he now alive regarding the electric lightall come from discoverers in science though all remain strange to them the day that a discovery enters the market they abandon it it concerns them no more in writing thus cuvier probably did not sufficiently take into account the reaction of the applications of science upon science itself the improvement of an old instrument or the invention of a new one is often tantamount to an enlargement and refinement of the senses of the scientific investigator beyond this the amelioration of the community is also an object worthy of the best efforts of the human brain still assuredly it is well and wise for a nation to bear in mind that those practical applications which strike the public eye and excite public admiration are the outgrowth of long antecedent labours begun continued and ended under the operation of a purely intellectual stimulus few says pasteur seem to comprehend the real origin of the marvels of industry and the wealth of nations i need no other proof of this than the frequent employment in lectures speeches and official language of the erroneous expression applied science a statesman of the greatest talent stated some time ago that in our day the reign of theoretic science had rightly yielded place to that of applied science nothing i venture to say could be more dangerous even to practical life than the consequences which might flow from these words they show the imperious necessity of a reform in our higher education there exists no category of sciences to which the name of applied science could be given we have science and the applications of science which are united as tree and fruit a final reflection is here suggested we have amongst us a small cohort of social regeneratorsmen of high thoughts and aspirationswho would place the operations of the scientific mind under the control of a hierarchy which should dictate to the man of science the course that he ought to pursue how this hierarchy is to get its wisdom they do not explain they decry and denounce scientific theories they scorn all reference to aether and atoms and molecules as subjects lying far apart from the worlds needs and yet such ultrasensible conceptions are often the spur to the greatest discoveries the source in fact from which the true natural philosopher derives inspiration and unifying power is essentially ideal faraday lived in this ideal world nearly half a century ago when he first obtained a spark from the magnet an oxford don expressed regret that such a discovery should have been made as it placed a new and facile implement in the hands of the incendiary to regret a comtist hierarchy would have probably added repression sending faraday back to his bookbinders bench as a more dignified and practical sphere of action than peddling with a magnet and yet it is faradays spark which now shines upon our coasts and promises to illuminate our streets halls quays squares warehouses and perhaps at no distant day our homes the end london printed by spottiswoode
