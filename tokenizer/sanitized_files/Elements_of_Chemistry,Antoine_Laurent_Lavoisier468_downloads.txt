advertisement of the translator the very high character of mr lavoisier as a chemical philosopher and the great revolution which in the opinion of many excellent chemists he has effected in the theory of chemistry has long made it much desired to have a connected account of his discoveries and of the new theory he has founded upon the modern experiments written by himself this is now accomplished by the publication of his elements of chemistry therefore no excuse can be at all necessary for giving the following work to the public in an english dress and the only hesitation of the translator is with regard to his own abilities for the task he is most ready to confess that his knowledge of the composition of language fit for publication is far inferior to his attachment to the subject and to his desire of appearing decently before the judgment of the world he has earnestly endeavoured to give the meaning of the author with the most scrupulous fidelity having paid infinitely greater attention to accuracy of translation than to elegance of stile this last indeed had he even by proper labour been capable of attaining he has been obliged for very obvious reasons to neglect far more than accorded with his wishes the french copy did not reach his hands before the middle of september and it was judged necessary by the publisher that the translation should be ready by the commencement of the university session at the end of october he at first intended to have changed all the weights and measures used by mr lavoisier into their correspondent english denominations but upon trial the task was found infinitely too great for the time allowed and to have executed this part of the work inaccurately must have been both useless and misleading to the reader all that has been attempted in this way is adding between brackets the degrees of fahrenheits scale corresponding with those of reaumeurs thermometer which is used by the author rules are added however in the appendix for converting the french weights and measures into english by which means the reader may at any time calculate such quantities as occur when desirous of comparing mr lavoisiers experiments with those of british authors by an oversight the first part of the translation went to press without any distinction being preserved between charcoal and its simple elementary part which enters into chemical combinations especially with oxygen or the acidifying principle forming carbonic acid this pure element which exists in great plenty in well made charcoal is named by mr lavoisier carbone and ought to have been so in the translation but the attentive reader can very easily rectify the mistake there is an error in plate xi which the engraver copied strictly from the original and which was not discovered until the plate was worked off at press when that part of the elements which treats of the apparatus there represented came to be translated the two tubes 21 and 24 by which the gas is conveyed into the bottles of alkaline solution 22 25 should have been made to dip into the liquor while the other tubes 23 and 26 which carry off the gas ought to have been cut off some way above the surface of the liquor in the bottles a few explanatory notes are added and indeed from the perspicuity of the author very few were found necessary in a very small number of places the liberty has been taken of throwing to the bottom of the page in notes some parenthetical expressions only relative to the subject which in their original place tended to confuse the sense these and the original notes of the author are distinguished by the letter a and to the few which the translator has ventured to add the letter e is subjoined mr lavoisier has added in an appendix several very useful tables for facilitating the calculations now necessary in the advanced state of modern chemistry wherein the most scrupulous accuracy is required it is proper to give some account of these and of the reasons for omitting several of them no i of the french appendix is a table for converting ounces gros and grains into the decimal fractions of the french pound and no ii for reducing these decimal fractions again into the vulgar subdivisions no iii contains the number of french cubical inches and decimals which correspond to a determinate weight of water the translator would most readily have converted these tables into english weights and measures but the necessary calculations must have occupied a great deal more time than could have been spared in the period limited for publication they are therefore omitted as altogether useless in their present state to the british chemist no iv is a table for converting lines or twelfth parts of the inch and twelfth parts of lines into decimal fractions chiefly for the purpose of making the necessary corrections upon the quantities of gasses according to their barometrical pressure this can hardly be at all useful or necessary as the barometers used in britain are graduated in decimal fractions of the inch but being referred to by the author in the text it has been retained and is no i of the appendix to this translation no v is a table for converting the observed heights of water within the jars used in pneumatochemical experiments into correspondent heights of mercury for correcting the volume of gasses this in mr lavoisiers work is expressed for the water in lines and for the mercury in decimals of the inch and consequently for the reasons given respecting the fourth table must have been of no use the translator has therefore calculated a table for this correction in which the water is expressed in decimals as well as the mercury this table is no ii of the english appendix no vi contains the number of french cubical inches and decimals contained in the corresponding ouncemeasures used in the experiments of our celebrated countryman dr priestley this table which forms no iii of the english appendix is retained with the addition of a column in which the corresponding english cubical inches and decimals are expressed no vii is a table of the weights of a cubical foot and inch french measure of the different gasses expressed in french ounces gros grains and decimals this which forms no vi of the english appendix has been with considerable labour calculated into english weight and measure no viii gives the specific gravities of a great number of bodies with columns containing the weights of a cubical foot and inch french measure of all the substances the specific gravities of this table which is no vii of the english appendix are retained but the additional columns as useless to the british philosopher are omitted and to have converted these into english denominations must have required very long and painful calculations rules are subjoined in the appendix to this translation for converting all the weights and measures used by mr lavoisier into corresponding english denominations and the translator is proud to acknowledge his obligation to the learned professor of natural philosophy in the university of edinburgh who kindly supplied him with the necessary information for this purpose a table is likewise added no iv of the english appendix for converting the degrees of reaumeurs scale used by mr lavoisier into the corresponding degrees of fahrenheit which is universally employed in britain1 this translation is sent into the world with the utmost diffidence tempered however with this consolation that though it must fall greatly short of the elegance or even propriety of language which every writer ought to endeavour to attain it cannot fail of advancing the interests of true chemical science by disseminating the accurate mode of analysis adopted by its justly celebrated author should the public call for a second edition every care shall be taken to correct the forced imperfections of the present translation and to improve the work by valuable additional matter from other authors of reputation in the several subjects treated of edinburgh oct 23 1789 footnotes 1 the translator has since been enabled by the kind assistance of the gentleman above alluded to to give tables of the same nature with those of mr lavoisier for facilitating the calculations of the results of chemical experiments preface of the author when i began the following work my only object was to extend and explain more fully the memoir which i read at the public meeting of the academy of sciences in the month of april 1787 on the necessity of reforming and completing the nomenclature of chemistry while engaged in this employment i perceived better than i had ever done before the justice of the following maxims of the abb de condillac in his system of logic and some other of his works we think only through the medium of wordslanguages are true analytical methodsalgebra which is adapted to its purpose in every species of expression in the most simple most exact and best manner possible is at the same time a language and an analytical methodthe art of reasoning is nothing more than a language well arranged thus while i thought myself employed only in forming a nomenclature and while i proposed to myself nothing more than to improve the chemical language my work transformed itself by degrees without my being able to prevent it into a treatise upon the elements of chemistry the impossibility of separating the nomenclature of a science from the science itself is owing to this that every branch of physical science must consist of three things the series of facts which are the objects of the science the ideas which represent these facts and the words by which these ideas are expressed like three impressions of the same seal the word ought to produce the idea and the idea to be a picture of the fact and as ideas are preserved and communicated by means of words it necessarily follows that we cannot improve the language of any science without at the same time improving the science itself neither can we on the other hand improve a science without improving the language or nomenclature which belongs to it however certain the facts of any science may be and however just the ideas we may have formed of these facts we can only communicate false impressions to others while we want words by which these may be properly expressed to those who will consider it with attention the first part of this treatise will afford frequent proofs of the truth of the above observations but as in the conduct of my work i have been obliged to observe an order of arrangement essentially differing from what has been adopted in any other chemical work yet published it is proper that i should explain the motives which have led me to do so it is a maxim universally admitted in geometry and indeed in every branch of knowledge that in the progress of investigation we should proceed from known facts to what is unknown in early infancy our ideas spring from our wants the sensation of want excites the idea of the object by which it is to be gratified in this manner from a series of sensations observations and analyses a successive train of ideas arises so linked together that an attentive observer may trace back to a certain point the order and connection of the whole sum of human knowledge when we begin the study of any science we are in a situation respecting that science similar to that of children and the course by which we have to advance is precisely the same which nature follows in the formation of their ideas in a child the idea is merely an effect produced by a sensation and in the same manner in commencing the study of a physical science we ought to form no idea but what is a necessary consequence and immediate effect of an experiment or observation besides he that enters upon the career of science is in a less advantageous situation than a child who is acquiring his first ideas to the child nature gives various means of rectifying any mistakes he may commit respecting the salutary or hurtful qualities of the objects which surround him on every occasion his judgments are corrected by experience want and pain are the necessary consequences arising from false judgment gratification and pleasure are produced by judging aright under such masters we cannot fail to become well informed and we soon learn to reason justly when want and pain are the necessary consequences of a contrary conduct in the study and practice of the sciences it is quite different the false judgments we form neither affect our existence nor our welfare and we are not forced by any physical necessity to correct them imagination on the contrary which is ever wandering beyond the bounds of truth joined to selflove and that selfconfidence we are so apt to indulge prompt us to draw conclusions which are not immediately derived from facts so that we become in some measure interested in deceiving ourselves hence it is by no means to be wondered that in the science of physics in general men have often made suppositions instead of forming conclusions these suppositions handed down from one age to another acquire additional weight from the authorities by which they are supported till at last they are received even by men of genius as fundamental truths the only method of preventing such errors from taking place and of correcting them when formed is to restrain and simplify our reasoning as much as possible this depends entirely upon ourselves and the neglect of it is the only source of our mistakes we must trust to nothing but facts these are presented to us by nature and cannot deceive we ought in every instance to submit our reasoning to the test of experiment and never to search for truth but by the natural road of experiment and observation thus mathematicians obtain the solution of a problem by the mere arrangement of data and by reducing their reasoning to such simple steps to conclusions so very obvious as never to lose sight of the evidence which guides them thoroughly convinced of these truths i have imposed upon myself as a law never to advance but from what is known to what is unknown never to form any conclusion which is not an immediate consequence necessarily flowing from observation and experiment and always to arrange the facts and the conclusions which are drawn from them in such an order as shall render it most easy for beginners in the study of chemistry thoroughly to understand them hence i have been obliged to depart from the usual order of courses of lectures and of treatises upon chemistry which always assume the first principles of the science as known when the pupil or the reader should never be supposed to know them till they have been explained in subsequent lessons in almost every instance these begin by treating of the elements of matter and by explaining the table of affinities without considering that in so doing they must bring the principal phenomena of chemistry into view at the very outset they make use of terms which have not been defined and suppose the science to be understood by the very persons they are only beginning to teach it ought likewise to be considered that very little of chemistry can be learned in a first course which is hardly sufficient to make the language of the science familiar to the ears or the apparatus familiar to the eyes it is almost impossible to become a chemist in less than three or four years of constant application these inconveniencies are occasioned not so much by the nature of the subject as by the method of teaching it and to avoid them i was chiefly induced to adopt a new arrangement of chemistry which appeared to me more consonant to the order of nature i acknowledge however that in thus endeavouring to avoid difficulties of one kind i have found myself involved in others of a different species some of which i have not been able to remove but i am persuaded that such as remain do not arise from the nature of the order i have adopted but are rather consequences of the imperfection under which chemistry still labours this science still has many chasms which interrupt the series of facts and often render it extremely difficult to reconcile them with each other it has not like the elements of geometry the advantage of being a complete science the parts of which are all closely connected together its actual progress however is so rapid and the facts under the modern doctrine have assumed so happy an arrangement that we have ground to hope even in our own times to see it approach near to the highest state of perfection of which it is susceptible the rigorous law from which i have never deviated of forming no conclusions which are not fully warranted by experiment and of never supplying the absence of facts has prevented me from comprehending in this work the branch of chemistry which treats of affinities although it is perhaps the best calculated of any part of chemistry for being reduced into a completely systematic body messrs geoffroy gellert bergman scheele de morveau kirwan and many others have collected a number of particular facts upon this subject which only wait for a proper arrangement but the principal data are still wanting or at least those we have are either not sufficiently defined or not sufficiently proved to become the foundation upon which to build so very important a branch of chemistry this science of affinities or elective attractions holds the same place with regard to the other branches of chemistry as the higher or transcendental geometry does with respect to the simpler and elementary part and i thought it improper to involve those simple and plain elements which i flatter myself the greatest part of my readers will easily understand in the obscurities and difficulties which still attend that other very useful and necessary branch of chemical science perhaps a sentiment of selflove may without my perceiving it have given additional force to these reflections mr de morveau is at present engaged in publishing the article affinity in the methodical encyclopdia and i had more reasons than one to decline entering upon a work in which he is employed it will no doubt be a matter of surprise that in a treatise upon the elements of chemistry there should be no chapter on the constituent and elementary parts of matter but i shall take occasion in this place to remark that the fondness for reducing all the bodies in nature to three or four elements proceeds from a prejudice which has descended to us from the greek philosophers the notion of four elements which by the variety of their proportions compose all the known substances in nature is a mere hypothesis assumed long before the first principles of experimental philosophy or of chemistry had any existence in those days without possessing facts they framed systems while we who have collected facts seem determined to reject them when they do not agree with our prejudices the authority of these fathers of human philosophy still carry great weight and there is reason to fear that it will even bear hard upon generations yet to come it is very remarkable that notwithstanding of the number of philosophical chemists who have supported the doctrine of the four elements there is not one who has not been led by the evidence of facts to admit a greater number of elements into their theory the first chemists that wrote after the revival of letters considered sulphur and salt as elementary substances entering into the composition of a great number of substances hence instead of four they admitted the existence of six elements beccher assumes the existence of three kinds of earth from the combination of which in different proportions he supposed all the varieties of metallic substances to be produced stahl gave a new modification to this system and succeeding chemists have taken the liberty to make or to imagine changes and additions of a similar nature all these chemists were carried along by the influence of the genius of the age in which they lived which contented itself with assertions without proofs or at least often admitted as proofs the slighted degrees of probability unsupported by that strictly rigorous analysis required by modern philosophy all that can be said upon the number and nature of elements is in my opinion confined to discussions entirely of a metaphysical nature the subject only furnishes us with indefinite problems which may be solved in a thousand different ways not one of which in all probability is consistent with nature i shall therefore only add upon this subject that if by the term elements we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them but if we apply the term elements or principles of bodies to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching we must admit as elements all the substances into which we are capable by any means to reduce bodies by decomposition not that we are entitled to affirm that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two or even of a greater number of principles but since these principles cannot be separated or rather since we have not hitherto discovered the means of separating them they act with regard to us as simple substances and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so the foregoing reflections upon the progress of chemical ideas naturally apply to the words by which these ideas are to be expressed guided by the work which in the year 1787 messrs de morveau berthollet de fourcroy and i composed upon the nomenclature of chemistry i have endeavoured as much as possible to denominate simple bodies by simple terms and i was naturally led to name these first it will be recollected that we were obliged to retain that name of any substance by which it had been long known in the world and that in two cases only we took the liberty of making alterations first in the case of those which were but newly discovered and had not yet obtained names or at least which had been known but for a short time and the names of which had not yet received the sanction of the public and secondly when the names which had been adopted whether by the ancients or the moderns appeared to us to express evidently false ideas when they confounded the substances to which they were applied with others possessed of different or perhaps opposite qualities we made no scruple in this case of substituting other names in their room and the greatest number of these were borrowed from the greek language we endeavoured to frame them in such a manner as to express the most general and the most characteristic quality of the substances and this was attended with the additional advantage both of assisting the memory of beginners who find it difficult to remember a new word which has no meaning and of accustoming them early to admit no word without connecting with it some determinate idea to those bodies which are formed by the union of several simple substances we gave new names compounded in such a manner as the nature of the substances directed but as the number of double combinations is already very considerable the only method by which we could avoid confusion was to divide them into classes in the natural order of ideas the name of the class or genus is that which expresses a quality common to a great number of individuals the name of the species on the contrary expresses a quality peculiar to certain individuals only these distinctions are not as some may imagine merely metaphysical but are established by nature a child says the abb de condillac is taught to give the name tree to the first one which is pointed out to him the next one he sees presents the same idea and he gives it the same name this he does likewise to a third and a fourth till at last the word tree which he first applied to an individual comes to be employed by him as the name of a class or a genus an abstract idea which comprehends all trees in general but when he learns that all trees serve not the same purpose that they do not all produce the same kind of fruit he will soon learn to distinguish them by specific and particular names this is the logic of all the sciences and is naturally applied to chemistry the acids for example are compounded of two substances of the order of those which we consider as simple the one constitutes acidity and is common to all acids and from this substance the name of the class or the genus ought to be taken the other is peculiar to each acid and distinguishes it from the rest and from this substance is to be taken the name of the species but in the greatest number of acids the two constituent elements the acidifying principle and that which it acidifies may exist in different proportions constituting all the possible points of equilibrium or of saturation this is the case in the sulphuric and the sulphurous acids and these two states of the same acid we have marked by varying the termination of the specific name metallic substances which have been exposed to the joint action of the air and of fire lose their metallic lustre increase in weight and assume an earthy appearance in this state like the acids they are compounded of a principle which is common to all and one which is peculiar to each in the same way therefore we have thought proper to class them under a generic name derived from the common principle for which purpose we adopted the term oxyd and we distinguish them from each other by the particular name of the metal to which each belongs combustible substances which in acids and metallic oxyds are a specific and particular principle are capable of becoming in their turn common principles of a great number of substances the sulphurous combinations have been long the only known ones in this kind now however we know from the experiments of messrs vandermonde monge and berthollet that charcoal may be combined with iron and perhaps with several other metals and that from this combination according to the proportions may be produced steel plumbago c we know likewise from the experiments of m pelletier that phosphorus may be combined with a great number of metallic substances these different combinations we have classed under generic names taken from the common substance with a termination which marks this analogy specifying them by another name taken from that substance which is proper to each the nomenclature of bodies compounded of three simple substances was attended with still greater difficulty not only on account of their number but particularly because we cannot express the nature of their constituent principles without employing more compound names in the bodies which form this class such as the neutral salts for instance we had to consider 1st the acidifying principle which is common to them all 2d the acidifiable principle which constitutes their peculiar acid 3d the saline earthy or metallic basis which determines the particular species of salt here we derived the name of each class of salts from the name of the acidifiable principle common to all the individuals of that class and distinguished each species by the name of the saline earthy or metallic basis which is peculiar to it a salt though compounded of the same three principles may nevertheless by the mere difference of their proportion be in three different states the nomenclature we have adopted would have been defective had it not expressed these different states and this we attained chiefly by changes of termination uniformly applied to the same state of the different salts in short we have advanced so far that from the name alone may be instantly found what the combustible substance is which enters into any combination whether that combustible substance be combined with the acidifying principle and in what proportion what is the state of the acid with what basis it is united whether the saturation be exact or whether the acid or the basis be in excess it may be easily supposed that it was not possible to attain all these different objects without departing in some instances from established custom and adopting terms which at first sight will appear uncouth and barbarous but we considered that the ear is soon habituated to new words especially when they are connected with a general and rational system the names besides which were formerly employed such as powder of algaroth salt of alembroth pompholix phagadenic water turbith mineral colcathar and many others were neither less barbarous nor less uncommon it required a great deal of practice and no small degree of memory to recollect the substances to which they were applied much more to recollect the genus of combination to which they belonged the names of oil of tartar per deliquium oil of vitriol butter of arsenic and of antimony flowers of zinc c were still more improper because they suggested false ideas for in the whole mineral kingdom and particularly in the metallic class there exists no such thing as butters oils or flowers and in short the substances to which they give these fallacious names are nothing less than rank poisons when we published our essay on the nomenclature of chemistry we were reproached for having changed the language which was spoken by our masters which they distinguished by their authority and handed down to us but those who reproach us on this account have forgotten that it was bergman and macquer themselves who urged us to make this reformation in a letter which the learned professor of upsal m bergman wrote a short time before he died to m de morveau he bids him spare no improper names those who are learned will always be learned and those who are ignorant will thus learn sooner there is an objection to the work which i am going to present to the public which is perhaps better founded that i have given no account of the opinion of those who have gone before me that i have stated only my own opinion without examining that of others by this i have been prevented from doing that justice to my associates and more especially to foreign chemists which i wished to render them but i beseech the reader to consider that if i had filled an elementary work with a multitude of quotations if i had allowed myself to enter into long dissertations on the history of the science and the works of those who have studied it i must have lost sight of the true object i had in view and produced a work the reading of which must have been extremely tiresome to beginners it is not to the history of the science or of the human mind that we are to attend in an elementary treatise our only aim ought to be ease and perspicuity and with the utmost care to keep every thing out of view which might draw aside the attention of the student it is a road which we should be continually rendering more smooth and from which we should endeavour to remove every obstacle which can occasion delay the sciences from their own nature present a sufficient number of difficulties though we add not those which are foreign to them but besides this chemists will easily perceive that in the first part of my work i make very little use of any experiments but those which were made by myself if at any time i have adopted without acknowledgment the experiments or the opinions of m berthollet m fourcroy m de la place m monge or in general of any of those whose principles are the same with my own it is owing to this circumstance that frequent intercourse and the habit of communicating our ideas our observations and our way of thinking to each other has established between us a sort of community of opinions in which it is often difficult for every one to know his own the remarks i have made on the order which i thought myself obliged to follow in the arrangement of proofs and ideas are to be applied only to the first part of this work it is the only one which contains the general sum of the doctrine i have adopted and to which i wished to give a form completely elementary the second part is composed chiefly of tables of the nomenclature of the neutral salts to these i have only added general explanations the object of which was to point out the most simple processes for obtaining the different kinds of known acids this part contains nothing which i can call my own and presents only a very short abridgment of the results of these processes extracted from the works of different authors in the third part i have given a description in detail of all the operations connected with modern chemistry i have long thought that a work of this kind was much wanted and i am convinced it will not be without use the method of performing experiments and particularly those of modern chemistry is not so generally known as it ought to be and had i in the different memoirs which i have presented to the academy been more particular in the detail of the manipulations of my experiments it is probable i should have made myself better understood and the science might have made a more rapid progress the order of the different matters contained in this third part appeared to me to be almost arbitrary and the only one i have observed was to class together in each of the chapters of which it is composed those operations which are most connected with one another i need hardly mention that this part could not be borrowed from any other work and that in the principal articles it contains i could not derive assistance from any thing but the experiments which i have made myself i shall conclude this preface by transcribing literally some observations of the abb de condillac which i think describe with a good deal of truth the state of chemistry at a period not far distant from our own these observations were made on a different subject but they will not on this account have less force if the application of them be thought just instead of applying observation to the things we wished to know we have chosen rather to imagine them advancing from one ill founded supposition to another we have at last bewildered ourselves amidst a multitude of errors these errors becoming prejudices are of course adopted as principles and we thus bewilder ourselves more and more the method too by which we conduct our reasonings is as absurd we abuse words which we do not understand and call this the art of reasoning when matters have been brought this length when errors have been thus accumulated there is but one remedy by which order can be restored to the faculty of thinking this is to forget all that we have learned to trace back our ideas to their source to follow the train in which they rise and as my lord bacon says to frame the human understanding anew this remedy becomes the more difficult in proportion as we think ourselves more learned might it not be thought that works which treated of the sciences with the utmost perspicuity with great precision and order must be understood by every body the fact is those who have never studied any thing will understand them better than those who have studied a great deal and especially than those who have written a great deal at the end of the fifth chapter the abb de condillac adds but after all the sciences have made progress because philosophers have applied themselves with more attention to observe and have communicated to their language that precision and accuracy which they have employed in their observations in correcting their language they reason better contents part first of the formation and decomposition of ariform fluidsof the combustion of simple bodies and the formation of acids page 1 chap iof the combinations

experiment 511 elements of chemistry part i of the formation and decomposition of ariform fluidsof the combustion of simple bodiesand the formation of acids chap i of the combinations of caloric and the formation of elastic ariform fluids that every body whether solid or fluid is augmented in all its dimensions by any increase of its sensible heat was long ago fully established as a physical axiom or universal proposition by the celebrated boerhaave such facts as have been adduced for controverting the generality of this principle offer only fallacious results or at least such as are so complicated with foreign circumstances as to mislead the judgment but when we separately consider the effects so as to deduce each from the cause to which they separately belong it is easy to perceive that the separation of particles by heat is a constant and general law of nature when we have heated a solid body to a certain degree and have thereby caused its particles to separate from each other if we allow the body to cool its particles again approach each other in the same proportion in which they were separated by the increased temperature the body returns through the same degrees of expansion which it before extended through and if it be brought back to the same temperature from which we set out at the commencement of the experiment it recovers exactly the same dimensions which it formerly occupied but as we are still very far from being able to arrive at the degree of absolute cold or deprivation of all heat being unacquainted with any degree of coldness which we cannot suppose capable of still farther augmentation it follows that we are still incapable of causing the ultimate particles of bodies to approach each other as near as is possible and consequently that the particles of all bodies do not touch each other in any state hitherto known which tho a very singular conclusion is yet impossible to be denied it is supposed that since the particles of bodies are thus continually impelled by heat to separate from each other they would have no connection between themselves and of consequence that there could be no solidity in nature unless they were held together by some other power which tends to unite them and so to speak to chain them together which power whatever be its cause or manner of operation we name attraction thus the particles of all bodies may be considered as subjected to the action of two opposite powers the one repulsive the other attractive between which they remain in equilibrio so long as the attractive force remains stronger the body must continue in a state of solidity but if on the contrary heat has so far removed these particles from each other as to place them beyond the sphere of attraction they lose the adhesion they before had with each other and the body ceases to be solid water gives us a regular and constant example of these facts whilst below zero2 of the french thermometer or 32 of fahrenheit it remains solid and is called ice above that degree of temperature its particles being no longer held together by reciprocal attraction it becomes liquid and when we raise its temperature above 80 212 its particles giving way to the repulsion caused by the heat assume the state of vapour or gas and the water is changed into an ariform fluid the same may be affirmed of all bodies in nature they are either solid or liquid or in the state of elastic ariform vapour according to the proportion which takes place between the attractive force inherent in their particles and the repulsive power of the heat acting upon these or what amounts to the same thing in proportion to the degree of heat to which they are exposed it is difficult to comprehend these phenomena without admitting them as the effects of a real and material substance or very subtile fluid which insinuating itself between the particles of bodies separates them from each other and even allowing the existence of this fluid to be hypothetical we shall see in the sequel that it explains the phenomena of nature in a very satisfactory manner this substance whatever it is being the cause of heat or in other words the sensation which we call warmth being caused by the accumulation of this substance we cannot in strict language distinguish it by the term heat because the same name would then very improperly express both cause and effect for this reason in the memoir which i published in 17773 i gave it the names of igneous fluid and matter of heat and since that time in the work4 published by mr de morveau mr berthollet mr de fourcroy and myself upon the reformation of chemical nomenclature we thought it necessary to banish all periphrastic expressions which both lengthen physical language and render it more tedious and less distinct and which even frequently does not convey sufficiently just ideas of the subject intended wherefore we have distinguished the cause of heat or that exquisitely elastic fluid which produces it by the term of caloric besides that this expression fulfils our object in the system which we have adopted it possesses this farther advantage that it accords with every species of opinion since strictly speaking we are not obliged to suppose this to be a real substance it being sufficient as will more clearly appear in the sequel of this work that it be considered as the repulsive cause whatever that may be which separates the particles of matter from each other so that we are still at liberty to investigate its effects in an abstract and mathematical manner in the present state of our knowledge we are unable to determine whether light be a modification of caloric or if caloric be on the contrary a modification of light this however is indisputable that in a system where only decided facts are admissible and where we avoid as far as possible to suppose any thing to be that is not really known to exist we ought provisionally to distinguish by distinct terms such things as are known to produce different effects we therefore distinguish light from caloric though we do not therefore deny that these have certain qualities in common and that in certain circumstances they combine with other bodies almost in the same manner and produce in part the same effects what i have already said may suffice to determine the idea affixed to the word caloric but there remains a more difficult attempt which is to give a just conception of the manner in which caloric acts upon other bodies since this subtile matter penetrates through the pores of all known substances since there are no vessels through which it cannot escape and consequently as there are none which are capable of retaining it we can only come at the knowledge of its properties by effects which are fleeting and difficultly ascertainable it is in these things which we neither see nor feel that it is especially necessary to guard against the extravagancy of our imagination which forever inclines to step beyond the bounds of truth and is very difficultly restrained within the narrow line of facts we have already seen that the same body becomes solid or fluid or ariform according to the quantity of caloric by which it is penetrated or to speak more strictly according as the repulsive force exerted by the caloric is equal to stronger or weaker than the attraction of the particles of the body it acts upon but if these two powers only existed bodies would become liquid at an indivisible degree of the thermometer and would almost instantaneously pass from the solid state of aggregation to that of ariform elasticity thus water for instance at the very moment when it ceases to be ice would begin to boil and would be transformed into an ariform fluid having its particles scattered indefinitely through the surrounding space that this does not happen must depend upon the action of some third power the pressure of the atmosphere prevents this separation and causes the water to remain in the liquid state till it be raised to 80 of temperature 212 above zero of the french thermometer the quantity of caloric which it receives in the lowest temperature being insufficient to overcome the pressure of the atmosphere whence it appears that without this atmospheric pressure we should not have any permanent liquid and should only be able to see bodies in that state of existence in the very instant of melting as the smallest additional caloric would instantly separate their particles and dissipate them through the surrounding medium besides without this atmospheric pressure we should not even have any ariform fluids strictly speaking because the moment the force of attraction is overcome by the repulsive power of the caloric the particles would separate themselves indefinitely having nothing to give limits to their expansion unless their own gravity might collect them together so as to form an atmosphere simple reflection upon the most common experiments is sufficient to evince the truth of these positions they are more particularly proved by the following experiment which i published in the memoirs of the french academy for 1777 p 426 having filled with sulphuric ether5 a small narrow glass vessel a plate vii fig 17 standing upon its stalk p the vessel which is from twelve to fifteen lines diameter is to be covered by a wet bladder tied round its neck with several turns of strong thread for greater security fix a second bladder over the first the vessel should be filled in such a manner with the ether as not to leave the smallest portion of air between the liquor and the bladder it is now to be placed under the recipient bcd of an airpump of which the upper part b ought to be fitted with a leathern lid through which passes a wire ef having its point f very sharp and in the same receiver there ought to be placed the barometer gh the whole being thus disposed let the recipient be exhausted and then by pushing down the wire ef we make a hole in the bladder immediately the ether begins to boil with great violence and is changed into an elastic ariform fluid which fills the receiver if the quantity of ether be sufficient to leave a few drops in the phial after the evaporation is finished the elastic fluid produced will sustain the mercury in the barometer attached to the airpump at eight or ten inches in winter and from twenty to twentyfive in summer6 to render this experiment more complete we may introduce a small thermometer into the phial a containing the ether which will descend considerably during the evaporation the only effect produced in this experiment is the taking away the weight of the atmosphere which in its ordinary state presses on the surface of the ether and the effects resulting from this removal evidently prove that in the ordinary temperature of the earth ether would always exist in an ariform state but for the pressure of the atmosphere and that the passing of the ether from the liquid to the ariform state is accompanied by a considerable lessening of heat because during the evaporation a part of the caloric which was before in a free state or at least in equilibrio in the surrounding bodies combines with the ether and causes it to assume the ariform state the same experiment succeeds with all evaporable fluids such as alkohol water and even mercury with this difference that the atmosphere formed in the receiver by alkohol only supports the attached barometer about one inch in winter and about four or five inches in summer that formed by water in the same situation raises the mercury only a few lines and that by quicksilver but a few fractions of a line there is therefore less fluid evaporated from alkohol than from ether less from water than from alkohol and still less from mercury than from either consequently there is less caloric employed and less cold produced which quadrates exactly with the results of these experiments another species of experiment proves very evidently that the ariform state is a modification of bodies dependent on the degree of temperature and on the pressure which these bodies undergo in a memoir read by mr de la place and me to the academy in 1777 which has not been printed we have shown that when ether is subjected to a pressure equal to twentyeight inches of the barometer or about the medium pressure of the atmosphere it boils at the temperature of about 32 104 or 33 10625 of the thermometer mr de luc who has made similar experiments with spirit of wine finds it boils at 67 18275 and all the world knows that water boils at 80 212 now boiling being only the evaporation of a liquid or the moment of its passing from the fluid to the ariform state it is evident that if we keep ether continually at the temperature of 33 10625 and under the common pressure of the atmosphere we shall have it always in an elastic ariform state and that the same thing will happen with alkohol when above 67 18275 and with water when above 80 212 all which are perfectly conformable to the following experiment7 i filled a large vessel abcd plate vii fig 16 with water at 35 11075 or 36 113 i suppose the vessel transparent that we may see what takes place in the experiment and we can easily hold the hands in water at that temperature without inconvenience into it i plunged some narrow necked bottles f g which were filled with the water after which they were turned up so as to rest on their mouths on the bottom of the vessel having next put some ether into a very small matrass with its neck a b c twice bent as in the plate i plunged this matrass into the water so as to have its neck inserted into the mouth of one of the bottles f immediately upon feeling the effects of the heat communicated to it by the water in the vessel abcd it began to boil and the caloric entering into combination with it changed it into elastic ariform fluid with which i filled several bottles successively f g c this is not the place to enter upon the examination of the nature and properties of this ariform fluid which is extremely inflammable but confining myself to the object at present in view without anticipating circumstances which i am not to suppose the reader to know i shall only observe that the ether from this experiment is almost only capable of existing in the ariform state in our world for if the weight of our atmosphere was only equal to between 20 and 24 inches of the barometer instead of 28 inches we should never be able to obtain ether in the liquid state at least in summer and the formation of ether would consequently be impossible upon mountains of a moderate degree of elevation as it would be converted into gas immediately upon being produced unless we employed recipients of extraordinary strength together with refrigeration and compression and lastly the temperature of the blood being nearly that at which ether passes from the liquid to the ariform state it must evaporate in the primae viae and consequently it is very probable the medical properties of this fluid depend chiefly upon its mechanical effect these experiments succeed better with nitrous ether because it evaporates in a lower temperature than sulphuric ether it is more difficult to obtain alkohol in the ariform state because as it requires 67 18275 to reduce it to vapour the water of the bath must be almost boiling and consequently it is impossible to plunge the hands into it at that temperature it is evident that if water were used in the foregoing experiment it would be changed into gas when exposed to a temperature superior to that at which it boils although thoroughly convinced of this mr de la place and myself judged it necessary to confirm it by the following direct experiment we filled a glass jar a plate vii fig 5 with mercury and placed it with its mouth downwards in a dish b likewise filled with mercury and having introduced about two gross of water into the jar which rose to the top of the mercury at cd we then plunged the whole apparatus into an iron boiler efgh full of boiling seawater of the temperature of 85 12325 placed upon the furnace ghik immediately upon the water over the mercury attaining the temperature of 80 212 it began to boil and instead of only filling the small space acd it was converted into an ariform fluid which filled the whole jar the mercury even descended below the surface of that in the dish b and the jar must have been overturned if it had not been very thick and heavy and fixed to the dish by means of ironwire immediately after withdrawing the apparatus from the boiler the vapour in the jar began to condense and the mercury rose to its former station but it returned again to the ariform state a few seconds after replacing the apparatus in the boiler we have thus a certain number of substances which are convertible into elastic ariform fluids by degrees of temperature not much superior to that of our atmosphere we shall afterwards find that there are several others which undergo the same change in similar circumstances such as muriatic or marine acid ammoniac or volatile alkali the carbonic acid or fixed air the sulphurous acid c all of these are permanently elastic in or about the mean temperature of the atmosphere and under its common pressure all these facts which could be easily multiplied if necessary give me full right to assume as a general principle that almost every body in nature is susceptible of three several states of existence solid liquid and ariform and that these three states of existence depend upon the quantity of caloric combined with the body henceforwards i shall express these elastic ariform fluids by the generic term gas and in each species of gas i shall distinguish between the caloric which in some measure serves the purpose of a solvent and the substance which in combination with the caloric forms the base of the gas to these bases of the different gases which are hitherto but little known we have been obliged to assign names these i shall point out in chap iv of this work when i have previously given an account of the phenomena attendant upon the heating and cooling of bodies and when i have established precise ideas concerning the composition of our atmosphere we have already shown that the particles of every substance in nature exist in a certain state of equilibrium between that attraction which tends to unite and keep the particles together and the effects of the caloric which tends to separate them hence the caloric not only surrounds the particles of all bodies on every side but fills up every interval which the particles of bodies leave between each other we may form an idea of this by supposing a vessel filled with small spherical leaden bullets into which a quantity of fine sand is poured which insinuating into the intervals between the bullets will fill up every void the balls in this comparison are to the sand which surrounds them exactly in the same situation as the particles of bodies are with respect to the caloric with this difference only that the balls are supposed to touch each other whereas the particles of bodies are not in contact being retained at a small distance from each other by the caloric if instead of spherical balls we substitute solid bodies of a hexahedral octohedral or any other regular figure the capacity of the intervals between them will be lessened and consequently will no longer contain the same quantity of sand the same thing takes place with respect to natural bodies the intervals left between their particles are not of equal capacity but vary in consequence of the different figures and magnitude of their particles and of the distance at which these particles are maintained according to the existing proportion between their inherent attraction and the repulsive force exerted upon them by the caloric in this manner we must understand the following expression introduced by the english philosophers who have given us the first precise ideas upon this subject the capacity of bodies for containing the matter of heat as comparisons with sensible objects are of great use in assisting us to form distinct notions of abstract ideas we shall endeavour to illustrate this by instancing the phenomena which take place between water and bodies which are wetted and penetrated by it with a few reflections if we immerge equal pieces of different kinds of wood suppose cubes of one foot each into water the fluid gradually insinuates itself into their pores and the pieces of wood are augmented both in weight and magnitude but each species of wood will imbibe a different quantity of water the lighter and more porous woods will admit a larger the compact and closer grained will admit of a lesser quantity for the proportional quantities of water imbibed by the pieces will depend upon the nature of the constituent particles of the wood and upon the greater or lesser affinity subsisting between them and water very resinous wood for instance though it may be at the same time very porous will admit but little water we may therefore say that the different kinds of wood possess different capacities for receiving water we may even determine by means of the augmentation of their weights what quantity of water they have actually absorbed but as we are ignorant how much water they contained previous to immersion we cannot determine the absolute quantity they contain after being taken out of the water the same circumstances undoubtedly take place with bodies that are immersed in caloric taking into consideration however that water is an incompressible fluid whereas caloric is on the contrary endowed with very great elasticity or in other words the particles of caloric have a great tendency to separate from each other when forced by any other power to approach this difference must of necessity occasion very considerable diversities in the results of experiments made upon these two substances having established these clear and simple propositions it will be very easy to explain the ideas which ought to be affixed to the following expressions which are by no means synonimous but possess each a strict and determinate meaning as in the following definitions free caloric is that which is not combined in any manner with any other body but as we live in a system to which caloric has a very strong adhesion it follows that we are never able to obtain it in the state of absolute freedom combined caloric is that which is fixed in bodies by affinity or elective attraction so as to form part of the substance of the body even part of its solidity by the expression specific caloric of bodies we understand the respective quantities of caloric requisite for raising a number of bodies of the same weight to an equal degree of temperature this proportional quantity of caloric depends upon the distance between the constituent particles of bodies and their greater or lesser degrees of cohesion and this distance or rather the space or void resulting from it is as i have already observed called the capacity of bodies for containing caloric heat considered as a sensation or in other words sensible heat is only the effect produced upon our sentient organs by the motion or passage of caloric disengaged from the surrounding bodies in general we receive impressions only in consequence of motion and we might establish it as an axiom that without motion there is no sensation this general principle applies very accurately to the sensations of heat and cold when we touch a cold body the caloric which always tends to become in equilibrio in all bodies passes from our hand into the body we touch which gives us the feeling or sensation of cold the direct contrary happens when we touch a warm body the caloric then passing from the body into our hand produces the sensation of heat if the hand and the body touched be of the same temperature or very nearly so we receive no impression either of heat or cold because there is no motion or passage of caloric and thus no sensation can take place without some correspondent motion to occasion it when the thermometer rises it shows that free caloric is entering into the surrounding bodies the thermometer which is one of these receives its share in proportion to its mass and to the capacity which it possesses for containing caloric the change therefore which takes place upon the thermometer only announces a change of place of the caloric in those bodies of which the thermometer forms one part it only indicates the portion of caloric received without being a measure of the whole quantity disengaged displaced or absorbed the most simple and most exact method for determining this latter point is that described by mr de la place in the memoirs of the academy no 1780 p 364 a summary explanation of which will be found towards the conclusion of this work this method consists in placing a body or a combination of bodies from which caloric is disengaging in the midst of a hollow sphere of ice and the quantity of ice melted becomes an exact measure of the quantity of caloric disengaged it is possible by means of the apparatus which we have caused to be constructed upon this plan to determine not as has been pretended the capacity of bodies for containing heat but the ratio of the increase or diminution of capacity produced by determinate degrees of temperature it is easy with the same apparatus by means of divers combinations of experiments to determine the quantity of caloric requisite for converting solid substances into liquids and liquids into elastic ariform fluids and vice versa what quantity of caloric escapes from elastic vapours in changing to liquids and what quantity escapes from liquids during their conversion into solids perhaps when experiments have been made with sufficient accuracy we may one day be able to determine the proportional quantity of caloric necessary for producing the several species of gasses i shall hereafter in a separate chapter give an account of the principal results of such experiments as have been made upon this head it remains before finishing this article to say a few words relative to the cause of the elasticity of gasses and of fluids in the state of vapour it is by no means difficult to perceive that this elasticity depends upon that of caloric which seems to be the most eminently elastic body in nature nothing is more readily conceived than that one body should become elastic by entering into combination with another body possessed of that quality we must allow that this is only an explanation of elasticity by an assumption of elasticity and that we thus only remove the difficulty one step farther and that the nature of elasticity and the reason for caloric being elastic remains still unexplained elasticity in the abstract is nothing more than that quality of the particles of bodies by which they recede from each other when forced together this tendency in the particles of caloric to separate takes place even at considerable distances we shall be satisfied of this when we consider that air is susceptible of undergoing great compression which supposes that its particles were previously very distant from each other for the power of approaching together certainly supposes a previous distance at least equal to the degree of approach consequently those particles of the air which are already considerably distant from each other tend to separate still farther in fact if we produce boyles vacuum in a large receiver the very last portion of air which remains spreads itself uniformly through the whole capacity of the vessel however large fills it completely throughout and presses every where against its sides we cannot however explain this effect without supposing that the particles make an effort to separate themselves on every side and we are quite ignorant at what distance or what degree of rarefaction this effort ceases to act here therefore exists a true repulsion between the particles of elastic fluids at least circumstances take place exactly as if such a repulsion actually existed and we have very good right to conclude that the particles of caloric mutually repel each other when we are once permitted to suppose this repelling force the rationale of the formation of gasses or ariform fluids becomes perfectly simple tho we must at the same time allow that it is extremely difficult to form an accurate conception of this repulsive force acting upon very minute particles placed at great distances from each other it is perhaps more natural to suppose that the particles of caloric have a stronger mutual attraction than those of any other substance and that these latter particles are forced asunder in consequence of this superior attraction between the particles of the caloric which forces them between the particles of other bodies that they may be able to reunite with each other we have somewhat analogous to this idea in the phenomena which occur when a dry sponge is dipt into water the sponge swells its particles separate from each other and all its intervals are filled up by the water it is evident that the sponge in the act of swelling has acquired a greater capacity for containing water than it had when dry but we cannot certainly maintain that the introduction of water between the particles of the sponge has endowed them with a repulsive power which tends to separate them from each other on the contrary the whole phenomena are produced by means of attractive powers and these are first the gravity of the water and the power which it exerts on every side in common with all other fluids 2dly the force of attraction which takes place between the particles of the water causing them to unite together 3dly the mutual attraction of the particles of the sponge with each other and lastly the reciprocal attraction which exists between the particles of the sponge and those of the water it is easy to understand that the explanation of this fact depends upon properly appreciating the intensity of and connection between these several powers it is probable that the separation of the particles of bodies occasioned by caloric depends in a similar manner upon a certain combination of different attractive powers which in conformity with the imperfection of our knowledge we endeavour to express by saying that caloric communicates a power of repulsion to the particles of bodies footnotes 2 whenever the degree of heat occurs in this work it is stated by the author according to reaumurs scale the degrees within brackets are the correspondent degrees of fahrenheits scale added by the translator e 3 collections of the french academy of sciences for that year p 420 4 chemical nomenclature 5 as i shall afterwards give a definition and explain the properties of the liquor called ether i shall only premise here that it is a very volatile inflammable liquor having a considerably smaller specific gravity than water or even spirit of winea 6 it would have been more satisfactory if the author had specified the degrees of the thermometer at which these heights of the mercury in the barometer are produced 7 vide memoirs of the french academy anno 1780 p 335a chap ii general views relative to the formation and composition of our atmosphere these views which i have taken of the formation of elastic ariform fluids or gasses throw great light upon the original formation of the atmospheres of the planets and particularly that of our earth we readily conceive that it must necessarily consist of a mixture of the following substances first of all bodies that are susceptible of evaporation or more strictly speaking which are capable of retaining the state of ariform elasticity in the temperature of our atmosphere and under a pressure equal to that of a column of twentyeight inches of quicksilver in the barometer and secondly of all substances whether liquid or solid which are capable of being dissolved by this mixture of different gasses the better to determine our ideas relating to this subject which has not hitherto been sufficiently considered let us for a moment conceive what change would take place in the various substances which compose our earth if its temperature were suddenly altered if for instance we were suddenly transported into the region of the planet mercury where probably the common temperature is much superior to that of boiling water the water of the earth and all the other fluids which are susceptible of the gasseous state at a temperature near to that of boiling water even quicksilver itself would become rarified and all these substances would be changed into permanent ariform fluids or gasses which would become part of the new atmosphere these new species of airs or gasses would mix with those already existing and certain reciprocal decompositions and new combinations would take place until such time as all the elective attractions or affinities subsisting amongst all these new and old gasseous substances had operated fully after which the elementary principles composing these gasses being saturated would remain at rest we must attend to this however that even in the above hypothetical situation certain bounds would occur to the evaporation of these substances produced by that very evaporation itself for as in proportion to the increase of elastic fluids the pressure of the atmosphere would be augmented as every degree of pressure tends in some measure to prevent evaporation and as even the most evaporable fluids can resist the operation of a very high temperature without evaporating if prevented by a proportionally stronger compression water and all other liquids being able to sustain a red heat in papins digester we must admit that the new atmosphere would at last arrive at such a degree of weight that the water which had not hitherto evaporated would cease to boil and of consequence would remain liquid so that even upon this supposition as in all others of the same nature the increasing gravity of the atmosphere would find certain limits which it could not exceed we might even extend these reflections greatly farther and examine what change might be produced in such situations upon stones salts and the greater part of the fusible substances which compose the mass of our earth these would be softened fused and changed into fluids c but these speculations carry me from my object to which i hasten to return by a contrary supposition to the one we have been forming if the earth were suddenly transported into a very cold region the water which at present composes our seas rivers and springs and probably the greater number of the fluids we are acquainted with would be converted into solid mountains and hard rocks at first diaphanous and homogeneous like rock crystal but which in time becoming mixed with foreign and heterogeneous substances would become opake stones of various colours in this case the air or at least some part of the ariform fluids which now compose the mass of our atmosphere would doubtless lose its elasticity for want of a sufficient temperature to retain them in that state they would return to the liquid state of existence and new liquids would be formed of whose properties we cannot at present form the most distant idea these two opposite suppositions give a distinct proof of the following corollaries first that solidity liquidity and ariform elasticity are only three different states of existence of the same matter or three particular modifications which almost all substances are susceptible of assuming successively and which solely depend upon the degree of temperature to which they are exposed or in other words upon the quantity of caloric with which they are penetrated8 2dly that it is extremely probable that air is a fluid naturally existing in a state of vapour or as we may better express it that our atmosphere is a compound of all the fluids which are susceptible of the vaporous or permanently elastic state in the usual temperature and under the common pressure 3dly that it is not impossible we may discover in our atmosphere certain substances naturally very compact even metals themselves as a metallic substance for instance only a little more volatile than mercury might exist in that situation amongst the fluids with which we are acquainted some as water and alkohol are susceptible of mixing with each other in all proportions whereas others on the contrary as quicksilver water and oil can only form a momentary union and after being mixed together separate and arrange themselves according to their specific gravities the same thing ought to or at least may take place in the atmosphere it is possible and even extremely probable that both at the first creation and every day gasses are formed which are difficultly miscible with atmospheric air and are continually separating from it if these gasses be specifically lighter than the general atmospheric mass they must of course gather in the higher regions and form strata that float upon the common air the phenomena which accompany igneous meteors induce me to believe that there exists in the upper parts of our atmosphere a stratum of inflammable fluid in contact with those strata of air which produce the phenomena of the aurora borealis and other fiery meteorsi mean hereafter to pursue this subject in a separate treatise footnotes 8 the degree of pressure which they undergo must be taken into account e chap iii analysis of atmospheric air and its division into two elastic fluids the one fit for respiration the other incapable of being respired from what has been premised it follows that our atmosphere is composed of a mixture of every substance capable of retaining the gasseous or ariform state in the common temperature and under the usual pressure which it experiences these fluids constitute a mass in some measure homogeneous extending from the surface of the earth to the greatest height hitherto attained of which the density continually decreases in the inverse ratio of the superincumbent weight but as i have before observed it is possible that this first stratum is surmounted by several others consisting of very different fluids our business in this place is to endeavour to determine by experiments the nature of the elastic fluids which compose the inferior stratum of air which we inhabit modern chemistry has made great advances in this research and it will appear by the following details that the analysis of atmospherical air has been more rigorously determined than that of any other substance of the class chemistry affords two general methods of determining the constituent principles of bodies the method of analysis and that of synthesis when for instance by combining water with alkohol we form the species of liquor called in commercial language brandy or spirit of wine we certainly have a right to conclude that brandy or spirit of wine is composed of alkohol combined with water we can produce the same result by the analytical method and in general it ought to be considered as a principle in chemical science never to rest satisfied without both these species of proofs we have this advantage in the analysis of atmospherical air being able both to decompound it and to form it a new in the most satisfactory manner i shall however at present confine myself to recount such experiments as are most conclusive upon this head and i may consider most of these as my own having either first invented them or having repeated those of others with the intention of analysing atmospherical air in perfectly new points of view i took a matrass a fig 14 plate ii of about 36 cubical inches capacity having a long neck b c d e of six or seven lines internal diameter and having bent the neck as in plate iv fig 2 so as to allow of its being placed in the furnace m m n n in such a manner that the extremity of its neck e might be inserted under a bellglass f g placed in a trough of quicksilver r r s s i introduced four ounces of pure mercury into the matrass and by means of a syphon exhausted the air in the receiver f g so as to raise the quicksilver to l l and i carefully marked the height at which it stood by pasting on a slip of paper having accurately noted the height of the thermometer and barometer i lighted a fire in the furnace m m n n which i kept up almost continually during twelve days so as to keep the quicksilver always almost at its boiling point nothing remarkable took place during the first day the mercury though not boiling was continually evaporating and covered the interior surface of the vessels with small drops at first very minute which gradually augmenting to a sufficient size fell back into the mass at the bottom of the vessel on the second day small red particles began to appear on the surface of the mercury which during the four or five following days gradually increased in size and number after which they ceased to increase in either respect at the end of twelve days seeing that the calcination of the mercury did not at all increase i extinguished the fire and allowed the vessels to cool the bulk of air in the body and neck of the matrass and in the bellglass reduced to a medium of 28 inches of the barometer and 10 545 of the thermometer at the commencement of the experiment was about 50 cubical inches at the end of the experiment the remaining air reduced to the same medium pressure and temperature was only between 42 and 43 cubical inches consequently it had lost about 16 of its bulk afterwards having collected all the red particles formed during the experiment from the running mercury in which they floated i found these to amount to 45 grains i was obliged to repeat this experiment several times as it is difficult in one experiment both to preserve the whole air upon which we operate and to collect the whole of the red particles or calx of mercury which is formed during the calcination it will often happen in the sequel that i shall in this manner give in one detail the results of two or three experiments of the same nature the air which remained after the calcination of the mercury in this experiment and which was reduced to 56 of its former bulk was no longer fit either for respiration or for combustion animals being introduced into it were suffocated in a few seconds and when a taper was plunged into it it was extinguished as if it had been immersed into water in the next place i took the 45 grains of red matter formed during this experiment which i put into a small glass retort having a proper apparatus for receiving such liquid or gasseous product as might be extracted having applied a fire to the retort in a furnace i observed that in proportion as the red matter became heated the intensity of its colour augmented when the retort was almost red hot the red matter began gradually to decrease in bulk and in a few minutes after it disappeared altogether at the same time 4112 grains of running mercury were collected in the recipient and 7 or 8 cubical inches of elastic fluid greatly more capable of supporting both respiration and combustion than atmospherical air were collected in the bellglass a part of this air being put into a glass tube of about an inch diameter showed the following properties a taper burned in it with a dazzling splendour and charcoal instead of consuming quietly as it does in common air burnt with a flame attended with a decrepitating noise like phosphorus and threw out such a brilliant light that the eyes could hardly endure it this species of air was discovered almost at the same time by mr priestley mr scheele and myself mr priestley gave it the name of dephlogisticated air mr scheele called it empyreal air at first i named it highly respirable air to which has since been substituted the term of vital air we shall presently see what we ought to think of these denominations in reflecting upon the circumstances of this experiment we readily perceive that the mercury during its calcination absorbs the salubrious and respirable part of the air or to speak more strictly the base of this respirable part that the remaining air is a species of mephitis incapable of supporting combustion or respiration and consequently that atmospheric air is composed of two elastic fluids of different and opposite qualities as a proof of this important truth if we recombine these two elastic fluids which we have separately obtained in the above experiment viz the 42 cubical inches of mephitis with the 8 cubical inches of respirable air we reproduce an air precisely similar to that of the atmosphere and possessing nearly the same power of supporting combustion and respiration and of contributing to the calcination of metals although this experiment furnishes us with a very simple means of obtaining the two principal elastic fluids which compose our atmosphere separate from each other yet it does not give us an exact idea of the proportion in which these two enter into its composition for the attraction of mercury to the respirable part of the air or rather to its base is not sufficiently strong to overcome all the circumstances which oppose this union these obstacles are the mutual adhesion of the two constituent parts of the atmosphere for each other and the elective attraction which unites the base of vital air with caloric in consequence of these when the calcination ends or is at least carried as far as is possible in a determinate quantity of atmospheric air there still remains a portion of respirable air united to the mephitis which the mercury cannot separate i shall afterwards show that at least in our climate the atmospheric air is composed of respirable and mephitic airs in the proportion of 27 and 73 and i shall then discuss the causes of the uncertainty which still exists with respect to the exactness of that proportion since during the calcination of mercury air is decomposed and the base of its respirable part is fixed and combined with the mercury it follows from the principles already established that caloric and light must be disengaged during the process but the two following causes prevent us from being sensible of this taking place as the calcination lasts during several days the disengagement of caloric and light spread out in a considerable space of time becomes extremely small for each particular moment of that time so as not to be perceptible and in the next place the operation being carried on by means of fire in a furnace the heat produced by the calcination itself becomes confounded with that proceeding from the furnace i might add the respirable part of the air or rather its base in entering into combination with the mercury does not part with all the caloric which it contained but still retains a part of it after forming the new compound but the discussion of this point and its proofs from experiment do not belong to this part of our subject it is however easy to render this disengagement of caloric and light evident to the senses by causing the decomposition of air to take place in a more rapid manner and for this purpose iron is excellently adapted as it possesses a much stronger affinity for the base of respirable air than mercury the elegant experiment of mr ingenhouz upon the combustion of iron is well known take a piece of fine iron wire twisted into a spiral bc plate iv fig 17 fix one of its extremities b into the cork a adapted to the neck of the bottle defg and fix to the other extremity of the wire c a small morsel of tinder matters being thus prepared fill the bottle defg with air deprived of its mephitic part then light the tinder and introduce it quickly with the wire upon which it is fixed into the bottle which you stop up with the cork a as is shown in the figure 17 plate iv the instant the tinder comes into contact with the vital air it begins to burn with great intensity and communicating the inflammation to the ironwire it too takes fire and burns rapidly throwing out brilliant sparks which fall to the bottom of the vessel in rounded globules which become black in cooling but retain a degree of metallic splendour the iron thus burnt is more brittle even than glass and is easily reduced into powder and is still attractable by the magnet though not so powerfully as it was before combustion as mr ingenhouz has neither examined the change produced on iron nor upon the air by this operation i have repeated the experiment under different circumstances in an apparatus adapted to answer my particular views as follows having filled a bellglass a plate iv fig 3 of about six pints measure with pure air or the highly respirable part of air i transported this jar by means of a very flat vessel into a quicksilver bath in the bason bc and i took care to render the surface of the mercury perfectly dry both within and without the jar with blotting paper i then provided a small capsule of chinaware d very flat and open in which i placed some small pieces of iron turned spirally and arranged in such a way as seemed most favourable for the combustion being communicated to every part to the end of one of these pieces of iron was fixed a small morsel of tinder to which was added about the sixteenth part of a grain of phosphorus and by raising the bellglass a little the china capsule with its contents were introduced into the pure air i know that by this means some common air must mix with the pure air in the glass but this when it is done dexterously is so very trifling as not to injure the success of the experiment this being done a part of the air is sucked out from the bellglass by means of a syphon ghi so as to raise the mercury within the glass to ef and to prevent the mercury from getting into the syphon a small piece of paper is twisted round its extremity in sucking out the air if the motion of the lungs only be used we cannot make the mercury rise above an inch or an inch and a half but by properly using the muscles of the mouth we can without difficulty cause it to rise six or seven inches i next took an iron wire mn plate iv fig 16 properly bent for the purpose and making it red hot in the fire passed it through the mercury into the receiver and brought it in contact with the small piece of phosphorus attached to the tinder the phosphorus instantly takes fire which communicates to the tinder and from that to the iron when the pieces have been properly arranged the whole iron burns even to the last particle throwing out a white brilliant light similar to that of chinese fireworks the great heat produced by this combustion melts the iron into round globules of different sizes most of which fall into the china cup but some are thrown out of it and swim upon the surface of the mercury at the beginning of the combustion there is a slight augmentation in the volume of the air in the bellglass from the dilatation caused by the heat but presently afterwards a rapid diminution of the air takes place and the mercury rises in the glass insomuch that when the quantity of iron is sufficient and the air operated upon is very pure almost the whole air employed is absorbed it is proper to remark in this place that unless in making experiments for the purpose of discovery it is better to be contented with burning a moderate quantity of iron for when this experiment is pushed too far so as to absorb much of the air the cup d which floats upon the quicksilver approaches too near the bottom of the bellglass and the great heat produced which is followed by a very sudden cooling occasioned by the contact of the cold mercury is apt to break the glass in which case the sudden fall of the column of mercury which happens the moment the least flaw is produced in the glass causes such a wave as throws a great part of the quicksilver from the bason to avoid this inconvenience and to ensure success to the experiment one gross and a half of iron is sufficient to burn in a bellglass which holds about eight pints of air the glass ought likewise to be strong that it may be able to bear the weight of the column of mercury which it has to support by this experiment it is not possible to determine at one time both the additional weight acquired by the iron and the changes which have taken place in the air if it is wished to ascertain what additional weight has been gained by the iron and the proportion between that and the air absorbed we must carefully mark upon the bellglass with a diamond the height of the mercury both before and after the experiment9 after this the syphon gh pl iv fig 3 guarded as before with a bit of paper to prevent its filling with mercury is to be introduced under the bellglass having the thumb placed upon the extremity g of the syphon to regulate the passage of the air and by this means the air is gradually admitted so as to let the mercury fall to its level this being done the bellglass is to be carefully removed the globules of melted iron contained in the cup and those which have been scattered about and swim upon the mercury are to be accurately collected and the whole is to be weighed the iron will be found in that state called martial ethiops by the old chemists possessing a degree of metallic brilliancy very friable and readily reducible into powder under the hammer or with a pestle and mortar if the experiment has succeeded well from 100 grains of iron will be obtained 135 or 136 grains of ethiops which is an augmentation of 35 per cent if all the attention has been paid to this experiment which it deserves the air will be found diminished in weight exactly equal to what the iron has gained having therefore burnt 100 grains of iron which has acquired an additional weight of 35 grains the diminution of air will be found exactly 70 cubical inches and it will be found in the sequel that the weight of vital air is pretty nearly half a grain for each cubical inch so that in effect the augmentation of weight in the one exactly coincides with the loss of it in the other i shall observe here once for all that in every experiment of this kind the pressure and temperature of the air both before and after the experiment must be reduced by calculation to a common standard of 10 545 of the thermometer and 28 inches of the barometer towards the end of this work the manner of performing this very necessary reduction will be found accurately detailed if it be required to examine the nature of the air which remains after this experiment we must operate in a somewhat different manner after the combustion is finished and the vessels have cooled we first take out the cup and the burnt iron by introducing the hand through the quicksilver under the bellglass we next introduce some solution of potash or caustic alkali or of the sulphuret of potash or such other substance as is judged proper for examining their action upon the residuum of air i shall in the sequel give an account of these methods of analysing air when i have explained the nature of these different substances which are only here in a manner accidentally mentioned after this examination so much water must be let into the glass as will displace the quicksilver and then by means of a shallow dish placed below the bellglass it is to be removed into the common water pneumatochemical apparatus where the air remaining may be examined at large and with great facility when very soft and very pure iron has been employed in this experiment and if the combustion has been performed in the purest respirable or vital air free from all admixture of the noxious or mephitic part the air which remains after the combustion will be found as pure as it was before but it is difficult to find iron entirely free from a small portion of charry matter which is chiefly abundant in steel it is likewise exceedingly difficult to procure the pure air perfectly free from some admixture of mephitis with which it is almost always contaminated but this species of noxious air does not in the smallest degree disturb the result of the experiment as it is always found at the end exactly in the same proportion as at the beginning i mentioned before that we have two ways of determining the constituent parts of atmospheric air the method of analysis and that by synthesis the calcination of mercury has furnished us with an example of each of these methods since after having robbed the respirable part of its base by means of the mercury we have restored it so as to recompose an air precisely similar to that of the atmosphere but we can equally accomplish this synthetic composition of atmospheric air by borrowing the materials of which it is composed from different kingdoms of nature we shall see hereafter that when animal substances are dissolved in the nitric acid a great quantity of gas is disengaged which extinguishes light and is unfit for animal respiration being exactly similar to the noxious or mephitic part of atmospheric air and if we take 73 parts by weight of this elastic fluid and mix it with 27 parts of highly respirable air procured from calcined mercury we will form an elastic fluid precisely similar to atmospheric air in all its properties there are many other methods of separating the respirable from the noxious part of the atmospheric air which cannot be taken notice of in this part without anticipating information which properly belongs to the subsequent chapters the experiments already adduced may suffice for an elementary treatise and in matters of this nature the choice of our evidences is of far greater consequence than their number i shall close this article by pointing out the property which atmospheric air and all the known gasses possess of dissolving water which is of great consequence to be attended to in all experiments of this nature mr saussure found by experiment that a cubical foot of atmospheric air is capable of holding 12 grains of water in solution other gasses as the carbonic acid appear capable of dissolving a greater quantity but experiments are still wanting by which to determine their several proportions this water held in solution by gasses gives rise to particular phenomena in many experiments which require great attention and which has frequently proved the source of great errors to chemists in determining the results of their experiments footnotes 9 it will likewise be necessary to take care that the air contained in the glass both before and after the experiment be reduced to a common temperature and pressure otherwise the results of the following calculations will be fallaciouse chap iv nomenclature of the several constituent parts of atmospheric air hitherto i have been obliged to make use of circumlocution to express the nature of the several substances which constitute our atmosphere having provisionally used the terms of respirable and noxious or nonrespirable parts of the air but the investigations i mean to undertake require a more direct mode of expression and having now endeavoured to give simple and distinct ideas of the different substances which enter into the composition of the atmosphere i shall henceforth express these ideas by words equally simple the temperature of our earth being very near to that at which water becomes solid and reciprocally changes from solid to fluid and as this phenomenon takes place frequently under our observation it has very naturally followed that in the languages of at least every climate subjected to any degree of winter a term has been used for signifying water in the state of solidity when deprived of its caloric the same however has not been found necessary with respect to water reduced to the state of vapour by an additional dose of caloric since those persons who do not make a particular study of objects of this kind are still ignorant that water when in a temperature only a little above the boiling heat is changed into an elastic ariform fluid susceptible like all other gasses of being received and contained in vessels and preserving its gasseous form so long as it remains at the temperature of 80 212 and under a pressure not exceeding 28 inches of the mercurial barometer as this phenomenon has not been generally observed no language has used a particular term for expressing water in this state10 and the same thing occurs with all fluids and all substances which do not evaporate in the common temperature and under the usual pressure of our atmosphere for similar reasons names have not been given to the liquid or concrete states of most of the ariform fluids these were not known to arise from the combination of caloric with certain bases and as they had not been seen either in the liquid or solid states their existence under these forms was even unknown to natural philosophers we have not pretended to make any alteration upon such terms as are sanctified by ancient custom and therefore continue to use the words water and ice in their common acceptation we likewise retain the word air to express that collection of elastic fluids which composes our atmosphere but we have not thought it necessary to preserve the same respect for modern terms adopted by latter philosophers having considered ourselves as at liberty to reject such as appeared liable to occasion erroneous ideas of the substances they are meant to express and either to substitute new terms or to employ the old ones after modifying them in such a manner as to convey more determinate ideas new words have been drawn chiefly from the greek language in such a manner as to make their etymology convey some idea of what was meant to be represented and these we have always endeavoured to make short and of such a nature as to be changeable into adjectives and verbs following these principles we have after mr macquers example retained the term gas employed by vanhelmont having arranged the numerous class of elastic ariform fluids under that name excepting only atmospheric air gas therefore in our nomenclature becomes a generic term expressing the fullest degree of saturation in any body with caloric being in fact a term expressive of a mode of existence to distinguish each species of gas we employ a second term from the name of the base which saturated with caloric forms each particular gas thus we name water combined to saturation with caloric so as to form an elastic fluid aqueous gas ether combined in the same manner etherial gas the combination of alkohol with caloric becomes alkoholic gas and following the same principles we have muriatic acid gas ammoniacal gas and so on of every substance susceptible of being combined with caloric in such a manner as to assume the gasseous or elastic ariform state we have already seen that the atmospheric air is composed of two gasses or ariform fluids one of which is capable by respiration of contributing to animal life and in which metals are calcinable and combustible bodies may burn the other on the contrary is endowed with directly opposite qualities it cannot be breathed by animals neither will it admit of the combustion of inflammable bodies nor of the calcination of metals we have given to the base of the former or respirable portion of the air the name of oxygen from greek oxys acidum and greek geinomas gignor because in reality one of the most general properties of this base is to form acids by combining with many different substances the union of this base with caloric we term oxygen gas which is the same with what was formerly called pure or vital air the weight of this gas at the temperature of 10 5450 and under a pressure equal to 28 inches of the barometer is half a grain for each cubical inch or one ounce and a half to each cubical foot the chemical properties of the noxious portion of atmospheric air being hitherto but little known we have been satisfied to derive the name of its base from its known quality of killing such animals as are forced to breathe it giving it the name of azote from the greek privitive particle greek a and greek xa vita hence the name of the noxious part of atmospheric air is azotic gas the weight of which in the same temperature and under the same pressure is 1 oz 2 gros and 48 grs to the cubical foot or 04444 of a grain to the cubical inch we cannot deny that this name appears somewhat extraordinary but this must be the case with all new terms which cannot be expected to become familiar until they have been some time in use we long endeavoured to find a more proper designation without success it was at first proposed to call it alkaligen gas as from the experiments of mr berthollet it appears to enter into the composition of ammoniac or volatile alkali but then we have as yet no proof of its making one of the constituent elements of the other alkalies beside it is proved to compose a part of the nitric acid which gives as good reason to have called it nitrigen for these reasons finding it necessary to reject any name upon systematic principles we have considered that we run no risk of mistake in adopting the terms of azote and azotic gas which only express a matter of fact or that property which it possesses of depriving such animals as breathe it of their lives i should anticipate subjects more properly reserved for the subsequent chapters were i in this place to enter upon the nomenclature of the several species of gasses it is sufficient in this part of the work to establish the principles upon which their denominations are founded the principal merit of the nomenclature we have adopted is that when once the simple elementary substance is distinguished by an appropriate term the names of all its compounds derive readily and necessarily from this first denomination footnotes 10 in english the word steam is exclusively appropriated to water in the state of vapour e chap v of the decomposition of oxygen gas by sulphur phosphorus and charcoaland of the formation of acids in general in performing experiments it is a necessary principle which ought never to be deviated from that they be simplified as much as possible and that every circumstance capable of rendering their results complicated be carefully removed wherefore in the experiments which form the object of this chapter we have never employed atmospheric air which is not a simple substance it is true that the azotic gas which forms a part of its mixture appears to be merely passive during combustion and calcination but besides that it retards these operations very considerably we are not certain but it may even alter their results in some circumstances for which reason i have thought it necessary to remove even this possible cause of doubt by only making use of pure oxygen gas in the following experiments which show the effects produced by combustion in that gas and i shall advert to such differences as take place in the results of these when the oxygen gas or pure vital air is mixed in different proportions with azotic gas having filled a bellglass a pl iv fig 3 of between five and six pints measure with oxygen gas i removed it from the water trough where it was filled into the quicksilver bath by means of a shallow glass dish slipped underneath and having dried the mercury i introduced 6114 grains of kunkels phosphorus in two little china cups like that represented at d fig 3 under the glass a and that i might set fire to each of the portions of phosphorus separately and to prevent the one from catching fire from the other one of the dishes was covered with a piece of flat glass i next raised the quicksilver in the bellglass up to e f by sucking out a sufficient portion of the gas by means of the syphon g h i after this by means of the crooked iron wire fig 16 made red hot i set fire to the two portions of phosphorus successively first burning that portion which was not covered with the piece of glass the combustion was extremely rapid attended with a very brilliant flame and considerable disengagement of light and heat in consequence of the great heat induced the gas was at first much dilated but soon after the mercury returned to its level and a considerable absorption of gas took place at the same time the whole inside of the glass became covered with white light flakes of concrete phosphoric acid at the beginning of the experiment the quantity of oxygen gas reduced as above directed to a common standard amounted to 162 cubical inches and after the combustion was finished only 2314 cubical inches likewise reduced to the standard remained so that the quantity of oxygen gas absorbed during the combustion was 13834 cubical inches equal to 69375 grains a part of the phosphorus remained unconsumed in the bottom of the cups which being washed on purpose to separate the acid weighed about 1614 grains so that about 45 grains of phosphorus had been burned but as it is hardly possible to avoid an error of one or two grains i leave the quantity so far qualified hence as nearly 45 grains of phosphorus had in this experiment united with 69375 grains of oxygen and as no gravitating matter could have escaped through the glass we have a right to conclude that the weight of the substance resulting from the combustion in form of white flakes must equal that of the phosphorus and oxygen employed which amounts to 114375 grains and we shall presently find that these flakes consisted entirely of a solid or concrete acid when we reduce these weights to hundredth parts it will be found that 100 parts of phosphorus require 154 parts of oxygen for saturation and that this combination will produce 254 parts of concrete phosphoric acid in form of white fleecy flakes this experiment proves in the most convincing manner that at a certain degree of temperature oxygen possesses a stronger elective attraction or affinity for phosphorus than for caloric that in consequence of this the phosphorus attracts the base of oxygen gas from the caloric which being set free spreads itself over the surrounding bodies but though this experiment be so far perfectly conclusive it is not sufficiently rigorous as in the apparatus described it is impossible to ascertain the weight of the flakes of concrete acid which are formed we can therefore only determine this by calculating the weights of oxygen and phosphorus employed but as in physics and in chemistry it is not allowable to suppose what is capable of being ascertained by direct experiment i thought it necessary to rep at this experiment as follows upon a larger scale and by means of a different apparatus i took a large glass baloon a pl iv fig 4 with an opening three inches diameter to which was fitted a crystal stopper ground with emery and pierced with two holes for the tubes yyy xxx before shutting the baloon with its stopper i introduced the support bc surmounted by the china cup d containing 150 grs of phosphorus the stopper was then fitted to the opening of the baloon luted with fat lute and covered with slips of linen spread with quicklime and white of eggs when the lute was perfectly dry the weight of the whole apparatus was determined to within a grain or a grain and a half i next exhausted the baloon by means of an air pump applied to the tube xxx and then introduced oxygen gas by means of the tube yyy having a stop cock adapted to it this kind of experiment is most readily and most exactly performed by means of the hydropneumatic machine described by mr meusnier and me in the memoirs of the academy for 1782 pag 466 and explained in the latter part of this work with several important additions and corrections since made to it by mr meusnier with this instrument we can readily ascertain in the most exact manner both the quantity of oxygen gas introduced into the baloon and the quantity consumed during the course of the experiment when all things were properly disposed i set fire to the phosphorus with a burning glass the combustion was extremely rapid accompanied with a bright flame and much heat as the operation went on large quantities of white flakes attached themselves to the inner surface of the baloon so that at last it was rendered quite opake the quantity of these flakes at last became so abundant that although fresh oxygen gas was continually supplied which ought to have supported the combustion yet the phosphorus was soon extinguished having allowed the apparatus to cool completely i first ascertained the quantity of oxygen gas employed and weighed the baloon accurately before it was opened i next washed dried and weighed the small quantity of phosphorus remaining in the cup on purpose to determine the whole quantity of phosphorus consumed in the experiment this residuum of the phosphorus was of a yellow ochrey colour it is evident that by these several precautions i could easily determine 1st the weight of the phosphorus consumed 2d the weight of the flakes produced by the combustion and 3d the weight of the oxygen which had combined with the phosphorus this experiment gave very nearly the same results with the former as it proved that the phosphorus during its combustion had absorbed a little more than one and a half its weight of oxygen and i learned with more certainty that the weight of the new substance produced in the experiment exactly equalled the sum of the weights of the phosphorus consumed and oxygen absorbed which indeed was easily determinable a priori if the oxygen gas employed be pure the residuum after combustion is as pure as the gas employed this proves that nothing escapes from the phosphorus capable of altering the purity of the oxygen gas and that the only action of the phosphorus is to separate the oxygen from the caloric with which it was before united i mentioned above that when any combustible body is burnt in a hollow sphere of ice or in an apparatus properly constructed upon that principle the quantity of ice melted during the combustion is an exact measure of the quantity of caloric disengaged upon this head the memoir given by m de la place and me a 1780 p 355 may be consulted having submitted the combustion of phosphorus to this trial we found that one pound of phosphorus melted a little more than 100 pounds of ice during its combustion the combustion of phosphorus succeeds equally well in atmospheric air as in oxygen gas with this difference that the combustion is vastly slower being retarded by the large proportion of azotic gas mixed with the oxygen gas and that only about onefifth part of the air employed is absorbed because as the oxygen gas only is absorbed the proportion of the azotic gas becomes so great toward the close of the experiment as to put an end to the combustion i have already shown that phosphorus is changed by combustion into an extremely light white flakey matter and its properties are entirely altered by this transformation from being insoluble in water it becomes not only soluble but so greedy of moisture as to attract the humidity of the air with astonishing rapidity by this means it is converted into a liquid considerably more dense and of more specific gravity than water in the state of phosphorus before combustion it had scarcely any sensible taste by its union with oxygen it acquires an extremely sharp and sour taste in a word from one of the class of combustible bodies it is changed into an incombustible substance and becomes one of those bodies called acids this property of a combustible substance to be converted into an acid by the addition of oxygen we shall presently find belongs to a great number of bodies wherefore strict logic requires that we should adopt a common term for indicating all these operations which produce analogous results this is the true way to simplify the study of science as it would be quite impossible to bear all its specifical details in the memory if they were not classically arranged for this reason we shall distinguish this conversion of phosphorus into an acid by its union with oxygen and in general every combination of oxygen with a combustible substance by the term of oxygenation from which i shall adopt the verb to oxygenate and of consequence shall say that in oxygenating phosphorus we convert it into an acid sulphur is likewise a combustible body or in other words it is a body which possesses the power of decomposing oxygen gas by attracting the oxygen from the caloric with which it was combined this can very easily be proved by means of experiments quite similar to those we have given with phosphorus but it is necessary to premise that in these operations with sulphur the same accuracy of result is not to be expected as with phosphorus because the acid which is formed by the combustion of sulphur is difficultly condensible and because sulphur burns with more difficulty and is soluble in the different gasses but i can safely assert from my own experiments that sulphur in burning absorbs oxygen gas that the resulting acid is considerably heavier than the sulphur burnt that its weight is equal to the sum of the weights of the sulphur which has been burnt and of the oxygen absorbed and lastly that this acid is weighty incombustible and miscible with water in all proportions the only uncertainty remaining upon this head is with regard to the proportions of sulphur and of oxygen which enter into the composition of the acid charcoal which from all our present knowledge regarding it must be considered as a simple combustible body has likewise the property of decomposing oxygen gas by absorbing its base from the caloric but the acid resulting from this combustion does not condense in the common temperature under the pressure of our atmosphere it remains in the state of gas and requires a large proportion of water to combine with or be dissolved in this acid has however all the known properties of other acids though in a weaker degree and combines like them with all the bases which are susceptible of forming neutral salts the combustion of charcoal in oxygen gas may be effected like that of phosphorus in the bellglass a pl iv fig 3 placed over mercury but as the heat of red hot iron is not sufficient to set fire to the charcoal we must add a small morsel of tinder with a minute particle of phosphorus in the same manner as directed in the experiment for the combustion of iron a detailed account of this experiment will be found in the memoirs of the academy for 1781 p 448 by that experiment it appears that 28 parts by weight of charcoal require 72 parts of oxygen for saturation and that the ariform acid produced is precisely equal in weight to the sum of the weights of the charcoal and oxygen gas employed this ariform acid was called fixed or fixable air by the chemists who first discovered it they did not then know whether it was air resembling that of the atmosphere or some other elastic fluid vitiated and corrupted by combustion but since it is now ascertained to be an acid formed like all others by the oxygenation of its peculiar base it is obvious that the name of fixed air is quite ineligible11 by burning charcoal in the apparatus mentioned p 60 mr de la place and i found that one lib of charcoal melted 96 libs 6 oz of ice that during the combustion 2 libs 9 oz 1 gros 10 grs of oxygen were absorbed and that 3 libs 9 oz 1 gros 10 grs of acid gas were formed this gas weighs 0695 parts of a grain for each cubical inch in the common standard temperature and pressure mentioned above so that 34242 cubical inches of acid gas are produced by the combustion of one pound of charcoal i might multiply these experiments and show by a numerous succession of facts that all acids are formed by the combustion of certain substances but i am prevented from doing so in place by the plan which i have laid down of proceeding only from facts already ascertained to such as are unknown and of drawing my examples only from circumstances already explained in the mean time however the three examples above cited may suffice for giving a clear and accurate conception of the manner in which acids are formed by these it may be clearly seen that oxygen is an element common to them all which constitutes their acidity and that they differ from each other according to the nature of the oxygenated or acidified substance we must therefore in every acid carefully distinguish between the acidifiable base which mr de morveau calls the radical and the acidifiing principle or oxygen footnotes 11 it may be proper to remark though here omitted by the author that in conformity with the general principles of the new nomenclature this acid is by mr lavoisier and his coleagues called the carbonic acid and when in the ariform state carbonic acid gas e chap vi of the nomenclature of acids in general and particularly of those drawn from nitre and seasalt it becomes extremely easy from the principles laid down in the preceding chapter to establish a systematic nomenclature for the acids the word acid being used as a generic term each acid falls to be distinguished in language as in nature by the name of its base or radical thus we give the generic name of acids to the products of the combustion or oxygenation of phosphorus of sulphur and of charcoal and these products are respectively named the phosphoric acid the sulphuric acid and the carbonic acid there is however a remarkable circumstance in the oxygenation of combustible bodies and of a part of such bodies as are convertible into acids that they are susceptible of different degrees of saturation with oxygen and that the resulting acids though formed by the union of the same elements are possessed of different properties depending upon that difference of proportion of this the phosphoric acid and more especially the sulphuric furnishes us with examples when sulphur is combined with a small proportion of oxygen it forms in this first or lower degree of oxygenation a volatile acid having a penetrating odour and possessed of very particular qualities by a larger proportion of oxygen it is changed into a fixed heavy acid without any odour and which by combination with other bodies gives products quite different from those furnished by the former in this instance the principles of our nomenclature seem to fail and it seems difficult to derive such terms from the name of the acidifiable base as shall distinctly express these two degrees of saturation or oxygenation without circumlocution by reflection however upon the subject or perhaps rather from the necessity of the case we have thought it allowable to express these varieties in the oxygenation of the acids by simply varying the termination of their specific names the volatile acid produced from sulphur was anciently known to stahl under the name of sulphurous acid12 we have preserved that term for this acid from sulphur undersaturated with oxygen and distinguish the other or completely saturated or oxygenated acid by the name of sulphuric acid we shall therefore say in this new chemical language that sulphur in combining with oxygen is susceptible of two degrees of saturation that the first or lesser degree constitutes sulphurous acid which is volatile and penetrating whilst the second or higher degree of saturation produces sulphuric acid which is fixed and inodorous we shall adopt this difference of termination for all the acids which assume several degrees of saturation hence we have a phosphorous and a phosphoric acid an acetous and an acetic acid and so on for others in similar circumstances this part of chemical science would have been extremely simple and the nomenclature of the acids would not have been at all perplexed as it is now in the old nomenclature if the base or radical of each acid had been known when the acid itself was discovered thus for instance phosphorus being a known substance before the discovery of its acid this latter was rightly distinguished by a term drawn from the name of its acidifiable base but when on the contrary an acid happened to be discovered before its base or rather when the acidifiable base from which it was formed remained unknown names were adopted for the two which have not the smallest connection and thus not only the memory became burthened with useless appellations but even the minds of students nay even of experienced chemists became filled with false ideas which time and reflection alone is capable of eradicating we may give an instance of this confusion with respect to the acid sulphur the former chemists having procured this acid from the vitriol of iron gave it the name of the vitriolic acid from the name of the substance which produced it and they were then ignorant that the acid procured from sulphur by combustion was exactly the same the same thing happened with the ariform acid formerly called fixed air it not being known that this acid was the result of combining charcoal with oxygen a variety of denominations have been given to it not one of which conveys just ideas of its nature or origin we have found it extremely easy to correct and modify the ancient language with respect to these acids proceeding from known bases having converted the name of vitriolic acid into that of sulphuric and the name of fixed air into that of carbonic acid but it is impossible to follow this plan with the acids whose bases are still unknown with these we have been obliged to use a contrary plan and instead of forming the name of the acid from that of its base have been forced to denominate the unknown base from the name of the known acid as happens in the case of the acid which is procured from sea salt to disengage this acid from the alkaline base with which it is combined we have only to pour sulphuric acid upon seasalt immediately a brisk effervescence takes place white vapours arise of a very penetrating odour and by only gently heating the mixture all the acid is driven off as in the common temperature and pressure of our atmosphere this acid is naturally in the state of gas we must use particular precautions for retaining it in proper vessels for small experiments the most simple and most commodious apparatus consists of a small retort g pl v fig 5 into which the seasalt is introduced well dried13 we then pour on some concentrated sulphuric acid and immediately introduce the beak of the retort under little jars or bellglasses a same plate and fig previously filled with quicksilver in proportion as the acid gas is disengaged it passes into the jar and gets to the top of the quicksilver which it displaces when the disengagement of the gas slackens a gentle heat is applied to the retort and gradually increased till nothing more passes over this acid gas has a very strong affinity with water which absorbs an enormous quantity of it as is proved by introducing a very thin layer of water into the glass which contains the gas for in an instant the whole acid gas disappears and combines with the water this latter circumstance is taken advantage of in laboratories and manufactures on purpose to obtain the acid of seasalt in a liquid form and for this purpose the apparatus pl iv fig 1 is employed it consists 1st of a tubulated retort a into which the seasalt and after it the sulphuric acid are introduced through the opening h 2d of the baloon or recipient c b intended for containing the small quantity of liquid which passes over during the process and 3d of a set of bottles with two mouths l l l l half filled with water intended for absorbing the gas disengaged by the distillation this apparatus will be more amply described in the latter part of this work although we have not yet been able either to compose or to decompound this acid of seasalt we cannot have the smallest doubt that it like all other acids is composed by the union of oxygen with an acidifiable base we have therefore called this unknown substance the muriatic base or muriatic radical deriving this name after the example of mr bergman and mr de morveau from the latin word muria which was anciently used to signify seasalt thus without being able exactly to determine the component parts of muriatic acid we design by that term a volatile acid which retains the form of gas in the common temperature and pressure of our atmosphere which combines with great facility and in great quantity with water and whose acidifiable base adheres so very intimately with oxygen that no method has hitherto been devised for separating them if ever this acidifiable base of the muriatic acid is discovered to be a known substance though now unknown in that capacity it will be requisite to change its present denomination for one analogous with that of its base in common with sulphuric acid and several other acids the muriatic is capable of different degrees of oxygenation but the excess of oxygen produces quite contrary effects upon it from what the same circumstance produces upon the acid of sulphur the lower degree of oxygenation converts sulphur into a volatile gasseous acid which only mixes in small proportions with water whilst a higher oxygenation forms an acid possessing much stronger acid properties which is very fixed and cannot remain in the state of gas but in a very high temperature which has no smell and which mixes in large proportion with water with muriatic acid the direct reverse takes place an additional saturation with oxygen renders it more volatile of a more penetrating odour less miscible with water and diminishes its acid properties we were at first inclined to have denominated these two degrees of saturation in the same manner as we had done with the acid of sulphur calling the less oxygenated muriatous acid and that which is more saturated with oxygen muriatic acid but as this latter gives very particular results in its combinations and as nothing analogous to it is yet known in chemistry we have left the name of muriatic acid to the less saturated and give the latter the more compounded appellation of oxygenated muriatic acid although the base or radical of the acid which is extracted from nitre or saltpetre be better known we have judged proper only to modify its name in the same manner with that of the muriatic acid it is drawn from nitre by the intervention of sulphuric acid by a process similar to that described for extracting the muriatic acid and by means of the same apparatus pl iv fig 1 in proportion as the acid passes over it is in part condensed in the baloon or recipient and the rest is absorbed by the water contained in the bottles llll the water becomes first green then blue and at last yellow in proportion to the concentration of the acid during this operation a large quantity of oxygen gas mixed with a small proportion of azotic gas is disengaged this acid like all others is composed of oxygen united to an acidifiable base and is even the first acid in which the existence of oxygen was well ascertained its two constituent elements are but weakly united and are easily separated by presenting any substance with which oxygen has a stronger affinity than with the acidifiable base peculiar to this acid by some experiments of this kind it was first discovered that azote or the base of mephitis or azotic gas constituted its acidifiable base or radical and consequently that the acid of nitre was really an azotic acid having azote for its base combined with oxygen for these reasons that we might be consistent with our principles it appeared necessary either to call the acid by the name of azotic or to name the base nitric radical but from either of these we were dissuaded by the following considerations in the first place it seemed difficult to change the name of nitre or saltpetre which has been universally adopted in society in manufactures and in chemistry and on the other hand azote having been discovered by mr berthollet to be the base of volatile alkali or ammoniac as well as of this acid we thought it improper to call it nitric radical we have therefore continued the term of azote to the base of that part of atmospheric air which is likewise the nitric and ammoniacal radical and we have named the acid of nitre in its lower and higher degrees of oxygenation nitrous acid in the former and nitric acid in the latter state thus preserving its former appellation properly modified several very respectable chemists have disapproved of this deference for the old terms and wished us to have persevered in perfecting a new chemical language without paying any respect for ancient usage so that by thus steering a kind of middle course we have exposed ourselves to the censures of one sect of chemists and to the expostulations of the opposite party the acid of nitre is susceptible of assuming a great number of separate states depending upon its degree of oxygenation or upon the proportions in which azote and oxygen enter into its composition by a first or lowest degree of oxygenation it forms a particular species of gas which we shall continue to name nitrous gas this is composed nearly of two parts by weight of oxygen combined with one part of azote and in this state it is not miscible with water in this gas the azote is by no means saturated with oxygen but on the contrary has still a very great affinity for that element and even attracts it from atmospheric air immediately upon getting into contact with it this combination of nitrous gas with atmospheric air has even become one of the methods for determining the quantity of oxygen contained in air and consequently for ascertaining its degree of salubrity this addition of oxygen converts the nitrous gas into a powerful acid which has a strong affinity with water and which is itself susceptible of various additional degrees of oxygenation when the proportions of oxygen and azote is below three parts by weight of the former to one of the latter the acid is red coloured and emits copious fumes in this state by the application of a gentle heat it gives out nitrous gas and we term it in this degree of oxygenation nitrous acid when four parts by weight of oxygen are combined with one part of azote the acid is clear and colourless more fixed in the fire than the nitrous acid has less odour and its constituent elements are more firmly united this species of acid in conformity with our principles of nomenclature is called nitric acid thus nitric acid is the acid of nitre surcharged with oxygen nitrous acid is the acid of nitre surcharged with azote or what is the same thing with nitrous gas and this latter is azote not sufficiently saturated with oxygen to possess the properties of an acid to this degree of oxygenation we have afterwards in the course of this work given the generical name of oxyd14 footnotes 12 the term formerly used by the english chemists for this acid was written sulphureous but we have thought proper to spell it as above that it may better conform with the similar terminations of nitrous carbonous c to be used hereafter in general we have used the english terminations ic and ous to translate the terms of the author which end with ique and cux with hardly any other alterationse 13 for this purpose the operation called decrepitation is used which consists in subjecting it to nearly a red heat in a proper vessel so as to evaporate all its water of crystallizatione 14 in strict conformity with the principles of the new nomenclature but which the author has given his reasons for deviating from in this instance the following ought to have been the terms for azote in its several degrees of oxygenation azote azotic gas azote combined with caloric azotic oxyd gas nitrous acid and nitric acide chap vii of the decomposition of oxygen gas by means of metals and the formation of metallic oxyds oxygen has a stronger affinity with metals heated to a certain degree than with caloric in consequence of which all metallic bodies excepting gold silver and platina have the property of decomposing oxygen gas by attracting its base from the caloric with which it was combined we have already shown in what manner this decomposition takes place by means of mercury and iron having observed that in the case of the first it must be considered as a kind of gradual combustion whilst in the latter the combustion is extremely rapid and attended with a brilliant flame the use of the heat employed in these operations is to separate the particles of the metal from each other and to diminish their attraction of cohesion or aggregation or what is the same thing their mutual attraction for each other the absolute weight of metallic substances is augmented in proportion to the quantity of oxygen they absorb they at the same time lose their metallic splendour and are reduced into an earthy pulverulent matter in this state metals must not be considered as entirely saturated with oxygen because their action upon this element is counterbalanced by the power of affinity between it and caloric during the calcination of metals the oxygen is therefore acted upon by two separate and opposite powers that of its attraction for caloric and that exerted by the metal and only tends to unite with the latter in consequence of the excess of the latter over the former which is in general very inconsiderable wherefore when metallic substances are oxygenated in atmospheric air or in oxygen gas they are not converted into acids like sulphur phosphorus and charcoal but are only changed into intermediate substances which though approaching to the nature of salts have not acquired all the saline properties the old chemists have affixed the name of calx not only to metals in this state but to every body which has been long exposed to the action of fire without being melted they have converted this word calx into a generical term under which they confound calcareous earth which from a neutral salt which it really was before calcination has been changed by fire into an earthy alkali by losing half of its weight with metals which by the same means have joined themselves to a new substance whose quantity often exceeds half their weight and by which they have been changed almost into the nature of acids this mode of classifying substances of so very opposite natures under the same generic name would have been quite contrary to our principles of nomenclature especially as by retaining the above term for this state of metallic substances we must have conveyed very false ideas of its nature we have therefore laid aside the expression metallic calx altogether and have substituted in its place the term oxyd from the greek word greek oxys by this may be seen that the language we have adopted is both copious and expressive the first or lowest degree of oxygenation in bodies converts them into oxyds a second degree of additional oxygenation constitutes the class of acids of which the specific names drawn from their particular bases terminate in ous as the nitrous and sulphurous acids the third degree of oxygenation changes these into the species of acids distinguished by the termination in ic as the nitric and sulphuric acids and lastly we can express a fourth or highest degree of oxygenation by adding the word oxygenated to the name of the acid as has been already done with the oxygenated muriatic acid we have not confined the term oxyd to expressing the combinations of metals with oxygen but have extended it to signify that first degree of oxygenation in all bodies which without converting them into acids causes them to approach to the nature of salts thus we give the name of oxyd of sulphur to that soft substance into which sulphur is converted by incipient combustion and we call the yellow matter left by phosphorus after combustion by the name of oxyd of phosphorus in the same manner nitrous gas which is azote in its first degree of oxygenation is the oxyd of azote we have likewise oxyds in great numbers from the vegetable and animal kingdoms and i shall show in the sequel that this new language throws great light upon all the operations of art and nature we have already observed that almost all the metallic oxyds have peculiar and permanent colours these vary not only in the different species of metals but even according to the various degrees of oxygenation in the same metal hence we are under the necessity of adding two epithets to each oxyd one of which indicates the metal oxydated15 while the other indicates the peculiar colour of the oxyd thus we have the black oxyd of iron the red oxyd of iron and the yellow oxyd of iron which expressions respectively answer to the old unmeaning terms of martial ethiops colcothar and rust of iron or ochre we have likewise the gray yellow and red oxyds of lead which answer to the equally false or insignificant terms ashes of lead massicot and minium these denominations sometimes become rather long especially when we mean to indicate whether the metal has been oxydated in the air by detonation with nitre or by means of acids but then they always convey just and accurate ideas of the corresponding object which we wish to express by their use all this will be rendered perfectly clear and distinct by means of the tables which are added to this work footnotes 15 here we see the word oxyd converted into the verb to oxydate oxydated oxydating after the same manner with the derivation of the verb to oxygenate oxygenated oxygenating from the word oxygen i am not clear of the absolute necessity of this second verb here first introduced but think in a work of this nature that it is the duty of the translator to neglect every other consideration for the sake of strict fidelity to the ideas of his authore chap viii of the radical principle of water and of its decomposition by charcoal and iron until very lately water has always been thought a simple substance insomuch that the older chemists considered it as an element such it undoubtedly was to them as they were unable to decompose it or at least since the decomposition which took place daily before their eyes was entirely unnoticed but we mean to prove that water is by no means a simple or elementary substance i shall not here pretend to give the history of this recent and hitherto contested discovery which is detailed in the memoirs of the academy for 1781 but shall only bring forwards the principal proofs of the decomposition and composition of water and i may venture to say that these will be convincing to such as consider them impartially experiment first having fixed the glass tube ef pl vii fig 11 of from 8 to 12 lines diameter across a furnace with a small inclination from e to f lute the superior extremity e to the glass retort a containing a determinate quantity of distilled water and to the inferior extremity f the worm ss fixed into the neck of the doubly tubulated bottle h which has the bent tube kk adapted to one of its openings in such a manner as to convey such ariform fluids or gasses as may be disengaged during the experiment into a proper apparatus for determining their quantity and nature to render the success of this experiment certain it is necessary that the tube ef be made of well annealed and difficultly fusible glass and that it be coated with a lute composed of clay mixed with powdered stoneware besides which it must be supported about its middle by means of an iron bar passed through the furnace lest it should soften and bend during the experiment a tube of chinaware or porcellain would answer better than one of glass for this experiment were it not difficult to procure one so entirely free from pores as to prevent the passage of air or of vapours when things are thus arranged a fire is lighted in the furnace efcd which is supported of such a strength as to keep the tube ef red hot but not to make it melt and at the same time such a fire is kept up in the furnace vvxx as to keep the water in the retort a continually boiling in proportion as the water in the retort a is evaporated it fills the tube ef and drives out the air it contained by the tube kk the aqueous gas formed by evaporation is condensed by cooling in the worm ss and falls drop by drop into the tubulated bottle h having continued this operation until all the water be evaporated from the retort and having carefully emptied all the vessels employed we find that a quantity of water has passed over into the bottle h exactly equal to what was before contained in the retort a without any disengagement of gas whatsoever so that this experiment turns out to be a simple distillation and the result would have been exactly the same if the water had been run from one vessel into the other through the tube ef without having undergone the intermediate incandescence experiment second the apparatus being disposed as in the former experiment 28 grs of charcoal broken into moderately small parts and which has previously been exposed for a long time to a red heat in close vessels are introduced into the tube ef every thing else is managed as in the preceding experiment the water contained in the retort a is distilled as in the former experiment and being condensed in the worm falls into the bottle h but at the same time a considerable quantity of gas is disengaged which escaping by the tube kk is received in a convenient apparatus for that purpose after the operation is finished we find nothing but a few atoms of ashes remaining in the tube ef the 28 grs of charcoal having entirely disappeared when the disengaged gasses are carefully examined they are sound to weigh 1137 grs16 these are of two kinds viz 144 cubical inches of carbonic acid gas weighing 100 grs and 380 cubical inches of a very light gas weighing only 137 grs which takes fire when in contact with air by the approach of a lighted body and when the water which has passed over into the bottle h is carefully examined it is found to have lost 857 grs of its weight thus in this experiment 857 grs of water joined to 28 grs of charcoal have combined in such a way as to form 100 grs of carbonic acid and 137 grs of a particular gas capable of being burnt i have already shown that 100 grs of carbonic acid gas consists of 72 grs of oxygen combined with 28 grs of charcoal hence the 28 grs of charcoal placed in the glass tube have acquired 72 grs of oxygen from the water and it follows that 857 grs of water are composed of 72 grs of oxygen combined with 137 grs of a gas susceptible of combustion we shall see presently that this gas cannot possibly have been disengaged from the charcoal and must consequently have been produced from the water i have suppressed some circumstances in the above account of this experiment which would only have complicated and obscured its results in the minds of the reader for instance the inflammable gas dissolves a very small part of the charcoal by which means its weight is somewhat augmented and that of the carbonic gas proportionally diminished altho the alteration produced by this circumstance is very inconsiderable yet i have thought it necessary to determine its effects by rigid calculation and to report as above the results of the experiment in its simplified state as if this circumstance had not happened at any rate should any doubts remain respecting the consequences i have drawn from this experiment they will be fully dissipated by the following experiments which i am going to adduce in support of my opinion experiment third the apparatus being disposed exactly as in the former experiment with this difference that instead of the 28 grs of charcoal the tube ef is filled with 274 grs of soft iron in thin plates rolled up spirally the tube is made red hot by means of its furnace and the water in the retort a is kept constantly boiling till it be all evaporated and has passed through the tube ef so as to be condensed in the bottle h no carbonic acid gas is disengaged in this experiment instead of which we obtain 416 cubical inches or 15 grs of inflammable gas thirteen times lighter than atmospheric air by examining the water which has been distilled it is found to have lost 100 grs and the 274 grs of iron confined in the tube are found to have acquired 85 grs additional weight and its magnitude is considerably augmented the iron is now hardly at all attractable by the magnet it dissolves in acids without effervescence and in short it is converted into a black oxyd precisely similar to that which has been burnt in oxygen gas in this experiment we have a true oxydation of iron by means of water exactly similar to that produced in air by the assistance of heat one hundred grains of water having been decomposed 85 grs of oxygen have combined with the iron so as to convert it into the state of black oxyd and 15 grs of a peculiar inflammable gas are disengaged from all this it clearly follows that water is composed of oxygen combined with the base of an inflammable gas in the respective proportions of 85 parts by weight of the former to 15 parts of the latter thus water besides the oxygen which is one of its elements in common with many other substances contains another element as its constituent base or radical and for which we must find an appropriate term none that we could think of seemed better adapted than the word hydrogen which signifies the generative principle of water from greek ydor aqua and greek geinomas gignor17 we call the combination of this element with caloric hydrogen gas and the term hydrogen expresses the base of that gas or the radical of water this experiment furnishes us with a new combustible body or in other words a body which has so much affinity with oxygen as to draw it from its connection with caloric and to decompose air or oxygen gas this combustible body has itself so great affinity with caloric that unless when engaged in a combination with some other body it always subsists in the ariform or gasseous state in the usual temperature and pressure of our atmosphere in this state of gas it is about 113 of the weight of an equal bulk of atmospheric air it is not absorbed by water though it is capable of holding a small quantity of that fluid in solution and it is incapable of being used for respiration as the property this gas possesses in common with all other combustible bodies is nothing more than the power of decomposing air and carrying off its oxygen from the caloric with which it was combined it is easily understood that it cannot burn unless in contact with air or oxygen gas hence when we set fire to a bottle full of this gas it burns gently first at the neck of the bottle and then in the inside of it in proportion as the external air gets in this combustion is slow and successive and only takes place at the surface of contact between the two gasses it is quite different when the two gasses are mixed before they are set on fire if for instance after having introduced one part of oxygen gas into a narrow mouthed bottle we fill it up with two parts of hydrogen gas and bring a lighted taper or other burning body to the mouth of the bottle the combustion of the two gasses takes place instantaneously with a violent explosion this experiment ought only to be made in a bottle of very strong green glass holding not more than a pint and wrapped round with twine otherwise the operator will be exposed to great danger from the rupture of the bottle of which the fragments will be thrown about with great force if all that has been related above concerning the decomposition of water be exactly conformable to truthif as i have endeavoured to prove that substance be really composed of hydrogen as its proper constituent element combined with oxygen it ought to follow that by reuniting these two elements together we should recompose water and that this actually happens may be judged of by the following experiment experiment fourth i took a large cristal baloon a pl iv fig 5 holding about 30 pints having a large opening to which was cemented the plate of copper bc pierced with four holes in which four tubes terminate the first tube h h is intended to be adapted to an air pump by which the baloon is to be exhausted of its air the second tube gg communicates by its extremity mm with a reservoir of oxygen gas with which the baloon is to be filled the third tube d d d communicates by its extremity d nn with a reservoir of hydrogen gas the extremity d of this tube terminates in a capillary opening through which the hydrogen gas contained in the reservoir is forced with a moderate degree of quickness by the pressure of one or two inches of water the fourth tube contains a metallic wire gl having a knob at its extremity l intended for giving an electrical spark from l to d on purpose to set fire to the hydrogen gas this wire is moveable in the tube that we may be able to separate the knob l from the extremity d of the tube d d the three tubes d d d gg and h h are all provided with stopcocks that the hydrogen gas and oxygen gas may be as much as possible deprived of water they are made to pass in their way to the baloon a through the tubes mm nn of about an inch diameter and filled with salts which from their deliquescent nature greedily attract the moisture of the air such are the acetite of potash and the muriat or nitrat of lime18 these salts must only be reduced to a coarse powder lest they run into lumps and prevent the gasses from geting through their interstices we must be provided before hand with a sufficient quantity of oxygen gas carefully purified from all admixture of carbonic acid by long contact with a solution of potash19 we must likewise have a double quantity of hydrogen gas carefully purified in the same manner by long contact with a solution of potash in water the best way of obtaining this gas free from mixture is by decomposing water with very pure soft iron as directed in exp 3 of this chapter having adjusted every thing properly as above directed the tube h h is adapted to an airpump and the baloon a is exhausted of its air we next admit the oxygen gas so as to fill the baloon and then by means of pressure as is before mentioned force a small stream of hydrogen gas through its tube d d which we immediately set on fire by an electric spark by means of the above described apparatus we can continue the mutual combustion of these two gasses for a long time as we have the power of supplying them to the baloon from their reservoirs in proportion as they are consumed i have in another place20 given a description of the apparatus used in this experiment and have explained the manner of ascertaining the quantities of the gasses consumed with the most scrupulous exactitude in proportion to the advancement of the combustion there is a deposition of water upon the inner surface of the baloon or matrass a the water gradually increases in quantity and gathering into large drops runs down to the bottom of the vessel it is easy to ascertain the quantity of water collected by weighing the baloon both before and after the experiment thus we have a twofold verification of our experiment by ascertaining both the quantities of the gasses employed and of the water formed by their combustion these two quantities must be equal to each other by an operation of this kind mr meusnier and i ascertained that it required 85 parts by weight of oxygen united to 15 parts of hydrogen to compose 100 parts of water this experiment which has not hitherto been published was made in presence of a numerous committee from the royal academy we exerted the most scrupulous attention to its accuracy and have reason to believe that the above propositions cannot vary a two hundredth part from absolute truth from these experiments both analytical and synthetic we may now affirm that we have ascertained with as much certainty as is possible in physical or chemical subjects that water is not a simple elementary substance but is composed of two elements oxygen and hydrogen which elements when existing separately have so strong affinity for caloric as only to subsist under the form of gas in the common temperature and pressure of our atmosphere this decomposition and recomposition of water is perpetually operating before our eyes in the temperature of the atmosphere by means of compound elective attraction we shall presently see that the phenomena attendant upon vinous fermentation putrefaction and even vegetation are produced at least in a certain degree by decomposition of water it is very extraordinary that this fact should have hitherto been overlooked by natural philosophers and chemists indeed it strongly proves that in chemistry as in moral philosophy it is extremely difficult to overcome prejudices imbibed in early education and to search for truth in any other road than the one we have been accustomed to follow i shall finish this chapter by an experiment much less demonstrative than those already related but which has appeared to make more impression than any other upon the minds of many people when 16 ounces of alkohol are burnt in an apparatus21 properly adapted for collecting all the water disengaged during the combustion we obtain from 17 to 18 ounces of water as no substance can furnish a product larger than its original bulk it follows that something else has united with the alkohol during its combustion and i have already shown that this must be oxygen or the base of air thus alkohol contains hydrogen which is one of the elements of water and the atmospheric air contains oxygen which is the other element necessary to the composition of water this experiment is a new proof that water is a compound substance footnotes 16 in the latter part of this work will be found a particular account of the processes necessary for separating the different kinds of gasses and for determining their quantitiesa 17 this expression hydrogen has been very severely criticised by some who pretend that it signifies engendered by water and not that which engenders water the experiments related in this chapter prove that when water is decomposed hydrogen is produced and that when hydrogen is combined with oxygen water is produced so that we may say with equal truth that water is produced from hydrogen or hydrogen is produced from watera 18 see the nature of these salts in the second part of this booka 19 by potash is here meant pure or caustic alkali deprived of carbonic acid by means of quicklime in general we may observe here that all the alkalies and earths must invariably be considered as in their pure or caustic state unless otherwise expressede the method of obtaining this pure alkali of potash will be given in the sequela 20 see the third part of this worka 21 see an account of this apparatus in the third part of this worka chap ix of the quantities of caloric disengaged from different species of combustion we have already mentioned that when any body is burnt in the center of a hollow sphere of ice and supplied with air at the temperature of zero 32 the quantity of ice melted from the inside of the sphere becomes a measure of the relative quantities of caloric disengaged mr de la place and i gave a description of the apparatus employed for this kind of experiment in the memoirs of the academy for 1780 p 355 and a description and plate of the same apparatus will be found in the third part of this work with this apparatus phosphorus charcoal and hydrogen gas gave the following results one pound of phosphorus melted 100 libs of ice one pound of charcoal melted 96 libs 8 oz one pound of hydrogen gas melted 295 libs 9 oz 312 gros as a concrete acid is formed by the combustion of phosphorus it is probable that very little caloric remains in the acid and consequently that the above experiment gives us very nearly the whole quantity of caloric contained in the oxygen gas even if we suppose the phosphoric acid to contain a good deal of caloric yet as the phosphorus must have contained nearly an equal quantity before combustion the error must be very small as it will only consist of the difference between what was contained in the phosphorus before and in the phosphoric acid after combustion i have already shown in chap v that one pound of phosphorus absorbs one pound eight ounces of oxygen during combustion and since by the same operation 100 lib of ice are melted it follows that the quantity of caloric contained in one pound of oxygen gas is capable of melting 66 libs 10 oz 5 gros 24 grs of ice one pound of charcoal during combustion melts only 96 libs 8 oz of ice whilst it absorbs 2 libs 9 oz 1 gros 10 grs of oxygen by the experiment with phosphorus this quantity of oxygen gas ought to disengage a quantity of caloric sufficient to melt 171 libs 6 oz 5 gros of ice consequently during this experiment a quantity of caloric sufficient to melt 74 libs 14 oz 5 gros of ice disappears carbonic acid is not like phosphoric acid in a concrete state after combustion but in the state of gas and requires to be united with caloric to enable it to subsist in that state the quantity of caloric missing in the last experiment is evidently employed for that purpose when we divide that quantity by the weight of carbonic acid formed by the combustion of one pound of charcoal we find that the quantity of caloric necessary for changing one pound of carbonic acid from the concrete to the gasseous state would be capable of melting 20 libs 15 oz 5 gros of ice we may make a similar calculation with the combustion of hydrogen gas and the consequent formation of water during the combustion of one pound of hydrogen gas 5 libs 10 oz 5 gros 24 grs of oxygen gas are absorbed and 295 libs 9 oz 312 gros of ice are melted but 5 libs 10 oz 5 gros 24 grs of oxygen gas in changing from the ariform to the solid state loses according to the experiment with phosphorus enough of caloric to have melted 377 libs 12 oz 3 gros of ice there is only disengaged from the same quantity of oxygen during its combustion with hydrogen gas as much caloric as melts 295 libs 2 oz 312 gros wherefore there remains in the water at zero 32 formed during this experiment as much caloric as would melt 82 libs 9 oz 712 gros of ice hence as 6 libs 10 oz 5 gros 24 grs of water are formed from the combustion of one pound of hydrogen gas with 5 libs 10 oz 5 gros 24 grs of oxygen it follows that in each pound of water at the temperature of zero 32 there exists as much caloric as would melt 12 libs 5 oz 2 gros 48 grs of ice without taking into account the quantity originally contained in the hydrogen gas which we have been obliged to omit for want of data to calculate its quantity from this it appears that water even in the state of ice contains a considerable quantity of caloric and that oxygen in entering into that combination retains likewise a good proportion from these experiments we may assume the following results as sufficiently established combustion of phosphorus from the combustion of phosphorus as related in the foregoing experiments it appears that one pound of phosphorus requires 1 lib 8 oz of oxygen gas for its combustion and that 2 libs 8 oz of concrete phosphoric acid are produced the quantity of caloric disengaged by the combustion of one pound of phosphorus expressed by the number of pounds of ice melted during that operation is 10000000 the quantity disengaged from each pound of oxygen during the combustion of phosphorus expressed in the same manner is 6666667 the quantity disengaged during the formation of one pound of phosphoric acid 4000000 the quantity remaining in each pound of phosphoric acid 000000a note a we here suppose the phosphoric acid not to contain any caloric which is not strictly true but as i have before observed the quantity it really contains is probably very small and we have not given it a value for want of a sufficient data to go upona combustion of charcoal in the combustion of one pound of charcoal 2 libs 9 oz 1 gros 10 grs of oxygen gas are absorbed and 3 libs 9 oz 1 gros 10 grs of carbonic acid gas are formed caloric disengaged daring the combustion of one pound of charcoal 9650000a caloric disengaged during the combustion of charcoal from each pound of oxygen gas absorbed 3752823 caloric disengaged during the formation of one pound of carbonic acid gas 2702024 caloric retained by each pound of oxygen after the combustion 2913844 caloric necessary for supporting one pound of carbonic acid in the state of gas 2097960 note a all these relative quantities of caloric are expressed by the number of pounds of ice and decimal parts melted during the several operationse combustion of hydrogen gas in the combustion of one pound of hydrogen gas 5 libs 10 oz 5 gros 24 grs of oxygen gas are absorbed and 6 libs 10 oz 5 gros 24 grs of water are formed caloric from each lib of hydrogen gas 29558950 caloric from each lib of oxygen gas 5216280 caloric disengaged during the formation of each pound of water 4433840 caloric retained by each lib of oxygen after combustion with hydrogen 1450386 caloric retained by each lib of water at the temperature of zero 32 1232823 of the formation of nitric acid when we combine nitrous gas with oxygen gas so as to form nitric or nitrous acid a degree of heat is produced which is much less considerable than what is evolved during the other combinations of oxygen whence it follows that oxygen when it becomes fixed in nitric acid retains a great part of the heat which it possessed in the state of gas it is certainly possible to determine the quantity of caloric which is disengaged during the combination of these two gasses and consequently to determine what quantity remains after the combination takes place the first of these quantities might be ascertained by making the combination of the two gasses in an apparatus surrounded by ice but as the quantity of caloric disengaged is very inconsiderable it would be necessary to operate upon a large quantity of the two gasses in a very troublesome and complicated apparatus by this consideration mr de la place and i have hitherto been prevented from making the attempt in the mean time the place of such an experiment may be supplied by calculations the results of which cannot be very far from truth mr de la place and i deflagrated a convenient quantity of nitre and charcoal in an ice apparatus and found that twelve pounds of ice were melted by the deflagration of one pound of nitre we shall see in the sequel that one pound of nitre is composed as under of potash 7 oz 6 gros 5184 grs 451584 grs dry acid 8 1 2116 470016 the above quantity of dry acid is composed of oxygen 6 oz 3 gros 6634 grs 373834 grs azote 1 5 2582 96182 by this we find that during the above deflagration 2 gros 113 gr of charcoal have suffered combustion alongst with 373834 grs or 6 oz 3 gros 6634 grs of oxygen hence since 12 libs of ice were melted during the combustion it follows that one pound of oxygen burnt in the same manner would have melted 2958320 libs of ice to which the quantity of caloric retained by a pound of oxygen after combining with charcoal to form carbonic acid gas being added which was already ascertained to be capable of melting 2913844 libs of ice we have for the total quantity of caloric remaining in a pound of oxygen when combined with nitrous gas in the nitric acid 5872164 which is the number of pounds of ice the caloric remaining in the oxygen in that state is capable of melting we have before seen that in the state of oxygen gas it contained at least 6666667 wherefore it follows that in combining with azote to form nitric acid it only loses 794502 farther experiments upon this subject are necessary to ascertain how far the results of this calculation may agree with direct fact this enormous quantity of caloric retained by oxygen in its combination into nitric acid explains the cause of the great disengagement of caloric during the deflagrations of nitre or more strictly speaking upon all occasions of the decomposition of nitric acid of the combustion of wax having examined several cases of simple combustion i mean now to give a few examples of a more complex nature one pound of waxtaper being allowed to burn slowly in an ice apparatus melted 133 libs 2 oz 513 gros of ice according to my experiments in the memoirs of the academy for 1784 p 606 one pound of waxtaper consists of 13 oz 1 gros 23 grs of charcoal and 2 oz 6 gros 49 grs of hydrogen by the foregoing experiments the above quantity of charcoal ought to melt 7939390 libs of ice and the hydrogen should melt 5237605 in all 13176995 libs thus we see the quantity of caloric disengaged from a burning taper is pretty exactly conformable to what was obtained by burning separately a quantity of charcoal and hydrogen equal to what enters into its composition these experiments with the taper were several times repeated so that i have reason to believe them accurate combustion of olive oil we included a burning lamp containing a determinate quantity of oliveoil in the ordinary apparatus and when the experiment was finished we ascertained exactly the quantities of oil consumed and of ice melted the result was that during the combustion of one pound of oliveoil 148 libs 14 oz 1 gros of ice were melted by my experiments in the memoirs of the academy for 1784 and of which the following chapter contains an abstract it appears that one pound of oliveoil consists of 12 oz 5 gros 5 grs of charcoal and 3 oz 2 gros 67 grs of hydrogen by the foregoing experiments that quantity of charcoal should melt 7618723 libs of ice and the quantity of hydrogen in a pound of the oil should melt 6215053 libs the sum of these two gives 13833776 libs of ice which the two constituent elements of the oil would have melted had they separately suffered combustion whereas the oil really melted 14888330 libs which gives an excess of 1054554 in the result of the experiment above the calculated result from data furnished by former experiments this difference which is by no means very considerable may arise from errors which are unavoidable in experiments of this nature or it may be owing to the composition of oil not being as yet exactly ascertained it proves however that there is a great agreement between the results of our experiments respecting the combination of caloric and those which regard its disengagement the following desiderata still remain to be determined viz what quantity of caloric is retained by oxygen after combining with metals so as to convert them into oxyds what quantity is contained by hydrogen in its different states of existence and to ascertain with more precision than is hitherto attained how much caloric is disengaged during the formation of water as there still remain considerable doubts with respect to our present determination of this point which can only be removed by farther experiments we are at present occupied with this inquiry and when once these several points are well ascertained which we hope they will soon be we shall probably be under the necessity of making considerable corrections upon most of the results of the experiments and calculations in this chapter i did not however consider this as a sufficient reason for withholding so much as is already known from such as may be inclined to labour upon the same subject it is difficult in our endeavours to discover the principles of a new science to avoid beginning by guesswork and it is rarely possible to arrive at perfection from the first setting out chap x of the combination of combustible substances with each other as combustible substances in general have a great affinity for oxygen they ought likewise to attract or tend to combine with each other quae sunt eadem uni tertio sunt eadem inter se and the axiom is found to be true almost all the metals for instance are capable of uniting with each other and forming what are called alloys22 in common language most of these like all combinations are susceptible of several degrees of saturation the greater number of these alloys are more brittle than the pure metals of which they are composed especially when the metals alloyed together are considerably different in their degrees of fusibility to this difference in fusibility part of the phenomena attendant upon alloyage are owing particularly the property of iron called by workmen hotshort this kind of iron must be considered as an alloy or mixture of pure iron which is almost infusible with a small portion of some other metal which fuses in a much lower degree of heat so long as this alloy remains cold and both metals are in the solid state the mixture is malleable but if heated to a sufficient degree to liquify the more fusible metal the particles of the liquid metal which are interposed between the particles of the metal remaining solid must destroy their continuity and occasion the alloy to become brittle the alloys of mercury with the other metals have usually been called amalgams and we see no inconvenience from continuing the use of that term sulphur phosphorus and charcoal readily unite with metals combinations of sulphur with metals are usually named pyrites their combinations with phosphorus and charcoal are either not yet named or have received new names only of late so that we have not scrupled to change them according to our principles the combinations of metal and sulphur we call sulphurets those with phosphorus phosphurets and those formed with charcoal carburets these denominations are extended to all the combinations into which the above three substances enter without being previously oxygenated thus the combination of sulphur with potash or fixed vegetable alkali is called sulphuret of potash that which it forms with ammoniac or volatile alkali is termed sulphuret of ammoniac hydrogen is likewise capable of combining with many combustible substances in the state of gas it dissolves charcoal sulphur phosphorus and several metals we distinguish these combinations by the terms carbonated hydrogen gas sulphurated hydrogen gas and phosphorated hydrogen gas the sulphurated hydrogen gas was called hepatic air by former chemists or foetid air from sulphur by mr scheele the virtues of several mineral waters and the foetid smell of animal excrements chiefly arise from the presence of this gas the phosphorated hydrogen gas is remarkable for the property discovered by mr gengembre of taking fire spontaneously upon getting into contact with atmospheric air or what is better with oxygen gas this gas has a strong flavour resembling that of putrid fish and it is very probable that the phosphorescent quality of fish in the state of putrefaction arises from the escape of this species of gas when hydrogen and charcoal are combined together without the intervention of caloric to bring the hydrogen into the state of gas they form oil which is either fixed or volatile according to the proportions of hydrogen and charcoal in its composition the chief difference between fixed or fat oils drawn from vegetables by expression and volatile or essential oils is that the former contains an excess of charcoal which is separated when the oils are heated above the degree of boiling water whereas the volatile oils containing a just proportion of these two constituent ingredients are not liable to be decomposed by that heat but uniting with caloric into the gasseous state pass over in distillation unchanged in the memoirs of the academy for 1784 p 593 i gave an account of my experiments upon the composition of oil and alkohol by the union of hydrogen with charcoal and of their combination with oxygen by these experiments it appears that fixed oils combine with oxygen during combustion and are thereby converted into water and carbonic acid by means of calculation applied to the products of these experiments we find that fixed oil is composed of 21 parts by weight of hydrogen combined with 79 parts of charcoal perhaps the solid substances of an oily nature such as wax contain a proportion of oxygen to which they owe their state of solidity i am at present engaged in a series of experiments which i hope will throw great light upon this subject it is worthy of being examined whether hydrogen in its concrete state uncombined with caloric be susceptible of combination with sulphur phosphorus and the metals there is nothing that we know of which a priori should render these combinations impossible for combustible bodies being in general susceptible of combination with each other there is no evident reason for hydrogen being an exception to the rule however no direct experiment as yet establishes either the possibility or impossibility of this union iron and zinc are the most likely of all the metals for entering into combination with hydrogen but as these have the property of decomposing water and as it is very difficult to get entirely free from moisture in chemical experiments it is hardly possible to determine whether the small portions of hydrogen gas obtained in certain experiments with these metals were previously combined with the metal in the state of solid hydrogen or if they were produced by the decomposition of a minute quantity of water the more care we take to prevent the presence of water in these experiments the less is the quantity of hydrogen gas procured and when very accurate precautions are employed even that quantity becomes hardly sensible however this inquiry may turn out respecting the power of combustible bodies as sulphur phosphorus and metals to absorb hydrogen we are certain that they only absorb a very small portion and that this combination instead of being essential to their constitution can only be considered as a foreign substance which contaminates their purity it is the province of the advocates23 for this system to prove by decisive experiments the real existence of this combined hydrogen which they have hitherto only done by conjectures founded upon suppositions footnotes 22 this term alloy which we have from the language of the arts serves exceedingly well for distinguishing all the combinations or intimate unions of metals with each other and is adopted in our new nomenclature for that purposea 23 by these are meant the supporters of the phlogistic theory who at present consider hydrogen or the base of inflammable air as the phlogiston of the celebrated stahle chap xi observations upon oxyds and acids with several basesand upon the composition of animal and vegetable substances we have in chap v and viii examined the products resulting from the combustion of the four simple combustible substances sulphur phosphorus charcoal and hydrogen we have shown in chap x that the simple combustible substances are capable of combining with each other into compound combustible substances and have observed that oils in general and particularly the fixed vegetable oils belong to this class being composed of hydrogen and charcoal it remains in this chapter to treat of the oxygenation of these compound combustible substances and to show that there exist acids and oxyds having double and triple bases nature furnishes us with numerous examples of this kind of combinations by means of which chiefly she is enabled to produce a vast variety of compounds from a very limited number of elements or simple substances it was long ago well known that when muriatic and nitric acids were mixed together a compound acid was formed having properties quite distinct from those of either of the acids taken separately this acid was called aqua regia from its most celebrated property of dissolving gold called king of metals by the alchymists mr berthollet has distinctly proved that the peculiar properties of this acid arise from the combined action of its two acidifiable bases and for this reason we have judged it necessary to distinguish it by an appropriate name that of nitromuriatic acid appears extremely applicable from its expressing the nature of the two substances which enter into its composition this phenomenon of a double base in one acid which had formerly been observed only in the nitromuriatic acid occurs continually in the vegetable kingdom in which a simple acid or one possessed of a single acidifiable base is very rarely found almost all the acids procurable from this kingdom have bases composed of charcoal and hydrogen or of charcoal hydrogen and phosphorus combined with more or less oxygen all these bases whether double or triple are likewise formed into oxyds having less oxygen than is necessary to give them the properties of acids the acids and oxyds from the animal kingdom are still more compound as their bases generally consist of a combination of charcoal phosphorus hydrogen and azote as it is but of late that i have acquired any clear and distinct notions of these substances i shall not in this place enlarge much upon the subject which i mean to treat of very fully in some memoirs i am preparing to lay before the academy most of my experiments are already performed but to be able to give exact reports of the resulting quantities it is necessary that they be carefully repeated and increased in number wherefore i shall only give a short enumeration of the vegetable and animal acids and oxyds and terminate this article by a few reflections upon the composition of vegetable and animal bodies sugar mucus under which term we include the different kinds of gums and starch are vegetable oxyds having hydrogen and charcoal combined in different proportions as their radicals or bases and united with oxygen so as to bring them to the state of oxyds from the state of oxyds they are capable of being changed into acids by the addition of a fresh quantity of oxygen and according to the degrees of oxygenation and the proportion of hydrogen and charcoal in their bases they form the several kinds of vegetable acids it would be easy to apply the principles of our nomenclature to give names to these vegetable acids and oxyds by using the names of the two substances which compose their bases they would thus become hydrocarbonous acids and oxyds in this method we might indicate which of their elements existed in excess without circumlocution after the manner used by mr rouelle for naming vegetable extracts he calls these extractoresinous when the extractive matter prevails in their composition and resinoextractive when they contain a larger proportion of resinous matter upon that plan and by varying the terminations according to the formerly established rules of our nomenclature we have the following denominations hydrocarbonous hydrocarbonic carbonohydrous and carbonohydric oxyds and for the acids hydrocarbonous hydro carbonic oxygenated hydrocarbonic carbonohydrous carbonohydric and oxygenated carbonohydric it is probable that the above terms would suffice for indicating all the varieties in nature and that in proportion as the vegetable acids become well understood they will naturally arrange themselves under these denominations but though we know the elements of which these are composed we are as yet ignorant of the proportions of these ingredients and are still far from being able to class them in the above methodical manner wherefore we have determined to retain the ancient names provisionally i am somewhat farther advanced in this inquiry than at the time of publishing our conjunct essay upon chemical nomenclature yet it would be improper to draw decided consequences from experiments not yet sufficiently precise though i acknowledge that this part of chemistry still remains in some degree obscure i must express my expectations of its being very soon elucidated i am still more forcibly necessitated to follow the same plan in naming the acids which have three or four elements combined in their bases of these we have a considerable number from the animal kingdom and some even from vegetable substances azote for instance joined to hydrogen and charcoal form the base or radical of the prussic acid we have reason to believe that the same happens with the base of the gallic acid and almost all the animal acids have their bases composed of azote phosphorus hydrogen and charcoal were we to endeavour to express at once all these four component parts of the bases our nomenclature would undoubtedly be methodical it would have the property of being clear and determinate but this assemblage of greek and latin substantives and adjectives which are not yet universally admitted by chemists would have the appearance of a barbarous language difficult both to pronounce and to be remembered besides this part of chemistry being still far from that accuracy it must arrive to the perfection of the science ought certainly to precede that of its language and we must still for some time retain the old names for the animal oxyds and acids we have only ventured to make a few slight modifications of these names by changing the termination into ous when we have reason to suppose the base to be in excess and into ic when we suspect the oxygen predominates the following are all the vegetable acids hitherto known 1 acetous acid 2 acetic acid 3 oxalic acid 4 tartarous acid 5 pyrotartarous acid 6 citric acid 7 malic acid 8 pyromucous acid 9 pyrolignous acid 10 gallic acid 11 benzoic acid 12 camphoric acid 13 succinic acid though all these acids as has been already said are chiefly and almost entirely composed of hydrogen charcoal and oxygen yet properly speaking they contain neither water carbonic acid nor oil but only the elements necessary for forming these substances the power of affinity reciprocally exerted by the hydrogen charcoal and oxygen in these acids is in a state of equilibrium only capable of existing in the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere for when they are heated but a very little above the temperature of boiling water this equilibrium is destroyed part of the oxygen and hydrogen unite and form water part of the charcoal and hydrogen combine into oil part of the charcoal and oxygen unite to form carbonic acid and lastly there generally remains a small portion of charcoal which being in excess with respect to the other ingredients is left free i mean to explain this subject somewhat farther in the succeeding chapter the oxyds of the animal kingdom are hitherto less known than those from the vegetable kingdom and their number is as yet not at all determined the red part of the blood lymph and most of the secretions are true oxyds under which point of view it is very important to consider them we are only acquainted with six animal acids several of which it is probable approach very near each other in their nature or at least differ only in a scarcely sensible degree i do not include the phosphoric acid amongst these because it is found in all the kingdoms of nature they are 1 lactic acid 2 saccholactic acid 3 bombic acid 4 formic acid 5 sebacic acid 6 prussic acid the connection between the constituent elements of the animal oxyds and acids is not more permanent than in those from the vegetable kingdom as a small increase of temperature is sufficient to overturn it i hope to render this subject more distinct than has been done hitherto in the following chapter chap xii of the decomposition of vegetable and animal substances by the action of fire before we can thoroughly comprehend what takes place during the decomposition of vegetable substances by fire we must take into consideration the nature of the elements which enter into their composition and the different affinities which the particles of these elements exert upon each other and the affinity which caloric possesses with them the true constituent elements of vegetables are hydrogen oxygen and charcoal these are common to all vegetables and no vegetable can exist without them such other substances as exist in particular vegetables are only essential to the composition of those in which they are found and do not belong to vegetables in general of these elements hydrogen and oxygen have a strong tendency to unite with caloric and be converted into gas whilst charcoal is a fixed element having but little affinity with caloric on the other hand oxygen which in the usual temperature tends nearly equally to unite with hydrogen and with charcoal has a much stronger affinity with charcoal when at the red heat24 and then unites with it to form carbonic acid although we are far from being able to appreciate all these powers of affinity or to express their proportional energy by numbers we are certain that however variable they may be when considered in relation to the quantity of caloric with which they are combined they are all nearly in equilibrium in the usual temperature of the atmosphere hence vegetables neither contain oil25 water nor carbonic acid tho they contain all the elements of these substances the hydrogen is neither combined with the oxygen nor with the charcoal and reciprocally the particles of these three substances form a triple combination which remains in equilibrium whilst undisturbed by caloric but a very slight increase of temperature is sufficient to overturn this structure of combination if the increased temperature to which the vegetable is exposed does not exceed the heat of boiling water one part of the hydrogen combines with the oxygen and forms water the rest of the hydrogen combines with a part of the charcoal and forms volatile oil whilst the remainder of the charcoal being set free from its combination with the other elements remains fixed in the bottom of the distilling vessel when on the contrary we employ a red heat no water is formed or at least any that may have been produced by the first application of the heat is decomposed the oxygen having a greater affinity with the charcoal at this degree of heat combines with it to form carbonic acid and the hydrogen being left free from combination with the other elements unites with caloric and escapes in the state of hydrogen gas in this high temperature either no oil is formed or if any was produced during the lower temperature at the beginning of the experiment it is decomposed by the action of the red heat thus the decomposition of vegetable matter under a high temperature is produced by the action of double and triple affinities while the charcoal attracts the oxygen on purpose to form carbonic acid the caloric attracts the hydrogen and converts it into hydrogen gas the distillation of every species of vegetable substance confirms the truth of this theory if we can give that name to a simple relation of facts when sugar is submitted to distillation so long as we only employ a heat but a little below that of boiling water it only loses its water of cristallization it still remains sugar and retains all its properties but immediately upon raising the heat only a little above that degree it becomes blackened a part of the charcoal separates from the combination water slightly acidulated passes over accompanied by a little oil and the charcoal which remains in the retort is nearly a third part of the original weight of the sugar the operation of affinities which take place during the decomposition by fire of vegetables which contain azote such as the cruciferous plants and of those containing phosphorus is more complicated but as these substances only enter into the composition of vegetables in very small quantities they only apparently produce slight changes upon the products of distillation the phosphorus seems to combine with the charcoal and acquiring fixity from that union remains behind in the retort while the azote combining with a part of the hydrogen forms ammoniac or volatile alkali animal substances being composed nearly of the same elements with cruciferous plants give the same products in distillation with this difference that as they contain a greater quantity of hydrogen and azote they produce more oil and more ammoniac i shall only produce one fact as a proof of the exactness with which this theory explains all the phenomena which occur during the distillation of animal substances which is the rectification and total decomposition of volatile animal oil commonly known by the name of dippels oil when these oils are procured by a first distillation in a naked fire they are brown from containing a little charcoal almost in a free state but they become quite colourless by rectification even in this state the charcoal in their composition has so slight a connection with the other elements as to separate by mere exposure to the air if we put a quantity of this animal oil well rectified and consequently clear limpid and transparent into a bellglass filled with oxygen gas over mercury in a short time the gas is much diminished being absorbed by the oil the oxygen combining with the hydrogen of the oil forms water which sinks to the bottom at the same time the charcoal which was combined with the hydrogen being set free manifests itself by rendering the oil black hence the only way of preserving these oils colourless and transparent is by keeping them in bottles perfectly full and accurately corked to hinder the contact of air which always discolours them successive rectifications of this oil furnish another phenomenon confirming our theory in each distillation a small quantity of charcoal remains in the retort and a little water is formed by the union of the oxygen contained in the air of the distilling vessels with the hydrogen of the oil as this takes place in each successive distillation if we make use of large vessels and a considerable degree of heat we at last decompose the whole of the oil and change it entirely into water and charcoal when we use small vessels and especially when we employ a slow fire or degree of heat little above that of boiling water the total decomposition of these oils by repeated distillation is greatly more tedious and more difficultly accomplished i shall give a particular detail to the academy in a separate memoir of all my experiments upon the decomposition of oil but what i have related above may suffice to give just ideas of the composition of animal and vegetable substances and of their decomposition by the action of fire footnotes 24 though this term red heat does not indicate any absolutely determinate degree of temperature i shall use it sometimes to express a temperature considerably above that of boiling watera 25 i must be understood here to speak of vegetables reduced to a perfectly dry state and with respect to oil i do not mean that which is procured by expression either in the cold or in a temperature not exceeding that of boiling water i only allude to the empyreumatic oil procured by distillation with a naked fire in a heat superior to the temperature of boiling water which is the only oil declared to be produced by the operation of fire what i have published upon this subject in the memoirs of the academy for 1786 may be consulteda chap xiii of the decomposition of vegetable oxyds by the vinous fermentation the manner in which wine cyder mead and all the liquors formed by the spiritous fermentation are produced is well known to every one the juice of grapes or of apples being expressed and the latter being diluted with water they are put into large vats which are kept in a temperature of at least 10 545 of the thermometer a rapid intestine motion or fermentation very soon takes place numerous globules of gas form in the liquid and burst at the surface when the fermentation is at its height the quantity of gas disengaged is so great as to make the liquor appear as if boiling violently over a fire when this gas is carefully gathered it is found to be carbonic acid perfectly pure and free from admixture with any other species of air or gas whatever when the fermentation is completed the juice of grapes is changed from being sweet and full of sugar into a vinous liquor which no longer contains any sugar and from which we procure by distillation an inflammable liquor known in commerce under the name of spirit of wine as this liquor is produced by the fermentation of any saccharine matter whatever diluted with water it must have been contrary to the principles of our nomenclature to call it spirit of wine rather than spirit of cyder or of fermented sugar wherefore we have adopted a more general term and the arabic word alkohol seems extremely proper for the purpose this operation is one of the most extraordinary in chemistry we must examine whence proceed the disengaged carbonic acid and the inflammable liquor produced and in what manner a sweet vegetable oxyd becomes thus converted into two such opposite substances whereof one is combustible and the other eminently the contrary to solve these two questions it is necessary to be previously acquainted with the analysis of the fermentable substance and of the products of the fermentation we may lay it down as an incontestible axiom that in all the operations of art and nature nothing is created an equal quantity of matter exists both before and after the experiment the quality and quantity of the elements remain precisely the same and nothing takes place beyond changes and modifications in the combination of these elements upon this principle the whole art of performing chemical experiments depends we must always suppose an exact equality between the elements of the body examined and those of the products of its analysis hence since from must of grapes we procure alkohol and carbonic acid i have an undoubted right to suppose that must consists of carbonic acid and alkohol from these premises we have two methods of ascertaining what passes during vinous fermentation by determining the nature of and the elements which compose the fermentable substances or by accurately examining the produces resulting from fermentation and it is evident that the knowledge of either of these must lead to accurate conclusions concerning the nature and composition of the other from these considerations it became necessary accurately to determine the constituent elements of the fermentable substances and for this purpose i did not make use of the compound juices of fruits the rigorous analysis of which is perhaps impossible but made choice of sugar which is easily analysed and the nature of which i have already explained this substance is a true vegetable oxyd with two bases composed of hydrogen and charcoal brought to the state of an oxyd by a certain proportion of oxygen and these three elements are combined in such a way that a very slight force is sufficient to destroy the equilibrium of their connection by a long train of experiments made in various ways and often repeated i ascertained that the proportion in which these ingredients exist in sugar are nearly eight parts of hydrogen 64 parts of oxygen and 28 parts of charcoal all by weight forming 100 parts of sugar sugar must be mixed with about four times its weight of water to render it susceptible of fermentation and even then the equilibrium of its elements would remain undisturbed without the assistance of some substance to give a commencement to the fermentation this is accomplished by means of a little yeast from beer and when the fermentation is once excited it continues of itself until completed i shall in another place give an account of the effects of yeast and other ferments upon fermentable substances i have usually employed 10 libs of yeast in the state of paste for each 100 libs of sugar with as much water as is four times the weight of the sugar i shall

period of the process i judged proper an hour or two after the substances are mixed together especially if they are kept in a temperature of from 15 6575 to 18 725 of the thermometer the first marks of fermentation commence the liquor turns thick and frothy little globules of air are disengaged which rise and burst at the surface the quantity of these globules quickly increases and there is a rapid and abundant production of very pure carbonic acid accompanied with a scum which is the yeast separating from the mixture after some days less or more according to the degree of heat the

of sugar and as for the sake of comparison i reduced the results of the actual experiments to the quintal or imaginary hundred pounds i thought it necessary to leave the fractional parts precisely as produced by calculation when we consider the results presented by these tables with attention it is easy to discover exactly what occurs during fermentation in the first place out of the 100 libs of sugar employed 4 libs 1 oz 4 gros 3 grs remain without having suffered decomposition so that in reality we have only operated upon 95 libs 14 oz 3 gros 69 grs of sugar that is to say upon 61 libs 6 oz 45 grs of oxygen 7 libs 10 oz 6 gros 6 grs of hydrogen and 26 libs 13 oz 5 gros 19 grs of charcoal by comparing these quantities we find that they are fully sufficient for forming the whole of the alkohol carbonic acid and acetous acid produced by the fermentation it is not therefore necessary to suppose that any water has been decomposed during the experiment unless it be pretended that the oxygen and hydrogen exist in the sugar in that state on the contrary i have already made it evident that hydrogen oxygen and charcoal the three constituent elements of vegetables remain in a state of equilibrium or mutual union with each other which subsists so long as this union remains undisturbed by increased temperature or by some new compound attraction and that then only these elements combine two and two together to form water and carbonic acid the effects of the vinous fermentation upon sugar is thus reduced to the mere separation of its elements into two portions one part is oxygenated at the expence of the other so as to form carbonic acid whilst the other part being deoxygenated in favour of the former is converted into the combustible substance alkohol therefore if it were possible to reunite alkohol and carbonic acid together we ought to form sugar it is evident that the charcoal and hydrogen in the alkohol do not exist in the state of oil they are combined with a portion of oxygen which renders them miscible with water wherefore these three substances oxygen hydrogen and charcoal exist here likewise in a species of equilibrium or reciprocal combination and in fact when they are made to pass through a red hot tube of glass or porcelain this union or equilibrium is destroyed the elements become combined two and two and water and carbonic acid are formed i had formally advanced in my first memoirs upon the formation of water that it was decomposed in a great number of chemical experiments and particularly during the vinous fermentation i then supposed that water existed ready formed in sugar though i am now convinced that sugar only contains the elements proper for composing it it may be readily conceived that it must have cost me a good deal to abandon my first notions but by several years reflection and after a great number of experiments and observations upon vegetable substances i have fixed my ideas as above i shall finish what i have to say upon vinous fermentation by observing that it furnishes us with the means of analysing sugar and every vegetable fermentable matter we may consider the substances submitted to fermentation and the products resulting from that operation as forming an algebraic equation and by successively supposing each of the elements in this equation unknown we can calculate their values in succession and thus verify our experiments by calculation and our calculation by experiment reciprocally i have often successfully employed this method for correcting the first results of my experiments and to direct me in the proper road for repeating them to advantage i have explained myself at large upon this subject in a memoir upon vinous fermentation already presented to the academy and which will speedily be published footnotes 26 the above apparatus is described in the third parta chap xiv of the putrefactive fermentation the phenomena of putrefaction are caused like those of vinous fermentation by the operation of very complicated affinities the constituent elements of the bodies submitted to this process cease to continue in equilibrium in the threefold combination and form themselves anew into binary combinations27 or compounds consisting of two elements only but these are entirely different from the results produced by the vinous fermentation instead of one part of the hydrogen remaining united with part of the water and charcoal to form alkohol as in the vinous fermentation the whole of the hydrogen is dissipated during putrefaction in the form of hydrogen gas whilst at the same time the oxygen and charcoal uniting with caloric escape in the form of carbonic acid gas so that when the whole process is finished especially if the materials have been mixed with a sufficient quantity of water nothing remains but the earth of the vegetable mixed with a small portion of charcoal and iron thus putrefaction is nothing more than a complete analysis of vegetable substance during which the whole of the constituent elements is disengaged in form of gas except the earth which remains in the state of mould28 such is the result of putrefaction when the substances submitted to it contain only oxygen hydrogen charcoal and a little earth but this case is rare and these substances putrify imperfectly and with difficulty and require a considerable time to complete their putrefaction it is otherwise with substances containing azote which indeed exists in all animal matters and even in a considerable number of vegetable substances this additional element is remarkably favourable to putrefaction and for this reason animal matter is mixed with vegetable when the putrefaction of these is wished to be hastened the whole art of forming composts and dunghills for the purposes of agriculture consists in the proper application of this admixture the addition of azote to the materials of putrefaction not only accelerates the process that element likewise combines with part of the hydrogen and forms a new substance called volatile alkali or ammoniac the results obtained by analysing animal matters by different processes leave no room for doubt with regard to the constituent elements of ammoniac whenever the azote has been previously separated from these substances no ammoniac is produced and in all cases they furnish ammoniac only in proportion to the azote they contain this composition of ammoniac is likewise fully proved by mr berthollet in the memoirs of the academy for 1785 p 316 where he gives a variety of analytical processes by which ammoniac is decomposed and its two elements azote and hydrogen procured separately i already mentioned in chap x that almost all combustible bodies were capable of combining with each other hydrogen gas possesses this quality in an eminent degree it dissolves charcoal sulphur and phosphorus producing the compounds named carbonated hydrogen gas sulphurated hydrogen gas and phosphorated hydrogen gas the two latter of these gasses have a peculiarly disagreeable flavour the sulphurated hydrogen gas has a strong resemblance to the smell of rotten eggs and the phosphorated smells exactly like putrid fish ammoniac has likewise a peculiar odour not less penetrating or less disagreeable than these other gasses from the mixture of these different flavours proceeds the fetor which accompanies the putrefaction of animal substances sometimes ammoniac predominates which is easily perceived by its sharpness upon the eyes sometimes as in feculent matters the sulphurated gas is most prevalent and sometimes as in putrid herrings the phosphorated hydrogen gas is most abundant i long supposed that nothing could derange or interrupt the course of putrefaction but mr fourcroy and mr thouret have observed some peculiar phenomena in dead bodies buried at a certain depth and preserved to a certain degree from contact with air having found the muscular flesh frequently converted into true animal fat this must have arisen from the disengagement of the azote naturally contained in the animal substance by some unknown cause leaving only the hydrogen and charcoal remaining which are the elements proper for producing fat or oil this observation upon the possibility of converting animal substances into fat may some time or other lead to discoveries of great importance to society the faeces of animals and other excrementitious matters are chiefly composed of charcoal and hydrogen and approach considerably to the nature of oil of which they furnish a considerable quantity by distillation with a naked fire but the intolerable foetor which accompanies all the products of these substances prevents our expecting that at least for a long time they can be rendered useful in any other way than as manures i have only given conjectural approximations in this chapter upon the composition of animal substances which is hitherto but imperfectly understood we know that they are composed of hydrogen charcoal azote phosphorus and sulphur all of which in a state of quintuple combination are brought to the state of oxyd by a larger or smaller quantity of oxygen we are however still unacquainted with the proportions in which these substances are combined and must leave it to time to complete this part of chemical analysis as it has already done with several others footnotes 27 binary combinations are such as consist of two simple elements combined together ternary and quaternary consist of three and four elementse 28 in the third part will be given the description of an apparatus proper for being used in experiments of this kinda chap xv of the acetous fermentation the acetous fermentation is nothing more than the acidification or oxygenation of wine29 produced in the open air by means of the absorption of oxygen the resulting acid is the acetous acid commonly called vinegar which is composed of hydrogen and charcoal united together in proportions not yet ascertained and changed into the acid state by oxygen as vinegar is an acid we might conclude from analogy that it contains oxygen but this is put beyond doubt by direct experiments in the first place we cannot change wine into vinegar without the contact of air containing oxygen secondly this process is accompanied by a diminution of the volume of the air in which it is carried on from the absorption of its oxygen and thirdly wine may be changed into vinegar by any other means of oxygenation independent of the proofs which these facts furnish of the acetous acid being produced by the oxygenation of wine an experiment made by mr chaptal professor of chemistry at montpellier gives us a distinct view of what takes place in this process he impregnated water with about its own bulk of carbonic acid from fermenting beer and placed this water in a cellar in vessels communicating with the air and in a short time the whole was converted into acetous acid the carbonic acid gas procured from beer vats in fermentation is not perfectly pure but contains a small quantity of alkohol in solution wherefore water impregnated with it contains all the materials necessary for forming the acetous acid the alkohol furnishes hydrogen and one portion of charcoal the carbonic acid furnishes oxygen and the rest of the charcoal and the air of the atmosphere furnishes the rest of the oxygen necessary for changing the mixture into acetous acid from this observation it follows that nothing but hydrogen is wanting to convert carbonic acid into acetous acid or more generally that by means of hydrogen and according to the degree of oxygenation carbonic acid may be changed into all the vegetable acids and on the contrary that by depriving any of the vegetable acids of their hydrogen they may be converted into carbonic acid although the principal facts relating to the acetous acid are well known yet numerical exactitude is still wanting till furnished by more exact experiments than any hitherto performed wherefore i shall not enlarge any farther upon the subject it is sufficiently shown by what has been said that the constitution of all the vegetable acids and oxyds is exactly conformable to the formation of vinegar but farther experiments are necessary to teach us the proportion of the constituent elements in all these acids and oxyds we may easily perceive however that this part of chemistry like all the rest of its divisions makes rapid progress towards perfection and that it is already rendered greatly more simple than was formerly believed footnotes 29 the word wine in this chapter is used to signify the liquor produced by the vinous fermentation whatever vegetable substance may have been used for obtaining ite chap xvi of the formation of neutral salts and of their different bases we have just seen that all the oxyds and acids from the animal and vegetable kingdoms are formed by means of a small number of simple elements or at least of such as have not hitherto been susceptible of decomposition by means of combination with oxygen these are azote sulphur phosphorus charcoal hydrogen and the muriatic radical30 we may justly admire the simplicity of the means employed by nature to multiply qualities and forms whether by combining three or four acidifiable bases in different proportions or by altering the dose of oxygen employed for oxydating or acidifying them we shall find the means no less simple and diversified and as abundantly productive of forms and qualities in the order of bodies we are now about to treat of acidifiable substances by combining with oxygen and their consequent conversion into acids acquire great susceptibility of farther combination they become capable of uniting with earthy and metallic bodies by which means neutral salts are formed acids may therefore be considered as true salifying principles and the substances with which they unite to form neutral salts may be called salifiable bases the nature of the union which these two principles form with each other is meant as the subject of the present chapter this view of the acids prevents me from considering them as salts though they are possessed of many of the principal properties of saline bodies as solubility in water c i have already observed that they are the result of a first order of combination being composed of two simple elements or at least of elements which act as if they were simple and we may therefore rank them to use the language of stahl in the order of mixts the neutral salts on the contrary are of a secondary order of combination being formed by the union of two mixts with each other and may therefore be termed compounds hence i shall not arrange the alkalies31 or earths in the class of salts to which i allot only such as are composed of an oxygenated substance united to a base i have already enlarged sufficiently upon the formation of acids in the preceding chapter and shall not add any thing farther upon that subject but having as yet given no account of the salifiable bases which are capable of uniting with them to form neutral salts i mean in this chapter to give an account of the nature and origin of each of these bases these are potash soda ammoniac lime magnesia barytes argill32 and all the metallic bodies 1 of potash we have already shown that when a vegetable substance is submitted to the action of fire in distilling vessels its component elements oxygen hydrogen and charcoal which formed a threefold combination in a state of equilibrium unite two and two in obedience to affinities which act conformable to the degree of heat employed thus at the first application of the fire whenever the heat produced exceeds the temperature of boiling water part of the oxygen and hydrogen unite to form water soon after the rest of the hydrogen and part of the charcoal combine into oil and lastly when the fire is pushed to the red heat the oil and water which had been formed in the early part of the process become again decomposed the oxygen and charcoal unite to form carbonic acid a large quantity of hydrogen gas is set free and nothing but charcoal remains in the retort a great part of these phenomena occur during the combustion of vegetables in the open air but in this case the presence of the air introduces three new substances the oxygen and azote of the air and caloric of which two at least produce considerable changes in the results of the operation in proportion as the hydrogen of the vegetable or that which results from the decomposition of the water is forced out in the form of hydrogen gas by the progress of the fire it is set on fire immediately upon getting in contact with the air water is again formed and the greater part of the caloric of the two gasses becoming free produces flame when all the hydrogen gas is driven out burnt and again reduced to water the remaining charcoal continues to burn but without flame it is formed into carbonic acid which carries off a portion of caloric sufficient to give it the gasseous form the rest of the caloric from the oxygen of the air being set free produces the heat and light observed during the combustion of charcoal the whole vegetable is thus reduced into water and carbonic acid and nothing remains but a small portion of gray earthy matter called ashes being the only really fixed principles which enter into the constitution of vegetables the earth or rather ashes which seldom exceeds a twentieth part of the weight of the vegetable contains a substance of a particular nature known under the name of fixed vegetable alkali or potash to obtain it water is poured upon the ashes which dissolves the potash and leaves the ashes which are insoluble by afterwards evaporating the water we obtain the potash in a white concrete form it is very fixed even in a very high degree of heat i do not mean here to describe the art of preparing potash or the method of procuring it in a state of purity but have entered upon the above detail that i might not use any word not previously explained the potash obtained by this process is always less or more saturated with carbonic acid which is easily accounted for as the potash does not form or at least is not set free but in proportion as the charcoal of the vegetable is converted into carbonic acid by the addition of oxygen either from the air or the water it follows that each particle of potash at the instant of its formation or at least of its liberation is in contact with a particle of carbonic acid and as there is a considerable affinity between these two substances they naturally combine together although the carbonic acid has less affinity with potash than any other acid yet it is difficult to separate the last portions from it the most usual method of accomplishing this is to dissolve the potash in water to this solution add two or three times its weight of quicklime then filtrate the liquor and evaporate it in close vessels the saline substance left by the evaporation is potash almost entirely deprived of carbonic acid in this state it is soluble in an equal weight of water and even attracts the moisture of the air with great avidity by this property it furnishes us with an excellent means of rendering air or gas dry by exposing them to its action in this state it is soluble in alkohol though not when combined with carbonic acid and mr berthollet employs this property as a method of procuring potash in the state of perfect purity all vegetables yield less or more of potash in consequence of combustion but it is furnished in various degrees of purity by different vegetables usually indeed from all of them it is mixed with different salts from which it is easily separable we can hardly entertain a doubt that the ashes or earth which is left by vegetables in combustion preexisted in them before they were burnt forming what may be called the skeleton or osseous part of the vegetable but it is quite otherwise with potash this substance has never yet been procured from vegetables but by means of processes or intermedia capable of furnishing oxygen and azote such as combustion or by means of nitric acid so that it is not yet demonstrated that potash may not be a produce from these operations i have begun a series of experiments upon this object and hope soon to be able to give an account of their results 2 of soda soda like potash is an alkali procured by lixiviation from the ashes of burnt plants but only from those which grow upon the seaside and especially from the herb kali whence is derived the name alkali given to this substance by the arabians it has some properties in common with potash and others which are entirely different in general these two substances have peculiar characters in their saline combinations which are proper to each and consequently distinguish them from each other thus soda which as obtained from marine plants is usually entirely saturated with carbonic acid does not attract the humidity of the atmosphere like potash but on the contrary desiccates its cristals effloresce and are converted into a white powder having all the properties of soda which it really is having only lost its water of cristallization hitherto we are not better acquainted with the constituent elements of soda than with those of potash being equally uncertain whether it previously existed ready formed in the vegetable or is a combination of elements effected by combustion analogy leads us to suspect that azote is a constituent element of all the alkalies as is the case with ammoniac but we have only slight presumptions unconfirmed by any decisive experiments respecting the composition of potash and soda 3 of ammoniac we have however very accurate knowledge of the composition of ammoniac or volatile alkali as it is called by the old chemists mr berthollet in the memoirs of the academy for 1784 p 316 has proved by analysis that 1000 parts of this substance consist of about 807 parts of azote combined with 193 parts of hydrogen ammoniac is chiefly procurable from animal substances by distillation during which process the azote and hydrogen necessary to its formation unite in proper proportions it is not however procured pure by this process being mixed with oil and water and mostly saturated with carbonic acid to separate these substances it is first combined with an acid the muriatic for instance and then disengaged from that combination by the addition of lime or potash when ammoniac is thus produced in its greatest degree of purity it can only exist under the gasseous form at least in the usual temperature of the atmosphere it has an excessively penetrating smell is absorbed in large quantities by water especially if cold and assisted by compression water thus saturated with ammoniac has usually been termed volatile alkaline fluor we shall call it either simply ammoniac or liquid ammoniac and ammoniacal gas when it exists in the ariform state 4 of lime magnesia barytes and argill the composition of these four earths is totally unknown and until by new discoveries their constituent elements are ascertained we are certainly authorised to consider them as simple bodies art has no share in the production of these earths as they are all procured ready formed from nature but as they have all especially the three first great tendency to combination they are never found pure lime is usually saturated with carbonic acid in the state of chalk calcarious spars most of the marbles c sometimes with sulphuric acid as in gypsum and plaster stones at other times with fluoric acid forming vitreous or fluor spars and lastly it is found in the waters of the sea and of saline springs combined with muriatic acid of all the salifiable bases it is the most universally spread through nature magnesia is found in mineral waters for the most part combined with sulphuric acid it is likewise abundant in seawater united with muriatic acid and it exists in a great number of stones of different kinds barytes is much less common than the three preceding earths it is found in the mineral kingdom combined with sulphuric acid forming heavy spars and sometimes though rarely united to carbonic acid argill or the base of alum having less tendency to combination than the other earths is often found in the state of argill uncombined with any acid it is chiefly procurable from clays of which properly speaking it is the base or chief ingredient 5 of metallic bodies the metals except gold and sometimes silver are rarely found in the mineral kingdom in their metallic state being usually less or more saturated with oxygen or combined with sulphur arsenic sulphuric acid muriatic acid carbonic acid or phosphoric acid metallurgy or the docimastic art teaches the means of separating them from these foreign matters and for this purpose we refer to such chemical books as treat upon these operations we are probably only acquainted as yet with a part of the metallic substances existing in nature as all those which have a stronger affinity to oxygen than charcoal possesses are incapable of being reduced to the metallic state and consequently being only presented to our observation under the form of oxyds are confounded with earths it is extremely probable that barytes which we have just now arranged with earths is in this situation for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies it is even possible that all the substances we call earths may be only metallic oxyds irreducible by any hitherto known process those metallic bodies we are at present acquainted with and which we can reduce to the metallic or reguline state are the following seventeen 1 arsenic 2 molybdena 3 tungstein 4 manganese 5 nickel 6 cobalt 7 bismuth 8 antimony 9 zinc 10 iron 11 tin 12 lead 13 copper 14 mercury 15 silver 16 platina 17 gold i only mean to consider these as salifiable bases without entering at all upon the consideration of their properties in the arts and for the uses of society in these points of view each metal would require a complete treatise which would lead me far beyond the bounds i have prescribed for this work footnotes 30 i have not ventured to omit this element as here enumerated with the other principles of animal and vegetable substances though it is not at all taken notice of in the preceding chapters as entering into the composition of these bodiese 31 perhaps my thus rejecting the alkalies from the class of salts may be considered as a capital defect in the method i have adopted and i am ready to admit the charge but this inconvenience is compensated by so many advantages that i could not think it of sufficient consequence to make me alter my plana 32 called alumine by mr lavoisier but as argill has been in a manner naturalized to the language for this substance by mr kirwan i have ventured to use it in preferencee chap xvii continuation of the observations upon salifiable bases and the formation of neutral salts it is necessary to remark that earths and alkalies unite with acids to form neutral salts without the intervention of any medium whereas metallic substances are incapable of forming this combination without being previously less or more oxygenated strictly speaking therefore metals are not soluble in acids but only metallic oxyds hence when we put a metal into an acid for solution it is necessary in the first place that it become oxygenated either by attracting oxygen from the acid or from the water or in other words that a metal cannot be dissolved in an acid unless the oxygen either of the acid or of the water mixed with it has a stronger affinity to the metal than to the hydrogen or the acidifiable base or what amounts to the same thing that no metallic solution can take place without a previous decomposition of the water or the acid in which it is made the explanation of the principal phenomena of metallic solution depends entirely upon this simple observation which was overlooked even by the illustrious bergman the first and most striking of these is the effervescence or to speak less equivocally the disengagement of gas which takes place during the solution in the solutions made in nitric acid this effervescence is produced by the disengagement of nitrous gas in solutions with sulphuric acid it is either sulphurous acid gas or hydrogen gas according as the oxydation of the metal happens to be made at the expence of the sulphuric acid or of the water as both nitric acid and water are composed of elements which when separate can only exist in the gasseous form at least in the common temperature of the atmosphere it is evident that whenever either of these is deprived of its oxygen the remaining element must instantly expand and assume the state of gas the effervescence is occasioned by this sudden conversion from the liquid to the gasseous state the same decomposition and consequent formation of gas takes place when solutions of metals are made in sulphuric acid in general especially by the humid way metals do not attract all the oxygen it contains they therefore reduce it not into sulphur but into sulphurous acid and as this acid can only exist as gas in the usual temperature it is disengaged and occasions effervescence the second phenomenon is that when the metals have been previously oxydated they all dissolve in acids without effervescence this is easily explained because not having now any occasion for combining with oxygen they neither decompose the acid nor the water by which in the former case the effervescence is occasioned a third phenomenon which requires particular consideration is that none of the metals produce effervescence by solution in oxygenated muriatic acid during this process the metal in the first place carries off the excess of oxygen from the oxygenated muriatic acid by which it becomes oxydated and reduces the acid to the state of ordinary muriatic acid in this case there is no production of gas not that the muriatic acid does not tend to exist in the gasseous state in the common temperature which it does equally with the acids formerly mentioned but because this acid which otherwise would expand into gas finds more water combined with the oxygenated muriatic acid than is necessary to retain it in the liquid form hence it does not disengage like the sulphurous acid but remains and quietly dissolves and combines with the metallic oxyd previously formed from its superabundant oxygen the fourth phenomenon is that metals are absolutely insoluble in such acids as have their bases joined to oxygen by a stronger affinity than these metals are capable of exerting upon that acidifying principle hence silver mercury and lead in their metallic states are insoluble in muriatic acid but when previously oxydated they become readily soluble without effervescence from these phenomena it appears that oxygen is the bond of union between metals and acids and from this we are led to suppose that oxygen is contained in all substances which have a strong affinity with acids hence it is very probable the four eminently salifiable earths contain oxygen and their capability of uniting with acids is produced by the intermediation of that element what i have formerly noticed relative to these earths is considerably strengthened by the above considerations viz that they may very possibly be metallic oxyds with which oxygen has a stronger affinity than with charcoal and consequently not reducible by any known means all the acids hitherto known are enumerated in the following table the first column of which contains the names of the acids according to the new nomenclature and in the second column are placed the bases or radicals of these acids with observations names of the acids names of the bases with observations 1 sulphurous sulphur 2 sulphuric 3 phosphorous phosphorus 4 phosphoric 5 muriatic muriatic radical or base hitherto unknown 6 oxygenated muriatic 7 nitrous 8 nitric azote 9 oxygenated nitric 10 carbonic charcoal the bases or radicals of all these acids 11 acetous seem to be formed by a combination 12 acetic of charcoal and hydrogen 13 oxalic and the only difference seems to be 14 tartarous owing to the different proportions in 15 pyrotartarous which these elements combine to form 16 citric their bases and to the different doses 17 malic of oxygen in their acidification a 18 pyrolignous connected series of accurate experiments 19 pyromucous is still wanted upon this subject 20 gallic our knowledge of the bases of 21 prussic these acids is hitherto imperfect we 22 benzoic only know that they contain hydrogen 23 succinic and charcoal as principal elements 24 camphoric and that the prussic acid contains 25 lactic azote 26 saccholactic 27 bombic the base of these and all acids 28 formic procured from animal substances seems 29 sebacic to consist of charcoal hydrogen phosphorous and azote 30 boracic the bases of these two are hitherto 31 fluoric entirely unknown 32 antimonic antimony 33 argentic silver 34 arseniaca arsenic 35 bismuthic bismuth 36 cobaltic cobalt 37 cupric copper 38 stannic tin 39 ferric iron 40 manganic manganese 41 mercuricb mercury 42 molybdic molybdena 43 nickolic nickel 44 auric gold 45 platinic platina 46 plumbic lead 47 tungstic tungstein 48 zincic zinc note a this term swerves a little from the rule in making the name of this acid terminate in ac instead of ic the base and acid are distinguished in french by arsenic and arsenique but having chosen the english termination ic to translate the french ique i was obliged to use this small deviatione note b mr lavoisier has hydrargirique but mercurius being used for the base or metal the name of the acid as above is equally regular and less harshe in this list which contains 48 acids i have enumerated 17 metallic acids hitherto very imperfectly known but upon which mr berthollet is about to publish a very important work it cannot be pretended that all the acids which exist in nature or rather all the acidifiable bases are yet discovered but on the other hand there are considerable grounds for supposing that a more accurate investigation than has hitherto been attempted will diminish the number of the vegetable acids by showing that several of these at present considered as distinct acids are only modifications of others all that can be done in the present state of our knowledge is to give a view of chemistry as it really is and to establish fundamental principles by which such bodies as may be discovered in future may receive names in conformity with one uniform system the known salifiable bases or substances capable of being converted into neutral salts by union with acids amount to 24 viz 3 alkalies 4 earths and 17 metallic substances so that in the present state of chemical knowledge the whole possible number of neutral salts amounts to 115233 this number is upon the supposition that the metallic acids are capable of dissolving other metals which is a new branch of chemistry not hitherto investigated upon which depends all the metallic combinations named vitreous there is reason to believe that many of these supposable saline combinations are not capable of being formed which must greatly reduce the real number of neutral salts producible by nature and art even if we suppose the real number to amount only to five or six hundred species of possible neutral salts it is evident that were we to distinguish them after the manner of the ancients either by the names of their first discoverers or by terms derived from the substances from which they are procured we should at last have such a confusion of arbitrary designations as no memory could possibly retain this method might be tolerable in the early ages of chemistry or even till within these twenty years when only about thirty species of salts were known but in the present times when the number is augmenting daily when every new acid gives us 24 or 48 new salts according as it is capable of one or two degrees of oxygenation a new method is certainly necessary the method we have adopted drawn from the nomenclature of the acids is perfectly analogical and following nature in the simplicity of her operations gives a natural and easy nomenclature applicable to every possible neutral salt in giving names to the different acids we express the common property by the generical term acid and distinguish each species by the name of its peculiar acidifiable base hence the acids formed by the oxygenation of sulphur phosphorus charcoal c are called sulphuric acid phosphoric acid carbonic acid c we thought it likewise proper to indicate the different degrees of saturation with oxygen by different terminations of the same specific names hence we distinguish between sulphurous and sulphuric and between phosphorous and phosphoric acids c by applying these principles to the nomenclature of neutral salts we give a common term to all the neutral salts arising from the combination of one acid and distinguish the species by adding the name of the salifiable base thus all the neutral salts having sulphuric acid in their composition are named sulphats those formed by the phosphoric acid phosphats c the species being distinguished by the names of the salifiable bases gives us sulphat of potash sulphat of soda sulphat of ammoniac sulphat of lime sulphat of iron c as we are acquainted with 24 salifiable bases alkaline earthy and metallic we have consequently 24 sulphats as many phosphats and so on through all the acids sulphur is however susceptible of two degrees of oxygenation the first of which produces sulphurous and the second sulphuric acid and as the neutral salts produced by these two acids have different properties and are in fact different salts it becomes necessary to distinguish these by peculiar terminations we have therefore distinguished the neutral salts formed by the acids in the first or lesser degree of oxygenation by changing the termination at into ite as sulphites phosphites34 c thus oxygenated or acidified sulphur in its two degrees of oxygenation is capable of forming 48 neutral salts 24 of which are sulphites and as many sulphats which is likewise the case with all the acids capable of two degrees of oxygenation35 it were both tiresome and unnecessary to follow these denominations through all the varieties of their possible application it is enough to have given the method of naming the various salts which when once well understood is easily applied to every possible combination the name of the combustible and acidifiable body being once known the names of the acid it is capable of forming and of all the neutral combinations the acid is susceptible of entering into are most readily remembered such as require a more complete illustration of the methods in which the new nomenclature is applied will in the second part of this book find tables which contain a full enumeration of all the neutral salts and in general all the possible chemical combinations so far as is consistent with the present state of our knowledge to these i shall subjoin short explanations containing the best and most simple means of procuring the different species of acids and some account of the general properties of the neutral salts they produce i shall not deny that to render this work more complete it would have been necessary to add particular observations upon each species of salt its solubility in water and alkohol the proportions of acid and of salifiable base in its composition the quantity of its water of cristallization the different degrees of saturation it is susceptible of and finally the degree of force or affinity with which the acid adheres to the base this immense work has been already begun by messrs bergman morveau kirwan and other celebrated chemists but is hitherto only in a moderate state of advancement even the principles upon which it is founded are not perhaps sufficiently accurate these numerous details would have swelled this elementary treatise to much too great a size besides that to have gathered the necessary materials and to have completed all the series of experiments requisite must have retarded the publication of this book for many years this is a vast field for employing the zeal and abilities of young chemists whom i would advise to endeavour rather to do well than to do much and to ascertain in the first place the composition of the acids before entering upon that of the neutral salts every edifice which is intended to resist the ravages of time should be built upon a sure foundation and in the present state of chemistry to attempt discoveries by experiments either not perfectly exact or not sufficiently rigorous will serve only to interrupt its progress instead of contributing to its advancement footnotes 33 this number excludes all triple salts or such as contain more than one salifiable base all the salts whose bases are over or under saturated with acid and those formed by the nitromuriatic acide 34 as all the specific names of the acids in the new nomenclature are adjectives they would have applied severally to the various salifiable bases without the invention of other terms with perfect distinctness thus sulphurous potash and sulphuric potash are equally distinct as sulphite of potash and sulphat of potash and have the advantage of being more easily retained in the memory because more naturally arising from the acids themselves than the arbitrary terminations adopted by mr lavoisiere 35 there is yet a third degree of oxygenation of acids as the oxygenated muriatic and oxygenated nitric acids the terms applicable to the neutral salts resulting from the union of these acids with salifiable bases is supplied by the author in the second part of this work these are formed by prefixing the word oxygenated to the name of the salt produced by the second degree of oxygenation thus oxygenated muriat of potash oxygenated nitrat of soda ce part ii of the combination of acids with salifiable bases and of the formation of neutral salts introduction if i had strictly followed the plan i at first laid down for the conduct of this work i would have confined myself in the tables and accompanying observations which compose this second part to short definitions of the several known acids and abridged accounts of the processes by which they are obtainable with a mere nomenclature or enumeration of the neutral salts which result from the combination of these acids with the various salifiable bases but i afterwards found that the addition of similar tables of all the simple substances which enter into the composition of the acids and oxyds together with the various possible combinations of these elements would add greatly to the utility of this work without being any great increase to its size these additions which are all contained in the twelve first sections of this part and the tables annexed to these form a kind of recapitulation of the first fifteen chapters of the first part the rest of the tables and sections contain all the saline combinations it must be very apparent that in this part of the work i have borrowed greatly from what has been already published by mr de morveau in the first volume of the encyclopedie par ordre des matires i could hardly have discovered a better source of information especially when the difficulty of consulting books in foreign languages is considered i make this general acknowledgment on purpose to save the trouble of references to mr de morveaus work in the course of the following part of mine table of simple substances simple substances belonging to all the kingdoms of nature which may be considered as the elements of bodies new

salt calcined or caustic magnesia barytes barytes or heavy earth argill clay earth of alum silex siliceous or vitrifiable earth sect iobservations upon the table of simple substances the principle object of chemical experiments is to decompose natural bodies so as separately to examine the different substances which enter into their composition by consulting chemical systems it will be found that this science of chemical analysis has made rapid progress in our own times formerly oil and salt were considered as elements of bodies whereas later observation and experiment have shown that all salts instead of being simple are composed of an acid united to a base the bounds of analysis have been greatly enlarged by modern discoveries36 the acids are shown to be composed of oxygen as an acidifying principle common to all united in each to a particular base i have proved what mr haffenfratz had before advanced that these radicals of the acids are not all simple elements many of them being like the oily principle composed of hydrogen and charcoal even the bases of neutral salts have been proved by mr berthollet to be compounds as he has shown that ammoniac is composed of azote and hydrogen thus as chemistry advances towards perfection by dividing and subdividing it is impossible to say where it is to end and these things we at present suppose simple may soon be found quite otherwise all we dare venture to affirm of any substance is that it must be considered as simple in the present state of our knowledge and so far as chemical analysis has hitherto been able to show we may even presume that the earths must soon cease to be considered as simple bodies they are the only bodies of the salifiable class which have no tendency to unite with oxygen and i am much inclined to believe that this proceeds from their being already saturated with that element if so they will fall to be considered as compounds consisting of simple substances perhaps metallic oxydated to a certain degree this is only hazarded as a conjecture and i trust the reader will take care not to confound what i have related as truths fixed on the firm basis of observation and experiment with mere hypothetical conjectures the fixed alkalies potash and soda are omitted in the foregoing table because they are evidently compound substances though we are ignorant as yet what are the elements they are composed of table of compound oxydable and acidifiable bases names of the radicals oxydable or acidifiable nitromuriatic radical or base from the mineral base of the acid formerly kingdom called aqua regia tartarous radical or base malic citric pyrolignous oxydable or acidifiable pyromucous hydrocarbonous or pyrotartarous carbonohydrous radicals oxalic from the vegetable acetous kingdom succinic radicals benzoic camphoric gallic oxydable or acidifiable lactic radicals from the animal saccholactic kingdom which formic mostly contain azote bombic and frequently phosphorus sebacic lithic prussic notethe radicals from the vegetable kingdom are converted by a first degree of oxygenation into vegetable oxyds such as sugar starch and gum or mucus those of the animal kingdom by the same means form animal oxyds as lymph ca sect iiobservations upon the table of compound radicals the older chemists being unacquainted with the composition of acids and not suspecting them to be formed by a peculiar radical or base for each united to an acidifying principle or element common to all could not consequently give any name to substances of which they had not the most distant idea we had therefore to invent a new nomenclature for this subject though we were at the same time sensible that this nomenclature must be susceptible of great modification when the nature of the compound radicals shall be better understood37 the compound oxydable and acidifiable radicals from the vegetable and animal kingdoms enumerated in the foregoing table are not hitherto reducible to systematic nomenclature because their exact analysis is as yet unknown we only know in general by some experiments of my own and some made by mr hassenfratz that most of the vegetable acids such as the tartarous oxalic citric malic acetous pyrotartarous and pyromucous have radicals composed of hydrogen and charcoal combined in such a way as to form single bases and that these acids only differ from each other by the proportions in which these two substances enter into the composition of their bases and by the degree of oxygenation which these bases have received we know farther chiefly from the experiments of mr berthollet that the radicals from the animal kingdom and even some of those from vegetables are of a more compound nature and besides hydrogen and charcoal that they often contain azote and sometimes phosphorus but we are not hitherto possessed of sufficiently accurate experiments for calculating the proportions of these several substances we are therefore forced in the manner of the older chemists still to name these acids after the substances from which they are procured there can be little doubt that these names will be laid aside when our knowledge of these substances becomes more accurate and extensive the terms hydrocarbonous hydrocarbonic carbonohydrous and carbono hydric38 will then become substituted for those we now employ which will then only remain as testimonies of the imperfect state in which this part of chemistry was transmitted to us by our predecessors it is evident that the oils being composed of hydrogen and charcoal combined are true carbonohydrous or hydrocarbonous radicals and indeed by adding oxygen they are convertible into vegetable oxyds and acids according to their degrees of oxygenation we cannot however affirm that oils enter in their entire state into the composition of vegetable oxyds and acids it is possible that they previously lose a part either of their hydrogen or charcoal and that the remaining ingredients no longer exist in the proportions necessary to constitute oils we still require farther experiments to elucidate these points properly speaking we are only acquainted with one compound radical from the mineral kingdom the nitromuriatic which is formed by the combination of azote with the muriatic radical the other compound mineral acids have been much less attended to from their producing less striking phenomena sect iiiobservations upon the combinations of light and caloric with different substances i have not constructed any table of the combinations of light and caloric with the various simple and compound substances because our conceptions of the nature of these combinations are not hitherto sufficiently accurate we know in general that all bodies in nature are imbued surrounded and penetrated in every way with caloric which fills up every interval left between their particles that in certain cases caloric becomes fixed in bodies so as to constitute a part even of their solid substance though it more frequently acts upon them with a repulsive force from which or from its accumulation in bodies to a greater or lesser degree the transformation of solids into fluids and of fluids to ariform elasticity is entirely owing we have employed the generic name gas to indicate this ariform state of bodies produced by a sufficient accumulation of caloric so that when we wish to express the ariform state of muriatic acid carbonic acid hydrogen water alkohol c we do it by adding the word gas to their names thus muriatic acid gas carbonic acid gas hydrogen gas aqueous gas alkoholic gas c the combinations of light and its mode of acting upon different bodies is still less known by the experiments of mr berthollet it appears to have great affinity with oxygen is susceptible of combining with it and contributes alongst with caloric to change it into the state of gas experiments upon vegetation give reason to believe that light combines with certain parts of vegetables and that the green of their leaves and the various colours of their flowers is chiefly owing to this combination this much is certain that plants which grow in darkness are perfectly white languid and unhealthy and that to make them recover vigour and to acquire their natural colours the direct influence of light is absolutely necessary somewhat similar takes place even upon animals mankind degenerate to a certain degree when employed in sedentary manufactures or from living in crowded houses or in the narrow lanes of large cities whereas they improve in their nature and constitution in most of the country labours which are carried on in the open air organization sensation spontaneous motion and all the operations of life only exist at the surface of the earth and in places exposed to the influence of light without it nature itself would be lifeless and inanimate by means of light the benevolence of the deity hath filled the surface of the earth with organization sensation and intelligence the fable of promotheus might perhaps be considered as giving a hint of this philosophical truth which had even presented itself to the knowledge of the ancients i have intentionally avoided any disquisitions relative to organized bodies in this work for which reason the phenomena of respiration sanguification and animal heat are not considered but i hope at some future time to be able to elucidate these curious subjects trancribers note the following table is presented in four sections to comply with 75 character line limitation table of the binary

simple substances oxygen forms almost a third of the mass of our atmosphere and is consequently one of the most plentiful substances in nature all the animals and vegetables live and grow in this immense magazine of oxygen gas and from it we procure the greatest part of what we employ in experiments so great is the reciprocal affinity between this element and other substances that we cannot procure it disengaged from all combination in the atmosphere it is united with caloric in the state of oxygen gas and this again is mixed with about two thirds of its weight of azotic gas several conditions are requisite to enable a body to become oxygenated or to permit oxygen to enter into combination with it in the first place it is necessary that the particles of the body to be oxygenated shall have less reciprocal attraction with each other than they have for the oxygen which otherwise cannot possibly combine with them nature in this case may be assisted by art as we have it in our power to diminish the attraction of the particles of bodies almost at will by heating them or in other words by introducing caloric into the interstices between their particles and as the attraction of these particles for each other is diminished in the inverse ratio of their distance it is evident that there must be a certain point of distance of particles when the affinity they possess with each other becomes less than that they have for oxygen and at which oxygenation must necessarily take place if oxygen be present we can readily conceive that the degree of heat at which this phenomenon begins must be different in different bodies hence on purpose to oxygenate most bodies especially the greater part of the simple substances it is only necessary to expose them to the influence of the air of the atmosphere in a convenient degree of temperature with respect to lead mercury and tin this needs be but little higher than the medium temperature of the earth but it requires a more considerable degree of heat to oxygenate iron copper c by the dry way or when this operation is not assisted by moisture sometimes oxygenation takes place with great rapidity and is accompanied by great sensible heat light and flame such is the combustion of phosphorus in atmospheric air and of iron in oxygen gas that of sulphur is less rapid and the oxygenation of lead tin and most of the metals takes place vastly slower and consequently the disengagement of caloric and more especially of light is hardly sensible some substances have so strong an affinity with oxygen and combine with it in such low degrees of temperature that we cannot procure them in their unoxygenated state such is the muriatic acid which has not hitherto been decomposed by art perhaps even not by nature and which consequently has only been found in the state of acid it is probable that many other substances of the mineral kingdom are necessarily oxygenated in the common temperature of the atmosphere and that being already saturated with oxygen prevents their farther action upon that element there are other means of oxygenating simple substances besides exposure to air in a certain degree of temperature such as by placing them in contact with metals combined with oxygen and which have little affinity with that element the red oxyd of mercury is one of the best substances for this purpose especially with bodies which do not combine with that metal in this oxyd the oxygen is united with very little force to the metal and can be driven out by a degree of heat only sufficient to make glass red hot wherefore such bodies as are capable of uniting with oxygen are readily oxygenated by means of being mixed with red oxyd of mercury and moderately heated the same effect may be to a certain degree produced by means of the black oxyd of manganese the red oxyd of lead the oxyds of silver and by most of the metallic oxyds if we only take care to choose such as have less affinity with oxygen than the bodies they are meant to oxygenate all the metallic reductions and revivifications belong to this class of operations being nothing more than oxygenations of charcoal by means of the several metallic oxyds the charcoal combines with the oxygen and with caloric and escapes in form of carbonic acid gas while the metal remains pure and revivified or deprived of the oxygen which before combined with it in the form of oxyd all combustible substances may likewise be oxygenated by means of mixing them with nitrat of potash or of soda or with oxygenated muriat of potash and subjecting the mixture to a certain degree of heat the oxygen in this case quits the nitrat or the muriat and combines with the combustible body this species of oxygenation requires to be performed with extreme caution and only with very small quantities because as the oxygen enters into the composition of nitrats and more especially of oxygenated muriats combined with almost as much caloric as is necessary for converting it into oxygen gas this immense quantity of caloric becomes suddenly free the instant of the combination of the oxygen with the combustible body and produces such violent explosions as are perfectly irresistible by the humid way we can oxygenate most combustible bodies and convert most of the oxyds of the three kingdoms of nature into acids for this purpose we chiefly employ the nitric acid which has a very slight hold of oxygen and quits it readily to a great number of bodies by the assistance of a gentle heat the oxygenated muriatic acid may be used for several operations of this kind but not in them all i give the name of binary to the combinations of oxygen with the simple substances because in these only two elements are combined when three substances are united in one combination i call it ternary and quaternary when the combination consists of four substances united table of the combinations of oxygen with the compound radicals

p 671 and 1778 p 535 in which i concluded that the number of acids must be greatly larger than was till then supposed since that time a new field of inquiry has been opened to chemists and instead of five or six acids which were then known near thirty new acids have been discovered by which means the number of known neutral salts have been increased in the same proportion the nature of the acidifiable bases or radicals of the acids and the degrees of oxygenation they are susceptible of still remain to be inquired into i have already shown that almost all the oxydable and acidifiable radicals from the mineral kingdom are simple and that on the contrary there hardly exists any radical in the vegetable and more especially in the animal kingdom but is composed of at least two substances hydrogen and charcoal and that azote and phosphorus are frequently united to these by which we have compound radicals of two three and four bases or simple elements united from these observations it appears that the vegetable and animal oxyds and acids may differ from each other in three several ways 1st according to the number of simple acidifiable elements of which their radicals are composed 2dly according to the proportions in which these are combined together and 3dly according to their different degrees of oxygenation which circumstances are more than sufficient to explain the great variety which nature produces in these substances it is not at all surprising after this that most of the vegetable acids are convertible into each other nothing more being requisite than to change the proportions of the hydrogen and charcoal in their composition and to oxygenate them in a greater or lesser degree this has been done by mr crell in some very ingenious experiments which have been verified and extended by mr hassenfratz from these it appears that charcoal and hydrogen by a first oxygenation produce tartarous acid oxalic acid by a second degree and acetous or acetic acid by a third or higher oxygenation only that charcoal seems to exist in a rather smaller proportion in the acetous and acetic acids the citric and malic acids differ little from the preceding acids ought we then to conclude that the oils are the radicals of the vegetable and animal acids i have already expressed my doubts upon this subject 1st although the oils appear to be formed of nothing but hydrogen and charcoal we do not know if these are in the precise proportion necessary for constituting the radicals of the acids 2dly since oxygen enters into the composition of these acids equally with hydrogen and charcoal there is no more reason for supposing them to be composed of oil rather than of water or of carbonic acid it is true that they contain the materials necessary for all these combinations but then these do not take place in the common temperature of the atmosphere all the three elements remain combined in a state of equilibrium which is readily destroyed by a temperature only a little above that of boiling water39 table of the binary combinations of azote with the simple substances simple substances results of the combinations new

the most abundant elements combined with caloric it forms azotic gas or mephitis which composes nearly two thirds of the atmosphere this element is always in the state of gas in the ordinary pressure and temperature and no degree of compression or of cold has been hitherto capable of reducing it either to a solid or liquid form this is likewise one of the essential constituent elements of animal bodies in which it is combined with charcoal and hydrogen and sometimes with phosphorus these are united together by a certain portion of oxygen by which they are formed into oxyds or acids according to the degree of oxygenation hence the animal substances may be varied in the same way with vegetables in three different manners 1st according to the number of elements which enter into the composition of the base or radical 2dly according to the proportions of these elements 3dly according to the degree of oxygenation when combined with oxygen azote forms the nitrous and nitric oxyds and acids when with hydrogen ammoniac is produced its combinations with the other simple elements are very little known to these we give the name of azurets preserving the termination in uret for all nonoxygenated compounds it is extremely probable that all the alkaline substances may hereafter be found to belong to this genus of azurets the azotic gas may be procured from atmospheric air by absorbing the oxygen gas which is mixed with it by means of a solution of sulphuret of potash or sulphuret of lime it requires twelve or fifteen days to complete this process during which time the surface in contact must be frequently renewed by agitation and by breaking the pellicle which forms on the top of the solution it may likewise be procured by dissolving animal substances in dilute nitric acid very little heated in this operation the azote is disengaged in form of gas which we receive under bell glasses filled with water in the pneumatochemical apparatus we may procure this gas by deflagrating nitre with charcoal or any other combustible substance when with charcoal the azotic gas is mixed with carbonic acid gas which may be absorbed by a solution of caustic alkali or by lime water after which the azotic gas remains pure we can procure it in a fourth manner from combinations of ammoniac with metallic oxyds as pointed out by mr de fourcroy the hydrogen of the ammoniac combines with the oxygen of the oxyd and forms water whilst the azote being left free escapes in form of gas the combinations of azote were but lately discovered mr cavendish first observed it in nitrous gas and acid and mr berthollet in ammoniac and the prussic acid as no evidence of its decomposition has hitherto appeared we are fully entitled to consider azote as a simple elementary

vegetable and animal oxyds and acids when it takes place in the state of gas it forms carbonated hydrogen gasa note c none of these combinations are known and it is probable that they cannot exist at least in the usual temperature of the atmosphere owing to the great affinity of hydrogen for calorica sect viiobservations upon hydrogen and its combinations with simple substances hydrogen as its name expresses is one of the constituent elements of water of which it forms fifteen hundredth parts by weight combined with eightyfive hundredth parts of oxygen this substance the properties and even existence of which was unknown till lately is very plentifully distributed in nature and acts a very considerable part in the processes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms as it possesses so great affinity with caloric as only to exist in the state of gas it is consequently impossible to procure it in the concrete or liquid state independent of combination to procure hydrogen or rather hydrogen gas we have only to subject water to the action of a substance with which oxygen has greater affinity than it has to hydrogen by this means the hydrogen is set free and by uniting with caloric assumes the form of hydrogen gas red hot iron is usually employed for this purpose the iron during the process becomes oxydated and is changed into a substance resembling the iron ore from the island of elba in this state of oxyd it is much less attractible by the magnet and dissolves in acids without effervescence charcoal in a red heat has the same power of decomposing water by attracting the oxygen from its combination with hydrogen in this process carbonic acid gas is formed and mixes with the hydrogen gas but is easily separated by means of water or alkalies which absorb the carbonic acid and leave the hydrogen gas pure we may likewise obtain hydrogen gas by dissolving iron or zinc in dilute sulphuric acid these two metals decompose water very slowly and with great difficulty when alone but do it with great ease and rapidity when assisted by sulphuric acid the hydrogen unites with caloric during the process and is disengaged in form of hydrogen gas while the oxygen of the water unites with the metal in the form of oxyd which is immediately dissolved in the acid forming a sulphat of iron or of zinc some very distinguished chemists consider hydrogen as the phlogiston of stahl and as that celebrated chemist admitted the existence of phlogiston in sulphur charcoal metals c they are of course obliged to suppose that hydrogen exists in all these substances though they cannot prove their supposition even if they could it would not avail much since this disengagement of hydrogen is quite insufficient to explain the phenomena of calcination and combustion we must always recur to the examination of this question are the heat and light which are disengaged during the different species of combustion furnished by the burning body or by the oxygen which combines in all these operations and certainly the supposition of hydrogen being disengaged throws no light whatever upon this question besides it belongs to those who make suppositions to prove them and doubtless a doctrine which without any supposition explains the phenomena as well and as naturally as theirs does by supposition has at least the advantage of greater simplicity40 table of the binary combinations

combinations phosphorus is a simple combustible substance which was unknown to chemists till 1667 when it was discovered by brandt who kept the process secret soon after kunkel found out brandts method of preparation and made it public it has been ever since known by the name of kunkels phosphorus it was for a long time procured only from urine and though homberg gave an account of the process in the memoirs of the academy for 1692 all the philosophers of europe were supplied with it from england it was first made in france in 1737 before a committee of the academy at the royal garden at present it is procured in a more commodious and more oeconomical manner from animal bones which are real calcareous phosphats according to the process of messrs gahn scheele rouelle c the bones of adult animals being calcined to whiteness are pounded and passed through a fine silk sieve pour upon the fine powder a quantity of dilute sulphuric acid less than is sufficient for dissolving the whole this acid unites with the calcareous earth of the bones into a sulphat of lime and the phosphoric acid remains free in the liquor the liquid is decanted off and the residuum washed with boiling water this water which has been used to wash out the adhering acid is joined with what was before decanted off and the whole is gradually evaporated the dissolved sulphat of lime cristallizes in form of silky threads which are removed and by continuing the evaporation we procure the phosphoric acid under the appearance of a white pellucid glass when this is powdered and mixed with one third its weight of charcoal we procure very pure phosphorus by sublimation the phosphoric acid as procured by the above process is never so pure as that obtained by oxygenating pure phosphorus either by combustion or by means of nitric acid wherefore this latter should always be employed in experiments of research phosphorus is found in almost all animal substances and in some plants which give a kind of animal analysis in all these it is usually combined with charcoal hydrogen and azote forming very compound radicals which are for the most part in the state of oxyds by a first degree of union with oxygen the discovery of mr hassenfratz of phosphorus being contained in charcoal gives reason to suspect that it is more common in the vegetable kingdom than has generally been supposed it is certain that by proper processes it may be procured from every individual of some of the families of plants as no experiment has hitherto given reason to suspect that phosphorus is a compound body i

c unknown sect xobservations upon charcoal and its combinations with simple substances as charcoal has not been hitherto decomposed it must in the present state of our knowledge be considered as a simple substance by modern experiments it appears to exist ready formed in vegetables and i have already remarked that in these it is combined with hydrogen sometimes with azote and phosphorus forming compound radicals which may be changed into oxyds or acids according to their degree of oxygenation to obtain the charcoal contained in vegetable or animal substances we subject them to the action of fire at first moderate and afterwards very strong on purpose to drive off the last portions of water which adhere very obstinately to the charcoal for chemical purposes this is usually done in retorts of stoneware or porcellain into which the wood or other matter is introduced and then placed in a reverberatory furnace raised gradually to its greatest heat the heat volatilizes or changes into gas all the parts of the body susceptible of combining with caloric into that form and the charcoal being more fixed in its nature remains in the retort combined with a little earth and some fixed salts in the business of charring wood this is done by a less expensive process the wood is disposed in heaps and covered with earth so as to prevent the access of any more air than is absolutely necessary for supporting the fire which is kept up till all the water and oil is driven off after which the fire is extinguished by shutting up all the airholes we may analyse charcoal either by combustion in air or rather in oxygen gas or by means of nitric acid in either case we convert it into carbonic acid and sometimes a little potash and some neutral salts remain this analysis has hitherto been but little attended to by chemists and we are not even certain if potash exists in charcoal before combustion or whether it be formed by means of some unknown combination during that process sect xiobservations upon the muriatic fluoric and boracic radicals and their combinations as the combinations of these substances either with each other or with the other combustible bodies are hitherto entirely unknown we have not attempted to form any table for their nomenclature we only know that these radicals are susceptible of oxygenation and of forming the muriatic fluoric and boracic acids and that in the acid state they enter into a number of combinations to be afterwards detailed chemistry has hitherto been unable to disoxygenate any of them so as to produce them in a simple state for this purpose some substance must be employed to which oxygen has a stronger affinity than to their radicals either by means of single affinity or by double elective attraction all that is known relative to the origin of the radicals of these acids will be mentioned in the sections set apart for considering their combinations with the salifiable bases sect xiiobservations upon the combinations of metals with each other before closing our account of the simple or elementary substances it might be supposed necessary to give a table of alloys or combinations of metals with each other but as such a table would be both exceedingly voluminous and very unsatisfactory without going into a series of experiments not yet attempted i have thought it adviseable to omit it altogether all that is necessary to be mentioned is that these alloys should be named according to the metal in largest proportion in the mixture or combination thus the term alloy of gold and silver or gold alloyed with silver indicates that gold is the predominating metal metallic alloys like all other combinations have a point of saturation it would even appear from the experiments of mr de la briche

sect xiiiobservations upon the nitrous and nitric acids and their combinations the nitrous and nitric acids are procured from a neutral salt long known in the arts under the name of saltpetre this salt is extracted by lixiviation from the rubbish of old buildings from the earth of cellars stables or barns and in general of all inhabited places in these earths the nitric acid is usually combined with lime and magnesia sometimes with potash and rarely with argill as all these salts excepting the nitrat of potash attract the moisture of the air and consequently would be difficultly preserved advantage is taken in the manufactures of saltpetre and the royal refining house of the greater affinity of the nitric acid to potash than these other bases by which means the lime magnesia and argill are precipitated and all these nitrats are reduced to the nitrat of potash or saltpetre41 the nitric acid is procured from this salt by distillation from three parts of pure saltpetre decomposed by one part of concentrated sulphuric acid in a retort with woulfes apparatus pl iv fig 1 having its bottles half filled with water and all its joints carefully luted the nitrous acid passes over in form of red vapours surcharged with nitrous gas or in other words not saturated with oxygen part of the acid condenses in the recipient in form of a dark orange red liquid while the rest combines with the water in the bottles during the distillation a large quantity of oxygen gas escapes owing to the greater affinity of oxygen to caloric in a high temperature than to nitrous acid though in the usual temperature of the atmosphere this affinity is reversed it is from the disengagement of oxygen that the nitric acid of the neutral salt is in this operation converted into nitrous acid it is brought back to the state of nitric acid by heating over a gentle fire which drives off the superabundant nitrous gas and leaves the nitric acid much diluted with water nitric acid is procurable in a more concentrated state and with much less loss by mixing very dry clay with saltpetre this mixture is put into an earthern retort and distilled with a strong fire the clay combines with the potash for which it has great affinity and the nitric acid passes over slightly impregnated with nitrous gas this is easily disengaged by heating the acid gently in a retort a small quantity of nitrous gas passes over into the recipient and very pure concentrated nitric acid remains in the retort we have already seen that azote is the nitric radical if to 2012 parts by weight of azote 4312 parts of oxygen be added 64 parts of nitrous gas are formed and if to this we join 36 additional parts of oxygen 100 parts of nitric acid result from the combination intermediate quantities of oxygen between these two extremes of oxygenation produce different species of nitrous acid or in other words nitric acid less or more impregnated with nitrous gas i ascertained the above proportions by means of decomposition and though i cannot answer for their absolute accuracy they cannot be far removed from truth mr cavendish who first showed by synthetic experiments that azote is the base of nitric acid gives the proportions of azote a little larger than i have done but as it is not improbable that he produced the nitrous acid and not the nitric that circumstance explains in some degree the difference in the results of our experiments as in all experiments of a philosophical nature the utmost possible degree of accuracy is required we must procure the nitric acid for experimental purposes from nitre which has been previously purified from all foreign matter if after distillation any sulphuric acid is suspected in the nitric acid it is easily separated by dropping in a little nitrat of barytes so long as any precipitation takes place the sulphuric acid from its greater affinity attracts the barytes and forms with it an insoluble neutral salt which falls to the bottom it may be purified in the same manner from muriatic acid by dropping in a little nitrat of silver so long as any precipitation of muriat of silver is produced when these two precipitations are finished distill off about seveneighths of the acid by a gentle heat and what comes over is in the most perfect degree of purity the nitric acid is one of the most prone to combination and is at the same time very easily decomposed almost all the simple substances with the exception of gold silver and platina rob it less or more of its oxygen some of them even decompose it altogether it was very anciently known and its combinations have been more studied by chemists than those of any other acid these combinations were named nitres by messrs macquer and beaum but we have changed their names to nitrats and nitrites according as they are formed by nitric or by nitrous acid and have added the specific name of each particular base to distinguish the several combinations from each other table of the

distillation from sulphat of iron in which sulphuric acid and oxyd of iron are combined according to the process described by basil valentine in the fifteenth century but in modern times it is procured more oeconomically by the combustion of sulphur in proper vessels both to facilitate the combustion and to assist the oxygenation of the sulphur a little powdered saltpetre nitrat of potash is mixed with it the nitre is decomposed and gives out its oxygen to the sulphur which contributes to its conversion into acid notwithstanding this addition the sulphur will only continue to burn in close vessels for a limited time the combination ceases because the oxygen is exhausted and the air of the vessels reduced almost to pure azotic gas and because the acid itself remains long in the state of vapour and hinders the progress of combustion in the manufactories for making sulphuric acid in the large way the mixture of nitre and sulphur is burnt in large close built chambers lined with lead having a little water at the bottom for facilitating the condensation of the vapours afterwards by distillation in large retorts with a gentle heat the water passes over slightly impregnated with acid and the sulphuric acid remains behind in a concentrated state it is then pellucid without any flavour and nearly double the weight of an equal bulk of water this process would be greatly facilitated and the combustion much prolonged by introducing fresh air into the chambers by means of several pairs of bellows directed towards the flame of the sulphur and by allowing the nitrous gas to escape through long serpentine canals in contact with water to absorb any sulphuric or sulphurous acid gas it might contain by one experiment mr berthollet found that 69 parts of sulphur in combustion united with 31 parts of oxygen to form 100 parts of sulphuric acid and by another experiment made in a different manner he calculates that 100 parts of sulphuric acid consists of 72 parts sulphur combined with 28 parts of oxygen all by weight this acid in common with every other can only dissolve metals when they have been previously oxydated but most of the metals are capable of decomposing a part of the acid so as to carry off a sufficient quantity of oxygen to render themselves soluble in the part of the acid which remains undecomposed this happens with silver mercury iron and zinc in boiling concentrated sulphuric acid they become first oxydated by decomposing part of the acid and then dissolve in the other part but they do not sufficiently disoxygenate the decomposed part of the acid to reconvert it into sulphur it is only reduced to the state of sulphurous acid which being volatilised by the heat flies off in form of sulphurous acid gas silver mercury and all the other metals except iron and zinc are insoluble in diluted sulphuric acid because they have not sufficient affinity with oxygen to draw it off from its combination either with the sulphur the sulphurous acid or the hydrogen but iron and zinc being assisted by the action of the acid decompose the water and become oxydated at its expence without the help of heat table of the combinations of

nomenclature these compounds must have been named stahls sulphureous salt having base of fixed vegetable alkali and so of the rest in this table we have followed bergmans order of affinity of the sulphuric acid which is the same in regard to the earths and alkalies but it is not certain if the order be the same for the metallic oxydsa sect xvobservations upon sulphurous acid and its combinations the sulphurous acid is formed by the union of oxygen with sulphur by a lesser degree of oxygenation than the sulphuric acid it is procurable either by burning sulphur slowly or by distilling sulphuric acid from silver antimony lead mercury or charcoal by which operation a part of the oxygen quits the acid and unites to these oxydable bases and the acid passes over in the sulphurous state of oxygenation this acid in the common pressure and temperature of the air can only exist in form of gas but it appears from the experiments of mr clouet that in a very low temperature it condenses and becomes fluid water absorbs a great deal more of this gas than of carbonic acid gas but much less than it does of muriatic acid gas that the metals cannot be dissolved in acids without being previously oxydated or by procuring oxygen for that purpose from the acids during solution is a general and well established fact which i have perhaps repeated too often hence as sulphurous acid is already deprived of great part of the oxygen necessary for forming the sulphuric acid it is more disposed to recover oxygen than to furnish it to the greatest part of the metals and for this reason it cannot dissolve them unless previously oxydated by other means from the same principle it is that the metallic oxyds dissolve without effervescence and with great facility in sulphurous acid this acid like the muriatic has even the property of dissolving metallic oxyds surcharged with oxygen and consequently insoluble in sulphuric acid and in this way forms true sulphats hence we might be led to conclude that there are no metallic sulphites were it not that the phenomena which accompany the solution of iron mercury and some other metals convince us that these metallic substances are susceptible of two degrees of oxydation during their solution in acids hence the neutral salt in which the metal is least oxydated must be named sulphite and that in which it is fully oxydated must be called sulphat it is yet unknown whether this distinction is applicable to any of the metallic sulphats except those of iron and mercury table of the combinations of phosphorous and

discovered of late and have not yet been nameda sect xviobservations upon phosphorous and phosphoric acids and their combinations under the article phosphorus part ii sect x we have already given a history of the discovery of that singular substance with some observations upon the mode of its existence in vegetable and animal bodies the best method of obtaining this acid in a state of purity is by burning well purified phosphorus under bellglasses moistened on the inside with distilled water during combustion it absorbs twice and a half its weight of oxygen so that 100 parts of phosphoric acid is composed of 2812 parts of phosphorus united to 7112 parts of oxygen this acid may be obtained concrete in form of white flakes which greedily attract the moisture of the air by burning phosphorus in a dry glass over mercury to obtain phosphorous acid which is phosphorus less oxygenated than in the state of phosphoric acid the phosphorus must be burnt by a very slow spontaneous combustion over a glassfunnel leading into a crystal phial after a few days the phosphorus is found oxygenated and the phosphorous acid in proportion as it forms has attracted moisture from the air and dropped into the phial the phosphorous acid is readily changed into phosphoric acid by exposure for a long time to the free air it absorbs oxygen from the air and becomes fully oxygenated as phosphorus has a sufficient affinity for oxygen to attract it from the nitric and muriatic acids we may form phosphoric acid by means of these acids in a very simple and cheap manner fill a tubulated receiver half full of concentrated nitric acid and heat it gently then throw in small pieces of phosphorus through the tube these are dissolved with effervescence and red fumes of nitrous gas fly off

carbonic acid chalky acid gives them the name of chalksa sect xviiobservations upon carbonic acid and its combinations of all the known acids the carbonic is the most abundant in nature it exists ready formed in chalk marble and all the calcareous stones in which it is neutralized by a particular earth called lime to disengage it from this combination nothing more is requisite than to add some sulphuric acid or any other which has a stronger affinity for lime a brisk effervescence ensues which is produced by the disengagement of the carbonic acid which assumes the state of gas immediately upon being set free this gas incapable of being condensed into the solid or liquid form by any degree of cold or of pressure hitherto known unites to about its own bulk of water and thereby forms a very weak acid it may likewise be obtained in great abundance from saccharine matter in fermentation but is then contaminated by a small portion of alkohol which it holds in solution as charcoal is the radical of this acid we may form it artificially by burning charcoal in oxygen gas or by combining charcoal and metallic oxyds in proper proportions the oxygen of the oxyd combines with the charcoal forming carbonic acid gas and the metal being left free recovers its metallic or reguline form we are indebted for our first knowledge of this acid to dr black before whose time its property of remaining always in the state of gas had made it to elude the researches of chemistry it would be a most valuable discovery to society if we could decompose this gas by any cheap process as by that means we might obtain for economical purposes the immense store of charcoal contained in calcareous earths marbles limestones c this cannot be effected by single affinity because to decompose the carbonic acid it requires a substance as combustible as charcoal itself so that we should only make an exchange of one combustible body for another not more valuable but it may possibly be accomplished by double affinity since this process is so readily performed by nature during vegetation from the most common materials table of the combinations of muriatic acid with the salifiable

acids and their combinations muriatic acid is very abundant in the mineral kingdom naturally combined with different salifiable bases especially with soda lime and magnesia in seawater and the water of several lakes it is combined with these three bases and in mines of rocksalt it is chiefly united to soda this acid does not appear to have been hitherto decomposed in any chemical experiment so that we have no idea whatever of the nature of its radical and only conclude from analogy with the other acids that it contains oxygen as its acidifying principle mr berthollet suspects the radical to be of a metallic nature but as nature appears to form this acid daily in inhabited places by combining miasmata with ariform fluids this must necessarily suppose a metallic gas to exist in the atmosphere which is certainly not impossible but cannot be admitted without proof the muriatic acid has only a moderate adherence to the salifiable bases and can readily be driven from its combination with these by sulphuric acid other acids as the nitric for instance may answer the same purpose but nitric acid being volatile would mix during distillation with the muriatic about one part of sulphuric acid is sufficient to decompose two parts of decrepitated seasalt this operation is performed in a tubulated retort having woulfes apparatus pl iv fig 1 adapted to it when all the junctures are properly lured the seasalt is put into the retort through the tube the sulphuric acid is poured on and the opening immediately closed with its ground crystal stopper as the muriatic acid can only subsist in the gaseous form in the ordinary temperature we could not condense it without the presence of water hence the use of the water with which the bottles in woulfes apparatus are half filled the muriatic acid gas driven off from the seasalt in the retort combines with the water and forms what the old chemists called smoaking spirit of salt or glaubers spirit of seasalt which we now name muriatic acid the acid obtained by the above process is still capable of combining with a farther dose of oxygen by being distilled from the oxyds of manganese lead or mercury and the resulting acid which we name oxygenated muriatic acid can only like the former exist in the gasseous form and is absorbed in a much smaller quantity by water when the impregnation of water with this gas is pushed beyond a certain point the superabundant acid precipitates to the bottom of the vessels in a concrete form mr berthollet has shown that this acid is capable of combining with a great number of the salifiable bases the neutral salts which result from this union are susceptible of deflagrating with charcoal and many of the metallic substances these deflagrations are very violent and dangerous

nitromuriatic acid and its combinations the nitromuriatic acid formerly called aqua regia is formed by a mixture of nitric and muriatic acids the radicals of these two acids combine together and form a compound base from which an acid is produced having properties peculiar to itself and distinct from those of all other acids especially the property of dissolving gold and platina in dissolutions of metals in this acid as in all other acids the metals are first oxydated by attracting a part of the oxygen from the compound radical this occasions a disengagement of a particular species of gas not hitherto described which may be called nitromuriatic gas it has a very disagreeable smell and is fatal to animal life when respired it attacks iron and causes it to rust it is absorbed in considerable quantity by water which thereby acquires some slight characters of acidity i had occasion to make these remarks during a course of experiments upon platina in which i dissolved a considerable quantity of that metal in nitromuriatic acid i at first suspected that in the mixture of nitric and muriatic acids the latter attracted a part of the oxygen from the former and became converted into oxygenated muriatic acid which gave it the property of dissolving gold but several facts remain inexplicable upon this supposition were it so we must be able to disengage nitrous gas by heating this acid which however does not sensibly happen from these considerations i am led to adopt the opinion of mr berthollet and to consider nitromuriatic acid as a single acid with a compound base or radical table of

it disengaged from that combination fluor spar or fluat of lime is put into a leaden retort with a proper quantity of sulphuric acid a recipient likewise of lead half full of water is adapted and fire is applied to the retort the sulphuric acid from its greater affinity expels the fluoric acid which passes over and is absorbed by the water in the receiver as fluoric acid is naturally in the gasseous form in the ordinary temperature we can receive it in a pneumatochemical apparatus over mercury we are obliged to employ metallic vessels in this process because fluoric acid dissolves glass and silicious earth and even renders these bodies volatile carrying them over with itself in distillation in the gasseous form we are indebted to mr margraff for our first acquaintance with this acid though as he could never procure it free from combination with a considerable quantity of silicious earth he was ignorant of its being an acid sui generis the duke de liancourt under the name of mr boulanger considerably increased our knowledge of its properties and mr scheele seems to have exhausted the subject the only thing remaining is to endeavour to discover the nature of the fluoric radical of which we cannot hitherto form any ideas as the acid does not appear to have been decomposed in any experiment it is only by means of compound affinity that experiments ought to be made with

add and its combinations this is a concrete acid extracted from a salt procured from india called borax or tincall although borax has been very long employed in the arts we have as yet very imperfect knowledge of its origin and of the methods by which it is extracted and purified there is reason to believe it to be a native salt found in the earth in certain parts of the east and in the water of some lakes the whole trade of borax is in the hands of the dutch who have been exclusively possessed of the art of purifying it till very lately that messrs leguillier of paris have rivalled them in the manufacture but the process still remains a secret to the world by chemical analysis we learn that borax is a neutral salt with excess of base consisting of soda partly saturated with a peculiar acid long called hombergs sedative salt now the boracic acid this acid is found in an uncombined state in the waters of certain lakes that of cherchiais in italy contains 9412 grains in each pint of water to obtain boracic acid dissolve some borax in boiling water filtrate the solution and add sulphuric acid or any other having greater affinity to soda than the boracic acid this latter acid is separated and is procured in a crystalline form by cooling this acid was long considered as being formed during the process by which it is obtained and was consequently supposed to differ according to the nature of the acid employed in separating it from the soda but it is now universally acknowledged that it is identically the same acid in whatever way procured provided it be properly purified from mixture of other acids by warning and by repeated solution and cristallization it is soluble both in water and alkohol and has the property of communicating a green colour to the flame of that spirit this circumstance led to a suspicion of its containing copper which is not confirmed by any decisive experiment on the contrary if it contain any of that metal it must only be considered as an accidental mixture it combines with the salifiable bases in the humid way and though in this manner it is incapable of dissolving any of the metals directly this combination is readily affected by compound affinity the table presents its combinations in the order of affinity in the humid way but there is a considerable change in the order when we operate via sicca for in that case argill though the last in our list must be placed immediately after soda the boracic radical is hitherto unknown no experiments having as yet been able to decompose the acid we conclude from analogy with the other

combinations of arseniac acid with potash and soda to which he gave the name of arsenical neutral saltsa sect xxiiiobservations upon arseniac acid and its combinations in the collections of the academy for 1746 mr macquer shows that when a mixture of white oxyd of arsenic and nitre are subjected to the action of a strong fire a neutral salt is obtained which he calls neutral salt of arsenic at that time the cause of this singular phenomenon in which a metal acts the part of an acid was quite unknown but more modern experiments teach that during this process the arsenic becomes oxygenated by carrying off the oxygen of the nitric acid it is thus converted into a real acid and combines with the potash there are other methods now known for oxygenating arsenic and obtaining its acid free from combination the most simple and most effectual of these is as follows dissolve white oxyd of arsenic in three parts by weight of muriatic acid to this solution in a boiling state add two parts of nitric acid and evaporate to dryness in this process the nitric acid is decomposed its oxygen unites with the oxyd of arsenic and converts it into an acid and the nitrous radical flies off in the state of nitrous gas whilst the muriatic acid is converted by the heat into muriatic acid gas and may be collected in proper vessels the arseniac acid is entirely freed from the other acids employed during the process by heating it in a crucible till it begins to grow red what remains is pure concrete arseniac acid mr scheeles process which was repeated with great success by mr morveau in the laboratory at dijon is as follows distil muriatic acid from the black oxyd of manganese this converts it into oxygenated muriatic acid by carrying off the oxygen from the manganese receive this in a recipient containing white oxyd of arsenic covered by a little distilled water the arsenic decomposes the oxygenated muriatic acid by carrying off its supersaturation of oxygen the arsenic is converted into arseniac acid and the oxygenated muriatic acid is brought back to the state of common muriatic acid the two acids are separated by distillation with a gentle heat increased towards the end of the operation the muriatic acid passes over and the arseniac acid remains behind in a white concrete form the arseniac acid is considerably less volatile than white oxyd of arsenic it often contains white oxyd of arsenic in solution owing to its not being sufficiently oxygenated this is prevented by continuing to add nitrous acid as in the former process till no more nitrous gas is produced from all these observations i would give the following definition of arseniac acid it is a white concrete metallic acid formed by the combination of arsenic with oxygen fixed in a red heat soluble in water and capable of combining with many of the salifiable bases sect xxivobservations upon molybdic acid and its combinations with acidifiable bases43 molybdena is a particular metallic body capable of being oxygenated so far as to become a true concrete acid44 for this purpose one part ore of molybdena which is a natural sulphuret of that metal is put into a retort with five or six parts nitric acid diluted with a quarter of its weight of water and heat is applied to the retort the oxygen of the nitric acid acts both upon the molybdena and the sulphur converting the one into molybdic and the other into sulphuric acid pour on fresh quantities of nitric acid so long as any red fumes of nitrous gas escape the molydbena is then oxygenated as far as is possible and is found at the bottom of the retort in a pulverulent form resembling chalk it must be washed in warm water to separate any adhering particles of sulphuric acid and as it is hardly soluble we lose very little of

frequent in the mines of cornwal is likewise an ore of this metal in all these ores the metal is oxydated and in some of them it appears even to be oxygenated to the state of acid being combined with lime into a true tungstat of lime to obtain the acid free mix one part of ore of tungstein with four parts of carbonat of potash and melt the mixture in a crucible then powder and pour on twelve parts of boiling water add nitric acid and the tungstic acid precipitates in a concrete form afterwards to insure the complete oxygenation of the metal add more nitric acid and evaporate to dryness

combinations tartar or the concretion which fixes to the inside of vessels in which the fermentation of wine is completed is a well known salt composed of a peculiar acid united in considerable excess to potash mr scheele first pointed out the method of obtaining this acid pure having observed that it has a greater affinity to lime than to potash he directs us to proceed in the following manner dissolve purified tartar in boiling water and add a sufficient quantity of lime till the acid be completely saturated the tartarite of lime which is formed being almost insoluble in cold water falls to the bottom and is separated from the solution of potash by decantation it is afterwards washed in cold water and dried then pour on some sulphuric acid diluted with eight or nine parts of water digest for twelve hours in a gentle heat frequently stirring the mixture the sulphuric acid combines with the lime and the tartarous acid is left free a small quantity of gas not hitherto examined is disengaged during this process at the end of twelve hours having decanted off the clear liquor wash the sulphat of lime in cold water which add to the decanted liquor then evaporate the whole and the tartarous acid is obtained in a concrete form two pounds of purified tartar by means of from eight to ten ounces of sulphuric acid yield about eleven ounces of tartarous acid as the combustible radical exists in excess or as the acid from tartar is not fully saturated with oxygen we call it tartarous acid and the neutral salts formed by its combinations with salifiable bases tartarites the base of the tartarous acid is a carbonohydrous or hydrocarbonous radical less oxygenated than in the oxalic acid and it would appear from the experiments of mr hassenfratz that azote enters into the composition of the tartarous radical even in considerable quantity by oxygenating the tartarous acid it is convertible into oxalic malic and acetous acids but it is probable the proportions of hydrogen and charcoal in the radical are changed during these conversions and that the difference between these acids does not alone consist in the different degrees of oxygenation the tartarous acid is susceptible of two degrees of saturation in its combinations with the fixed alkalies by one of these a salt is formed with excess of acid improperly called cream of tartar which in our new nomenclature is named acidulous tartarite of potash by a second or equal degree of saturation a perfectly neutral salt is formed formerly called vegetable salt which we name tartarite of potash with soda this acid forms tartarite of soda formerly called sal de seignette or sal polychrest of rochell sect xxviiobservations upon malic acid and its combinations with the salifiable bases45 the malic acid exists ready formed in the sour juice of ripe and unripe apples and many other fruits and is obtained as follows saturate the juice of apples with potash or soda and add a proper proportion of acetite of lead dissolved in water a double decomposition takes place the malic acid combines with the oxyd of lead and precipitates being almost insoluble and the acetite of potash or soda remains in the liquor the malat of lead being separated by decantation is washed with cold water and some dilute sulphuric acid is added this unites with the lead into an insoluble sulphat and the malic acid remains free in the liquor this acid which is found mixed with citric and tartarous acid in a great number of fruits is a kind of medium between oxalic and acetous acids being more oxygenated than the former and less so than the latter from this circumstance mr hermbstadt calls it imperfect vinegar but it differs likewise from acetous acid by having rather more charcoal and less hydrogen in the composition of its radical when an acid much diluted has been used in the foregoing process the liquor contains oxalic as well as malic acid and probably a little tartarous these are separated by mixing limewater with the acids oxalat tartarite and malat of lime are produced the two former being insoluble are precipitated and the malat of lime remains dissolved from this the pure malic acid is separated by the acetite of lead and afterwards by sulphuric acid as directed above table of the combinations of citric acid with the salifiable bases in the order of affinitya bases neutral salts

cellar and is afterwards concentrated by exposing it to the temperature of 4 or 5 degrees below zero from 21 to 23 of fahrenheit the water is frozen and the acid remains liquid reduced to about an eighth part of its original bulk a lower degree of cold would occasion the acid to be engaged amongst the ice and render it difficultly separable this process was pointed out by mr georgius it is more easily obtained by saturating the lemonjuice with lime so as to form a citrat of lime which is insoluble in water wash this salt and pour on a proper quantity of sulphuric acid this forms a sulphat of

especially the more heavy and compact ones gave out a particular acid spirit by distillation in a naked fire but before mr goetling who gives an account of his experiments upon this subject in crells

one part of sugar pour six or eight parts of nitric acid and apply a gentle heat a considerable effervescence takes place and a great quantity of nitrous gas is disengaged the nitric acid is

small proportion of argill from the liquor remaining after the first cristallization of the oxalic acid we may obtain malic acid by refrigeration this acid is more oxygenated than the oxalic and by a further oxygenation the sugar is convertible into acetous acid or vinegar the oxalic acid combined with a small quantity of soda or potash has the property like the tartarous acid of entering into a number of combinations without suffering decomposition these combinations form triple salts or neutral salts with double bases which ought to have proper names the salt of sorrel which is potash having oxalic acid combined in excess is named acidulous oxalat of potash in our new nomenclature the acid procured from sorrel has been known to chemists for more than a century being mentioned by mr duclos in the memoirs of the academy for 1688 and was pretty accurately described by boerhaave but mr scheele first showed that it contained potash and demonstrated its identity with the acid formed by the oxygenation of sugar sect xxxiiiobservations upon acetous acid and its combinations this acid is composed of charcoal and hydrogen united together and brought to the state of an acid by the addition of oxygen it is consequently formed by the same elements with the tartarous oxalic citric malic acids and others but the elements exist in different proportions in each of these and it would appear that the acetous acid is in a higher state of oxygenation than these other acids i have some reason to believe that the acetous radical contains a small portion of azote and as this element is not contained in the radicals of any vegetable acid except the tartarous this circumstance is one of the causes of difference the acetous acid or vinegar is produced by exposing wine to a gentle heat with the addition of some ferment this is usually the ley or mother which has separated from other vinegar during fermentation or some similar matter the spiritous part of the wine which consists of charcoal and hydrogen is oxygenated and converted into vinegar this operation can only take place with free access of air and is always attended by a diminution of the air employed in consequence of the absorption of oxygen wherefore it ought always to be carried on in vessels only half filled with the vinous liquor submitted to the acetous fermentation the acid formed during this process is very volatile is mixed with a large proportion of water and with many foreign substances and to obtain it pure it is distilled in stone or glass vessels by a gentle fire the acid which passes over in distillation is somewhat changed by the process and is not exactly of the same nature with what remains in the alembic but seems less oxygenated this circumstance has not been formerly observed by chemists distillation is not sufficient for depriving this acid of all its unnecessary water and for this purpose the best way is by exposing it to a degree of cold from 4 to 6 below the freezing point from 19 to 23 of fahrenheit by this means the aqueous part becomes frozen and leaves the acid in a liquid state and considerably concentrated in the usual temperature of the air this acid can only exist in the gasseous form and can only be retained by combination with a large proportion of water there are other chemical processes for obtaining the acetous acid which consist in oxygenating the tartarous oxalic or malic acids by means of nitric acid but there is reason to believe the proportions of the elements of the radical are changed during this process mr hassenfratz is at present engaged in repeating the experiments by which these conversions are said to be produced the combinations of acetous acid with the various salifiable bases are very readily formed but most of the resulting neutral salts are not cristallizable whereas those produced by the tartarous and oxalic acids are in general hardly soluble tartarite and oxalat of lime are not soluble in any sensible degree the malats are a medium between the oxalats and acetites with respect to solubility and the malic acid is in the middle degree of saturation between the oxalic and acetous acids with this as with all the acids the metals require to be oxydated previous to solution the ancient chemists knew hardly any of the salts formed by the combinations of acetous acid with the salifiable bases except the acetites of potash soda ammoniac copper and lead mr cadet discovered the acetite of arsenic47 mr wenzel the dijon academicians mr de lassone and mr proust made us acquainted with the properties of the other acetites from the property which acetite of potash possesses of giving out ammoniac in distillation there is some reason to suppose that besides charcoal and hydrogen the acetous radical contains a small proportion of azote though it is not impossible but the above production of ammoniac may be occasioned by the decomposition of the potash table of the combinations of acetic acid with

supposing that it consists of the same radical with that of the acetous acid but more highly saturated with oxygen according to this idea acetic acid is the highest degree of oxygenation of which the hydrocarbonous radical is susceptible but although this circumstance be extremely probable it requires to be confirmed by farther and more decisive experiments before it be adopted as an absolute chemical truth we procure this acid as follows upon three parts acetite of potash or of copper pour one part of concentrated sulphuric acid and by distillation a very highly concentrated vinegar is obtained which we call acetic acid formerly named radical vinegar it is not hitherto rigorously proved that this acid is more highly oxygenated than the acetous acid nor that the difference between

crystallization this acid is soluble in twentyfour times its weight of cold water and in a much smaller quantity of hot water it possesses the qualities of an acid in a very small degree and only affects the blue vegetable colours very slightly the affinities of this acid with the salifiable bases are taken from mr de morveau who is the first chemist that has endeavoured to ascertain them sect xxxviobservations upon benzoic acid and its combinations with salifiable bases48 this acid was known to the ancient chemists under the name of flowers of benjamin or of benzoin and was procured by sublimation from the gum or resin called benzoin the means of procuring it via humida was discovered by mr geoffroy and perfected by mr scheele upon benzoin reduced to powder pour strong limewater having rather an excess of lime keep the mixture continually stirring and after half an hours digestion pour off the liquor and use fresh portions of limewater in the same manner so long as there is any appearance of neutralization join all the decanted liquors and evaporate as far as possible without occasioning cristallization and when the liquor is cold drop in muriatic acid till no more precipitate is formed by the former part of the process a benzoat of lime is formed and by the latter the muriatic acid combines with the lime forming muriat of lime which remains dissolved while the benzoic acid being insoluble precipitates in a concrete state sect xxxviiobservations upon camphoric acid and its combinations with salifiable bases49 camphor is a concrete essential oil obtained by sublimation from a species of laurus which grows in china and japan by distilling nitric acid eight times from camphor mr kosegarten converted it into an acid analogous to the oxalic but as it differs from that acid in some circumstances we have thought necessary to give it a particular name till its nature be more completely ascertained by farther experiment as camphor is a carbonohydrous or hydrocarbonous radical it is easily conceived that by oxygenation it should form oxalic malic and several other vegetable acids this conjecture is rendered not improbable by the experiments of mr kosegarten and the principal phenomena exhibited in the combinations of camphoric acid with the salifiable bases being very similar to those of the oxalic and malic acids lead me to believe that it consists of a mixture of these two acids sect xxxviiiobservations upon gallic acid and its combinations with salifiable bases50 the gallic acid formerly called principle of astringency is obtained

xxxixobservations upon lactic acid and its combinations with salifiable bases51 the only accurate knowledge we have of this acid is from the works of mr scheele it is contained in whey united to a small quantity of earth and is obtained as follows reduce whey to one eighth part of its bulk by evaporation and filtrate to separate all its cheesy matter then add as much lime as is necessary to combine with the acid the lime is afterwards disengaged by the addition of oxalic acid which combines with it into an insoluble neutral salt when the oxalat of lime has been separated by decantation evaporate the remaining liquor to the consistence of honey the lactic acid is dissolved by alkohol which does not unite with the sugar of milk and other foreign matters these are separated by filtration from the alkohol and acid and the alkohol being evaporated or distilled off leaves the lactic acid behind this acid unites with all the salifiable bases forming salts which do not cristallize and it seems considerably to resemble the acetous acid table of the combinations of saccholactic acid with the salifiable bases in the order of affinity bases neutral salts lime saccholat

combinations a species of sugar may be extracted by evaporation from whey which has long been known in pharmacy and which has a considerable resemblance to that procured from sugar canes this saccharine matter like ordinary sugar may be oxygenated by means of nitric acid for this purpose several portions of nitric acid are distilled from it the remaining liquid is evaporated and set to cristallize by which means cristals of oxalic acid are procured at the same time a very fine white powder precipitates which is the saccholactic acid discovered by scheele it is susceptible of combining with the alkalies ammoniac the earths and even with the metals its action upon the latter is hitherto but little known except that with them it forms difficultly soluble salts the order of

argill noteall unknown to the ancient chemistsa sect xliobservations upon formic acid and its combinations this acid was first obtained by distillation from ants in the last century by samuel fisher the subject was treated of by margraff in 1749 and by messrs ardwisson and ochrn of leipsic in 1777 the formic acid is drawn from a large species of red ants formica rufa lin which form large ant hills in woody places it is procured either by distilling the ants with a gentle heat in a glass retort or an alembic or after having washed the ants in cold water and dried them upon a cloth by pouring on boiling water which dissolves the acid or the acid may be procured by gentle expression from the insects in which case it is stronger than in any of the former ways to obtain it pure we must rectify by means of distillation which separates it from the uncombined oily and charry matter and it may be concentrated by freezing in the manner recommended for treating the acetous acid sect xliiobservations upon bombic acid and its combinations with acidifiable bases52 the juices of the silk worm seem to assume an acid quality when that insect changes from a larva to a chrysalis at the moment of its escape from the latter to the butterfly form it emits a reddish liquor which reddens blue paper and which was first attentively observed by mr chaussier of the dijon academy who obtains the acid by infusing silk worm chrysalids in alkohol which dissolves their acid without being charged with any of the gummy parts of the insect and by evaporating the alkohol the acid remains tollerably pure the properties and affinities of this acid are not hitherto ascertained with any precision and we have reason to believe that analogous acids may be procured from other insects the radical of this acid is probably like that of the other acids from the animal kingdom composed of charcoal hydrogen and azote with the addition perhaps of phosphorus table of the combinations of

in fine powder and constantly stirred raising the fire towards the end of the operation and taking care to avoid the vapours which are very offensive by this process the sebacic acid unites with the lime into a sebat of lime which is difficultly soluble in water it is however separated from the fatty matters with which it is mixed by solution in a large quantity of boiling water from this the neutral salt is separated by evaporation and to render it pure is calcined redissolved and again cristallized after this we pour on a proper quantity of sulphuric acid and the sebacic acid passes over by distillation sect xlivobservations upon the lithic acid and its combinations with the salifiable bases53 from the later experiments of bergman and scheele the urinary calculus appears to be a species of salt with an earthy basis it is slightly acidulous and requires a large quantity of water for solution three grains being scarcely soluble in a thousand grains of boiling water and the greater part again cristallizes when cold to this concrete acid which mr de morveau calls lithiasic acid we give the name of lithic acid the nature and properties of which are hitherto very little known there is some appearance that it is an acidulous neutral salt or acid combined in excess with a salifiable base and i have reason to believe that it really is an acidulous phosphat of lime if so

experiments which have been made hitherto upon this acid seem still to leave a considerable degree of uncertainty with regard to its nature i shall not enlarge upon its properties and the means of procuring it pure and dissengaged from combination it combines with iron to which it communicates a blue colour and is equally susceptible of entering into combination with most of the other metals which are precipitated from it by the alkalies ammoniac and lime in consequence of greater affinity the prussic radical from the experiments of scheele and especially from those of mr berthollet seems composed of charcoal and azote hence it is an acid with a double base the phosphorus which has been found combined with it appears from the experiments of mr hassenfratz to be only accidental although this acid combines with alkalies earths and metals in the same way with other acids it possesses only some of the properties we have been in use to attribute to acids and it may consequently be improperly ranked here in the class of acids but as i have already observed it is difficult to form a decided opinion upon the nature of this substance until the subject has been farther elucidated by a greater number of experiments footnotes 36 see memoirs of the academy for 1776 p 671 and for 1778 p 535a 37 see part i chap xi upon this subjecta 38 see part i chap xi upon the application of these

ancient chemists and its affinities with the salifiable bases have not been hitherto determineda part iii description of the instruments and operations of chemistry introduction in the two former parts of this work i designedly avoided being particular in describing the manual operations of chemistry because i had found from experience that in a work appropriated to reasoning minute descriptions of processes and of plates interrupt the chain of ideas and render the attention necessary both difficult and tedious to the reader on the other hand if i had confined myself to the summary descriptions hitherto given beginners could have only acquired very vague conceptions of practical chemistry from my work and must have wanted both confidence and interest in operations they could neither repeat nor thoroughly comprehend this want could not have been supplied from books for besides that there are not any which describe the modern instruments and experiments sufficiently at large any work that could have been consulted would have presented these things under a very different order of arrangement and in a different chemical language which must greatly tend to injure the main object of my performance influenced by these motives i determined to reserve for a third part of my work a summary description of all the instruments and manipulations relative to elementary chemistry i considered it as better placed at the end rather than at the beginning of the book because i must have been obliged to suppose the reader acquainted with circumstances which a beginner cannot know and must therefore have read the elementary part to become acquainted with the whole of this third part may therefore be considered as resembling the explanations of plates which are usually placed at the end of academic memoirs that they may not interrupt the connection of the text by lengthened description though i have taken great pains to render this part clear and methodical and have not omitted any essential instrument or apparatus i am far from pretending by it to set aside the necessity of attendance upon lectures and laboratories for such as wish to acquire accurate knowledge of the science of chemistry these should familiarise themselves to the employment of apparatus and to the performance of experiments by actual experience nihil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu the motto which the celebrated rouelle caused to be painted in large characters in a conspicuous part of his laboratory is an important truth never to be lost sight of either by teachers or students of chemistry chemical operations may be naturally divided into several classes according to the purposes they are intended for performing some may be considered as purely mechanical such as the determination of the weight and bulk of bodies trituration levigation searching washing filtration c others may be considered as real chemical operations because they are performed by means of chemical powers and agents such are solution fusion c some of these are intended for separating the elements of bodies from each other some for reuniting these elements together and some as combustion produce both these effects during the same process without rigorously endeavouring to follow the above method i mean to give a detail of the chemical operations in such order of arrangement as seemed best calculated for conveying instruction i shall be more particular in describing the apparatus connected with modern chemistry because these are hitherto little known by men who have devoted much of their time to chemistry and even by many professors of the science chap i of the instruments necessary for determining the absolute and specific gravities of solid and liquid bodies the best method hitherto known for determining the quantities of substances submitted to chemical experiment or resulting from them is by means of an accurately constructed beam and scales with properly regulated weights which well known operation is called weighing the denomination and quantity of the weights used as an unit or standard for this purpose are extremely arbitrary and vary not only in different kingdoms but even in different provinces of the same kingdom and in different cities of the same province this variation is of infinite consequence to be well understood in commerce and in the arts but in chemistry it is of no moment what particular denomination of weight be employed provided the results of experiments be expressed in convenient fractions of the same denomination for this purpose until all the weights used in society be reduced to the same standard it will be sufficient for chemists in different parts to use the common pound of their own country as the unit or standard and to express all its fractional parts in decimals instead of the arbitrary divisions now in use by this means the chemists of all countries will be thoroughly understood by each other as although the absolute weights of the ingredients and products cannot be known they will readily and without calculation be able to determine the relative proportions of these to each other with the utmost accuracy so that in this way we shall be possessed of an universal language for this part of chemistry with this view i have long projected to have the pound divided into decimal fractions and i have of late succeeded through the assistance of mr fourche balancemaker at paris who has executed it for me with great accuracy and judgment i recommend to all who carry on experiments to procure similar divisions of the pound which they will find both easy and simple in its application with a very small knowledge of decimal fractions54 as the usefulness and accuracy of chemistry depends entirely upon the determination of the weights of the ingredients and products both before and after experiments too much precision cannot be employed in this part of the subject and for this purpose we must be provided with good instruments as we are often obliged in chemical processes to ascertain within a grain or less the tare or weight of large and heavy instruments we must have beams made with peculiar niceness by accurate workmen and these must always be kept apart from the laboratory in some place where the vapours of acids or other corrosive liquors cannot have access otherwise the steel will rust and the accuracy of the balance be destroyed i have three sets of different sizes made by mr fontin with the utmost nicety and excepting those made by mr ramsden of london i do not think any can compare with them for precision and sensibility the largest of these is about three feet long in the beam for large weights up to fifteen or twenty pounds the second for weights of eighteen or twenty ounces is exact to a tenth part of a grain and the smallest calculated only for weighing about one gros is sensibly affected by the five hundredth part of a grain besides these nicer balances which are only used for experiments of research we must have others of less value for the ordinary purposes of the laboratory a large iron balance capable of weighing forty or fifty pounds within half a dram one of a middle size which may ascertain eight or ten pounds within ten or twelve grains and a small one by which about a pound may be determined within one grain we must likewise be provided with weights divided into their several fractions both vulgar and decimal with the utmost nicety and verified by means of repeated and accurate trials in the nicest scales and it requires some experience and to be accurately acquainted with the different weights to be able to use them properly the best way of precisely ascertaining the weight of any particular substance is to weigh it twice once with the decimal divisions of the pound and another time with the common subdivisions or vulgar fractions and by comparing these we attain the utmost accuracy by the specific gravity of any substance is understood the quotient of its absolute weight divided by its magnitude or what is the same the weight of a determinate bulk of any body the weight of a determinate magnitude of water has been generally assumed as unity for this purpose and we express the specific gravity of gold sulphuric acid c by saying that gold is nineteen times and sulphuric acid twice the weight of water and so of other bodies it is the more convenient to assume water as unity in specific gravities that those substances whose specific gravity we wish to determine are most commonly weighed in water for that purpose thus if we wish to determine the specific gravity of gold flattened under the hammer and supposing the piece of gold to weigh 8 oz 4 gros 212 grs in the air55 it is suspended by means of a fine metallic wire under the scale of a hydrostatic balance so as to be entirely immersed in water and again weighed the piece of gold in mr brissons experiment lost by this means 3 gros 37 grs and as it is evident that the weight lost by a body weighed in water is precisely equal to the weight of the water displaced or to that of an equal volume of water we may conclude that in equal magnitudes gold weighs 489312 grs and water 253 grs which reduced to unity gives 10000 as the specific gravity of water and 193617 for that of gold we may operate in the same manner with all solid substances we have rarely any occasion in chemistry to determine the specific gravity of solid bodies unless when operating upon alloys or metallic glasses but we have very frequent necessity to ascertain that of fluids as it is often the only means of judging of their purity or degree of concentration this object may be very fully accomplished with the hydrostatic balance by weighing a solid body such for example as a little ball of rock cristal suspended by a very fine gold wire first in the air and afterwards in the fluid whose specific gravity we wish to discover the weight lost by the cristal when weighed in the liquor is equal to that of an equal bulk of the liquid by repeating this operation successively in water and different fluids we can very readily ascertain by a simple and easy calculation the relative specific gravities of these fluids either with respect to each other or to water this method is not however sufficiently exact or at least is rather troublesome from its extreme delicacy when used for liquids differing but little in specific gravity from water such for instance as mineral waters or any other water containing very small portions of salt in solution in some operations of this nature which have not hitherto been made public i employed an instrument of great sensibility for this purpose with great advantage it consists of a hollow cylinder a b c f pl vii fig 6 of brass or rather of silver loaded at its bottom b c f with tin as represented swimming in a jug of water l m n o to the upper part of the cylinder is attached a stalk of silver wire not more than three fourths of a line diameter surmounted by a little cup d intended for containing weights upon the stalk a mark is made at g the use of which we shall presently explain this cylinder may be made of any size but to be accurate ought at least to displace four pounds of water the weight of tin with which this instrument is loaded ought to be such as will make it remain almost in equilibrium in distilled water and should not require more than half a dram or a dram at most to make it sink to g we must first determine with great precision the exact weight of the instrument and the number of additional grains requisite for making it sink in distilled water of a determinate temperature to the mark we then perform the same experiment upon all the fluids of which we wish to ascertain the specific gravity and by means of calculation reduce the observed differences to a common standard of cubic feet pints or pounds or of decimal fractions comparing them with water this method joined to experiments with certain reagents56 is one of the best for determining the quality of waters and is even capable of pointing out differences which escape the most accurate chemical analysis i shall at some future period give an account of a very extensive set of experiments which i have made upon this subject these metallic hydrometers are only to be used for determining the specific gravities of such waters as contain only neutral salts or alkaline substances and they may be constructed with different degrees of ballast for alkohol and other spiritous liquors when the specific gravities of acid liquors are to be ascertained we must use a glass hydrometer as represented pl vii fig 1457 this consists of a hollow cylinder of glass a b c f hermetically sealed at its lower end and drawn out at the upper into a capillary tube a ending in the little cup or bason d this instrument is ballasted with more or less mercury at the bottom of the cylinder introduced through the tube in proportion to the weight of the liquor intended to be examined we may introduce a small graduated slip of paper into the tube a d and though these degrees do not exactly correspond to the fractions of grains in the different liquors they may be rendered very useful in calculation what is said in this chapter may suffice without farther enlargement for indicating the means of ascertaining the absolute and specific gravities of solids and fluids as the necessary instruments are generally known and may easily be procured but as the instruments i have used for measuring the gasses are not any where described i shall give a more detailed account of these in the following chapter footnotes 54 mr lavoisier gives in this part of his work very accurate directions for reducing the common subdivisions of the french pound into decimal fractions and vice versa by means of tables subjoined to this 3d part as these instructions and the table would be useless to the british chemist from the difference between the subdivisions of the french and troy pounds i have omitted them but have subjoined in the appendix accurate rules for converting the one into the othere 55 vide mr brissons essay upon specific gravity p 5a 56 for the use of these reagents see bergmans excellent treatise upon the analysis of mineral waters in his chemical and physical essayse 57 three or four years ago i have seen similar glass hydrometers made for dr black by b knie a very ingenious artist of this citye chap ii of gazometry or the measurement of the weight and volume of ariform substances sect i description of the pneumatochemical apparatus the french chemists have of late applied the name of pneumatochemical apparatus to the very simple and ingenious contrivance invented by dr priestley which is now indispensibly necessary to every laboratory this consists of a wooden trough of larger or smaller dimensions as is thought convenient lined with platelead or tinned copper as represented in perspective pl v in fig 1 the same trough or cistern is supposed to have two of its sides cut away to show its interior construction more distinctly in this apparatus we distinguish between the shelf abcd fig 1 and 2 and the bottom or body of the cistern fghi fig 2 the jars or bellglasses are filled with water in this deep part and being turned with their mouths downwards are afterwards set upon the shelf abcd as shown plate x fig 1 f the upper parts of the sides of the cistern above the level of the shelf are called the rim or borders the cistern ought to be filled with water so as to stand at least an inch and a half deep upon the shelf and it should be of such dimensions as to admit of at least one foot of water in every direction in the well this size is sufficient for ordinary occasions but it is often convenient and even necessary to have more room i would therefore advise such as intend to employ themselves usefully in chemical experiments to have this apparatus made of considerable magnitude where their place of operating will allow the well of my principal cistern holds four cubical feet of water and its shelf has a surface of fourteen square feet yet in spite of this size which i at first thought immoderate i am often straitened for room in laboratories where a considerable number of experiments are performed it is necessary to have several lesser cisterns besides the large one which may be called the general magazine and even some portable ones which may be moved when necessary near a furnace or wherever they may be wanted there are likewise some operations which dirty the water of the apparatus and therefore require to be carried on in cisterns by themselves it were doubtless considerably cheaper to use cisterns or ironbound tubs of wood simply dovetailed instead of being lined with lead or copper and in my first experiments i used them made in that way but i soon discovered their inconvenience if the water be not always kept at the same level such of the dovetails as are left dry shrink and when more water is added it escapes through the joints and runs out we employ cristal jars or bell glasses pl v fig 9 a for containing the gasses in this apparatus and for transporting these when full of gas from one cistern to another or for keeping them in reserve when the cistern is too full we make use of a flat dish bc surrounded by a standing up rim or border with two handles de for carrying it by after several trials of different materials i have found marble the best substance for constructing the mercurial pneumatochemical apparatus as it is perfectly impenetrable by mercury and is not liable like wood to separate at the junctures or to allow the mercury to escape through chinks neither does it run the risk of breaking like glass stoneware or porcelain take a block of marble bcde plate v fig 3 and 4 about two feet long 15 or 18 inches broad and ten inches thick and cause it to be hollowed out as at m n fig 5 about four inches deep as a reservoir for the mercury and to be able more conveniently to fill the jars cut the gutter t v fig 3 4 and 5 at least four inches deeper and as this trench may sometimes prove troublesome it is made capable of being covered at pleasure by thin boards which slip into the grooves x y fig 5 i have two marble cisterns upon this construction of different sizes by which i can always employ one of them as a reservoir of mercury which it preserves with more safety than any other vessel being neither subject to overturn nor to any other accident we operate with mercury in this apparatus exactly as with water in the one before described but the bellglasses must be of smaller diameter and much stronger or we may use glass tubes having their mouths widened as in fig 7 these are called eudiometers by the glassmen who sell them one of the bellglasses is represented fig 5 a standing in its place and what is called a jar is engraved fig 6 the mercurial pneumatochemical apparatus is necessary in all experiments wherein the disengaged gasses are capable of being absorbed by water as is frequently the case especially in all combinations excepting those of metals in fermentation c sect ii of the gazometer i give the name of gazometer to an instrument which i invented and caused construct for the purpose of a kind of bellows which might furnish an uniform and continued stream of oxygen gas in experiments of fusion mr meusnier and i have since made very considerable corrections and additions having converted it into what may be called an universal instrument without which it is hardly possible to perform most of the very exact experiments the name we have given the instrument indicates its intention for measuring the volume or quantity of gas submitted to it for examination it consists of a strong iron beam de pl viii fig 1 three feet long having at each end d and e a segment of a circle likewise strongly constructed of iron and very firmly joined instead of being poised as in ordinary balances this beam rests by means of a cylindrical axis of polished steel f fig 9 upon two large moveable brass frictionwheels by which the resistance to its motion from friction is considerably diminished being converted into friction of the second order as an additional precaution the parts of these wheels which support the axis of the beam are covered with plates of polished rockcristal the whole of this machinery is fixed to the top of the solid column of wood bc fig 1 to one extremity d of the beam a scale p for holding weights is suspended by a flat chain which applies to the curvature of the arc ndo in a groove made for the purpose to the other extremity e of the beam is applied another flat chain i k m so constructed as to be incapable of lengthening or shortening by being less or more charged with weight to this chain an iron trivet with three branches a i c i and h i is strongly fixed at i and these branches support a large inverted jar a of hammered copper of about 18 inches diameter and 20 inches deep the whole of this machine is represented in perspective pl viii fig 1 and pl ix fig 2 and 4 give perpendicular sections which show its interior structure round the bottom of the jar on its outside is fixed pl ix fig 2 a border divided into compartments 1 2 3 4 c intended to receive leaden weights separately represented 1 2 3 fig 3 these are intended for increasing the weight of the jar when a considerable pressure is requisite as will be afterwards explained though such necessity seldom occurs the cylindrical jar a is entirely open below de pl ix fig 4 but is closed above with a copper lid a b c open at b f and capable of being shut by the cock g this lid as may be seen by inspecting the figures is placed a few inches within the top of the jar to prevent the jar from being ever entirely immersed in the water and covered over were i to have this instrument made over again i should cause the lid to be considerably more flattened so as to be almost level this jar or reservoir of air is contained in the cylindrical copper vessel lmno pl viii fig 1 filled with water in the middle of the cylindrical vessel lmno pl ix fig 4 are placed two tubes st xy which are made to approach each other at their upper extremities t y these are made of such a length as to rise a little above the upper edge lm of the vessel lmno and when the jar abcde touches the bottom no their upper ends enter about half an inch into the conical hollow b leading to the stopcock g the bottom of the vessel lmno is represented pl ix fig 3 in the middle of which a small hollow semispherical cap is soldered which may be considered as the broad end of a funnel reversed the two tubes st xy fig 4 are adapted to this cap at s and x and by this means communicate with the tubes mm nn oo pp fig 3 which are fixed horizontally upon the bottom of the vessel and all of which terminate in and are united by the spherical cap sx three of these tubes are continued out of the vessel as in pl viii fig 1 the first marked in that figure 1 2 3 is inserted at its extremity 3 by means of an intermediate stopcock 4 to the jar v which stands upon the shelf of a small pneumatochemical apparatus ghik the inside of which is shown pl ix fig 1 the second tube is applied against the outside of the vessel lmno from 6 to 7 is continued at 8 9 10 and at 11 is engaged below the jar v the former of these tubes is intended for conveying gas into the machine and the latter for conducting small quantities for trials under jars the gas is made either to flow into or out of the machine according to the degree of pressure it receives and this pressure is varied at pleasure by loading the scale p less or more by means of weights when gas is to be introduced into the machine the pressure is taken off or even rendered negative but when gas is to be expelled a pressure is made with such degree of force as is found necessary the third tube 12 13 14 15 is intended for conveying air or gas to any necessary place or apparatus for combustions combinations or any other experiment in which it is required to explain the use of the fourth tube i must enter into some discussions suppose the vessel lmno pl viii fig 1 full of water and the jar a partly filled with gas and partly with water it is evident that the weights in the bason p may be so adjusted as to occasion an exact equilibrium between the weight of the bason and of the jar so that the external air shall not tend to enter into the jar nor the gas to escape from it and in this case the water will stand exactly at the same level both within and without the jar on the contrary if the weight in the bason p be diminished the jar will then press downwards from its own gravity and the water will stand lower within the jar than it does without in this case the included air or gas will suffer a degree of compression above that experienced by the external air exactly proportioned to the weight of a column of water equal to the difference of the external and internal surfaces of the water from these reflections mr meusnier contrived a method of determining the exact degree of pressure to which the gas contained in the jar is at any time exposed for this purpose he employs a double glass syphon 19 20 21 22 23 firmly cemented at 19 and 23 the extremity 19 of this syphon communicates freely with the water in the external vessel of the machine and the extremity 23 communicates with the fourth tube at the bottom of the cylindrical vessel and consequently by means of the perpendicular tube st pl ix fig 4 with the air contained in the jar he likewise cements at 16 pl viii fig 1 another glass tube 16 17 18 which communicates at 16 with the water in the exterior vessel lmno and at its upper end 18 is open to the external air by these several contrivances it is evident that the water must stand in the tube 16 17 18 at the same level with that in the cistern lmno and on the contrary that in the branch 19 20 21 it must stand higher or lower according as the air in the jar is subjected to a greater or lesser pressure than the external air to ascertain these differences a brass scale divided into inches and lines is fixed between these two tubes it is readily conceived that as air and all other elastic fluids must increase in weight by compression it is necessary to know their degree of condensation to be enabled to calculate their quantities and to convert the measure of their volumes into correspondent weights and this object is intended to be fulfilled by the contrivance now described but to determine the specific gravity of air or of gasses and to ascertain their weight in a known volume it is necessary to know their temperature as well as the degree of pressure under which they subsist and this is accomplished by means of a small thermometer strongly cemented into a brass collet which screws into the lid of the jar a this thermometer is represented separately pl viii fig 10 and in its place 24 25 fig 1 and pl ix fig 4 the bulb is in the inside of the jar a and its graduated stalk rises on the outside of the lid the practice of gazometry would still have laboured under great difficulties without farther precautions than those above described when the jar a sinks in the water of the cistern lmno it must lose a weight equal to that of the water which it displaces and consequently the compression which it makes upon the contained air or gas must be proportionally diminished hence the gas furnished during experiments from the machine will not have the same density towards the end that it had at the beginning as its specific gravity is continually diminishing this difference may it is true be determined by calculation but this would have occasioned such mathematical investigations as must have rendered the use of this apparatus both troublesome and difficult mr meusnier has remedied this inconvenience by the following contrivance a square rod of iron 26 27 pl viii fig 1 is raised perpendicular to the middle of the beam de this rod passes through a hollow box of brass 28 which opens and may be filled with lead and this box is made to slide alongst the rod by means of a toothed pinion playing in a rack so as to raise or lower the box and to fix it at such places as is judged proper when the lever or beam de stands horizontal this box gravitates to neither side but when the jar a sinks into the cistern lmno so as to make the beam incline to that side it is evident the loaded box 28 which then passes beyond the center of suspension must gravitate to the side of the jar and augment its pressure upon the included air this is increased in proportion as the box is raised towards 27 because the same weight exerts a greater power in proportion to the length of the lever by which it acts hence by moving the box 28 alongst the rod 26 27 we can augment or diminish the correction it is intended to make upon the pressure of the jar and both experience and calculation show that this may be made to compensate very exactly for the loss of weight in the jar at all degrees of pressure i have not hitherto explained the most important part of the use of this machine which is the manner of employing it for ascertaining the quantities of the air or gas furnished during experiments to determine this with the most rigorous precision and likewise the quantity supplied to the machine from experiments we fixed to the arc which terminates the arm of the beam e pl viii fig 1 the brass sector l m divided into degrees and half degrees which consequently moves in common with the beam and the lowering of this end of the beam is measured by the fixed index 29 30 which has a nonius giving hundredth parts of a degree at its extremity 30 the whole particulars of the different parts of the above described machine are represented in plate viii as follow fig 2 is the flat chain invented by mr vaucanson and employed for suspending the scale or bason p fig 1 but as this lengthens or shortens according as it is more or less loaded it would not have answered for suspending the jar a fig 1 fig 5 is the chain i k m which in fig 1 sustains the jar a this is entirely formed of plates of polished iron interlaced into each other and held together by iron pins this chain does not lengthen in any sensible degree by any weight it is capable of supporting fig 6 the trivet or three branched stirrup by which the jar a is hung to the balance with the screw by which it is fixed in an accurately vertical position fig 3 the iron rod 26 27 which is fixed perpendicular to the center of the beam with its box 28 fig 7 8 the frictionwheels with the plates of rockcristal z as points of contact by which the friction of the axis of the lever of the balance is avoided fig 4 the piece of metal which supports the axis of the frictionwheels fig 9 the middle of the lever or beam with the axis upon which it moves fig 10 the thermometer for determining the temperature of the air or gas contained in the jar when this gazometer is to be used the cistern or external vessel lmno pl viii fig 1 is to be filled with water to a determinate height which should be the same in all experiments the level of the water should be taken when the beam of the balance stands horizontal this level when the jar is at the bottom of the cistern is increased by all the water which it displaces and is diminished in proportion as the jar rises to its highest elevation we next endeavour by repeated trials to discover at what elevation the box 28 must be fixed to render the pressure equal in all situations of the beam i should have said nearly because this correction is not absolutely rigorous and differences of a quarter or even of half a line are not of any consequence this height of the box 28 is not the same for every degree of pressure but varies according as this is of one two three or more inches all these should be registered with great order and precision we next take a bottle which holds eight or ten pints the capacity of which is very accurately determined by weighing the water it is capable of containing this bottle is turned bottom upwards full of water in the cistern of the pneumato chemical apparatus ghik fig 1 and is set on its mouth upon the shelf of the apparatus instead of the glass jar v having the extremity 11 of the tube 7 8 9 10 11 inserted into its mouth the machine is fixed at zero of pressure and the degree marked by the index 30 upon the sector m l is accurately observed then by opening the stopcock 8 and pressing a little upon the jar a as much air is forced into the bottle as fills it entirely the degree marked by the index upon the sector is now observed and we calculate what number of cubical inches correspond to each degree we then fill a second and third bottle and so on in the same manner with the same precautions and even repeat the operation several times with bottles of different sizes till at last by accurate attention we ascertain the exact gage or capacity of the jar a in all its parts but it is better to have it formed at first accurately cylindrical by which we avoid these calculations and estimates the instrument i have been describing was constructed with great accuracy and uncommon skill by mr meignie junior engineer and physical instrumentmaker it is a most valuable instrument from the great number of purposes to which it is applicable and indeed there are many experiments which are almost impossible to be performed without it it becomes expensive because in many experiments such as the formation of water and of nitric acid it is absolutely necessary to employ two of the same machines in the present advanced state of chemistry very expensive and complicated instruments are become indispensibly necessary for ascertaining the analysis and synthesis of bodies with the requisite precision as to quantity and proportion it is certainly proper to endeavour to simplify these and to render them less costly but this ought by no means to be attempted at the expence of their conveniency of application and much less of their accuracy sect iii some other methods of measuring the volume of gasses the gazometer described in the foregoing section is too costly and too complicated for being generally used in laboratories for measuring the gasses and is not even applicable to every circumstance of this kind in numerous series of experiments more simple and more readily applicable methods must be employed for this purpose i shall describe the means i used before i was in possession of a gazometer and which i still use in preference to it in the ordinary course of my experiments suppose that after an experiment there is a residuum of gas neither absorbable by alkali nor water contained in the upper part of the jar aef pl iv fig 3 standing on the shelf of a pneumatochemical apparatus of which we wish to ascertain the quantity we must first mark the height to which the mercury or water rises in the jar with great exactness by means of slips of paper pasted in several parts round the jar if we have been operating in mercury we begin by displacing the mercury from the jar by introducing water in its stead this is readily done by filling a bottle quite full of water having stopped it with your finger turn it up and introduce its mouth below the edge of the jar then turning down its body again the mercury by its gravity falls into the bottle and the water rises in the jar and takes the place occupied by the mercury when this is accomplished pour so much water into the cistern abcd as will stand about an inch over the surface of the mercury then pass the dish bc pl v fig 9 under the jar and carry it to the water cistern fig 1 and 2 we here exchange the gas into another jar which has been previously graduated in the manner to be afterwards described and we thus judge of the quantity or volume of the gas by means of the degrees which it occupies in the graduated jar there is another method of determining the volume of gas which may either be substituted in place of the one above described or may be usefully employed as a correction or proof of that method after the air or gas is exchanged from the first jar marked with slips of paper into the graduated jar turn up the mouth of the marked jar and fill it with water exactly to the marks ef pl iv fig 3 and by weighing the water we determine the volume of the air or gas it contained allowing one cubical foot or 1728 cubical inches of water for each 70 pounds french weight the manner of graduating jars for this purpose is very easy and we ought to be provided with several of different sizes and even several of each size in case of accidents take a tall narrow and strong glass jar and having filled it with water in the cistern pl v fig 1 place it upon the shelf abcd we ought always to use the same place for this operation that the level of the shelf may be always exactly similar by which almost the only error to which this process is liable will be avoided then take a narrow mouthed phial which holds exactly 6 oz 3 gros 61 grs of water which corresponds to 10 cubical inches if you have not one exactly of this dimension choose one a little larger and diminish its capacity to the size requisite by dropping in a little melted wax and rosin this bottle serves the purpose of a standard for gaging the jars make the air contained in this bottle pass into the jar and mark exactly the place to which the water has descended add another measure of air and again mark the place of the water and so on till all the water be displaced it is of great consequence that during the course of this operation the bottle and jar be kept at the same temperature with the water in the cistern and for this reason we must avoid keeping the hands upon either as much as possible or if we suspect they have been heated we must cool them by means of the water in the cistern the height of the barometer and thermometer during this experiment is of no consequence when the marks have been thus ascertained upon the jar for every ten cubical inches we engrave a scale upon one of its sides by means of a diamond pencil glass tubes are graduated in the same manner for using in the mercurial apparatus only they must be divided into cubical inches and tenths of a cubical inch the bottle used for gaging these must hold 8 oz 6 gros 25 grs of mercury which exactly corresponds to a cubical inch of that metal the method of determining the volume of air or gas by means of a graduated jar has the advantage of not requiring any correction for the difference of height between the surface of the water within the jar and in the cistern but it requires corrections with respect to the height of the barometer and thermometer but when we ascertain the volume of air by weighing the water which the jar is capable of containing up to the marks ef it is necessary to make a farther correction for the difference between the surface of the water in the cistern and the height to which it rises within the jar this will be explained in the fifth section of this chapter sect iv of the method of separating the different gasses from each other as experiments often produce two three or more species of gas it is necessary to be able to separate these from each other that we may ascertain the quantity and species of each suppose that under the jar a pl iv fig 3 is contained a quantity of different gasses mixed together and standing over mercury we begin by marking with slips of paper as before directed the height at which the mercury stands within the glass then introduce about a cubical inch of water into the jar which will swim over the surface of the mercury if the mixture of gas contains any muriatic or sulphurous acid gas a rapid and considerable absorption will instantly take place from the strong tendency these two gasses have especially the former to combine with or be absorbed by water if the water only produces a slight absorption of gas hardly equal to its own bulk we conclude that the mixture neither contains muriatic acid sulphuric acid or ammoniacal gas but that it contains carbonic acid gas of which water only absorbs about its own bulk to ascertain this conjecture introduce some solution of caustic alkali and the carbonic acid gas will be gradually absorbed in the course of a few hours it combines with the caustic alkali or potash and the remaining gas is left almost perfectly free from any sensible residuum of carbonic acid gas after each experiment of this kind we must carefully mark the height at which the mercury stands within the jar by slips of paper pasted on and varnished over when dry that they may not be washed off when placed in the water apparatus it is likewise necessary to register the difference between the surface of the mercury in the cistern and that in the jar and the height of the barometer and thermometer at the end of each experiment when all the gas or gasses absorbable by water and potash are absorbed water is admitted into the jar to displace the mercury and as is described in the preceding section the mercury in the cistern is to be covered by one or two inches of water after this the jar is to be transported by means of the flat dish bc pl v fig 9 into the water apparatus and the quantity of gas remaining is to be ascertained by changing it into a graduated jar after this small trials of it are to be made by experiments in little jars to ascertain nearly the nature of the gas in question for instance into a small jar full of the gas fig 8 pl v a lighted taper is introduced if the taper is not immediately extinguished we conclude the gas to contain oxygen gas and in proportion to the brightness of the flame we may judge if it contain less or more oxygen gas than atmospheric air contains if on the contrary the taper be instantly extinguished we have strong reason to presume that the residuum is chiefly composed of azotic gas if upon the approach of the taper the gas takes fire and burns quietly at the surface with a white flame we conclude it to be pure hydrogen gas if this flame is blue we judge it consists of carbonated hydrogen gas and if it takes fire with a sudden deflagration that it is a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen gas if again upon mixing a portion of the residuum with oxygen gas red fumes are produced we conclude that it contains nitrous gas these preliminary trials give some general knowledge of the properties of the gas and nature of the mixture but are not sufficient to determine the proportions and quantities of the several gasses of which it is composed for this purpose all the methods of analysis must be employed and to direct these properly it is of great use to have a previous approximation by the above methods suppose for instance we know that the residuum consists of oxygen and azotic gas mixed together put a determinate quantity 100 parts into a graduated tube of ten or twelve lines diameter introduce a solution of sulphuret of potash in contact with the gas and leave them together for some days the sulphuret absorbs the whole oxygen gas and leaves the azotic gas pure if it is known to contain hydrogen gas a determinate quantity is introduced into voltas eudiometer alongst with a known proportion of hydrogen gas these are deflagrated together by means of the electrical spark fresh portions of oxygen gas are successively added till no farther deflagration takes place and till the greatest possible diminution is produced by this process water is formed which is immediately absorbed by the water of the apparatus but if the hydrogen gas contain charcoal carbonic acid is formed at the same time which is not absorbed so quickly the quantity of this is readily ascertained by assisting its absorption by means of agitation if the residuum contains nitrous gas by adding oxygen gas with which it combines into nitric acid we can very nearly ascertain its quantity from the diminution produced by this mixture i confine myself to these general examples which are sufficient to give an idea of this kind of operations a whole volume would not serve to explain every possible case it is necessary to become familiar with the analysis of gasses by long experience we must even acknowledge that they mostly possess such powerful affinities to each other that we are not always certain of having separated them completely in these cases we must vary our experiments in every possible point of view add new agents to the combination and keep out others and continue our trials till we are certain of the truth and exactitude of our conclusions sect v of the necessary corrections upon the volume of the gasses according to the pressure of the atmosphere all elastic fluids are compressible or condensible in proportion to the weight with which they are loaded perhaps this law which is ascertained by general experience may suffer some irregularity when these fluids are under a degree of condensation almost sufficient to reduce them to the liquid state or when either in a state of extreme rarefaction or condensation but we seldom approach either of these limits with most of the gasses which we submit to our experiments i understand this proposition of gasses being compressible in proportion to their superincumbent weights as follows a barometer which is an instrument generally known is properly speaking a species of syphon abcd pl xii fig 16 whose leg ab is filled with mercury whilst the leg cd is full of air if we suppose the branch cd indefinitely continued till it equals the height of our atmosphere we can readily conceive that the barometer is in reality a sort of balance in which a column of mercury stands in equilibrium with a column of air of the same weight but it is unnecessary to prolongate the branch cd to such a height as it is evident that the barometer being immersed in air the column of mercury ab will be equally in equilibrium with a column of air of the same diameter though the leg cd be cut off at c and the part cd be taken away altogether the medium height of mercury in equilibrium with the weight of a column of air from the highest part of the atmosphere to the surface of the earth is about twentyeight french inches in the lower parts of the city of paris or in other words the air at the surface of the earth at paris is usually pressed upon by a weight equal to that of a column of mercury twentyeight inches in height i must be understood in this way in the several parts of this publication when talking of the different gasses as for instance when the cubical foot of oxygen gas is said to weigh 1 oz 4 gros under 28 inches pressure the height of this column of mercury supported by the pressure of the air diminishes in proportion as we are elevated above the surface of the earth or rather above the level of the sea because the mercury can only form an equilibrium with the column of air which is above it and is not in the smallest degree affected by the air which is below its level in what ratio does the mercury in the barometer descend in proportion to its elevation or what is the same thing according to what law or ratio do the several strata of the atmosphere decrease in density this question which has exercised the ingenuity of natural philosophers during last century is considerably elucidated by the following experiment if we take the glass syphon abcde pl xii fig 17 shut at e and open at a and introduce a few drops of mercury so as to intercept the communication of air between the leg ab and the leg be it is evident that the air contained in bcde is pressed upon in common with the whole surrounding air by a weight or column of air equal to 28 inches of mercury but if we pour 28 inches of mercury into the leg ab it is plain the air in the branch bcde will now be pressed upon by a weight equal to twice 28 inches of mercury or twice the weight of the atmosphere and experience shows that in this case the included air instead of filling the tube from b to e only occupies from c to e or exactly one half of the space it filled before if to this first column of mercury we add two other portions of 28 inches each in the branch ab the air in the branch bcde will be pressed upon by four times the weight of the atmosphere or four times the weight of 28 inches of mercury and it will then only fill the space from d to e or exactly one quarter of the space it occupied at the commencement of the experiment from these experiments which may be infinitely varied has been deduced as a general law of nature which seems applicable to all permanently elastic fluids that they diminish in volume in proportion to the weights with which they are pressed upon or in other words the volume of all elastic fluids is in the inverse ratio of the weight by which they are compressed the experiments which have been made for measuring the heights of mountains by means of the barometer confirm the truth of these deductions and even supposing them in some degree inaccurate these differences are so extremely small that they may be reckoned as nullities in chemical experiments when this law of the compression of elastic fluids is once well understood it becomes easily applicable to the corrections necessary in pneumato chemical experiments upon the volume of gas in relation to its pressure these corrections are of two kinds the one relative to the variations of the barometer and the other for the column of water or mercury contained in the jars i shall endeavour to explain these by examples beginning with the most simple case suppose that 100 cubical inches of oxygen gas are obtained at 10 545 of the thermometer and at 28 inches 6 lines of the barometer it is required to know what volume the 100 cubical inches of gas would occupy under the pressure of 28 inches58 and what is the exact weight of the 100 inches of oxygen gas let the unknown volume or the number of inches this gas would occupy at 28 inches of the barometer be expressed by x and since the volumes are in the inverse ratio of their superincumbent weights we have the following statement 100 cubical inches is to x inversely as 285 inches of pressure is to 280 inches or directly 28 285 100 x 101786cubical inches at 28 inches barometrical pressure that is to say the same gas or air which at 285 inches of the barometer occupies 100 cubical inches of volume will occupy 101786 cubical inches when the barometer is at 28 inches it is equally easy to calculate the weight of this gas occupying 100 cubical inches under 285 inches of barometrical pressure for as it corresponds to 101786 cubical inches at the pressure of 28 and as at this pressure and at 10 545 of temperature each cubical inch of oxygen gas weighs half a grain it follows that 100 cubical inches under 285 barometrical pressure must weigh 50893 grains this conclusion might have been formed more directly as since the volume of elastic fluids is in the inverse ratio of their compression their weights must be in the direct ratio of the same compression hence since 100 cubical inches weigh 50 grains under the pressure of 28 inches we have the following statement to determine the weight of 100 cubical inches of the same gas as 285 barometrical pressure 28 50 285 x the unknown quantity 50893 the following case is more complicated suppose the jar a pl xii fig 18 to contain a quantity of gas in its upper part acd the rest of the jar below cd being full of mercury and the whole standing in the mercurial bason or reservoir ghik filled with mercury up to ef and that the difference between the surface cd of the mercury in the jar and ef that in the cistern is six inches while the barometer stands at 275 inches it is evident from these data that the air contained in acd is pressed upon by the weight of the atmosphere diminished by the weight of the column of mercury ce or by 275 6 215 inches of barometrical pressure this air is therefore less compressed than the atmosphere at the mean height of the barometer and consequently occupies more space than it would occupy at the mean pressure the difference being exactly proportional to the difference between the compressing weights if then upon measuring the space acd it is found to be 120 cubical inches it must be reduced to the volume which it would occupy under the mean pressure of 28 inches this is done by the following statement 120 x the unknown volume 215 28 inversely this gives x 120 215 28 92143 cubical inches in these calculations we may either reduce the height of the mercury in the barometer and the difference of level in the jar and bason into lines or decimal fractions of the inch but i prefer the latter as it is more readily calculated as in these operations which frequently recur it is of great use to have means of abbreviation i have given a table in the appendix for reducing lines and fractions of lines into decimal fractions of the inch in experiments performed in the waterapparatus we must make similar corrections to procure rigorously exact results by taking into account and making allowances for the difference of height of the water within the jar above the surface of the water in the cistern but as the pressure of the atmosphere is expressed in inches and lines of the mercurial barometer and as homogeneous quantities only can be calculated together we must reduce the observed inches and lines of water into correspondent heights of the mercury i have given a table in the appendix for this conversion upon the supposition that mercury is 135681 times heavier than water sect vi of corrections relative to the degrees of the thermometer in ascertaining the weight of gasses besides reducing them to a mean of barometrical pressure as directed in the preceding section we must likewise reduce them to a standard thermometrical temperature because all elastic fluids being expanded by heat and condensed by cold their weight in any determinate volume is thereby liable to considerable alterations as the temperature of 10 545 is a medium between the heat of summer and the cold of winter being the temperature of subterraneous places and that which is most easily approached to at all seasons i have chosen that degree as a mean to which i reduce air or gas in this species of calculation mr de luc found that atmospheric air was increased 1215 part of its bulk by each degree of a mercurial thermometer divided into 81 degrees between the freezing and boiling points this gives 1211 part for each degree of reaumurs thermometer which is divided into 80 degrees between these two points the experiments of mr monge seem to make this dilatation less for hydrogen gas which he thinks is only dilated 1180 we have not any exact experiments hitherto published respecting the ratio of dilatation of the other gasses but from the trials which have been made their dilatation seems to differ little from that of atmospheric air hence i may take for granted till farther experiments give us better information upon this subject that atmospherical air is dilated 1210 part and hydrogen gas 1190 part for each degree of the thermometer but as there is still great uncertainty upon this point we ought always to operate in a temperature as near as possible to the standard of 10 545 by this means any errors in correcting the weight or volume of gasses by reducing them to the common standard will become of little moment the calculation for this correction is extremely easy divide the observed volume of air by 210 and multiply the quotient by the degrees of temperature above or below 10 545 this correction is negative when the actual temperature is above the standard and positive when below by the use of logarithmical tables this calculation is much facilitated59 sect vii example for calculating the corrections relative to the variations of pressure and temperature case in the jar a pl iv fig 3 standing in a water apparatus is contained 353 cubical inches of air the surface of the water within the jar at ef is 412 inches above the water in the cistern the barometer is at 27 inches 912 lines and the thermometer at 15 6575 having burnt a quantity of phosphorus in the air by which concrete phosphoric acid is produced the air after the combustion occupies 295 cubical inches the water within the jar stands 7 inches above that in the cistern the barometer is at 27 inches 914 lines and the thermometer at 16 68 it is required from these data to determine the actual volume of air before and after combustion and the quantity absorbed during the process calculation before combustion the air in the jar before combustion was 353 cubical inches but it was only under a barometrical pressure of 27 inches 912 lines which reduced to decimal fractions by tab i of the appendix gives 2779167 inches and from this we must deduct the difference of 412 inches of water which by tab ii corresponds to 033166 inches of the barometer hence the real pressure of the air in the jar is 2746001 as the volume of elastic fluids diminish in the inverse ratio of the compressing weights we have the following statement to reduce the 353 inches to the volume the air would occupy at 28 inches barometrical pressure 353 x the unknown volume 2746001 28 hence x 353 2746001 28 346192 cubical inches which is the volume the same quantity of air would have occupied at 28 inches of the barometer the 210th part of this corrected volume is 165 which for the five degrees of temperature above the standard gives 8255 cubical inches and as this correction is subtractive the real corrected volume of the air before combustion is 337942 inches calculation after combustion by a similar calculation upon the volume of air after combustion we find its barometrical pressure 2777083 051593 2725490 hence to have the volume of air under the pressure of 28 inches 295 x 2777083 28 inversely or x 295 x 2725490 28 287150 the 210th part of this corrected volume is 1368 which multiplied by 6 degrees of thermometrical difference gives the subtractive correction for temperature 8208 leaving the actual corrected volume of air after combustion 278942 inches result the corrected volume before combustion 337942 ditto remaining after combustion 278942 volume absorbed during combustion 59000 sect viii method of determining the absolute gravity of the different gasses take a large balloon a pl v fig 10 capable of holding 17 or 18 pints or about half a cubical foot having the brass cap bcde strongly cemented to its neck and to which the tube and stopcock f g is fixed by a tight screw this apparatus is connected by the double screw represented separately at fig 12 to the jar bcd fig 10 which must be some pints larger in dimensions than the balloon this jar is open at top and is furnished with the brass cap h i and stopcock l m one of these slopcocks is represented separately at fig 11 we first determine the exact capacity of the balloon by filling it with water and weighing it both full and empty when emptied of water it is dried with a cloth introduced through its neck d e and the last remains of moisture are removed by exhausting it once or twice in an airpump when the weight of any gas is to be ascertained this apparatus is used as follows fix the balloon a to the plate of an airpump by means of the screw of the stopcock f g which is left open the balloon is to be exhausted as completely as possible observing carefully the degree of exhaustion by means of the barometer attached to the airpump when the vacuum is formed the stopcock f g is shut and the weight of the balloon determined with the most scrupulous exactitude it is then fixed to the jar bcd which we suppose placed in water in the shelf of the pneumato chemical apparatus fig 1 the jar is to be filled with the gas we mean to weigh and then by opening the stopcocks f g and l m the gas ascends into the balloon whilst the water of the cistern rises at the same time into the jar to avoid very troublesome corrections it is necessary during this first part of the operation to sink the jar in the cistern till the surfaces of the water within the jar and without exactly correspond the stopcocks are again shut and the balloon being unscrewed from its connection with the jar is to be carefully weighed the difference between this weight and that of the exhausted balloon is the precise weight of the air or gas contained in the balloon multiply this weight by 1728 the number of cubical inches in a cubical foot and divide the product by the number of cubical inches contained in the balloon the quotient is the weight of a cubical foot of the gas or air submitted to experiment exact account must be kept of the barometrical height and temperature of the thermometer during the above experiment and from these the resulting weight of a cubical foot is easily corrected to the standard of 28 inches and 10 as directed in the preceding section the small portion of air remaining in the balloon after forming the vacuum must likewise be attended to which is easily determined by the barometer attached to the airpump if that barometer for instance remains at the hundredth part of the height it stood at before the vacuum was formed we conclude that one hundredth part of the air originally contained remained in the balloon and consequently that only 99100 of gas was introduced from the jar into the balloon footnotes 58 according to the proportion of 114 to 107 given between the french and english foot 28 inches of the french barometer are equal to 2983 inches of the english directions will be found in the appendix for converting all the french weights and measures used in this work into corresponding english denominationse 59 when fahrenheits thermometer is employed the dilatation by each degree must be smaller in the proportion of 1 to 225 because each degree of reaumurs scale contains 225 degrees of fahrenheit hence we must divide by 4725 and finish the rest of the calculation as abovee chap iii description of the calorimeter or apparatus for measuring caloric the calorimeter or apparatus for measuring the relative quantities of heat contained in bodies was described by mr de la place and me in the memoirs of the academy for 1780 p 355 and from that essay the materials of this chapter are extracted if after having cooled any body to the freezing point it be exposed in an atmosphere of 25 8825 the body will gradually become heated from the surface inwards till at last it acquire the same temperature with the surrounding air but if a piece of ice be placed in the same situation the circumstances are quite different it does not approach in the smallest degree towards the temperature of the circumambient air but remains constantly at zero 32 or the temperature of melting ice till the last portion of ice be completely melted this phenomenon is readily explained as to melt ice or reduce it to water it requires to be combined with a certain portion of caloric the whole caloric attracted from the surrounding bodies is arrested or fixed at the surface or external layer of ice which it is employed to dissolve and combines with it to form water the next quantity of caloric combines with the second layer to dissolve it into water and so on successively till the whole ice be dissolved or converted into water by combination with caloric the very last atom still remaining at its former temperature because the caloric has never penetrated so far as long as any intermediate ice remained to melt upon these principles if we conceive a hollow sphere of ice at the temperature of zero 32 placed in an atmosphere 10 545 and containing a substance at any degree of temperature above freezing it follows 1st that the heat of the external atmosphere cannot penetrate into the internal hollow of the sphere of ice 2dly that the heat of the body placed in the hollow of the sphere cannot penetrate outwards beyond it but will be stopped at the internal surface and continually employed to melt successive layers of ice until the temperature of the body be reduced to zero 32 by having all its superabundant caloric above that temperature carried off by the ice if the whole water formed within the sphere of ice during the reduction of the temperature of the included body to zero be carefully collected the weight of the water will be exactly proportional to the quantity of caloric lost by the body in passing from its original temperature to that of melting ice for it is evident that a double quantity of caloric would have melted twice the quantity of ice hence the quantity of ice melted is a very exact measure of the quantity of caloric employed to produce that effect and consequently of the quantity lost by the only substance that could possibly have supplied it i have made this supposition of what would take place in a hollow sphere of ice for the purpose of more readily explaining the method used in this species of experiment which was first conceived by mr de la place it would be difficult to procure such spheres of ices and inconvenient to make use of them when got but by means of the following apparatus we have remedied that defect i acknowledge the name of calorimeter which i have given it as derived partly from greek and partly from latin is in some degree open to criticism but in matters of science a slight deviation from strict etymology for the sake of giving distinctness of idea is excusable and i could not derive the name entirely from greek without approaching too near to the names of known instruments employed for other purposes the calorimeter is represented in pl vi it is shown in perspective at fig 1 and its interior structure is engraved in fig 2 and 3 the former being a horizontal and the latter a perpendicular section its capacity or cavity is divided into three parts which for better distinction i shall name the interior middle and external cavities the interior cavity f f f f fig 4 into which the substances submitted to experiment are put is composed of a grating or cage of iron wire supported by several iron bars its opening or mouth lm is covered by the lid hg of the same materials the middle cavity b b b b fig 2 and 3 is intended to contain the ice which surrounds the interior cavity and which is to be melted by the caloric of the substance employed in the experiment the ice is supported by the grate m m at the bottom of the cavity under which is placed the sieve n n these two are represented separately in fig 5 and 6 in proportion as the ice contained in the middle cavity is melted by the caloric disengaged from the body placed in the interior cavity the water runs through the grate and sieve and falls through the conical funnel c c d fig 3 and tube x y into the receiver f fig 1 this water may be retained or let out at pleasure by means of the stopcock u the external cavity a a a a fig 2 and 3 is filled with ice to prevent any effect upon the ice in the middle cavity from the heat of the surrounding air and the water produced from it is carried off through the pipe st which shuts by means of the stopcock r the whole machine is covered by the lid ff fig 7 made of tin painted with oil colour to prevent rust when this machine is to be employed the middle cavity b b b b fig 2 and 3 the lid gh fig 4 of the interior cavity the external cavity a a a a fig 2 and 3 and the general lid ff fig 7 are all filled with pounded ice well rammed so that no void spaces remain and the ice of the middle cavity is allowed to drain the machine is then opened and the substance submitted to experiment being placed in the interior cavity it is instantly closed after waiting till the included body is completely cooled to the freezing point and the whole melted ice has drained from the middle cavity the water collected in the vessel f fig 1 is accurately weighed the weight of the water produced during the experiment is an exact measure of the caloric disengaged during the cooling of the included body as this substance is evidently in a similar situation with the one formerly mentioned as included in a hollow sphere of ice the whole caloric disengaged is stopped by the ice in the middle cavity and that ice is preserved from being affected by any other heat by means of the ice contained in the general lid fig 7 and in the external cavity experiments of this kind last from fifteen to twenty hours they are sometimes accelerated by covering up the substance in the interior cavity with well drained ice which hastens its cooling the substances to be operated upon are placed in the thin iron bucket fig 8 the cover of which has an opening fitted with a cork into which a small thermometer is fixed when we use acids or other fluids capable of injuring the metal of the instruments they are contained in the matras fig 10 which has a similar thermometer in a cork fitted to its mouth and which stands in the interior cavity upon the small cylindrical support rs fig 10 it is absolutely requisite that there be no communication between the external and middle cavities of the calorimeter otherwise the ice melted by the influence of the surrounding air in the external cavity would mix with the water produced from the ice of the middle cavity which would no longer be a measure of the caloric lost by the substance submitted to experiment when the temperature of the atmosphere is only a few degrees above the freezing point its heat can hardly reach the middle cavity being arrested by the ice of the cover fig 7 and of the external cavity but if the temperature of the air be under the degree of freezing it might cool the ice contained in the middle cavity by causing the ice in the external cavity to fall in the first place below zero 32 it is therefore essential that this experiment be carried on in a temperature somewhat above freezing hence in time of frost the calorimeter must be kept in an apartment carefully heated it is likewise necessary that the ice employed be not under zero 32 for which purpose it must be pounded and spread out thin for some time in a place of a higher temperature the ice of the interior cavity always retains a certain quantity of water adhering to its surface which may be supposed to belong to the result of the experiment but as at the beginning of each experiment the ice is already saturated with as much water as it can contain if any of the water produced by the caloric should remain attached to the ice it is evident that very nearly an equal quantity of what adhered to it before the experiment must have run down into the vessel f in its stead for the inner surface of the ice in the middle cavity is very little changed during the experiment by any contrivance that could be devised we could not prevent the access of the external air into the interior cavity when the atmosphere was 9 or 10 52 or 54 above zero the air confined in the cavity being in that case specifically heavier than the external air escapes downwards through the pipe x y fig 3 and is replaced by the warmer external air which giving out its caloric to the ice becomes heavier and sinks in its turn thus a current of air is formed through the machine which is the more rapid in proportion as the external air exceeds the internal in temperature this current of warm air must melt a part of the ice and injure the accuracy of the experiment we may in a great degree guard against this source of error by keeping the stopcock u continually shut but it is better to operate only when the temperature of the external air does not exceed 3 or at most 4 39 to 41 for we have observed that in this case the melting of the interior ice by the atmospheric air is perfectly insensible so that we may answer for the accuracy of our experiments upon the specific heat of bodies to a fortieth part we have caused make two of the above described machines one which is intended for such experiments as do not require the interior air to be renewed is precisely formed according to the description here given the other which answers for experiments upon combustion respiration c in which fresh quantities of air are indispensibly necessary differs from the former in having two small tubes in the two lids by which a current of atmospheric air may be blown into the interior cavity of the machine it is extremely easy with this apparatus to determine the phenomena which occur in operations where caloric is either disengaged or absorbed if we wish for instance to ascertain the quantity of caloric which is disengaged from a solid body in cooling a certain number of degrees let its temperature be raised to 80 212 it is then placed in the interior cavity f f f f fig 2 and 3 of the calorimeter and allowed to remain till we are certain that its temperature is reduced to zero 32 the water produced by melting the ice during its cooling is collected and carefully weighed and this weight divided by the volume of the body submitted to experiment multiplied into the degrees of temperature which it had above zero at the commencement of the experiment gives the proportion of what the english philosophers call specific heat fluids are contained in proper vessels whose specific heat has been previously ascertained and operated upon in the machine in the same manner as directed for solids taking care to deduct from the quantity of water melted during the experiment the proportion which belongs to the containing vessel if the quantity of caloric disengaged during the combination of different substances is to be determined these substances are to be previously reduced to the freezing degree by keeping them a sufficient time surrounded with pounded ice the mixture is then to be made in the inner cavity of the calorimeter in a proper vessel likewise reduced to zero 32 and they are kept inclosed till the temperature of the combination has returned to the same degree the quantity of water produced is a measure of the caloric disengaged during the combination to determine the quantity of caloric disengaged during combustion and during animal respiration the combustible bodies are burnt or the animals are made to breathe in the interior cavity and the water produced is carefully collected guinea pigs which resist the effects of cold extremely well are well adapted for this experiment as the continual renewal of air is absolutely necessary in such experiments we blow fresh air into the interior cavity of the calorimeter by means of a pipe destined for that purpose and allow it to escape through another pipe of the same kind and that the heat of this air may not produce errors in the results of the experiments the tube which conveys it into the machine is made to pass through pounded ice that it may be reduced to zero 32 before it arrives at the calorimeter the air which escapes must likewise be made to pass through a tube surrounded with ice included in the interior cavity of the machine and the water which is produced must make a part of what is collected because the caloric disengaged from this air is part of the product of the experiment it is somewhat more difficult to determine the specific caloric contained in the different gasses on account of their small degree of density for if they are only placed in the calorimeter in vessels like other fluids the quantity of ice melted is so small that the result of the experiment becomes at best very uncertain for this species of experiment we have contrived to make the air pass through two metallic worms or spiral tubes one of these through which the air passes and becomes heated in its way to the calorimeter is contained in a vessel full of boiling water and the other through which the air circulates within the calorimeter to disengage its caloric is placed in the interior cavity f f f f of that machine by means of a small thermometer placed at one end of the second worm the temperature of the air as it enters the calorimeter is determined and its temperature in getting out of the interior cavity is found by another thermometer placed at the other end of the worm by this contrivance we are enabled to ascertain the quantity of ice melted by determinate quantities of air or gas while losing a certain number of degrees of temperature and consequently to determine their several degrees of specific caloric the same apparatus with some particular precautions may be employed to ascertain the quantity of caloric disengaged by the condensation of the vapours of different liquids the various experiments which may be made with the calorimeter do not afford absolute conclusions but only give us the measure of relative quantities we have therefore to fix a unit or standard point from whence to form a scale of the several results the quantity of caloric necessary to melt a pound of ice has been chosen as this unit and as it requires a pound of water of the temperature of 60 167 to melt a pound of ice the quantity of caloric expressed by our unit or standard point is what raises a pound of water from zero 32 to 60 167 when this unit is once determined we have only to express the quantities of caloric disengaged from different bodies by cooling a certain number of degrees in analogous values the following is an easy mode of calculation for this purpose applied to one of our earliest experiments we took 7 lib 11 oz 2 gros 36 grs of plateiron cut into narrow slips and rolled up or expressing the quantity in decimals 77070319 these being heated in a bath of boiling water to about 78 2075 were quickly introduced into the interior cavity of the calorimeter at the end of eleven hours when the whole quantity of water melted from the ice had thoroughly drained off we found that 1109795 pounds of ice were melted hence the caloric disengaged from the iron by cooling 78 1755 having melted 1109795 pounds of ice how much would have been melted by cooling 60 135 this question gives the following statement in direct proportion 78 1109795 60 x 085369 dividing this quantity by the weight of the whole iron employed viz 77070319 the quotient 0110770 is the quantity of ice which would have been melted by one pound of iron whilst cooling through 60 135 of temperature fluid substances such as sulphuric and nitric acids c are contained in a matras pl vi fig 9 having a thermometer adapted to the cork with its bulb immersed in the liquid the matras is placed in a bath of boiling water and when from the thermometer we judge the liquid is raised to a proper temperature the matras is placed in the calorimeter the calculation of the products to determine the specific caloric of these fluids is made as above directed taking care to deduct from the water obtained the quantity which would have been produced by the matras alone which must be ascertained by a previous experiment the table of the results obtained by these experiments is omitted because not yet sufficiently complete different circumstances having occasioned the series to be interrupted it is not however lost sight of and we are less or more employed upon the subject every winter chap iv of mechanical operations for division of bodies sect i of trituration levigation and pulverization these are properly speaking only preliminary mechanical operations for dividing and separating the particles of bodies and reducing them into very fine powder these operations can never reduce substances into their primary or elementary and ultimate particles they do not even destroy the aggregation of bodies for every particle after the most accurate trituration forms a small whole resembling the original mass from which it was divided the real chemical operations on the contrary such as solution destroy the aggregation of bodies and separate their constituent and integrant particles from each other brittle substances are reduced to powder by means of pestles and mortars these are of brass or iron pl i fig 1 of marble or granite fig 2 of lignum vitae fig 3 of glass fig 4 of agate fig 5 or of porcellain fig 6 the pestles for each of these are represented in the plate immediately below the mortars to which they respectively belong and are made of hammered iron or brass of wood glass porcellain marble granite or agate according to the nature of the substances they are intended to triturate in every laboratory it is requisite to have an assortment of these utensils of various sizes and kinds those of porcellain and glass can only be used for rubbing substances to powder by a dexterous use of the pestle round the sides of the mortar as it would be easily broken by reiterated blows of the pestle the bottom of mortars ought to be in the form of a hollow sphere and their sides should have such a degree of inclination as to make the substances they contain fall back to the bottom when the pestle is lifted but not so perpendicular as to collect them too much together otherwise too large a quantity would get below the pestle and prevent its operation for this reason likewise too large a quantity of the substance to be powdered ought not to be put into the mortar at one time and we must from time to time get rid of the particles already reduced to powder by means of sieves to be afterwards described the most usual method of levigation is by means of a flat table abcd pl 1 fig 7 of porphyry or other stone of similar hardness upon which the substance to be reduced to powder is spread and is then bruised and rubbed by a muller m of the same hard materials the bottom of which is made a small portion of a large sphere and as the muller tends continually to drive the substances towards the sides of the table a thin flexible knife or spatula of iron horn wood or ivory is used for bringing them back to the middle of the stone in large works this operation is performed by means of large rollers of hard stone which turn upon each other either horizontally in the way of cornmills or by one vertical roller turning upon a flat stone in the above operations it is often requisite to moisten the substances a little to prevent the fine powder from flying off there are many bodies which cannot be reduced to powder by any of the foregoing methods such are fibrous substances as woods such as are tough and elastic as the horns of animals elastic gum c and the malleable metals which flatten under the pestle instead of being reduced to powder for reducing the woods to powder rasps as pl i fig 8 are employed files of a finer kind are used for horn and still finer pl 1 fig 9 and 10 for metals some of the metals though not brittle enough to powder under the pestle are too soft to be filed as they clog the file and prevent its operation zinc is one of these but it may be powdered when hot in a heated iron mortar or it may be rendered brittle by alloying it with a small quantity of mercury one or other of these methods is used by firework makers for producing a blue flame by means of zinc metals may be reduced into grains by pouring them when melted into water which serves very well when they are not wanted in fine powder fruits potatoes c of a pulpy and fibrous nature may be reduced to pulp by means of the grater pl 1 fig 11 the choice of the different substances of which these instruments are made is a matter of importance brass or copper are unfit for operations upon substances to be used as food or in pharmacy and marble or metallic instruments must not be used for acid substances hence mortars of very hard wood and those of porcelain granite or glass are of great utility in many operations sect ii of sifting and washing powdered substances none of the mechanical operations employed for reducing bodies to powder is capable of producing it of an equal degree of fineness throughout the powder obtained by the longest and most accurate trituration being still an assemblage of particles of various sizes the coarser of these are removed so as only to leave the finer and more homogeneous particles by means of sieves pl i fig 12 13 14 15 of different finenesses adapted to the particular purposes they are intended for all the powdered matter which is larger than the intestices of the sieve remains behind and is again submitted to the pestle while the finer pass through the sieve fig 12 is made of haircloth or of silk gauze and the one represented fig 13 is of parchment pierced with round holes of a proper size this latter is employed in the manufacture of gunpowder when very subtile or valuable materials are to be sifted which are easily dispersed or when the finer parts of the powder may be hurtful a compound sieve fig 15 is made use of which consists of the sieve abcd with a lid ef and receiver gh these three parts are represented as joined together for use fig 14 there is a method of procuring powders of an uniform fineness considerably more accurate than the sieve but it can only be used with such substances as are not acted upon by water the powdered substance is mixed and agitated with water or other convenient fluid the liquor is allowed to settle for a few moments and is then decanted off the coarsest powder remains at the bottom of the vessel and the finer passes over with the liquid by repeated decantations in this manner various sediments are obtained of different degrees of fineness the last sediment or that which remains longed suspended in the liquor being the finest this process may likewise be used with advantage for separating substances of different degrees of specific gravity though of the same fineness this last is chiefly employed in mining for separating the heavier metallic ores from the lighter earthy matters with which they are mixed in chemical laboratories pans and jugs of glass or earthen ware are employed for this operation sometimes for decanting the liquor without disturbing the sediment the glass syphon abchi pl ii fig 11 is used which may be supported by means of the perforated board de at the proper depth in the vessel fg to draw off all the liquor required into the receiver lm the principles and application of this useful instrument are so well known as to need no explanation sect iii of filtration a filtre is a species of very fine sieve which is permeable to the particles of fluids but through which the particles of the finest powdered solids are incapable of passing hence its use in separating fine powders from suspension in fluids in pharmacy very close and fine woollen cloths are chiefly used for this operation these are commonly formed in a conical shape pl ii fig 2 which has the advantage of uniting all the liquor which drains through into a point a where it may be readily collected in a narrow mouthed vessel in large pharmaceutical laboratories this filtring bag is streached upon a wooden stand pl ii fig 1 for the purposes of chemistry as it is requisite to have the filtres perfectly clean unsized paper is substituted instead of cloth or flannel through this substance no solid body however finely it be powdered can penetrate and fluids percolate through it with the greatest readiness as paper breaks easily when wet various methods of supporting it are used according to circumstances when a large quantity of fluid is to be filtrated the paper is supported by the frame of wood pl ii fig 3 abcd having a piece of coarse cloth stretched over it by means of ironhooks this cloth must be well cleaned each time it is used or even new cloth must be employed if there is reason to suspect its being impregnated with any thing which can injure the subsequent operations in ordinary operations where moderate quantities of fluid are to be filtrated different kinds of glass funnels are used for supporting the paper as represented pl ii fig 5 6 and 7 when several filtrations must be carried on at once the board or shelf ab fig 9 supported upon stands c and d and pierced with round holes is very convenient for containing the funnels some liquors are so thick and clammy as not to be able to penetrate through paper without some previous preparation such as clarification by means of white of eggs which being mixed with the liquor coagulates when brought to boil and entangling the greater part of the impurities of the liquor rises with them to the surface in the state of scum spiritous liquors may be clarified in the same manner by means of isinglass dissolved in water which coagulates by the action of the alkohol without the assistance of heat as most of the acids are produced by distillation and are consequently clear we have rarely any occasion to filtrate them but if at any time concentrated acids require this operation it is impossible to employ paper which would be corroded and destroyed by the acid for this purpose pounded glass or rather quartz or rockcristal broke in pieces and grossly powdered answers very well a few of the larger pieces are put in the neck of the funnel these are covered with the smaller pieces the finer powder is placed over all and the acid is poured on at top for the ordinary purposes of society riverwater is frequently filtrated by means of clean washed sand to separate its impurities sect iv of decantation this operation is often substituted instead of filtration for separating solid particles which are diffused through liquors these are allowed to settle in conical vessels abcde pl ii fig 10 the diffused matters gradually subside and the clear fluid is gently poured off if the sediment be extremely light and apt to mix again with the fluid by the slightest motion the syphon fig 11 is used instead of decantation for drawing off the clear fluid in experiments where the weight of the precipitate must be rigorously ascertained decantation is preferable to filtration providing the precipitate be several times washed in a considerable proportion of water the weight of the precipitate may indeed be ascertained by carefully weighing the filtre before and after the operation but when the quantity of precipitate is small the different proportions of moisture retained by the paper in a greater or lesser degree of exsiccation may prove a material source of error which ought carefully to be guarded against chap v of chemical means for separating the particles of bodies from each other without decomposition and for uniting them again i have already shown that there are two methods of dividing the particles of bodies the mechanical and chemical the former only separates a solid mass into a great number of smaller masses and for these purposes various species of forces are employed according to circumstances such as the strength of man or of animals the weight of water applied through the means of hydraulic engines the expansive power of steam the force of the wind c by all these mechanical powers we can never reduce substances into powder beyond a certain degree of fineness and the smallest particle produced in this way though it seems very minute to our organs is still in fact a mountain when compared with the ultimate elementary particles of the pulverized substance the chemical agents on the contrary divide bodies into their primitive particles if for instance a neutral salt be acted upon by these it is divided as far as is possible without ceasing to be a neutral salt in this chapter i mean to give examples of this kind of division of bodies to which i shall add some account of the relative operations sect i of the solution of salts in chemical language the terms of solution and dissolution have long been confounded and have very improperly been indiscriminately employed for expressing both the division of the particles of a salt in a fluid such as water and the division of a metal in an acid a few reflections upon the effects of these two operations will suffice to show that they ought not to be confounded together in the solution of salts the saline particles are only separated from each other whilst neither the salt nor the water are at all decomposed we are able to recover both the one and the other in the same quantity as before the operation the same thing takes place in the solution of resins in alkohol during metallic dissolutions on the contrary a decomposition either of the acid or of the water which dilutes it always takes place the metal combines with oxygen and is changed into an oxyd and a gasseous substance is disengaged so that in reality none of the substances employed remain after the operation in the same state they were in before this article is entirely confined to the consideration of solution to understand properly what takes place during the solution of salts it is necessary to know that in most of these operations two distinct effects are complicated together viz solution by water and solution by caloric and as the explanation of most of the phenomena of solution depends upon the distinction of these two circumstances i shall enlarge a little upon their nature nitrat of potash usually called nitre or saltpetre contains very little water of cristallization perhaps even none at all yet this salt liquifies in a degree of heat very little superior to that of boiling water this liquifaction cannot therefore be produced by means of the water of cristallization but in consequence of the salt being very fusible in its nature and from its passing from the solid to the liquid state of aggregation when but a little raised above the temperature of boiling water all salts are in this manner susceptible of being liquified by caloric but in higher or lower degrees of temperature some of these as the acetites of potash and soda liquify with a very moderate heat whilst others as sulphat of potash lime c require the strongest fires we are capable of producing this liquifaction of salts by caloric produces exactly the same phenomena with the melting of ice it is accomplished in each salt by a determinate degree of heat which remains invariably the same during the whole time of the liquifaction caloric is employed and becomes fixed during the melting of the salt and is on the contrary disengaged when the salt coagulates these are general phenomena which universally occur during the passage of every species of substance from the solid to the fluid state of aggregation and from fluid to solid these phenomena arising from solution by caloric are always less or more conjoined with those which take place during solutions in water we cannot pour water upon a salt on purpose to dissolve it without employing a compound solvent both water and caloric hence we may distinguish several different cases of solution according to the nature and mode of existence of each salt if for instance a salt be difficultly soluble in water and readily so by caloric it evidently follows that this salt will be difficultly soluble in cold water and considerably in hot water such is nitrat of potash and more especially oxygenated muriat of potash if another salt be little soluble both in water and caloric the difference of its solubility in cold and warm water will be very inconsiderable sulphat of lime is of this kind from these considerations it follows that there is a necessary relation between the following circumstances the solubility of a salt in cold water its solubility in boiling water and the degree of temperature at which the same salt liquifies by caloric unassisted by water and that the difference of solubility in hot and cold water is so much greater in proportion to its ready solution in caloric or in proportion to its susceptibility of liquifying in a low degree of temperature the above is a general view of solution but for want of particular facts and sufficiently exact experiments it is still nothing more than an approximation towards a particular theory the means of compleating this part of chemical science is extremely simple we have only to ascertain how much of each salt is dissolved by a certain quantity of water at different degrees of temperature and as by the experiments published by mr de la place and me the quantity of caloric contained in a pound of water at each degree of the thermometer is accurately known it will be very easy to determine by simple experiments the proportion of water and caloric required for solution by each salt what quantity of caloric is absorbed by each at the moment of liquifaction and how much is disengaged at the moment of cristallization hence the reason why salts are more rapidly soluble in hot than in cold water is perfectly evident in all solutions of salts caloric is employed when that is furnished intermediately from the surrounding bodies it can only arrive slowly to the salt whereas this is greatly accelerated when the requisite caloric exists ready combined with the water of solution in general the specific gravity of water is augmented by holding salts in solution but there are some exceptions to the rule some time hence the quantities of radical of oxygen and of base which constitute each neutral salt the quantity of water and caloric necessary for solution the increased specific gravity communicated to water and the figure of the elementary particles of the cristals will all be accurately known from these all the circumstances and phenomena of cristallization will be explained and by these means this part of chemistry will be compleated mr seguin has formed the plan of a thorough investigation of this kind which he is extremely capable of executing the solution of salts in water requires no particular apparatus small glass phials of different sizes pl ii fig 16 and 17 pans of earthern ware a fig 1 and 2 longnecked matrasses fig 14 and pans or basons of copper or of silver fig 13 and 15 answer very well for these operations sect ii of lixiviation this is an operation used in chemistry and manufactures for separating substances which are soluble in water from such as are insoluble the large vat or tub pl ii fig 12 having a hole d near its bottom containing a wooden spiget and fosset or metallic stopcock de is generally used for this purpose a thin stratum of straw is placed at the bottom of the tub over this the substance to be lixiviated is laid and covered by a cloth then hot or cold water according to the degree of solubility of the saline matter is poured on when the water is supposed to have dissolved all the saline parts it is let off by the stopcock and as some of the water charged with salt necessarily adheres to the straw and insoluble matters several fresh quantities of water are poured on the straw serves to secure a proper passage for the water and may be compared to the straws or glass rods used in filtrating to keep the paper from touching the sides of the funnel the cloth which is laid over the matters under lixiviation prevents the water from making a hollow in these substances where it is poured on through which it might escape without acting upon the whole mass this operation is less or more imitated in chemical experiments but as in these especially with analytical views greater exactness is required particular precautions must be employed so as not to leave any saline or soluble part in the residuum more water must be employed than in ordinary lixiviations and the substances ought to be previously stirred up in the water before the clear liquor is drawn off otherwise the whole mass might not be equally lixiviated and some parts might even escape altogether from the action of the water we must likewise employ fresh portions of water in considerable quantity until it comes off entirely free from salt which we may ascertain by means of the hydrometer formerly described in experiments with small quantities this operation is conveniently performed in jugs or matrasses of glass and by filtrating the liquor through paper in a glass funnel when the substance is in larger quantity it may be lixiviated in a kettle of boiling water and filtrated through paper supported by cloth in the wooden frame pl ii fig 3 and 4 and in operations in the large way the tub already mentioned must be used sect iii of evaporation this operation is used for separating two substances from each other of which one at least must be fluid and whose degrees of volatility are considerably different by this means we obtain a salt which has been dissolved in water in its concrete form the water by heating becomes combined with caloric which renders it volatile while the particles of the salt being brought nearer to each other and within the sphere of their mutual attraction unite into the solid state as it was long thought that the air had great influence upon the quantity of fluid evaporated it will be proper to point out the errors which this opinion has produced there certainly is a constant slow evaporation from fluids exposed to the free air and though this species of evaporation may be considered in some degree as a solution in air yet caloric has considerable influence in producing it as is evident from the refrigeration which always accompanies this process hence we may consider this gradual evaporation as a compound solution made partly in air and partly in caloric but the evaporation which takes place from a fluid kept continually boiling is quite different in its nature and in it the evaporation produced by the action of the air is exceedingly inconsiderable in comparison with that which is occasioned by caloric this latter species may be termed vaporization rather than evaporation this process is not accelerated in proportion to the extent of evaporating surface but in proportion to the quantities of caloric which combine with the fluid too free a current of cold air is often hurtful to this process as it tends to carry off caloric from the water and consequently retards its conversion into vapour hence there is no inconvenience produced by covering in a certain degree the vessels in which liquids are evaporated by continual boiling provided the covering body be of such a nature as does not strongly draw off the caloric or to use an expression of dr franklins provided it be a bad conductor of heat in this case the vapours escape through such opening as is left and at least as much is evaporated frequently more than when free access is allowed to the external air as during evaporation the fluid carried off by caloric is entirely lost being sacrificed for the sake of the fixed substances with which it was combined this process is only employed where the fluid is of small value as water for instance but when the fluid is of more consequence we have recourse to distillation in which process we preserve both the fixed substance and the volatile fluid the vessels employed for evaporation are basons or pans of copper silver or lead pl ii fig 13 and 15 or capsules of glass porcellain or stone ware pl ii a fig 1 and 2 pl iii fig 3 and 4 the best utensils for this purpose are made of the bottoms of glass retorts and matrasses as their equal thinness renders them more fit than any other kind of glass vessel for bearing a brisk fire and sudden alterations of heat and cold without breaking as the method of cutting these glass vessels is no where described in books i shall here give a description of it that they may be made by chemists for themselves out of spoiled retorts matrasses and recipients at a much cheaper rate than any which can be procured from glass manufacturers the instrument pl iii fig 5 consisting of an iron ring ac fixed to the rod ab having a wooden handle d is employed as follows make the ring red hot in the fire and put it upon the matrass g fig 6 which is to be cut when the glass is sufficiently heated throw on a little cold water and it will generally break exactly at the circular line heated by the ring small flasks or phials of thin glass are exceeding good vessels for evaporating small quantities of fluid they are very cheap and stand the fire remarkably one or more of these may be placed upon a second grate above the furnace pl iii fig 2 where they will only experience a gentle heat by this means a great number of experiments may be carried on at one time a glass retort placed in a sand bath and covered with a dome of baked earth pl iii fig 1 answers pretty well for evaporations but in this way it is always considerably slower and is even liable to accidents as the sand heats unequally and the glass cannot dilate in the same unequal manner the retort is very liable to break sometimes the sand serves exactly the office of the iron ring formerly mentioned for if a single drop of vapour condensed into liquid happens to fall upon the heated part of the vessel it breaks circularly at that place when a very intense fire is necessary earthen crucibles may be used but we generally use the word evaporation to express what is produced by the temperature of boiling water or not much higher sect iv of cristallization in this process the integrant parts of a solid body separated from each other by the intervention of a fluid are made to exert the mutual attraction of aggregation so as to coalesce and reproduce a solid mass when the particles of a body are only separated by caloric and the substance is thereby retained in the liquid state all that is necessary for making it cristallize is to remove a part of the caloric which is lodged between its particles or in other words to cool it if this refrigeration be slow and the body be at the same time left at rest its particles assume a regular arrangement and cristallization properly so called takes place but if the refrigeration is made rapidly or if the liquor be agitated at the moment of its passage to the concrete state the cristallization is irregular and confused the same phenomena occur with watery solutions or rather in those made partly in water and partly by caloric so long as there remains a sufficiency of water and caloric to keep the particles of the body asunder beyond the sphere of their mutual attraction the salt remains in the fluid state but whenever either caloric or water is not present in sufficient quantity and the attraction of the particles for each other becomes superior to the power which keeps them asunder the salt recovers its concrete form and the cristals produced are the more regular in proportion as the evaporation has been slower and more tranquilly performed all the phenomena we formerly mentioned as taking place during the solution of salts occur in a contrary sense during their cristallization caloric is disengaged at the instant of their assuming the solid state which furnishes an additional proof of salt being held in solution by the compound action of water and caloric hence to cause salts to cristallize which readily liquify by means of caloric it is not sufficient to carry off the water which held them in solution but the caloric united to them must likewise be removed nitrat of potash oxygenated muriat of potash alum sulphat of soda c are examples of this circumstance as to make these salts cristallize refrigeration must be added to evaporation such salts on the contrary as require little caloric for being kept in solution and which from that circumstance are nearly equally soluble in cold and warm water are cristallizable by simply carrying off the water which holds them in solution and even recover their solid state in boiling water such are sulphat of lime muriat of potash and of soda and several others the art of refining saltpetre depends upon these properties of salts and upon their different degrees of solubility in hot and cold water this salt as produced in the manufactories by the first operation is composed of many different salts some are deliquescent and not susceptible of being cristallized such as the nitrat and muriat of lime others are almost equally soluble in hot and cold water as the muriats of potash and of soda and lastly the saltpetre or nitrat of potash is greatly more soluble in hot than it is in cold water the operation is begun by pouring upon this mixture of salts as much water as will hold even the least soluble the muriats of soda and of potash in solution so long as it is hot this quantity readily dissolves all the saltpetre but upon cooling the greater part of this salt cristallizes leaving about a sixth part remaining dissolved and mixed with the nitrat of lime and the two muriats the nitre obtained by this process is still somewhat impregnated with other salts because it has been cristallized from water in which these abound it is completely purified from these by a second solution in a small quantity of boiling water and second cristallization the water remaining after these cristallizations of nitre is still loaded with a mixture of saltpetre and other salts by farther evaporation crude saltpetre or roughpetre as the workmen call it is procured from it and this is purified by two fresh solutions and cristallizations the deliquescent earthy salts which do not contain the nitric acid are rejected in this manufacture but those which consist of that acid neutralized by an earthy base are dissolved in water the earth is precipitated by means of potash and allowed to subside the clear liquor is then decanted evaporated and allowed to cristallize the above management for refining saltpetre may serve as a general rule for separating salts from each other which happen to be mixed together the nature of each must be considered the proportion in which each dissolves in given quantities of water and the different solubility of each in hot and cold water if to these we add the property which some salts possess of being soluble in alkohol or in a mixture of alkohol and water we have many resources for separating salts from each other by means of cristallization though it must be allowed that it is extremely difficult to render this separation perfectly complete the vessels used for cristallization are pans of earthen ware a pl ii fig 1 and 2 and large flat dishes pl iii fig 7 when a saline solution is to be exposed to a slow evaporation in the heat of the atmosphere with free access of air vessels of some depth pl iii fig 3 must be employed that there may be a considerable body of liquid by this means the cristals produced are of considerable size and remarkably regular in their figure every species of salt cristallizes in a peculiar form and even each salt varies in the form of its cristals according to circumstances which take place during cristallization we must not from thence conclude that the saline particles of each species are indeterminate in their figures the primative particles of all bodies especially of salts are perfectly constant in their specific forms but the cristals which form in our experiments are composed of congeries of minute particles which though perfectly equal in size and shape may assume very dissimilar arrangements and consequently produce a vast variety of regular forms which have not the smallest apparent resemblance to each other nor to the original cristal this subject has been very ably treated by the abb hay in several memoirs presented to the academy and in his work upon the structure of cristals it is only necessary to extend generally to the class of salts the principles he has particularly applied to some cristalized stones sect v of simple distillation as distillation has two distinct objects to accomplish it is divisible into simple and compound and in this section i mean to confine myself entirely to the former when two bodies of which one is more volatile than the other or has more affinity to caloric are submitted to distillation our intention is to separate them from each other the more volatile substance assumes the form of gas and is afterwards condensed by refrigeration in proper vessels in this case distillation like evaporation becomes a species of mechanical operation which separates two substances from each other without decomposing or altering the nature of either in evaporation our only object is to preserve the fixed body without paying any regard to the volatile matter whereas in distillation our principal attention is generally paid to the volatile substance unless when we intend to preserve both the one and the other hence simple distillation is nothing more than evaporation produced in close vessels the most simple distilling vessel is a species of bottle or matrass a pl iii fig 8 which has been bent from its original form bc to bd and which is then called a retort when used it is placed either in a reverberatory furnace pl xiii fig 2 or in a sand bath under a dome of baked earth pl iii fig 1 to receive and condense the products we adapt a recipient e pl iii fig 9 which is luted to the retort sometimes more especially in pharmaceutical operations the glass or stone ware cucurbit a with its capital b pl iii fig 12 or the glass alembic and capital fig 13 of one piece is employed this latter is managed by means of a tubulated opening t fitted with a ground stopper of cristal the capital both of the cucurbit and alembic has a furrow or trench r r intended for conveying the condensed liquor into the beak rs by which it runs out as in almost all distillations expansive vapours are produced which might burst the vessels employed we are under the necessity of having a small hole t fig 9 in the balloon or recipient through which these may find vent hence in this way of distilling all the products which are permanently ariform are entirely lost and even such as difficultly lose that state have not sufficient space to condense in the balloon this apparatus is not therefore proper for experiments of investigation and can only be admitted in the ordinary operations of the laboratory or in pharmacy in the article appropriated for compound distillation i shall explain the various methods which have been contrived for preserving the whole products from bodies in this process as glass or earthen vessels are very brittle and do not readily bear sudden alterations of heat and cold every well regulated laboratory ought to have one or more alembics of metal for distilling water spiritous liquors essential oils c this apparatus consists of a cucurbit and capital of tinned copper or brass pl iii fig 15 and 16 which when judged proper may be placed in the water bath d fig 17 in distillations especially of spiritous liquors the capital must be furnished with a refrigetory ss fig 16 kept continually filled with cold water when the water becomes heated it is let off by the stopcock r and renewed with a fresh supply of cold water as the fluid distilled is converted into gas by means of caloric furnished by the fire of the furnace it is evident that it could not condense and consequently that no distillation properly speaking could take place unless it is made to deposit in the capital all the caloric it received in the cucurbit with this view the sides of the capital must always be preserved at a lower temperature than is necessary for keeping the distilling substance in the state of gas and the water in the refrigetory is intended for this purpose water is converted into gas by the temperature of 80 212 alkohol by 67 18275 ether by 32 104 hence these substances cannot be distilled or rather they will fly off in the state of gas unless the temperature of the refrigetory be kept under these respective degrees in the distillation of spiritous and other expansive liquors the above described refrigetory is not sufficient for condensing all the vapours which arise in this case therefore instead of receiving the distilled liquor immediately from the beak tu of the capital into a recipient a worm is interposed between them this instrument is represented pl iii fig 18 contained in a worm tub of tinned copper it consists of a metallic tube bent into a considerable number of spiral revolutions the vessel which contains the worm is kept full of cold water which is renewed as it grows warm this contrivance is employed in all distilleries of spirits without the intervention of a capital and refrigetory properly so called the one represented in the plate is furnished with two worms one of them being particularly appropriated to distillations of odoriferous substances in some simple distillations it is necessary to interpose an adopter between the retort and receiver as shown pl iii fig 11 this may serve two different purposes either to separate two products of different degrees of volatility or to remove the receiver to a greater distance from the furnace that it may be less heated but these and several other more complicated instruments of ancient contrivance are far from producing the accuracy requisite in modern chemistry as will be readily perceived when i come to treat of compound distillation sect vi of sublimation this term is applied to the distillation of substances which condense in a concrete or solid form such as the sublimation of sulphur and of muriat of ammoniac or sal ammoniac these operations may be conveniently performed in the ordinary distilling vessels already described though in the sublimation of sulphur a species of vessels named alludels have been usually employed these are vessels of stone or porcelain ware which adjust to each other over a cucurbit containing the sulphur to be sublimed one of the best subliming vessels for substances which are not very volatile is a flask or phial of glass sunk about two thirds into a sand bath but in this way we are apt to lose a part of the products when these are wished to be entirely preserved we must have recourse to the pneumatochemical distilling apparatus to be described in the following chapter chap vi of pneumatochemical distillations metallic dissolutions and some other operations which require very complicated instruments sect i of compound and pneumatochemical distillations in the preceding chapter i have only treated of distillation as a simple operation by which two substances differing in degrees of volatility may be separated from each other but distillation often actually decomposes the substances submitted to its action and becomes one of the most complicated operations in chemistry in every distillation the substance distilled must be brought to the state of gas in the cucurbit or retort by combination with caloric in simple distillation this caloric is given out in the refrigeratory or in the worm and the substance again recovers its liquid or solid form but the substances submitted to compound distillation are absolutely decompounded one part as for instance the charcoal they contain remains fixed in the retort and all the rest of the elements are reduced to gasses of different kinds some of these are susceptible of being condensed and of recovering their solid or liquid forms whilst others are permanently ariform one part of these are absorbable by water some by the alkalies and others are not susceptible of being absorbed at all an ordinary distilling apparatus such as has been described in the preceding chapter is quite insufficient for retaining or for separating these diversified products and we are obliged to have recourse for this purpose to methods of a more complicated nature the apparatus i am about to describe is calculated for the most complicated distillations and may be simplified according to circumstances it consists of a tubulated glass retort a pl iv fig 1 having its beak fitted to a tubulated balloon or recipient bc to the upper orifice d of the balloon a bent tube defg is adjusted which at its other extremity g is plunged into the liquor contained in the bottle l with three necks xxx three other similar bottles are connected with this first one by means of three similar bent tubes disposed in the same manner and the farthest neck of the last bottle is connected with a jar in a pneumatochemical apparatus by means of a bent tube60 a determinate weight of distilled water is usually put into the first bottle and the other three have each a solution of caustic potash in water the weight of all these bottles and of the water and alkaline solution they contain must be accurately ascertained every thing being thus disposed the junctures between the retort and recipient and of the tube d of the latter must be luted with fat lute covered over with slips of linen spread with lime and white of egg all the other junctures are to be secured by a lute made of wax and rosin melted together when all these dispositions are completed and when by means of heat applied to the retort a the substance it contains becomes decomposed it is evident that the least volatile products must condense or sublime in the beak or neck of the retort itself where most of the concrete substances will fix themselves the more volatile substances as the lighter oils ammoniac and several others will condense in the recipient gc whilst the gasses which are not susceptible of condensation by cold will pass on by the tubes and boil up through the liquors in the several bottles such as are absorbable by water will remain in the first bottle and those which caustic alkali can absorb will remain in the others whilst such gasses as are not susceptible of absorption either by water or alkalies will escape by the tube rm at the end of which they may be received into jars in a pneumatochemical apparatus the charcoal and fixed earth c which form the substance or residuum anciently called caput mortuum remain behind in the retort in this manner of operating we have always a very material proof of the accuracy of the analysis as the whole weights of the products taken together after the process is finished must be exactly equal to the weight of the original substance submitted to distillation hence for instance if we have operated upon eight ounces of starch or gum arabic the weight of the charry residuum in the retort together with that of all the products gathered in its neck and the balloon and of all the gas received into the jars by the tube rm added to the additional weight acquired by the bottles must when taken together be exactly eight ounces if the product be less or more it proceeds from error and the experiment must be repeated until a satisfactory result be procured which ought not to differ more than six or eight grains in the pound from the weight of the substance submitted to experiment in experiments of this kind i for a long time met with an almost insurmountable difficulty which must at last have obliged me to desist altogether but for a very simple method of avoiding it pointed out to me by mr hassenfratz the smallest diminution in the heat of the furnace and many other circumstances inseparable from this kind of experiments cause frequent reabsorptions of gas the water in the cistern of the pneumatochemical apparatus rushes into the last bottle through the tube rm the same circumstance happens from one bottle into another and the fluid is often forced even into the recipient c this accident is prevented by using bottles having three necks as represented in the plate into one of which in each bottle a capillary glasstube st st st st is adapted so as to have its lower extremity t immersed in the liquor if any absorption takes place either in the retort or in any of the bottles a sufficient quantity of external air enters by means of these tubes to fill up the void and we get rid of the inconvenience at the price of having a small mixture of common air with the products of the experiment which is thereby prevented from failing altogether though these tubes admit the external air they cannot permit any of the gasseous substances to escape as they are always shut below by the water of the bottles it is evident that in the course of experiments with this apparatus the liquor of the bottles must rise in these tubes in proportion to the pressure sustained by the gas or air contained in the bottles and this pressure is determined by the height and gravity of the column of fluid contained in all the subsequent bottles if we suppose that each bottle contains three inches of fluid and that there are three inches of water in the cistern of the connected apparatus above the orifice of the tube rm and allowing the gravity of the fluids to be only equal to that of water it follows that the air in the first bottle must sustain a pressure equal to twelve inches of water the water must therefore rise twelve inches in the tube s connected with the first bottle nine inches in that belonging to the second six inches in the third and three in the last wherefore these tubes must be made somewhat more than twelve nine six and three inches long respectively allowance being made for oscillatory motions which often take place in the liquids it is sometimes necessary to introduce a similar tube between the retort and recipient and as the tube is not immersed in fluid at its lower extremity until some has collected in the progress of the distillation its upper end must be shut at first with a little lute so as to be opened according to necessity or after there is sufficient liquid in the recipient to secure its lower extremity this apparatus cannot be used in very accurate experiments when the substances intended to be operated upon have a very rapid action upon each other or when one of them can only be introduced in small successive portions as in such as produce violent effervescence when mixed together in such cases we employ a tubulated retort a pl vii fig 1 into which one of the substances is introduced preferring always the solid body if any such is to be treated we then lute to the opening of the retort a bent tube bcda terminating at its upper extremity b in a funnel and at its other end a in a capillary opening the fluid material of the experiment is poured into the retort by means of this funnel which must be made of such a length from b to c that the column of liquid introduced may counterbalance the resistance produced by the liquors contained in all the bottles pl iv fig 1 those who have not been accustomed to use the above described distilling apparatus may perhaps be startled at the great number of openings which require luting and the time necessary for making all the previous preparations in experiments of this kind it is very true that if we take into account all the necessary weighings of materials and products both before and after the experiments these preparatory and succeeding steps require much more time and attention than the experiment itself but when the experiment succeeds properly we are well rewarded for all the time and trouble bestowed as by one process carried on in this accurate manner much more just and extensive knowledge is acquired of the nature of the vegetable or animal substance thus submitted to investigation than by many weeks assiduous labour in the ordinary method of proceeding when in want of bottles with three orifices those with two may be used it is even possible to introduce all the three tubes at one opening so as to employ ordinary widemouthed bottles provided the opening be sufficiently large in this case we must carefully fit the bottles with corks very accurately cut and boiled in a mixture of oil wax and turpentine these corks are pierced with the necessary holes for receiving the tubes by means of a round file as in pl iv fig 8 sect ii of metallic dissolutions i have already pointed out the difference between solution of salts in water and metallic dissolutions the former requires no particular vessels whereas the latter requires very complicated vessels of late invention that we may not lose any of the products of the experiment and may thereby procure truly conclusive results of the phenomena which occur the metals in general dissolve in acids with effervescence which is only a motion excited in the solvent by the disengagement of a great number of bubbles of air or ariform fluid which proceed from the surface of the metal and break at the surface of the liquid mr cavendish and dr priestley were the first inventors of a proper apparatus for collecting these elastic fluids that of dr priestley is extremely simple and consists of a bottle a pl vii fig 2 with its cork b through which passes the bent glass tube bc which is engaged under a jar filled with water in the pneumatochemical apparatus or simply in a bason full of water the metal is first introduced into the bottle the acid is then poured over it and the bottle is instantly closed with its cork and tube as represented in the plate but this apparatus has its inconveniencies when the acid is much concentrated or the metal much divided the effervescence begins before we have time to cork the bottle properly and some gas escapes by which we are prevented from ascertaining the quantity disengaged with rigorous exactness in the next place when we are obliged to employ heat or when heat is produced by the process a part of the acid distills and mixes with the water of the pneumatochemical apparatus by which means we are deceived in our calculation of the quantity of acid decomposed besides these the water in the cistern of the apparatus absorbs all the gas produced which is susceptible of absorption and renders it impossible to collect these without loss to remedy these inconveniencies i at first used a bottle with two necks pl vii fig 3 into one of which the glass funnel bc is luted so as to prevent any air escaping a glass rod de is fitted with emery to the funnel so as to serve the purpose of a stopper when it is used the matter to be dissolved is first introduced into the bottle and the acid is then permitted to pass in as slowly as we please by raising the glass rod gently as often as is necessary until saturation is produced another method has been since employed which serves the same purpose and is preferable to the last described in some instances this consists in adapting to one of the mouths of the bottle a pl vii fig 4 a bent tube defg having a capillary opening at d and ending in a funnel at g this tube is securely luted to the mouth c of the bottle when any liquid is poured into the funnel it falls down to f and if a sufficient quantity be added it passes by the curvature e and falls slowly into the bottle so long as fresh liquor is supplied at the funnel the liquor can never be forced out of the tube and no gas can escape through it because the weight of the liquid serves the purpose of an accurate cork to prevent any distillation of acid especially in dissolutions accompanied with heat this tube is adapted to the retort a pl vii fig 1 and a small tubulated recipient m is applied in which any liquor which may distill is condensed on purpose to separate any gas that is absorbable by water we add the double necked bottle l half filled with a solution of caustic potash the alkali absorbs any carbonic acid gas and usually only one or two other gasses pass into the jar of the connected pneumatochemical apparatus through the tube no in the first chapter of this third part we have directed how these are to be separated and examined if one bottle of alkaline solution be not thought sufficient two three or more may be added sect iii apparatus necessary in experiments upon vinous and putrefactive fermentations for these operations a peculiar apparatus especially intended for this kind of experiment is requisite the one i am about to describe is finally adopted as the best calculated for the purpose after numerous corrections and improvements it consists of a large matrass a pl x fig 1 holding about twelve pints with a cap of brass a b strongly cemented to its mouth and into which is screwed a bent tube c d furnished with a stopcock e to this tube is joined the glass recipient b having three openings one of which communicates with the bottle c placed below it to the posterior opening of this recipient is fitted a glass tube g h i cemented at g and i to collets of brass and intended to contain a very deliquescent concrete neutral salt such as nitrat or muriat of lime acetite of potash c this tube communicates with two bottles d and e filled to x and y with a solution of caustic potash all the parts of this machine are joined together by accurate screws and the touching parts have greased leather interposed to prevent any passage of air each piece is likewise furnished with two stopcocks by which its two extremities may be closed so that we can weigh each separately at any period of the operation the fermentable matter such as sugar with a proper quantity of yeast and diluted with water is put into the matrass sometimes when the fermentation is too rapid a considerable quantity of froth is produced which not only fills the neck of the matrass but passes into the recipient and from thence runs down into the bottle c on purpose to collect this scum and must and to prevent it from reaching the tube filled with deliquescent salts the recipient and connected bottle are made of considerable capacity in the vinous fermentation only carbonic acid gas is disengaged carrying with it a small proportion of water in solution a great part of this water is deposited in passing through the tube g h i which is filled with a deliquescent salt in gross powder and the quantity is ascertained by the augmentation of the weight of the salt the carbonic acid gas bubbles up through the alkaline solution in the bottle d to which it is conveyed by the tube k l m any small portion which may not be absorbed by this first bottle is secured by the solution in the second bottle e so that nothing in general passes into the jar f except the common air contained in the vessels at the commencement of the experiment the same apparatus answers extremely well for experiments upon the putrefactive fermentation but in this case a considerable quantity of hydrogen gas is disengaged through the tube q r s t u by which it is conveyed into the jar f and as this disengagement is very rapid especially in summer the jar must be frequently changed these putrefactive fermentations require constant attendance from the above circumstance whereas the vinous fermentation hardly needs any by means of this apparatus we can ascertain with great precision the weights of the substances submitted to fermentation and of the liquid and ariform products which are disengaged what has been already said in part i chap xiii upon the products of the vinous fermentation may be consulted sect iv apparatus for the decomposition of water having already given an account in the first part of this work of the experiments relative to the decomposition of water i shall avoid any unnecessary repetitions and only give a few summary observations upon the subject in this section the principal substances which have the power of decomposing water are iron and charcoal for which purpose they require to be made red hot otherwise the water is only reduced into vapours and condenses afterwards by refrigeration without sustaining the smallest alteration in a red heat on the contrary iron or charcoal carry off the oxygen from its union with hydrogen in the first case black oxyd of iron is produced and the hydrogen is disengaged pure in form of gas in the other case carbonic acid gas is formed which disengages mixed with the hydrogen gas and this latter is commonly carbonated or holds charcoal in solution a musket barrel without its breach pin answers exceedingly well for the decomposition of water by means of iron and one should be chosen of considerable length and pretty strong when too short so as to run the risk of heating the lute too much a tube of copper is to be strongly soldered to one end the barrel is placed in a long furnace cdef pl vii fig 11 so as to have a few degrees of inclination from e to f a glass retort a is luted to the upper extremity e which contains water and is placed upon the furnace vvxx the lower extremity f is luted to a worm ss which is connected with the tubulated bottle h in which any water distilled without decomposition during the operation collects and the disengaged gas is carried by the tube kk to jars in a pneumatochemical apparatus instead of the retort a funnel may be employed having its lower part shut by a stopcock through which the water is allowed to drop gradually into the gunbarrel immediately upon getting into contact with the heated part of the iron the water is converted into steam and the experiment proceeds in the same manner as if it were furnished in vapours from the retort in the experiment made by mr meusnier and me before a committee of the academy we used every precaution to obtain the greatest possible precision in the result of our experiment having even exhausted all the vessels employed before we began so that the hydrogen gas obtained might be free from any mixture of azotic gas the results of that experiment will hereafter be given at large in a particular memoir in numerous experiments we are obliged to use tubes of glass porcelain or copper instead of gunbarrels but glass has the disadvantage of being easily melted and flattened if the heat be in the smallest degree raised too high and porcelain is mostly full of small minute pores through which the gas escapes especially when compressed by a column of water for these reasons i procured a tube of brass which mr de la briche got cast and bored out of the solid for me at strasburg under his own inspection this tube is extremely convenient for decomposing alkohol which resolves into charcoal carbonic acid gas and hydrogen gas it may likewise be used with the same advantage for decomposing water by means of charcoal and in a great number of experiments of this nature footnotes 60 the representation of this apparatus pl iv fig 1 will convey a much better idea of its disposition than can possibly be given by the most laboured descriptione chap vii of the composition and application of lutes the necessity of properly securing the junctures of chemical vessels to prevent the escape of any of the products of experiments must be sufficiently apparent for this purpose lutes are employed which ought to be of such a nature as to be equally impenetrable to the most subtile substances as glass itself through which only caloric can escape this first object of lutes is very well accomplished by bees wax melted with about an eighth part of turpentine this lute is very easily managed sticks very closely to glass and is very difficultly penetrable it may be rendered more consistent and less or more hard or pliable by adding different kinds of resinous matters though this species of lute answers extremely well for retaining gasses and vapours there are many chemical experiments which produce considerable heat by which this lute becomes liquified and consequently the expansive vapours must very readily force through and escape for such cases the following fat lute is the best hitherto discovered though not without its disadvantages which shall be pointed out take very pure and dry unbaked clay reduced to a very fine powder put this into a brass mortar and beat it for several hours with a heavy iron pestle dropping in slowly some boiled lintseed oil this is oil which has been oxygenated and has acquired a drying quality by being boiled with litharge this lute is more tenacious and applies better if amber varnish be used instead of the above oil to make this varnish melt some yellow amber in an iron laddle by which operation it loses a part of its succinic acid and essential oil and mix it with lintseed oil though the lute prepared with this varnish is better than that made with boiled oil yet as its additional expence is hardly compensated by its superior quality it is seldom used the above fat lute is capable of sustaining a very violent degree of heat is impenetrable by acids and spiritous liquors and adheres exceedingly well to metals stone ware or glass providing they have been previously rendered perfectly dry but if unfortunately any of the liquor in the course of an experiment gets through either between the glass and the lute or between the layers of the lute itself so as to moisten the part it is extremely difficult to close the opening this is the chief inconvenience which attends the use of fat lute and perhaps the only one it is subject to as it is apt to soften by heat we must surround all the junctures with slips of wet bladder applied over the luting and fixed on by packthread tied round both above and below the joint the bladder and consequently the lute below must be farther secured by a number of turns of packthread all over it by these precautions we are free from every danger of accident and the junctures secured in this manner may be considered in experiments as hermetically sealed it frequently happens that the figure of the junctures prevents the application of ligatures which is the case with the threenecked bottles formerly described and it even requires great address to apply the twine without shaking the apparatus so that where a number of junctures require luting we are apt to displace several while securing one in these cases we may substitute slips of linen spread with white of egg and lime mixed together instead of the wet bladder these are applied while still moist and very speedily dry and acquire considerable hardness strong glue dissolved in water may answer instead of white of egg these fillets are usefully applied likewise over junctures luted together with wax and rosin before applying a lute all the junctures of the vessels must be accurately and firmly fitted to each other so as not to admit of being moved if the beak of a retort is to be luted to the neck of a recipient they ought to fit pretty accurately otherwise we must fix them by introducing short pieces of soft wood or of cork if the disproportion between the two be very considerable we must employ a cork which fits the neck of the recipient having a circular hole of proper dimensions to admit the beak of the retort the same precaution is necessary in adapting bent tubes to the necks of bottles in the apparatus represented pl iv fig 1 and others of a similar nature each mouth of each bottle must be fitted with a cork having a hole made with a round file of a proper size for containing the tube and when one mouth is intended to admit two or more tubes which frequently happens when we have not a sufficient number of bottles with two or three necks we must use a cork with two or three holes pl iv fig 8 when the whole apparatus is thus solidly joined so that no part can play upon another we begin to lute the lute is softened by kneading and rolling it between the fingers with the assistance of heat if necessary it is rolled into little cylindrical pieces and applied to the junctures taking great care to make it apply close and adhere firmly in every part a second roll is applied over the first so as to pass it on each side and so on till each juncture be sufficiently covered after this the slips of bladder or of linen as above directed must be carefully applied over all though this operation may appear extremely simple yet it requires peculiar delicacy and management great care must be taken not to disturb one juncture whilst luting another and more especially when applying the fillets and ligatures before beginning any experiment the closeness of the luting ought always to be previously tried either by slightly heating the retort a pl iv fig 1 or by blowing in a little air by some of the perpendicular tubes s s s s the alteration of pressure causes a change in the level of the liquid in these tubes if the apparatus be accurately luted this alteration of level will be permanent whereas if there be the smallest opening in any of the junctures the liquid will very soon recover its former level it must always be remembered that the whole success of experiments in modern chemistry depends upon the exactness of this operation which therefore requires the utmost patience and most attentive accuracy it would be of infinite service to enable chemists especially those who are engaged in pneumatic processes to dispense with the use of lutes or at least to diminish the number necessary in complicated instruments i once thought of having my apparatus constructed so as to unite in all its parts by fitting with emery in the way of bottles with cristal stoppers but the execution of this plan was extremely difficult i have since thought it preferable to substitute columns of a few lines of mercury in place of lutes and have got an apparatus constructed upon this principle which appears capable of very convenient application in a great number of circumstances it consists of a double necked bottle a pl xii fig 12 the interior neck bc communicates with the inside of the bottle and the exterior neck or rim de leaves an interval between the two necks forming a deep gutter intended to contain the mercury the cap or lid of glass b enters this gutter and is properly fitted to it having notches in its lower edge for the passage of the tubes which convey the gas these tubes instead of entering directly into the bottles as in the ordinary apparatus have a double bend for making them enter the gutter as represented in fig 13 and for making them fit the notches of the cap b they rise again from the gutter to enter the inside of the bottle over the border of the inner mouth when the tubes are disposed in their proper places and the cap firmly fitted on the gutter is filled with mercury by which means the bottle is completely excluded from any communication excepting through the tubes this apparatus may be very convenient in many operations in which the substances employed have no action upon mercury pl xii fig 14 represents an apparatus upon this principle properly fitted together mr seguin to whose active and intelligent assistance i have been very frequently much indebted has bespoken for me at the glasshouses some retorts hermetically united to their recipients by which luting will be altogether unnecessary chap viii of operations upon combustion and deflagration sect i of combustion in general combustion according to what has been already said in the first part of this work is the decomposition of oxygen gas produced by a combustible body the oxygen which forms the base of this gas is absorbed by and enters into combination with the burning body while the caloric and light are set free every combustion therefore necessarily supposes oxygenation whereas on the contrary every oxygenation does not necessarily imply concomitant combustion because combustion properly so called cannot take place without disengagement of caloric and light before combustion can take place it is necessary that the base of oxygen gas should have greater affinity to the combustible body than it has to caloric and this elective attraction to use bergmans expression can only take place at a certain degree of temperature which is different for each combustible substance hence the necessity of giving a first motion or beginning to every combustion by the approach of a heated body this necessity of heating any body we mean to burn depends upon certain considerations which have not hitherto been attended to by any natural philosopher for which reason i shall enlarge a little upon the subject in this place nature is at present in a state of equilibrium which cannot have been attained until all the spontaneous combustions or oxygenations possible in the ordinary degrees of temperature had taken place hence no new combustions or oxygenations can happen without destroying this equilibrium and raising the combustible substances to a superior degree of temperature to illustrate this abstract view of the matter by example let us suppose the usual temperature of the earth a little changed and that it is raised only to the degree of boiling water it is evident that in this case phosphorus which is combustible in a considerably lower degree of temperature would no longer exist in nature in its pure and simple state but would always be procured in its acid or oxygenated state and its radical would become one of the substances unknown to chemistry by gradually increasing the temperature of the earth the same circumstance would successively happen to all the bodies capable of combustion and at last every possible combustion having taken place there would no longer exist any combustible body whatever as every substance susceptible of that operation would be oxygenated and consequently incombustible there cannot therefore exist so far as relates to us any combustible body except such as are incombustible in the ordinary temperatures of the earth or what is the same thing in other words that it is essential to the nature of every combustible body not to possess the property of combustion unless heated or raised to the degree of temperature at which its combustion naturally takes place when this degree is once produced combustion commences and the caloric which is disengaged by the decomposition of the oxygen gas keeps up the temperature necessary for continuing combustion when this is not the case that is when the disengaged caloric is insufficient for keeping up the necessary temperature the combustion ceases this circumstance is expressed in common language by saying that a body burns ill or with difficulty although combustion possesses some circumstances in common with distillation especially with the compound kind of that operation they differ in a very material point in distillation there is a separation of one part of the elements of the substance from each other and a combination of these in a new order occasioned by the affinities which take place in the increased temperature produced during distillation this likewise happens in combustion but with this farther circumstance that a new element not originally in the body is brought into action oxygen is added to the substance submitted to the operation and caloric is disengaged the necessity of employing oxygen in the state of gas in all experiments with combustion and the rigorous determination of the quantities employed render this kind of operations peculiarly troublesome as almost all the products of combustion are disengaged in the state of gas it is still more difficult to retain them than even those furnished during compound distillation hence this precaution was entirely neglected by the ancient chemists and this set of experiments exclusively belong to modern chemistry having thus pointed out in a general way the objects to be had in view in experiments upon combustion i proceed in the following sections of this chapter to describe the different instruments i have used with this view the following arrangement is formed not upon the nature of the combustible bodies but upon that of the instruments necessary for combustion sect ii of the combustion of phosphorus in these combustions we begin by filling a jar capable at least of holding six pints with oxygen gas in the water apparatus pl v fig 1 when it is perfectly full so that the gas begins to flow out below the jar a is carried to the mercury apparatus pl iv fig 3 we then dry the surface of the mercury both within and without the jar by means of blottingpaper taking care to keep the paper for some time entirely immersed in the mercury before it is introduced under the jar lest we let in any common air which sticks very obstinately to the surface of the paper the body to be submitted to combustion being first very accurately weighed in nice scales is placed in a small flat shallow dish d of iron or porcelain this is covered by the larger cup p which serves the office of a diving bell and the whole is passed through the mercury into the jar after which the larger cup is retired the difficulty of passing the materials of combustion in this manner through the mercury may be avoided by raising one of the sides of the jar a for a moment and slipping in the little cup d with the combustible body as quickly as possible in this manner of operating a small quantity of common air gets into the jar but it is so very inconsiderable as not to injure either the progress or accuracy of the experiment in any sensible degree when the cup d is introduced under the jar we suck out a part of the oxygen gas so as to raise the mercury to ef as formerly directed part i chap v otherwise when the combustible body is set on fire the gas becoming dilated would be in part forced out and we should no longer be able to make any accurate calculation of the quantities before and after the experiment a very convenient mode of drawing out the air is by means of an airpump syringe adapted to the syphon ghi by which the mercury may be raised to any degree under twentyeight inches very inflammable bodies as phosphorus are set on fire by means of the crooked iron wire mn pl iv fig 16 made red hot and passed quickly through the mercury such as are less easily set on fire have a small portion of tinder upon which a minute particle of phosphorus is fixed laid upon them before using the red hot iron in the first moment of combustion the air being heated rarifies and the mercury descends but when as in combustions of phosphorus and iron no elastic fluid is formed absorption becomes presently very sensible and the mercury rises high into the jar great attention must be used not to burn too large a quantity of any substance in a given quantity of gas otherwise towards the end of the experiment the cup would approach so near the top of the jar as to endanger breaking it by the great heat produced and the sudden refrigeration from the cold mercury for the methods of measuring the volume of the gasses and for correcting the measures according to the heighth of the barometer and thermometer c see chap ii sect v and vi of this part the above process answers very well for burning all the concrete substances and even for the fixed oils these last are burnt in lamps under the jar and are readily set on fire by means of tinder phosphorus and hot iron but it is dangerous for substances susceptible of evaporating in a moderate heat such as ether alkohol and the essential oils these substances dissolve in considerable quantity in oxygen gas and when set on fire a dangerous and sudden explosion takes place which carries up the jar to a great height and dashes it in a thousand pieces from two such explosions some of the members of the academy and myself escaped very narrowly besides though this manner of operating is sufficient for determining pretty accurately the quantity of oxygen gas absorbed and of carbonic acid produced as water is likewise formed in all experiments upon vegetable and animal matters which contain an excess of hydrogen this apparatus can neither collect it nor determine its quantity the experiment with phosphorus is even incomplete in this way as it is impossible to demonstrate that the weight of the phosphoric acid produced is equal to the sum of the weights of the phosphorus burnt and oxygen gas absorbed during the process i have been therefore obliged to vary the instruments according to circumstances and to employ several of different kinds which i shall describe in their order beginning with that used for burning phosphorus take a large balloon a pl iv fig 4 of cristal or white glass with an opening ef about two inches and a half or three inches diameter to which a cap of brass is accurately fitted with emery and which has two holes for the passage of the tubes xxx yyy before shutting the balloon with its cover place within it the stand bc supporting the cup of porcelain d which contains the phosphorus then lute on the cap with fat lute and allow it to dry for some days and weigh the whole accurately after this exhaust the balloon by means of an airpump connected with the tube xxx and fill it with oxygen gas by the tube yyy from the gazometer pl viii fig 1 described chap ii sect ii of this part the phosphorus is then set on fire by means of a burningglass and is allowed to burn till the cloud of concrete phosphoric acid stops the combustion oxygen gas being continually supplied from the gazometer when the apparatus has cooled it is weighed and unluted the tare of the instrument being allowed the weight is that of the phosphoric acid contained it is proper for greater accuracy to examine the air or gas contained in the balloon after combustion as it may happen to be somewhat heavier or lighter than common air and this difference of weight must be taken into account in the calculations upon the results of the experiment sect iii of the combustion of charcoal the apparatus i have employed for this process consists of a small conical furnace of hammered copper represented in perspective pl xii fig 9 and internally displayed fig 11 it is divided into the furnace abc where the charcoal is burnt the grate d e and the ashhole f the tube gh in the middle of the dome of the furnace serves to introduce the charcoal and as a chimney for carrying off the air which has served for combustion through the tube l m n which communicates with the gazometer the hydrogen gas or air intended for supporting the combustion is conveyed into the ashhole f whence it is forced by the application of pressure to the gazometer to pass through the grate d e and to blow upon the burning charcoal placed immediately above oxygen gas which forms 28100 of atmospheric air is changed into carbonic acid gas during combustion with charcoal whilst the azotic gas of the air is not altered at all hence after the combustion of charcoal in atmospheric air a mixture of carbonic acid gas and azotic gas must remain to allow this mixture to pass off the tube o p is adapted to the chimney gh by means of a screw at g and conveys the gas into bottles half filled with solution of caustic potash the carbonic acid gas is absorbed by the alkali and the azotic gas is conveyed into a second gazometer where its quantity is ascertained the weight of the furnace abc is first accurately determined then introduce the tube rs of known weight by the chimney gh till its lower end s rests upon the grate d e which it occupies entirely in the next place fill the furnace with charcoal and weigh the whole again to know the exact quantity of charcoal submitted to experiment the furnace is now put in its place the tube l m n is screwed to that which communicates with the gazometer and the tube o p to that which communicates with the bottles of alkaline solution every thing being in readiness the stopcock of the gazometer is opened a small piece of burning charcoal is thrown into the tube rs which is instantly withdrawn and the tube o p is screwed to the chimney gh the little piece of charcoal falls upon the grate and in this manner gets below the whole charcoal and is kept on fire by the stream of air from the gazometer to be certain that the combustion is begun and goes on properly the tube q r s is fixed to the furnace having a piece of glass cemented to its upper extremity s through which we can see if the charcoal be on fire i neglected to observe above that the furnace and its appendages are plunged in water in the cistern tvxy fig 11 pl xii to which ice may be added to moderate the heat if necessary though the heat is by no means very considerable as there is no air but what comes from the gazometer and no more of the charcoal burns at one time than what is immediately over the grate as one piece of charcoal is consumed another falls down into its place in consequence of the declivity of the sides of the furnace this gets into the stream of air from the grate d e and is burnt and so on successively till the whole charcoal is consumed the air which has served the purpose of the combustion passes through the mass of charcoal and is forced by the pressure of the gazometer to escape through the tube o p and to pass through the bottles of alkaline solution this experiment furnishes all the necessary data for a complete analysis of atmospheric air and of charcoal we know the weight of charcoal consumed the gazometer gives us the measure of the air employed the quantity and quality of gas remaining after combustion may be determined as it is received either in another gazometer or in jars in a pneumatochemical apparatus the weight of ashes remaining in the ashhole is readily ascertained and finally the additional weight acquired by the bottles of alkaline solution gives the exact quantity of carbonic acid formed during the process by this experiment we may likewise determine with sufficient accuracy the proportions in which charcoal and oxygen enter into the composition of carbonic acid in a future memoir i shall give an account to the academy of a series of experiments i have undertaken with this instrument upon all the vegetable and animal charcoals by some very slight alterations this machine may be made to answer for observing the principal phenomena of respiration sect iv of the combustion of oils oils are more compound in their nature than charcoal being formed by the combination of at least two elements charcoal and hydrogen of course after their combustion in common air water carbonic acid gas and azotic gas remain hence the apparatus employed for their combustion requires to be adapted for collecting these three products and is consequently more complicated than the charcoal furnace the apparatus i employ for this purpose is composed of a large jar or pitcher a pl xii fig 4 surrounded at its upper edge by a rim of iron properly cemented at de and receding from the jar at bc so as to leave a furrow or gutter xx between it and the outside of the jar somewhat more than two inches deep the cover or lid of the jar fig 5 is likewise surrounded by an iron rim f g which adjusts into the gutter xx fig 4 which being filled with mercury has the effect of closing the jar hermetically in an instant without using any lute and as the gutter will hold about two inches of mercury the air in the jar may be made to sustain the pressure of more than two feet of water without danger of its escaping the lid has four holes t h i k for the passage of an equal number of tubes the opening t is furnished with a leather box through which passes the rod fig 3 intended for raising and lowering the wick of the lamp as will be afterwards directed the three other holes are intended for the passage of three several tubes one of which conveys the oil to the lamp a second conveys air for keeping up the combustion and the third carries off the air after it has served for combustion the lamp in which the oil is burnt is represented fig 2 a is the reservoir of oil having a funnel by which it is filled b c d e f g h is a syphon which conveys the oil to the lamp 11 7 8 9 10 is the tube which conveys the air for combustion from the gazometer to the same lamp the tube b c is formed externally at its lower end b into a male screw which turns in a female screw in the lid of the reservoir of oil a so that by turning the reservoir one way or the other it is made to rise or fall by which the oil is kept at the necessary level when the syphon is to be filled and the communication formed between the reservoir of oil and the lamp the stopcock c is shut and that at e opened oil is poured in by the opening f at the top of the syphon till it rises within three or four lines of the upper edge of the lamp the stopcock k is then shut and that at c opened the oil is then poured in at f till the branch b c d of the syphon is filled and then the stopcock e is closed the two branches of the syphon being now completely filled a communication is fully established between the reservoir and the lamp in pl xii fig 1 all the parts of the lamp 11 fig 2 are represented magnified to show them distinctly the tube i k carries the oil from the reservoir to the cavity a a a a which contains the wick the tube 9 10 brings the air from the gazometer for keeping up the combustion this air spreads through the cavity d d d d and by means of the passages c c c c and b b b b is distributed on each side of the wick after the principles of the lamps constructed by argand quinquet and lange to render the whole of this complicated apparatus more easily understood and that its description may make all others of the same kind more readily followed it is represented completely connected together for use in pl xi the gazometer p furnishes air for the combustion by the tube and stopcock 1 2 the tube 2 3 communicates with a second gazometer which is filled whilst the first one is emptying during the process that there may be no interruption to the combustion 4 5 is a tube of glass filled with deliquescent salts for drying the air as much as possible in its passage and the weight of this tube and its contained salts at the beginning of the experiment being known it is easy to determine the quantity of water absorbed by them from the air from this deliquescent tube the air is conducted through the pipe 5 6 7 8 9 10 to the lamp 11 where it spreads on both sides of the wick as before described and feeds the flame one part of this air which serves to keep up the combustion of the oil forms carbonic acid gas and water by oxygenating its elements part of this water condenses upon the sides of the pitcher a and another part is held in solution in the air by means of caloric furnished by the combustion this air is forced by the compression of the gazometer to pass through the tube 12 13 14 15 into the bottle 16 and the worm 17 18 where the water is fully condensed from the refrigeration of the air and if any water still remains in solution it is absorbed by deliquescent salts contained in the tube 19 20 all these precautions are solely intended for collecting and determining the quantity of water formed during the experiment the carbonic acid and azotic gas remains to be ascertained the former is absorbed by caustic alkaline solution in the bottles 22 and 25 i have only represented two of these in the figure but nine at least are requisite and the last of the series may be half filled with limewater which is the most certain reagent for indicating the presence of carbonic acid if the limewater is not rendered turbid we may be certain that no sensible quantity of that acid remains in the air the rest of the air which has served for combustion and which chiefly consists of azotic gas though still mixed with a considerable portion of oxygen gas which has escaped unchanged from the combustion is carried through a third tube 28 29 of deliquescent salts to deprive it of any moisture it may have acquired in the bottles of alkaline solution and limewater and from thence by the tube 29 30 into a gazometer where its quantity is ascertained small essays are then taken from it which are exposed to a solution of sulphuret of potash to ascertain the proportions of oxygen and azotic gas it contains in the combustion of oils the wick becomes charred at last and obstructs the rise of the oil besides if we raise the wick above a certain height more oil rises through its capillary tubes than the stream of air is capable of consuming and smoke is produced hence it is necessary to be able to lengthen or shorten the wick without opening the apparatus this is accomplished by means of the rod 31 32 33 34 which passes through a leatherbox and is connected with the support of the wick and that the motion of this rod and consequently of the wick may be regulated with the utmost smoothness and facility it is moved at pleasure by a pinnion which plays in a toothed rack the rod with its appendages are represented pl xii fig 3 it appeared to me that the combustion would be assisted by surrounding the flame of the lamp with a small glass jar open at both ends as represented in its place in pl xi i shall not enter into a more detailed description of the construction of this apparatus which is still capable of being altered and modified in many respects but shall only add that when it is to be used in experiment the lamp and reservoir with the contained oil must be accurately weighed after which it is placed as before directed and lighted having then formed the connection between the air in the gazometer and the lamp the external jar a pl xi is fixed over all and secured by means of the board bc and two rods of iron which connect this board with the lid and are screwed to it a small quantity of oil is burnt while the jar is adjusting to the lid and the product of that combustion is lost there is likewise a small portion of air from the gazometer lost at the same time both of these are of very inconsiderable consequence in extensive experiments and they are even capable of being valued in our calculation of the results in a particular memoir i shall give an account to the academy of the difficulties inseparable from this kind of experiments these are so insurmountable and troublesome that i have not hitherto been able to obtain any rigorous determination of the quantities of the products i have sufficient proof however that the fixed oils are entirely resolved during combustion into water and carbonic acid gas and consequently that they are composed of hydrogen and charcoal but i have no certain knowledge respecting the proportions of these ingredients sect v of the combustion of alkohol the combustion of alkohol may be very readily performed in the apparatus already described for the combustion of charcoal and phosphorus a lamp filled with alkohol is placed under the jar a pl iv fig 3 a small morsel of phosphorus is placed upon the wick of the lamp which is set on fire by means of the hot iron as before directed this process is however liable to considerable inconveniency it is dangerous to make use of oxygen gas at the beginning of the experiment for fear of deflagration which is even liable to happen when common air is employed an instance of this had very near proved fatal to myself in presence of some members of the academy instead of preparing the experiment as usual at the time it was to be performed i had disposed every thing in order the evening before the atmospheric air of the jar had thereby sufficient time to dissolve a good deal of the alkohol and this evaporation had even been considerably promoted by the height of the column of mercury which i had raised to ef pl iv fig 3 the moment i attempted to set the little morsel of phosphorus on fire by means of the red hot iron a violent explosion took place which threw the jar with great violence against the floor of the laboratory and dashed it in a thousand pieces hence we can only operate upon very small quantities such as ten or twelve grains of alkohol in this manner and the errors which may be committed in experiments upon such small quantities prevents our placing any confidence in their results i endeavoured to prolong the combustion in the experiments contained in the memoirs of the academy for 1784 p 593 by lighting the alkohol first in common air and furnishing oxygen gas afterwards to the jar in proportion as it consumed but the carbonic acid gas produced by the process became a great hinderance to the combustion the more so that alkohol is but difficultly combustible especially in worse than common air so that even in this way very small quantities only could be burnt perhaps this combustion might succeed better in the oil apparatus pl xi but i have not hitherto ventured to try it the jar a in which the combustion is performed is near 1400 cubical inches in dimension and were an explosion to take place in such a vessel its consequences would be very terrible and very difficult to guard against i have not however despaired of making the attempt from all these difficulties i have been hitherto obliged to confine myself to experiments upon very small quantities of alkohol or at least to combustions made in open vessels such as that represented in pl ix fig 5 which will be described in section vii of this chapter if i am ever able to remove these difficulties i shall resume this investigation sect vi of the combustion of ether tho the combustion of ether in close vessels does not present the same difficulties as that of alkohol yet it involves some of a different kind not more easily overcome and which still prevent the progress of my experiments i endeavoured to profit by the property which ether possesses of dissolving in atmospheric air and rendering it inflammable without explosion for this purpose i constructed the reservoir of ether a b c d plate xii fig 8 to which air is brought from the gazometer by the tube 1 2 3 4 this air spreads in the first place in the double lid ac of the reservoir from which it passes through seven tubes ef gh ik c which descend to the bottom of the ether and it is forced by the pressure of the gazometer to boil up through the ether in the reservoir we may replace the ether in this first reservoir in proportion as it is dissolved and carried off by the air by means of the supplementary reservoir e connected by a brass tube fifteen or eighteen inches long and shut by a stopcock this length of the connecting tube is to enable the descending ether to overcome the resistance occasioned by the pressure of the air from the gazometer the air thus loaded with vapours of ether is conducted by the tube 5 6 7 8 9 to the jar a into which it is allowed to escape through a capillary opening at the extremity of which it is set on fire the air when it has served the purpose of combustion passes through the bottle 16 pl xi the worm 17 18 and the deliquescent tube 19 20 after which it passes through the alkaline bottles in these its carbonic acid gas is absorbed the water formed during the experiment having been previously deposited in the former parts of the apparatus when i caused construct this apparatus i supposed that the combination of atmospheric air and ether formed in the reservoir a b c d pl xii fig 8 was in proper proportion for supporting combustion but in this i was mistaken for there is a very considerable quantity of excess of ether so that an additional quantity of atmospheric air is necessary to enable it to burn fully hence a lamp constructed upon these principles will burn in common air which furnishes the quantity of oxygen necessary for combustion but will not burn in close vessels in which the air is not renewed from this circumstance my ether lamp went out soon after being lighted and shut up in the jar a pl xii fig 8 to remedy this defect i endeavoured to bring atmospheric air to the lamp by the lateral tube 10 11 12 13 14 15 which i distributed circularly round the flame but the flame is so exceedingly rare that it is blown out by the gentlest possible stream of air so that i have not hitherto succeeded in burning ether i do not however despair of being able to accomplish it by means of some changes i am about to have made upon this apparatus sect vii of the combustion of hydrogen gas and the formation of water in the formation of water two substances hydrogen and oxygen which are both in the ariform state before combustion are transformed into liquid or water by the operation this experiment would be very easy and would require very simple instruments if it were possible to procure the two gasses perfectly pure so that they might burn without any residuum we might in that case operate in very small vessels and by continually furnishing the two gasses in proper proportions might continue the combustion indefinitely but hitherto chemists have only employed oxygen gas mixed with azotic gas from which circumstance they have only been able to keep up the combustion of hydrogen gas for a very limited time in close vessels because as the residuum of azotic gas is continually increasing the air becomes at last so much contaminated that the flame weakens and goes out this inconvenience is so much the greater in proportion as the oxygen gas employed is less pure from this circumstance we must either be satisfied with operating upon small quantities or must exhaust the vessels at intervals to get rid of the residuum of azotic gas but in this case a portion of the water formed during the experiment is evaporated by the exhaustion and the resulting error is the more dangerous to the accuracy of the process that we have no certain means of valuing it these considerations make me desirous to repeat the principal experiments of pneumatic chemistry with oxygen gas entirely free from any admixture of azotic gas and this may be procured from oxygenated muriat of potash the oxygen gas extracted from this salt does not appear to contain azote unless accidentally so that by proper precautions it may be obtained perfectly pure in the mean time the apparatus employed by mr meusnier and me for the combustion of hydrogen gas which is described in the experiment for recomposition of water part i chap viii and need not be here repeated will answer the purpose when pure gasses are procured this apparatus will require no alterations except that the capacity of the vessels may then be diminished see pl iv fig 5 the combustion when once begun continues for a considerable time but weakens gradually in proportion as the quantity of azotic gas remaining from the combustion increases till at last the azotic gas is in such over proportion that the combustion can no longer be supported and the flame goes out this spontaneous extinction must be prevented because as the hydrogen gas is pressed upon in its reservoir by an inch and a half of water whilst the oxygen gas suffers a pressure only of three lines a mixture of the two would take place in the balloon which would at last be forced by the superior pressure into the reservoir of oxygen gas wherefore the combustion must be stopped by shutting the stopcock of the tube ddd whenever the flame grows very feeble for which purpose it must be attentively watched there is another apparatus for combustion which though we cannot with it perform experiments with the same scrupulous exactness as with the preceding instruments gives very striking results that are extremely proper to be shewn in courses of philosophical chemistry it consists of a worm ef pl ix fig 5 contained in a metallic cooller abcd to the upper part of this worm e the chimney gh is fixed which is composed of two tubes the inner of which is a continuation of the worm and the outer one is a case of tinplate which surrounds it at about an inch distance and the interval is filled up with sand at the inferior extremity k of the inner tube a glass tube is fixed to which we adopt the argand lamp lm for burning alkohol c things being thus disposed and the lamp being filled with a determinate quantity of alkohol it is set on fire the water which is formed during the combustion rises in the chimney ke and being condensed in the worm runs out at its extremity f into the bottle p the double tube of the chimney filled with sand in the interstice is to prevent the tube from cooling in its upper part and condensing the water otherwise it would fall back in the tube and we should not be able to ascertain its quantity and besides it might fall in drops upon the wick and extinguish the flame the intention of this construction is to keep the chimney always hot and the worm always cool that the water may be preserved in the state of vapour whilst rising and may be condensed immediately upon getting into the descending part of the apparatus by this instrument which was contrived by mr meusnier and which is described by me in the memoirs of the academy for 1784 p 593 we may with attention to keep the worm always cold collect nearly seventeen ounces of water from the combustion of sixteen ounces of alkohol sect viii of the oxydation of metals the term oxydation or calcination is chiefly used to signify the process by which metals exposed to a certain degree of heat are converted into oxyds by absorbing oxygen from the air this combination takes place in consequence of oxygen possessing a greater affinity to metals at a certain temperature than to caloric which becomes disengaged in its free state but as this disengagement when made in common air is slow and progressive it is scarcely evident to the senses it is quite otherwise however when oxydation takes place in oxygen gas for being produced with much greater rapidity it is generally accompanied with heat and light so as evidently to show that metallic substances are real combustible bodies all the metals have not the same degree of affinity to oxygen gold silver and platina for instance are incapable of taking it away from its combination with caloric even in the greatest known heat whereas the other metals absorb it in a larger or smaller quantity until the affinities of the metal to oxygen and of the latter to caloric are in exact equilibrium indeed this state of equilibrium of affinities may be assumed as a general law of nature in all combinations in all operations of this nature the oxydation of metals is accelerated by giving free access to the air it is sometimes much assisted by joining the action of a bellows which directs a stream of air over the surface of the metal this process becomes greatly more rapid if a stream of oxygen gas be used which is readily done by means of the gazometer formerly described the metal in this case throws out a brilliant flame and the oxydation is very quickly accomplished but this method can only be used in very confined experiments on account of the expence of procuring oxygen gas in the essay of ores and in all the common operations of the laboratory the calcination or oxydation of metals is usually performed in a dish of baked clay pl iv fig 6 commonly called a roasting test placed in a strong furnace the substances to be oxydated are frequently stirred on purpose to present fresh surfaces to the air whenever this operation is performed upon a metal which is not volatile and from which nothing flies off into the surrounding air during the process the metal acquires additional weight but the cause of this increased weight during oxydation could never have been discovered by means of experiments performed in free air and it is only since these operations have been performed in close vessels and in determinate quantities of air that any just conjectures have been formed concerning the cause of this phenomenon the first method for this purpose is due to dr priestley who exposes the metal to be calcined in a porcelain cup n pl iv fig 11 placed upon the stand ik under a jar a in the bason bcde full of water the water is made to rise up to gh by sucking out the air with a syphon and the focus of a burning glass is made to fall upon the metal in a few minutes the oxydation takes place a part of the oxygen contained in the air combines with the metal and a proportional diminution of the volume of air is produced what remains is nothing more than azotic gas still however mixed with a small quantity of oxygen gas i have given an account of a series of experiments made with this apparatus in my physical and chemical essays first published in 1773 mercury may be used instead of water in this experiment whereby the results are rendered still more conclusive another process for this purpose was invented by mr boyle and of which i gave an account in the memoirs of the academy for 1774 p 351 the metal is introduced into a retort pl iii fig 20 the beak of which is hermetically sealed the metal is then oxydated by means of heat applied with great precaution the weight of the vessel and its contained substances is not at all changed by this process until the extremity of the neck of the retort is broken but when that is done the external air rushes in with a hissing noise this operation is attended with danger unless a part of the air is driven out of the retort by means of heat before it is hermetically sealed as otherwise the retort would be apt to burst by the dilation of the air when placed in the furnace the quantity of air driven out may be received under a jar in the pneumatochemical apparatus by which its quantity and that of the air remaining in the retort is ascertained i have not multiplied my experiments upon oxydation of metals so much as i could have wished neither have i obtained satisfactory results with any metal except tin it is much to be wished that some person would undertake a series of experiments upon oxydation of metals in the several gasses the subject is important and would fully repay any trouble which this kind of experiment might occasion as all the oxyds of mercury are capable of revivifying without addition and restore the oxygen gas they had before absorbed this seemed to be the most proper metal for becoming the subject of conclusive experiments upon oxydation i formerly endeavoured to accomplish the oxydation of mercury in close vessels by filling a retort containing a small quantity of mercury with oxygen gas and adapting a bladder half full of the same gas to its beak see pl iv fig 12 afterwards by heating the mercury in the retort for a very long time i succeeded in oxydating a very small portion so as to form a little red oxyd floating upon the surface of the running mercury but the quantity was so small that the smallest error committed in the determination of the quantities of oxygen gas before and after the operation must have thrown very great uncertainty upon the results of the experiment i was besides dissatisfied with this process and not without cause lest any air might have escaped through the pores of the bladder more especially as it becomes shrivelled by the heat of the furnace unless covered over with cloths kept constantly wet this experiment is performed with more certainty in the apparatus described in the memoirs of the academy for 1775 p 580 this consists of a retort a pl iv fig 2 having a crooked glass tube bcde of ten or twelve lines internal diameter melted on to its beak and which is engaged under the bell glass fg standing with its mouth downwards in a bason filled with water or mercury the retort is placed upon the bars of the furnace mmnn pl iv fig 2 or in a sand bath and by means of this apparatus we may in the course of several days oxydate a small quantity of mercury in common air the red oxyd floats upon the surface from which it may be collected and revivified so as to compare the quantity of oxygen gas obtained in revivification with the absorption which took place during oxydation this kind of experiment can only be performed upon a small scale so that no very certain conclusions can be drawn from them61 the combustion of iron in oxygen gas being a true oxydation of that metal ought to be mentioned in this place the apparatus employed by mr ingenhousz for this operation is represented in pl iv fig 17 but having already described it sufficiently in chap iii i shall refer the reader to what is said of it in that place iron may likewise be oxydated by combustion in vessels filled with oxygen gas in the way already directed for phosphorus and charcoal this apparatus is represented pl iv fig 3 and described in the fifth chapter of the first part of this work we learn from mr ingenhousz that all the metals except gold silver and mercury may be burnt or oxydated in the same manner by reducing them into very fine wire or very thin plates cut into narrow slips these are twisted round with ironwire which communicates the property of burning to the other metals mercury is even difficultly oxydated in free air in chemical laboratories this process is usually carried on in a matrass a pl iv fig having a very flat body and a very long neck bc which vessel is commonly called boyles bell a quantity of mercury is introduced sufficient to cover the bottom and it is placed in a sandbath which keeps up a constant heat approaching to that of boiling mercury by continuing this operation with five or six similar matrasses during several months and renewing the mercury from time to time a few ounces of red oxyd are at last obtained the great slowness and inconvenience of this apparatus arises from the air not being sufficiently renewed but if on the other hand too free a circulation were given to the external air it would carry off the mercury in solution in the state of vapour so that in a few days none would remain in the vessel as of all the experiments upon the oxydation of metals those with mercury are the most conclusive it were much to be wished that a simple apparatus could be contrived by which this oxydation and its results might be demonstrated in public courses of chemistry this might in my opinion be accomplished by methods similar to those i have already described for the combustion of charcoal and the oils but from other pursuits i have not been able hitherto to resume this kind of experiment the oxyd of mercury revives without addition by being heated to a slightly red heat in this degree of temperature oxygen has greater affinity to caloric than to mercury and forms oxygen gas this is always mixed with a small portion of azotic gas which indicates that the mercury absorbs a small portion of this latter gas during oxydation it almost always contains a little carbonic acid gas which must undoubtedly be attributed to the foulnesses of the oxyd these are charred by the heat and convert a part of the oxygen gas into carbonic acid if chemists were reduced to the necessity of procuring all the oxygen gas employed in their experiments from mercury oxydated by heat without addition or as it is called calcined or precipitated per se the excessive dearness of that preparation would render experiments even upon a moderate scale quite impracticable but mercury may likewise be oxydated by means of nitric acid and in this way we procure a red oxyd even more pure than that produced by calcination i have sometimes prepared this oxyd by dissolving mercury in nitric acid evaporating to dryness and calcining the salt either in a retort or in capsules formed of pieces of broken matrasses and retorts in the manner formerly described but i have never succeeded in making it equally beautiful with what is sold by the druggists and which is i believe brought from holland in choosing this we ought to prefer what is in solid lumps composed of soft adhering scales as when in powder it is sometimes adulterated with red oxyd of lead to obtain oxygen gas from the red oxyd of mercury i usually employ a porcelain retort having a long glass tube adapted to its beak which is engaged under jars in the water pneumatochemical apparatus and i place a bottle in the water at the end of the tube for receiving the mercury in proportion as it revives and distils over as the oxygen gas never appears till the retort becomes red it seems to prove the principle established by mr berthollet that an obscure heat can never form oxygen gas and that light is one of its constituent elements we must reject the first portion of gas which comes over as being mixed with common air from what was contained in the retort at the beginning of the experiment but even with this precaution the oxygen gas procured is usually contaminated with a tenth part of azotic gas and with a very small portion of carbonic acid gas this latter is readily got rid of by making the gas pass through a solution of caustic alkali but we know of no method for separating the azotic gas its proportions may however be ascertained by leaving a known quantity of the oxygen gas contaminated with it for a fortnight in contact with sulphuret of soda or potash which absorbs the oxygen gas so as to convert the sulphur into sulphuric acid and leaves the azotic gas remaining pure we may likewise procure oxygen gas from black oxyd of manganese or nitrat of potash by exposing them to a red heat in the apparatus already described for operating upon red oxyd of mercury only as it requires such a heat as is at least capable of softening glass we must employ retorts of stone or of porcelain but the purest and best oxygen gas is what is disengaged from oxygenated muriat of potash by simple heat this operation is performed in a glass retort and the gas obtained is perfectly pure provided that the first portions which are mixed with the common air of the vessels be rejected footnotes 61 see an account of this experiment part i chap iiia chap ix of deflagration i have already shown part i chap ix that oxygen does not always part with the whole of the caloric it contained in the state of gas when it enters into combination with other bodies it carries almost the whole of its caloric alongst with it in entering into the combinations which form nitric acid and oxygenated muriatic acid so that in nitrats and more especially in oxygenated muriats the oxygen is in a certain degree in the state of oxygen gas condensed and reduced to the smallest volume it is capable of occupying in these combinations the caloric exerts a constant action upon the oxygen to bring it back to the state of gas hence the oxygen adheres but very slightly and the smallest additional force is capable of setting it free and when such force is applied it often recovers the state of gas instantaneously this rapid passage from the solid to the ariform state is called detonation or fulmination because it is usually accompanied with noise and explosion deflagrations are commonly produced by means of combinations of charcoal either with nitre or oxygenated muriat of potash sometimes to assist the inflammation sulphur is added and upon the just proportion of these ingredients and the proper manipulation of the mixture depends the art of making gunpowder as oxygen is changed by deflagration with charcoal into carbonic acid instead of oxygen gas carbonic acid gas is disengaged at least when the mixture has been made in just proportions in deflagration with nitre azotic gas is likewise disengaged because azote is one of the constituent elements of nitric acid the sudden and instantaneous disengagement and expansion of these gasses is not however sufficient for explaining all the phenomena of deflagration because if this were the sole operating power gun powder would always be so much the stronger in proportion as the quantity of gas disengaged in a given time was the more considerable which does not always accord with experiment i have tried some kinds which produced almost double the effect of ordinary gun powder although they gave out a sixth part less of gas during deflagration it would appear that the quantity of caloric disengaged at the moment of detonation contributes considerably to the expansive effects produced for although caloric penetrates freely through the pores of every body in nature it can only do so progressively and in a given time hence when the quantity disengaged at once is too large to get through the pores of the surrounding bodies it must necessarily act in the same way with ordinary elastic fluids and overturn every thing that opposes its passage this must at least in part take place when gunpowder is set on fire in a cannon as although the metal is permeable to caloric the quantity disengaged at once is too large to find its way through the pores of the metal it must therefore make an effort to escape on every side and as the resistance all around excepting towards the muzzle is too great to be overcome this effort is employed for expelling the bullet the caloric produces a second effect by means of the repulsive force exerted between its particles it causes the gasses disengaged at the moment of deflagration to expand with a degree of force proportioned to the temperature produced it is very probable that water is decomposed during the deflagration of gunpowder and that part of the oxygen furnished to the nascent carbonic acid gas is produced from it if so a considerable quantity of hydrogen gas must be disengaged in the instant of deflagration which expands and contributes to the force of the explosion it may readily be conceived how greatly this circumstance must increase the effect of powder if we consider that a pint of hydrogen gas weighs only one grain and two thirds hence a very small quantity in weight must occupy a very large space and it must exert a prodigious expansive force in passing from the liquid to the ariform state of existence in the last place as a portion of undecomposed water is reduced to vapour during the deflagration of gunpowder and as water in the state of gas occupies seventeen or eighteen hundred times more space than in its liquid state this circumstance must likewise contribute largely to the explosive force of the powder i have already made a considerable series of experiments upon the nature of the elastic fluids disengaged during the deflagration of nitre with charcoal and sulphur and have made some likewise with the oxygenated muriat of potash this method of investigation leads to tollerably accurate conclusions with respect to the constituent elements of these salts some of the principal results of these experiments and of the consequences drawn from them respecting the analysis of nitric acid are reported in the collection of memoirs presented to the academy by foreign philosophers vol xi p 625 since then i have procured more convenient instruments and i intend to repeat these experiments upon a larger scale by which i shall procure more accurate precision in their results the following however is the process i have hitherto employed i would very earnestly advise such as intend to repeat some of these experiments to be very much upon their guard in operating upon any mixture which contains nitre charcoal and sulphur and more especially with those in which oxygenated muriat of potash is mixed with these two materials i make use of pistol barrels about six inches long and of five or six lines diameter having the touchhole spiked up with an iron nail strongly driven in and broken in the hole and a little tinsmiths solder run in to prevent any possible issue for the air these are charged with a mixture of known quantities of nitre and charcoal or any other mixture capable of deflagration reduced to an impalpable powder and formed into a paste with a moderate quantity of water every portion of the materials introduced must be rammed down with a rammer nearly of the same caliber with the barrel four or five lines at the muzzle must be left empty and about two inches of quick match are added at the end of the charge the only difficulty in this experiment especially when sulphur is contained in the mixture is to discover the proper degree of moistening for if the paste be too much wetted it will not take fire and if too dry the deflagration is apt to become too rapid and even dangerous when the experiment is not intended to be rigorously exact we set fire to the match and when it is just about to communicate with the charge we plunge the pistol below a large bellglass full of water in the pneumato chemical apparatus the deflagration begins and continues in the water and gas is disengaged with less or more rapidity in proportion as the mixture is more or less dry so long as the deflagration continues the muzzle of the pistol must be kept somewhat inclined downwards to prevent the water from getting into its barrel in this manner i have sometimes collected the gas produced from the deflagration of an ounce and half or two ounces of nitre in this manner of operating it is impossible to determine the quantity of carbonic acid gas disengaged because a part of it is absorbed by the water while passing through it but when the carbonic acid is absorbed the azotic gas remains and if it be agitated for a few minutes in caustic alkaline solution we obtain it pure and can easily determine its volume and weight we may even in this way acquire a tollerably exact knowledge of the quantity of carbonic acid by repeating the experiment a great many times and varying the proportions of charcoal till we find the exact quantity requisite to deflagrate the whole nitre employed hence by means of the weight of charcoal employed we determine the weight of oxygen necessary for saturation and deduce the quantity of oxygen contained in a given weight of nitre i have used another process by which the results of this experiment are considerably more accurate which consists in receiving the disengaged gasses in bellglasses filled with mercury the mercurial apparatus i employ is large enough to contain jars of from twelve to fifteen pints in capacity which are not very readily managed when full of mercury and even require to be filled by a particular method when the jar is placed in the cistern of mercury a glass syphon is introduced connected with a small airpump by means of which the air is exhausted and the mercury rises so as to fill the jar after this the gas of the deflagration is made to pass into the jar in the same manner as directed when water is employed i must again repeat that this species of experiment requires to be performed with the greatest possible precautions i have sometimes seen when the disengagement of gas proceeded with too great rapidity jars filled with more than an hundred and fifty pounds of mercury driven off by the force of the explosion and broken to pieces while the mercury was scattered about in great quantities when the experiment has succeeded and the gas is collected under the jar its quantity in general and the nature and quantities of the several species of gasses of which the mixture is composed are accurately ascertained by the methods already pointed out in the second chapter of this part of my work i have been prevented from putting the last hand to the experiments i had begun upon deflagration from their connection with the objects i am at present engaged in and i am in hopes they will throw considerable light upon the operations belonging to the manufacture of gunpowder chap x of the instruments necessary for operating upon bodies in very high temperatures sect i of fusion we have already seen that by aqueous solution in which the particles of bodies are separated from each other neither the solvent nor the body held in solution are at all decomposed so that whenever the cause of separation ceases the particles reunite and the saline substance recovers precisely the same appearance and properties it possessed before solution real solutions are produced by fire or by introducing and accumulating a great quantity of caloric between the particles of bodies and this species of solution in caloric is usually called fusion this operation is commonly performed in vessels called crucibles which must necessarily be less fusible than the bodies they are intended to contain hence in all ages chemists have been extremely solicitous to procure crucibles of very refractory materials or such as are capable of resisting a very high degree of heat the best are made of very pure clay or of porcelain earth whereas such as are made of clay mixed with calcareous or silicious earth are very fusible all the crucibles made in the neighbourhood of paris are of this kind and consequently unfit for most chemical experiments the hessian crucibles are tolerably good but the best are made of limoges earth which seems absolutely infusible we have in france a great many clays very fit for making crucibles such for instance is the kind used for making melting pots at the glassmanufactory of st gobin crucibles are made of various forms according to the operations they are intended to perform several of the most common kinds are represented pl vii fig 7 8 9 and 10 the one represented at fig 9 is almost shut at its mouth though fusion may often take place without changing the nature of the fused body this operation is frequently employed as a chemical means of decomposing and recompounding bodies in this way all the metals are extracted from their ores and by this process they are revivified moulded and alloyed with each other by this process sand and alkali are combined to form glass and by it likewise pastes or coloured stones enamels c are formed the action of violent fire was much more frequently employed by the ancient chemists than it is in modern experiments since greater precision has been employed in philosophical researches the humid has been preferred to the dry method of process and fusion is seldom had recourse to until all the other means of analysis have failed sect ii of furnaces these are instruments of most universal use in chemistry and as the success of a great number of experiments depends upon their being well or ill constructed it is of great importance that a laboratory be well provided in this respect a furnace is a kind of hollow cylindrical tower sometimes widened above pl xiii fig 1 abcd which must have at least two lateral openings one in its upper part f which is the door of the fireplace and one below g leading to the ashhole between these the furnace is divided by a horizontal grate intended for supporting the fewel the situation of which is marked in the figure by the line hi though this be the least complicated of all the chemical furnaces yet it is applicable to a great number of purposes by it lead tin bismuth and in general every substance which does not require a very strong fire may be melted in crucibles it will serve for metallic oxydations for evaporatory vessels and for sandbaths as in pl iii fig 1 and 2 to render it proper for these purposes several notches m m m m pl xiii fig 1 are made in its upper edge as otherwise any pan which might be placed over the fire would stop the passage of the air and prevent the fewel from burning this furnace can only produce a moderate degree of heat because the quantity of charcoal it is capable of consuming is limited by the quantity of air which is allowed to pass through the opening g of the ashhole its power might be considerably augmented by enlarging this opening but then the great stream of air which is convenient for some operations might be hurtful in others wherefore we must have furnaces of different forms constructed for different purposes in our laboratories there ought especially to be several of the kind now described of different sizes the reverberatory furnace pl xiii fig 2 is perhaps more necessary this like the common furnace is composed of the ashhole hikl the fireplace klmn the laboratory mnop and the dome rrss with its funnel or chimney ttvv and to this last several additional tubes may be adapted according to the nature of the different experiments the retort a is placed in the division called the laboratory and supported by two bars of iron which run across the furnace and its beak comes out at a round hole in the side of the furnace one half of which is cut in the piece called the laboratory and the other in the dome in most of the ready made reverberatory furnaces which are sold by the potters at paris the openings both above and below are too small these do not allow a sufficient volume of air to pass through hence as the quantity of charcoal consumed or what is much the same thing the quantity of caloric disengaged is nearly in proportion to the quantity of air which passes through the furnace these furnaces do not produce a sufficient effect in a great number of experiments to remedy this defect there ought to be two openings gg to the ashhole one of these is shut up when only a moderate fire is required and both are kept open when the strongest power of the furnace is to be exerted the opening of the dome ss ought likewise to be considerably larger than is usually made it is of great importance not to employ retorts of too large size in proportion to the furnace as a sufficient space ought always to be allowed for the passage of the air between the sides of the furnace and the vessel the retort a in the figure is too small for the size of the furnace yet i find it more easy to point out the error than to correct it the intention of the dome is to oblige the flame and heat to surround and strike back or reverberate upon every part of the retort whence the furnace gets the name of reverberatory without this circumstance the retort would only be heated in its bottom the vapours raised from the contained substance would condense in the upper part and a continual cohabitation would take place without any thing passing over into the receiver but by means of the dome the retort is equally heated in every part and the vapours being forced out can only condense in the neck of the retort or in the recipient to prevent the bottom of the retort from being either heated or coolled too suddenly it is sometimes placed in a small sandbath of baked clay standing upon the cross bars of the furnace likewise in many operations the retorts are coated over with lutes some of which are intended to preserve them from the too sudden influence of heat or of cold while others are for sustaining the glass or forming a kind of second retort which supports the glass one during operations wherein the strength of the fire might soften it the former is made of brickclay with a little cows hair beat up alongst with it into a paste or mortar and spread over the glass or stone retorts the latter is made of pure clay and pounded stoneware mixed together and used in the same manner this dries and hardens by the fire so as to form a true supplementary retort capable of retaining the materials if the glass retort below should crack or soften but in experiments which are intended for collecting gasses this lute being porous is of no manner of use in a great many experiments wherein very violent fire is not required the reverberatory furnace may be used as a melting one by leaving out the piece called the laboratory and placing the dome immediately upon the fireplace as represented pl xiii fig 3 the furnace represented in fig 4 is very convenient for fusions it is composed of the fireplace and ashhole abd without a door and having a hole e which receives the muzzle of a pair of bellows strongly luted on and the dome abgh which ought to be rather lower than is represented in the figure this furnace is not capable of producing a very strong heat but is sufficient for ordinary operations and may be readily moved to any part of the laboratory where it is wanted though these particular furnaces are very convenient every laboratory must be provided with a forge furnace having a good pair of bellows or what is more necessary a powerful melting furnace i shall describe the one i use with the principles upon which it is constructed the air circulates in a furnace in consequence of being heated in its passage through the burning coals it dilates and becoming lighter than the surrounding air is forced to rise upwards by the pressure of the lateral columns of air and is replaced by fresh air from all sides especially from below this circulation of air even takes place when coals are burnt in a common chaffing dish but we can readily conceive that in a furnace open on all sides the mass of air which passes all other circumstances being equal cannot be so great as when it is obliged to pass through a furnace in the shape of a hollow tower like most of the chemical furnaces and consequently that the combustion must be more rapid in a furnace of this latter construction suppose for instance the furnace abcdef open above and filled with burning coals the force with which the air passes through the coals will be in proportion to the difference between the specific gravity of two columns equal to ac the one of cold air without and the other of heated air within the furnace there must be some heated air above the opening ab and the superior levity of this ought likewise to be taken into consideration but as this portion is continually coolled and carried off by the external air it cannot produce any great effect but if we add to this furnace a large hollow tube ghab of the same diameter which preserves the air which has been heated by the burning coals from being coolled and dispersed by the surrounding air the difference of specific gravity which causes the circulation will then be between two columns equal to gc hence if gc be three times the length of ac the circulation will have treble force this is upon the supposition that the air in ghcd is as much heated as what is contained in abcd which is not strictly the case because the heat must decrease between ab and gh but as the air in ghab is much warmer than the external air it follows that the addition of the tube must increase the rapidity of the stream of air that a larger quantity must pass through the coals and consequently that a greater degree of combustion must take place we must not however conclude from these principles that the length of this tube ought to be indefinitely prolonged for since the heat of the air gradually diminishes in passing from ab to gh even from the contact of the sides of the tube if the tube were prolonged to a certain degree we would at last come to a point where the specific gravity of the included air would be equal to the air without and in this case as the cool air would no longer tend to rise upwards it would become a gravitating mass resisting the ascension of the air below besides as this air which has served for combustion is necessarily mixed with carbonic acid gas which is considerably heavier than common air if the tube were made long enough the air might at last approach so near to the temperature of the external air as even to gravitate downwards hence we must conclude that the length of the tube added to a furnace must have some limit beyond which it weakens instead of strengthening the force of the fire from these reflections it follows that the first foot of tube added to a furnace produces more effect than the sixth and the sixth more than the tenth but we have no data to ascertain at what height we ought to stop this limit of useful addition is so much the farther in proportion as the materials of the tube are weaker conductors of heat because the air will thereby be so much less coolled hence baked earth is much to be preferred to plate iron it would be even of consequence to make the tube double and to fill the interval with rammed charcoal which is one of the worst conductors of heat known by this the refrigeration of the air will be retarded and the rapidity of the stream of air consequently increased and by this means the tube may be made so much the longer as the fireplace is the hottest part of a furnace and the part where the air is most dilated in its passage this part ought to be made with a considerable widening or belly this is the more necessary as it is intended to contain the charcoal and crucible as well as for the passage of the air which supports or rather produces the combustion hence we only allow the interstices between the coals for the passage of the air from these principles my melting furnace is constructed which i believe is at least equal in power to any hitherto made though i by no means pretend that it possesses the greatest possible intensity that can be produced in chemical furnaces the augmentation of the volume of air produced during its passage through a melting furnace not being hitherto ascertained from experiment we are still unacquainted with the proportions which should exist between the inferior and superior apertures and the absolute size of which these openings should be made is still less understood hence data are wanting by which to proceed upon principle and we can only accomplish the end in view by repeated trials this furnace which according to the above stated rules is in form of an eliptical spheroid is represented pl xiii fig 6 abcd it is cut off at the two ends by two plains which pass perpendicular to the axis through the foci of the elipse from this shape it is capable of containing a considerable quantity of charcoal while it leaves sufficient space in the intervals for the passage of the air that no obstacle may oppose the free access of external air it is perfectly open below after the model of mr macquers melting furnace and stands upon an iron tripod the grate is made of flat bars set on edge and with considerable interstices to the upper part is added a chimney or tube of baked earth abfg about eighteen feet long and almost half the diameter of the furnace though this furnace produces a greater heat than any hitherto employed by chemists it is still susceptible of being considerably increased in power by the means already mentioned the principal of which is to render the tube as bad a conductor of heat as possible by making it double and filling the interval with rammed charcoal when it is required to know if lead contains any mixture of gold or silver it is heated in a strong fire in capsules of calcined bones which are called cuppels the lead is oxydated becomes vitrified and sinks into the substance of the cuppel while the gold or silver being incapable of oxydation remain pure as lead will not oxydate without free access of air this operation cannot be performed in a crucible placed in the middle of the burning coals of a furnace because the internal air being mostly already reduced by the combustion into azotic and carbonic acid gas is no longer fit for the oxydation of metals it was therefore necessary to contrive a particular apparatus in which the metal should be at the same time exposed to the influence of violent heat and defended from contact with air rendered incombustible by its passage through burning coals the furnace intended for answering this double purpose is called the cuppelling or essay furnace it is usually made of a square form as represented pl xiii fig 8 and 10 having an ashhole aabb a fireplace bbcc a laboratory ccdd and a dome ddee the muffle or small oven of baked earth gh fig 9 being placed in the laboratory of the furnace upon cross bars of iron is adjusted to the opening gg and luted with clay softened in water the cuppels are placed in this oven or muffle and charcoal is conveyed into the furnace through the openings of the dome and fireplace the external air enters through the openings of the ashhole for supporting the combustion and escapes by the superior opening or chimney at ee and air is admitted through the door of the muffle gg for oxydating the contained metal very little reflection is sufficient to discover the erroneous principles upon which this furnace is constructed when the opening gg is shut the oxydation is produced slowly and with difficulty for want of air to carry it on and when this hole is open the stream of cold air which is then admitted fixes the metal and obstructs the process these inconveniencies may be easily remedied by constructing the muffle and furnace in such a manner that a stream of fresh external air should always play upon the surface of the metal and this air should be made to pass through a pipe of clay kept continually red hot by the fire of the furnace by this means the inside of the muffle will never be coolled and processes will be finished in a few minutes which at present require a considerable space of time mr sage remedies these inconveniencies in a different manner he places the cuppel containing lead alloyed with gold or silver amongst the charcoal of an ordinary furnace and covered by a small porcelain muffle when the whole is sufficiently heated he directs the blast of a common pair of handbellows upon the surface of the metal and completes the cuppellation in this way with great ease and exactness sect iii of increasing the action of fire by using oxygen gas instead of atmospheric air by means of large burning glasses such as those of tchirnausen and mr de trudaine a degree of heat is obtained somewhat greater than has hitherto been produced in chemical furnaces or even in the ovens of furnaces used for baking hard porcelain but these instruments are extremely expensive and do not even produce heat sufficient to melt crude platina so that their advantages are by no means sufficient to compensate for the difficulty of procuring and even of using them concave mirrors produce somewhat more effect than burning glasses of the same diameter as is proved by the experiments of messrs macquer and beaum with the speculum of the abb bouriot but as the direction of the reflected rays is necessarily from below upwards the substance to be operated upon must be placed in the air without any support which renders most chemical experiments impossible to be performed with this instrument for these reasons i first endeavoured to employ oxygen gas for combustion by filling large bladders with it and making it pass through a tube capable of being shut by a stopcock and in this way i succeeded in causing it to support the combustion of lighted charcoal the intensity of the heat produced even in my first attempt was so great as readily to melt a small quantity of crude platina to the success of this attempt is owing the idea of the gazometer described p 308 et seq which i substituted instead of the bladders and as we can give the oxygen gas any necessary degree of pressure we can with this instrument keep up a continued stream and give it even a very considerable force the only apparatus necessary for experiments of this kind consists of a small table abcd pl xii fig 15 with a hole f through which passes a tube of copper or silver ending in a very small opening at g and capable of being opened or shut by the stopcock h this tube is continued below the table at l m n o and is connected with the interior cavity of the gazometer when we mean to operate a hole of a few lines deep must be made with a chizel in a piece of charcoal into which the substance to be treated is laid the charcoal is set on fire by means of a candle and blowpipe after which it is exposed to a rapid stream of oxygen gas from the extremity g of the tube fg this manner of operating can only be used with such bodies as can be placed without inconvenience in contact with charcoal such as metals simple earths c but for bodies whose elements have affinity to charcoal and which are consequently decomposed by that substance such as sulphats phosphats and most of the neutral salts metallic glasses enamels c we must use a lamp and make the stream of oxygen gas pass through its flame for this purpose we use the elbowed blowpipe st instead of the bent one fg employed with charcoal the heat produced in this second manner is by no means so intense as in the former way and is very difficultly made to melt platina in this manner of operating with the lamp the substances are placed in cuppels of calcined bones or little cups of porcelain or even in metallic dishes if these last are sufficiently large they do not melt because metals being good conductors of heat the caloric spreads rapidly through the whole mass so that none of its parts are very much heated in the memoirs of the academy for 1782 p 476 and for 1783 p 573 the series of experiments i have made with this apparatus may be seen at large the following are some of the principal results 1 rock cristal or pure silicious earth is infusible but becomes capable of being softened or fused when mixed with other substances 2 lime magnesia and barytes are infusible either when alone or when combined together but especially lime they assist the fusion of every other body 3 argill or pure base of alum is completely fusible per se into a very hard opake vitreous substance which scratches glass like the precious stones 4 all the compound earths and stones are readily fused into a brownish glass 5 all the saline substances even fixed alkali are volatilized in a few seconds 6 gold silver and probably platina are slowly volatilized without any particular phenomenon 7 all other metallic substances except mercury become oxydated though placed upon charcoal and burn with different coloured flames and at last dissipate altogether 8 the metallic oxyds likewise all burn with flames this seems to form a distinctive character for these substances and even leads me to believe as was suspected by bergman that barytes is a metallic oxyd though we have not hitherto been able to obtain the metal in its pure or reguline state 9 some of the precious stones as rubies are capable of being softened and soldered together without injuring their colour or even diminishing their weights the hyacinth tho almost equally fixed with the ruby loses its colour very readily the saxon and brasilian topaz and the brasilian ruby lose their colour very quickly and lose about a fifth of their weight leaving a white earth resembling white quartz or unglazed china the emerald chrysolite and garnet are almost instantly melted into an opake and coloured glass 10 the diamond presents a property peculiar to itself it burns in the same manner with combustible bodies and is entirely dissipated there is yet another manner of employing oxygen gas for considerably increasing the force of fire by using it to blow a furnace mr achard first conceived this idea but the process he employed by which he thought to dephlogisticate as it is called atmospheric air or to deprive it of azotic gas is absolutely unsatisfactory i propose to construct a very simple furnace for this purpose of very refractory earth similar to the one represented pl xiii fig 4 but smaller in all its dimensions it is to have two openings as at e through one of which the nozle of a pair of bellows is to pass by which the heat is to be raised as high as possible with common air after which the stream of common air from the bellows being suddenly stopt oxygen gas is to be admitted by a tube at the other opening communicating with a gazometer having the pressure of four or five inches of water i can in this manner unite the oxygen gas from several gazometers so as to make eight or nine cubical feet of gas pass through the furnace and in this way i expect to produce a heat greatly more intense than any hitherto known the upper orifice of the furnace must be carefully made of considerable dimensions that the caloric produced may have free issue lest the too sudden expansion of that highly elastic fluid should produce a dangerous explosion finis appendix no i table for converting lines or twelfth parts of an inch and fractions of lines into decimal fractions of the inch twelfth parts decimal decimal of a

of any substance whose specific gravity is known64 in 1696 mr everard balancemaker to the exchequer weighed before the commissioners of the house of commons 21456 cubical inches by the exchequer standard foot of distilled water at the temperature of 55 of fahrenheit and found it to weigh 1131 oz 14 dts troy of the exchequer standard the beam turned with 6 grs when loaded with 30 pounds in each scale hence supposing the pound averdupois to weigh 7000 grs troy a cubic foot of water weighs 6212 pounds averdupois or 1000 ounces averdupois wanting 106 grains troy and hence if the specific gravity of water be called 1000 the proportional specific gravities of all other bodies will nearly express the number of averdupois ounces in a cubic foot or more accurately supposing the specific gravity of water expressed by 1 and of all other bodies in proportional numbers as the cubic foot of water weighs at the above temperature exactly 4374894 grains troy and the cubic inch of water 253175 grains the absolute weight of a cubical foot or inch of any body in troy grains may be found by multiplying their specific gravity by either of the above numbers respectively by everards experiment and the proportions of the english and french foot as established by the royal society and french academy of sciences the following numbers are ascertained paris grains in a paris cube foot

care 641376 by homberg 641666 these show some uncertainty in measures or in weights but the above computation from everards experiment may be relied on because the comparison of the foot of england with that of france was made by the joint labours of the royal society of london and the french academy of sciences it agrees likewise very nearly with the weight assigned by mr lavoisier 70 paris
