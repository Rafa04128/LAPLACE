uffizi gallery florence murillo madonna and child pitti gallery florence raphael sistine madonna dresden gallery preface this little book is intended as a companion volume to childlife in art and is a study of madonna art as a revelation of motherhood with the historical and legendary incidents in the life of the virgin it has nothing to do these subjects have been discussed comprehensively and finally in mrs jamesons splendid work on the legends of the madonna out of the great mass of madonna subjects are selected here only the idealized and devotional pictures of the mother and babe the methods of classifying such works are explained in the introduction great pains have been taken to choose as illustrations not only the pictures which are universal favorites but others which are less widely known and not easily accessible the cover was designed by miss isabelle a sinclair in the various colors appropriate to the virgin mary the lily is the virgins flower la fleur de marie the highest symbol of her purity the gold border surrounding the panel is copied from the ornamentation of the mantle worn by botticellis dresden madonna estelle m hurll new bedford mass may 1897 introduction it is now about fifteen centuries since the madonna with her babe was first introduced into art and it is safe to say that throughout all this time the subject has been unrivalled in popularity it requires no very profound philosophy to discover the reason for this the madonna is the universal type of motherhood a subject which in its very nature appeals to all classes and conditions of people no one is too ignorant to understand it and none too wise to be superior to its charm the little child appreciates it as readily as the old man and both alike are drawn to it by an irresistible attraction thus century after century the artist has poured out his soul in this allprevailing theme of mother love until we have an accumulation of madonna pictures so great that no one would dare to estimate their number it would seem that every conceivable type was long since exhausted but the end is not yet so long as we have mothers art will continue to produce madonnas with so much available material the student of madonna art would be discouraged at the outset were it not possible to approach the subject systematically even the vast number of madonna pictures becomes manageable when studied by some method of classification several plans are possible the historical student is naturally guided in his grouping by the periods in which the pictures were produced the critic by the technical schools which they represent besides these more scholarly methods are others founded on simpler and more obvious dividing lines such are the two proposed in the following pages forming respectively part i and part ii of our little volume the first is based on the style of composition in which the picture is painted the second on the subject which it treats the first examines the mechanical arrangement of the figures the second asks what is the real relation between them the first deals with external characteristics the second with the inner significance proceeding by the first we ask what are the general styles of treatment in which madonna pictures have been rendered the answer names the following five classes 1 the portrait madonna the figures in halflength against an indefinite background 2 the madonna enthroned where the setting is some sort of a throne or dais 3 the madonna in the sky or the madonna in gloria where the figures are set in the heavens as represented by a glory of light by clouds by a company of cherubs or by simple elevation above the earths surface 4 the pastoral madonna with a landscape background 5 the madonna in a home environment where the setting is an interior the foregoing subjects are arranged in the order of historical development so far as is possible the first and last of the classes enumerated are so small compared with the others that they are somewhat insignificant in the whole number of madonna pictures yet in all probability it is along these lines that future art is most likely to develop the subject choosing the portrait madonna because of its universal adaptability and representing the madonna in her home in an effort to realize historically the new testament scenes of the remaining three the enthroned madonna is doubtless the largest class historically considered because of the long period through which it has been represented the pastoral and enskied madonnas were in high favor in the first period of their perfection our next question is concerned with the aspects of motherhood displayed in madonna pictures in what relation to her child has the madonna been represented the answer includes the following three subjects 1 the madonna of love the mater amabilis in which the relation is purely maternal the emphasis is upon a mothers natural affection as displayed towards her child 2 the madonna in adoration the madre pia in which the mothers attitude is one of humility contemplating her child with awe 3 the madonna as witness in which the mother is preminently the christbearer wearing the honors of her proud position as witness to her sons great destiny these subjects are mentioned in the order of philosophical climax and as we go from the first to the second and from the second to the third we advance farther and farther into the experience of motherhood at the same time there is an increase in the dignity of the madonna and in her importance as an individual in the mater amabilis she is subordinate to her child absorbed in him so to speak his infantine charms often overmatch her own beauty when she rises to the responsibilities of her high calling she is for the time being of equal interest and importance sthetically she is now even more attractive than her child whose seriousness in such pictures takes something from his childlikeness chronologically our list reads backwards as the religious aspect of marys motherhood was the first treated in art while the naturalistic conception came last regarded as expressive of national characteristics the mater amabilis is the madonna best beloved in northern countries while the other two subjects belong specially to the art of the south it will be seen that any number of madonna pictures having been arranged in the five groups designated in part i may be gathered up and redistributed in the three classes of part ii to make this clear the pictures mentioned in the first method of classification are frequently referred to a second time viewed from an entirely different standpoint since the lines of cleavage are so widely dissimilar in the two cases both methods of study are necessary to a complete understanding of a picture by the first we learn a convenient term of description by which we may casually designate a madonna by the second we find its highest meaning as a work of art and are admitted to some new secret of a mothers love part i madonnas classed by the style of composition the madonna in art chapter i the portrait madonna the first madonna pictures known to us are of the portrait style and are of byzantine or greek origin they were brought to rome and the western empire from constantinople the ancient byzantium the capital of the eastern empire where a new school of christian art had developed out of that of ancient greece justinians conquest of italy sowed the new artseed in a fertile field where it soon took root and multiplied rapidly there was however little or no improvement in the type for a long period it remained practically unchanged till the thirteenth century thus while a byzantine madonna is to be found in nearly every old church in italy to see one is to see all they are halflength figures against a background of gold leaf at first laid on solidly or at a somewhat later date studded with cherubs the virgin has a meagre ascetic countenance large illshaped eyes and an almost peevish expression her head is draped in a heavy dark blue veil falling in stiff folds unattractive as such pictures are to us from an artistic standpoint they inspire us with respect if not with reverence once objects of mingled devotion and admiration they are still regarded with awe by many who can no longer admire their real origin being lost in obscurity innumerable legends have arisen attributing them to miraculous agencies and also endowing them with power to work miracles there is an early and widespread tradition imported with the madonna from the east which makes st luke a painter it is said that he painted many portraits of the virgin and naturally all the churches possessing old byzantine pictures claim that they are genuine works from the hand of the evangelist there is one in the ara coeli at rome and another in s maria in cosmedino of which marvellous tales are told besides others of great sanctity in st marks venice and in padua it would not be interesting to dwell in any detail upon these curious old pictures we would do better to take our first example from the art which though founded on byzantine types had begun to learn of nature such a picture we find in the venice academy by jacopo bellini painted at the beginning of the fifteenth century somewhat later than any corresponding picture could have been found elsewhere in italy as venice was chronologically behind the other art schools the background is a glory of cherub heads touched with gold hatching both mother and child wear heavy nimbi ornamented with gold these points recall byzantine work but the gentler face of the virgin and the graceful fall of her drapery show that we are in a different world of art the child is dressed in a little tunic in the primitive method with the dawn of the italian renaissance the old style of portrait madonna passed out of vogue more elaborate backgrounds were introduced from the growing resources of technique in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries pictures of the portrait style were comparatively rare raphael however was not above adopting this method as every lover of the granduca madonna will remember his friend bartolommeo also selected this style of composition for some of the loveliest of his works illustration jacopo bellinimadonna and child the story of the friendship between these two men is full of interest at the time of raphaels first appearance in florence 1504 bartolommeo had been four years a monk and had laid aside apparently forever the brush he had previously wielded with such promise the young stranger sought the frate in his cell at san marco and soon found the way to his heart stimulated by this new friendship bartolommeo roused himself from lethargy and resumed the practice of art with increasing success it is pleasant to trace the influence which the two artists exerted upon each other the older man had experience and learning the younger had enthusiasm and genius now it happened that by nature bartolommeo was specially gifted in the arrangement of large compositions with many figures and stately architectural backgrounds it is by these that he is chiefly known today so it is the more interesting that when raphaels sweet simplicity first touched him he turned aside for the time from these elaborate plans and gave himself to the portrayal of the madonna in that simplest possible way the halflength portrait picture several of these he painted upon the walls of his own convent glorifying that dim place of prayer and fasting with visions of radiant and happy motherhood one of these may still be seen in the cell sometimes called the capella giovanato it instantly recalls the tempi madonna of raphael both in the pose of the figure and in the genuineness of feeling exhibited damp and decay have warred in vain against it and the modern visitor lingers before the mother and babe with hushed admiration two other similar frescoes have been removed to the academy they show the same motherly tenderness the same innocent and beautiful babyhood the mother holds her child close in her arms pressing her forehead to his or bending her cheek to receive his kiss he throws his little arm about her neck clinging to her veil or caressing her face besides this group of pictures by bartolommeo there are other scattered instances of portrait madonnas during the italian renaissance by men too great to be tied to the fashions of their day mantegna was such a painter and luini another all told however their pictures of this sort make up a class too rare to deserve longer description a century later the spanish school occasionally reverted to the same style of treatment a pair of notable pictures are the madonna of bethlehem by alonzo cano and the madonna of the napkin by murillo both are in seville the latter in the museum the former still hanging in its original place in the cathedral of canos work a great authority1 on spanish art has written that in serene celestial beauty it is excelled by no image of the blessed mary ever devised in spain murillos picture is better known and has a curious interest from its history the cook in the capuchin monastery where the artist had been painting begged a picture as a parting gift no canvas being at hand a napkin was offered instead on which the master painted a madonna unexcelled among his works in brilliancy of color footnote 1 stirlingmaxwell in annals of the artists of spain illustration gabriel maxmadonna and child as the portrait picture was the first style of madonna known to art so also it is the last by a leap of nearly a thousand years we have returned in our own day to the method of the tenth century it is strange that what was once a matter of necessity should at last become an object of choice in the beginning of madonna art the limited resources of technique precluded any attempts to make a more elaborate setting such difficulties no longer stand in the way and where we now see a portrait madonna the artist has deliberately discarded all accessories in order better to idealize his theme take for instance the portrait madonnas by gabriel max here are no details to divert the attention from motherhood pure and simple we do not ask of the subject whether she is of high or of low estate a queen or a peasant we have only to look into the earnest loving face to read that here is a mother there are two pictures of this sort evidently studied from the same bohemian models in one the mother looks down at her babe in the other directly at the spectator with a singularly visionary expression when weary with the senseless repetition of the set compositions of past ages we turn with relief to a simple portrait mother like this at once the most primitive and the most advanced form of madonna art it is only another case where the simplest is the best chapter ii the madonna enthroned in every true home the mother is queen enthroned in the hearts of her loving children there is therefore a beautiful double significance which we should always have in mind in looking at the madonna enthroned according to the theological conception of the period in which it was first produced the picture stands for the virgin mother as queen of heaven understood typically it represents the exaltation of motherhood in the history of art development the enthroned madonna begins where the portrait madonna ends we may date it from the thirteenth century when cimabue of florence and guido of siena produced their famous pictures similar types had previously appeared in the mosaic decorations of churches but now for the first time they were worthily set forth in panel pictures the story of cimabues madonna is one of the ofttold tales we like to hear repeated how on a certain day about 1270 charles of anjou was passing through florence how he honored the studio of cimabue by a visit how the madonna was then first uncovered how the people shouted so joyously that the street was thereafter named the borgo dei allegri and how the great picture was finally borne in triumphal procession to the church of santa maria novellaall these are the scenes in the pretty drama the late sir frederick leighton has preserved for future centuries this story already six hundred years old in a charming pageant picture cimabues madonna carried through the streets of florence this was the first work ever exhibited by the english artist and was an important step in the career which ended in the presidency of the royal academy cimabues madonna still hangs in santa maria novella over the altar of the ruccellai chapel and thither many a pilgrim takes his way to honor the memory of the father of modern painting the throne is a sort of carved armchair very simple in form but richly overlaid with gold the surrounding background is filled with adoring angels here sits the madonna in stiff solemnity holding her child on her lap if we find it hard to admire her beauty we must note the superiority of the picture to its predecessors for the enthroned madonna in a really attractive and beautiful form we must pass at once to the period of full art development in the interval many variations upon the theme have been invented the throne may be of any size shape or material the composition may consist of any number of figures the madonna seated or standing is now the centre of an assembly of personages symmetrically grouped about her there is little or no unity of action among them each one is an independent figure the guard of honor may be composed of saints as in montagnas madonna of the brera milan or again it is a company of angels as in the berlin madonna attributed to botticelli similar to which is the picture by ghirlandajo in the uffizi gallery where saints are represented each one is marked by some special emblem the identification of which makes in itself an interesting study st peters key st pauls sword st catherines wheel and st barbaras tower soon become familiar symbols to those fond of this kind of lore among the idealized presences about the virgins throne may sometimes be seen the prosaic figure of the donor whose munificence has made the picture possible this is well illustrated in the famous madonna of victory in the louvre painted in commemoration of the battle of fornovo where mantegna represents francesco gonzaga commander of the venetian forces kneeling at the virgins feet a charming feature in many enthroned madonnas is the group of cherubs belowone two or the mystic three they are not the exclusive possession of any single school of art bartolommeo and andrea del sarto of the florentines francia of the bolognese and bellini and cima of the venetians were particularly partial to them the treatment in northern italy gives them a more definite purpose in the composition than does that of florence for here they are always musicians playing on all sorts of instrumentsthe violin the mandolin or the pipe bartolommeo was specially successful in the subject of the enthroned madonna having fine gifts of composition united with profound religious earnestness the great picture in the pitti gallery at florence may serve as a typical example andrea del sartos chefdoeuvrethe madonna di san francesco uffizimay also be assigned to this class although the arrangement is entirely novel the virgin holding the babe in her arms stands on a sort of pedestal carved at the corners with a design of harpies from which the picture is often known as the madonna of the harpies the pedestal throne is also seen in two of correggios dresden pictures but here the virgin is seated with the child on her lap an exceedingly simple throne madonna is that of luini in the brera at milan where the virgin sits on a plain coping not at all high illustration peruginomadonna and saints detail a beautiful madonna enthroned is by perugino in the vatican gallery at rome one of the artists best works in power and vivacity of color the throne is an architectural structure of elegant simplicity of design apparently of carved and inlaid marble the virgin sits in quiet dignity her face bent towards the bishops at her right st costantius and st herculanus on the other side stand the youthful st laurence and st louis of toulouse although perugino was an exceedingly prolific artist he did not often choose this particular subject on this account the picture is especially interesting and also because it is the original model of well known works by two of the umbrian painters most illustrious pupils many indeed were the apprentices trained in the famous bottega at perugia but among them all raphael and pinturicchio took the lead these were the two who honored their master by repeating with modifications of their own the beautiful composition of the vatican pinturicchios picture is in the church of st andrea at perugia a charming feature which he introduced is a little st john standing at the foot of the throne raphaels picture is the socalled ansidei madonna of the national gallery london purchased by the english government in 1885 for the fabulous price of 72000 the composition is here reduced to its simplest possible form with only one saint on each sidest nicholas on the right st john the baptist on the left the virgin and child give no attention to these personages but are absorbed in a book which is open on the mothers knee raphael had no great liking for this style of picture which was rather too formal for his taste it is noticeable that in the few instances where he painted it he took the suggestion as here from some previous work thus his madonna of st anthony also in the national gallery loaned by the king of naples was based upon an old picture by bernardino di mariotto according to the strict orders of the nuns for whose convent it was a commission the baldacchino madonna of the pitti at florence is closely akin to bartolommeos composition in the same gallery glancing briefly at these scattered examples we learn that the enthroned madonna belongs to every school of italian art and exhibits an astonishing variety of forms probably it was in the north of italy that it flourished most the paduan school has its fine representation in mantegnas picture already referred to the brescian in morettos madonna of s clemente the veronese in girolamo dai libris splendid altar piece in san giorgio maggiore the bergamesque in lottos madonna of s bartolommeo above all it was in venice the queen city of the adriatic that the enthroned madonna reached the greatest popularity the spirit of the composition was peculiarly adapted to the venetian love of pomp and ceremony to understand venetian art aright we must distinguish the character of the earlier and later periods with vivarini bellini and cima the madonna in trono was the expression of a devout religious feeling with titian tintoretto and veronese it was merely one among many popular art subjects thus arose two different general types the earlier madonna was a somewhat cold type of beauty the faultless regularity of her features and the imperturbable calm of her expression make her rather unapproachable but she shows a strong sweet purity of character worthy of profound respect one of cimas most important works is the madonna of this type in the venice academy high on a marble throne she sits under a pillared portico behind which stretches a pleasant landscape three saints stand on each sidean old man a youth and a maiden on the steps sit two choristers playing the violin and mandolin palmas great altarpiece at vicenza is another splendid enthroned madonna attended by st george and st lucy and entertained by a musical angel seated at her feet the virgin supports her beautiful boy as he gives his blessing bellinis enthroned madonnas are known throughout the world the picture by which he established his fame was one of this class originally painted for a chapel in san giobbe but now hanging in the venice academy ruskin has pronounced it one of the greatest pictures ever painted in christendom in her central art power it is a large composition with three saints at each side and three choristers below the frari madonna is in a simpler vein and consists of three compartments the central one containing the virgins throne the angioletti on the steps are probably the most popular of their charming class in venice illustration giovanni bellinimadonna of san zaccaria detail the san zaccaria madonna was painted when bellini was over eighty years old and has certain technical qualities surpassing any the artist had previously attained the depth of light and shade is particularly remarkable the colors rich and harmonious the attendant saints are st lucy on the right a pretty blonde girl with st jerome beyond her absorbed in his bible opposite stand st catherine pensively looking down and st peter in profound meditation the entire picture both in conception and execution may be considered a representative example of the times following the bellini school and forming as it were a connecting link between the earlier and the later art was giorgione less than a score of existing works give witness to the rare spirit of this master who was spared to earth only thirtyfour years these are of a quality to place him among the immortals the enthroned madonna is the subject of two one in the madrid gallery and another at castelfranco they create an entirely distinct madonna ideala poetic being who sits with drooping head and dreamy eyes as if seeing unspeakable visions the castelfranco picture expresses the finest elements in venetian character every other composition seems elaborate and artificial when compared with the simplicity of this other madonnas seem almost coarse beside such delicacy the virgins throne is of an unusual heighta double plinththe upper step of which is somewhat above the heads of the attendant saints liberale and francis this simple compositional device emphasizes the effect of her pensive expression it is as if her high meditations set her apart from human companionship there is indeed something almost pathetic in her isolation but for the strength of character in her face the color scheme is as simple and beautiful as the underlying conception the virgins tunic is of green and the mantle falling from the right shoulder and lying across her lap is red with deep shadows in its large folds the back of the seat is covered with a strip of red and gold embroidery the later period of venetian art is marked by a new ideal of the virgin she is now a magnificent creature of flesh and blood her face is proud and handsome her figure large wellproportioned and somewhat voluptuous no bethlehem stable ever sheltered this haughty beauty her home is in kings palaces she belongs distinctly to the realm of wealth and worldliness she has never known sorrow anxiety or poverty life has brought her nothing but pleasure and luxury her throne stands no longer in the sacred place of some inner sanctuary where angel choristers make music it is an elevated platform at one side of the composition as in titians pesaro altarpiece and veroneses madonna in the venice academy this gives an opportunity for a display of elaborate draperies such as we may see in veroneses picture the peculiar qualities of art in verona and venice are blended in paolo veronese no artist ever enjoyed more the splendors of color or combined them in more enchanting harmonies such gifts transform the commonest materials and though his virgin is a very ordinary woman she has undeniable charms an oftcopied figure in this picture is that of the little st john a universal favorite among child lovers illustration veronesemadonna and saints the reader must have remarked that though the fundamental idea of the enthroned madonna is that of queenship the virgin wears no crown in any of the pictures thus far cited the crowned madonna is not characteristic of italian art it is found occasionally in mosaics from the eighth to the eleventh centuries and in some of the early votive pictures but does not appear in the later period except in a few venetian pictures by giovanni da murano and carlo crivelli the same idea was often carried out by placing two hovering angels over the virgins head holding the crown between them botticellis madonna of the inkhorn is treated in this way the crown is essentially teutonic in origin and character turning to the representative art of germany and belgium we find the virgin almost invariably wearing a crown whether she sits on a throne or in a pastoral environment no better example could be named than the celebrated holbein madonna of darmstadt known chiefly through the copy in the dresden gallery here the imposing height of the virgin is rendered still more impressive by a high golden crown richly embossed and edged with pearls beneath this her blond hair falls loosely over her beautiful neck and gleams on the blue garment hanging over her shoulders strong and tender this noble figure sums up the finest elements in the madonna art of the north a simple and lovely form for the madonnas crown is the narrow golden fillet set with pearls singly or in clusters this is placed over the virgins brow just at the edge of the hair which is otherwise unconfined this is seen on madonnas by van eyck frankfort drer woodcut of 1513 memling bruges schongauer munich illustration quentin massysmadonna and child in the enthroned madonna by quentin massys in the berlin gallery we have many typical characteristics of northern art the throne itself is exceedingly rich ornamented with agate pillars with embossed capitals of gold the virgin has the fine features and earnest tender expression which recalls earlier flemish painters her dress falls in rich heavy folds upon the marble pavement but as with van eyck and memling holbein and schongauer fine clothes do not conceal her girlish simplicity or her loving heart a low table spread with food stands at the lefta curious domestic element to introduce and thoroughly northern in realism considered as a symbol of the exaltation of motherhood there is no reason why the throne should go out of fashion but if it is to appear it must be used intelligently and with some adaptation to present modes of thought not servilely imitated from the forms of a bygone age this is a fact too little appreciated by the artists of today many modern pictures could be citedby bouguereau ittenbach and othersof enthroned madonnas in which is adopted the form but not the spirit of the italian rennaissance in such works the setting is a mere affectation entirely out of taste if we are to have a throne let us have a madonna who is a veritable queen chapter iii the madonna in the sky the madonna in gloria we have seen that the first madonnas were painted against a background either of solid gold or of cherub figures and that the latter style of setting was continued in the early pictures of the enthroned madonna the effect was to idealize the subject and carry it into the region of the heavenly this was the germinal idea which grew into the madonna in gloria the glory was originally a sort of nimbus of a larger order surrounding the entire figure instead of merely the head it was oval in shape like the almond or mandorla a picture of this class is the famous madonna della stella of fra angelico it is in a beautiful gothic tabernacle which is the sole ornament of a cell in san marco florence at every step in these sacred precincts we meet some reminder of the angelic brother how the gray walls blossomed under his brush into forms and colors of eternal beauty after seeing the larger wallpaintings in corridors and refectory this little gem seems to epitomize his choicest gifts a rich frame fit setting for the jewel encloses an outer circle of adoring angels and within the central panel contains only the full length figure of the virgin with her child against a mandorla formed of golden rays running from centre to circumference the madonna is enveloped in a long dark blue cloak drawn around her head like a byzantine veil a single star gleams above her brow from which is derived the title of the picture she holds her child fondly and he with responsive affection nestles against his mother pressing his little face into her neck faithful to the standards of his predecessors and untouched by the new spirit of naturalism all about him the monk painter preserves in his conception the most sacred traditions of past ages and yet unites with them an element of love and tenderness which appeals strongly to every human heart illustration fra angelicomadonna della stella it is but a step from this earlier form of the madonna in gloria to the more modern style of the madonna in the sky where the field of vision is enlarged and we see the virgin and child raised above the surface of the earth in some pictures her elevation is very slight there is a curious composition by andrea del sarto berlin gallery where we are puzzled to know if the madonna is enthroned or enskied a flight of steps in the centre leads up as if to a throne but above these the virgin sits in a niche on a bank of clouds in correggios madonna of st sebastian in the dresden gallery the virgin seems to be descending from heaven to earth with her babe and the surrounding clouds and cherubs rest literally upon the heads of the saints who are honored by the vision in other pictures the dividing line between earth and heaven is much more strongly marked we have a landscape below then a stratum of intervening air and in the upper sky the madonna with her child the lower part of the picture is occupied by a company of saints to whom the heavenly vision is vouchsafed or in rare cases by cherubs the virgin appears in a cloud of cherub heads or accompanied by a few childangels there are a few pictures in which her mother st anne sits with her adoring seraphs sometimes attend one on each side or even sainted personages all these variations are exemplified in the pictures which we are to consider illustration umbrian schoolglorification of the virgin the first has come down to us from the hand of some unknown umbrian painter in the national gallery london where it now hangs it was once attributed to lo spagna but is now entered in the catalogue as nameless it matters little whether or not we know the name of the master he could ask no higher tribute to his talent than the universal admiration which his picture commands in the foreground of a quiet umbrian landscape is a marble balcony on the railing of which sit two captivating little boy choristers one roguish fellow pipes on a trumpet while the other his face tiptilted to the heavenly vision makes music on a small guitar above on a cloud sits the virgin with the sweet mystic smile on her face so characteristic of umbrian art she supports her babe with her right arm and in her left hand carries a lily stalk the child standing on his mothers knee and clinging to her neck turns his face out with sweet earnestness in clouds at the side tiny cherubs bear tapers while others floating above hold a large crown just over her head although we cannot limit this style of picture to any special locality it appears to have found much favor in the art of northern italy in the brescian school moretto was unusually fond of the subject his treatment of the theme is somewhat heavy there is little of the ethereal in his celestial vision either in the type of womanhood or in the style of arrangement in defiance of the law of gravitation he poses his upper figures so as to form a solid pyramid wide at the base and tapering abruptly to the apex illustration morettomadonna in glory in the glorified madonna of st john the evangelist brescia the pyramidal effect is accentuated by curtains draped back on either side of the upper part of the composition in the madonna of san giorgio maggiore at verona we have a much more attractive picture the gloria encompassing the vision is clearly defined giving so strong an effect of the supernatural that we cease to judge the composition by ordinary standards of natural law the virgins white veil flutters from her head as if caught by some heavenly breeze her cloak floats about her by the same mysterious force held in graceful festoons by winged cherub heads below is a group of five virgin martyrs with st cecilia in the centre wearing a crown of roses st lucia holds the awl the instrument of her torture looking down at st catherine who leans against her terrible wheel st agnes on the other side reads quietly from a book while she caresses her lamb and st barbara stands behind her with eyes lifted to the sky they are all splendid young amazons recalling morettos fine st justina of the vienna gallery there is no trace of ascetism in their strong welldeveloped figures and in their faces no suggestion of an unhealthy pietism morettos ideals were an anticipation of the most advanced ideas of the modern science of physical culture his madonna and saints derive their beauty neither from over refinement on the one hand nor from sensuous charms on the other but from sane and harmonious selfdevelopment the berlin gallery contains a third glorified madonna by the same painter treated as a holy family st elizabeth sits beside the virgin who holds her own boy on her right side while bending to embrace the little st john with the left arm so large a group is not appropriately treated in this way yet the picture is so fine a work of art as to disarm criticism still another representative of the brescian school must be considered in the person of savoldo born of a noble family and following painting as an amusement rather than as an actual profession his works are rare and one of the finest examples of his art is the glorification of the virgin in the brera gallery at milan the mandorlashaped glory surrounds the virgins figure studded with faintly discerned cherub heads on either side a musical angel is in adoration four saints stand on the earth below the entire conception is rendered with the utmost delicacy the grace and beauty of the madonna are of exactly the quality to make her appearance a beatific vision from brescia we turn to verona where we again find many pictures of the beautiful subject there are in the churches of verona at least three notable works by gianfrancesco caroto in this style one is in sant anastasia another is in san giorgio and the thirdthe artists best existing workis in san fermo maggiore and shows the virgins mother st anne seated with her in the clouds girolamo dai libri was a few years younger than caroto and at one period was to some extent an imitator of the latter beginning as a miniaturist he finally attained a high place among the veronese artists of the first order his characteristics can nowhere be seen to better advantage than in the madonna of st andrew and st peter in the verona gallery the virgin is in an oval glory edged all around with small fleecy clouds she has a beautiful matronly face with abundant hair smoothly brushed over her forehead the two apostles below are fine strong figures full of virility morando or cavazzola was doubtless the most gifted of the older school of verona possessing some of the best qualities of the later master paolo veronese we should not leave the school therefore without mentioning a remarkable contribution he added to this class of pictures in his latest altarpiece here the upper air is filled with a sacred company the virgin and child are attended by st francis and st anthony and surrounded by seven allegorical figures to represent the cardinal virtues below are six saints specially honored in the franciscan order the picture is called the finest production of the school in the first quarter of the sixteenth century in the venetian school titian and tintoretto both painted the subject of the madonna in glory but the pictures are not notable compared with many others from their hands from the north of italy we naturally turn next to the south to inquire what raphael was doing at the same period in rome occupied by many great works under the papal patronage he still found time for his favorite subject of the madonna painting some pictures in the styles already mastered and two for the first time in the style of the madonna in the sky illustration spanish schoolmadonna on the crescent moon the first was the foligno madonna now in the vatican gallery it was painted in 1511 for the popes secretary sigismund conti as a thankoffering for having escaped the danger of a falling meteor at foligno no thoughtful observer can be slow to recognize the superiority of this composition over all others of its kind in point of unity here is no formal row of saints each absorbed in his or her own reflections apart from any common purpose on the contrary all unite in paying honor to the queen of heaven not less superior to his contemporaries was the painters skill in arranging the figures of mother and child with such grace of equilibrium that they seem to float in the upper air in the sistine madonna raphael carried this form of composition to the highest perfection so simple and apparently unstudied is its beauty that we do not realize the masterliness of its art we seem to be standing before an altar or better still before an open window from which the curtains have been drawn aside allowing us to look directly into the heaven of heavens a cloud of cherub faces fills the air from the midst of which and advancing towards us is the virgin with her child the downward force of gravity is perfectly counterbalanced by the vital energy of her progress forward there is here no uncomfortable sense on the part of the spectator that natural law is disregarded while the seated madonna in glory seems often in danger of falling to earth this fulllength figure in motion avoids any such solidity of effect the figures on either side are also so posed as to arouse no surprise at their presence we should have said beforehand that heavy pontifical robes would be absurdly incongruous in such a composition but raphael solves the problem so simply that few would suspect the difficulties the final touch of beauty is added in the cherub heads below recalling the nave charm of the similar figures in the umbrian picture we have considered illustration bouguereaumadonna of the angels after the time of raphael a pretty form of madonna in glory was occasionally painted showing the virgin with her babe sitting above the crescent moon the conception appears more than once in the paintings of albert drer and later artists of all schools adopted it sassoferratos picture in the vatican gallery is a popular example tintorettos in berlin is not so well known in the dresden gallery is a work by an unknown spanish painter of the seventeenth century differing from the others in that the virgin is standing as in the oftrepeated spanish pictures of the immaculate conception it is of pictures like this that our poet longfellow is speaking when he thus apostrophizes the virgin thou peerless queen of air as sandals to thy feet the silver moon dost wear the enskied madonna involves many technical difficulties of composition and demands a high order of artistic imagination it could hardly be called a frequent subject in the period of greatest artistic daring and no modern painter has shown any adequate understanding of the subject though there are not lacking those who have made the attempt bodenhausen defregger bouguereau have all followed raphael in representing the queen of heaven as a fulllength figure in the sky but their conception has not the dignity corresponding to the style of treatment impatient and dissatisfied with such modern art we turn back to the old masters with new appreciation of their great gifts chapter iv the pastoral madonna it was many centuries before art at first devoted exclusively to figure painting turned to the study of natural scenery thus it was that madonna pictures of various kinds had long been established in popular favor before the idea of a landscape setting was introduced we need not look for interesting pictures of this class before the latter part of the fifteenth century and it was not until the sixteenth that the pastoral madonna in its highest form was first produced even then there was no great number which show a really sympathetic love of nature in the ideal pastoral the landscape entirely fills the picture and the figures are as it were an integral part of it such pictures are so rare that we write in golden letters the names of the few who have given us these treasures raphaels justly comes first in the list his earliest madonnas show his love of natural scenery in the charming glimpses of umbrian landscape which form the background these are treated as mntz points out with marked simplicity of outline and breadth of design they are however but the beginning of the great things that were to follow the young painters sojourn in florence witnessed a marvellous development of his powers here he was surrounded by the greatest artists of his time and he was quick to absorb into himself something of excellence from them all his fertility of production was amazing in a period of four years 15041508 interrupted by visits to perugia and urbino he produced about twenty madonnas in which we may trace the new influences affecting him leonardo da vinci was doubtless his greatest inspiration and it was from this masterstudent of nature that the young man learned with new enthusiasm the value of going directly to nature herself the fruit of this new study is a group of lovely pastoral madonnas which are entirely unique as nature idyls three of these are among the worlds great favorites they are the belle jardinire the beautiful gardener of the louvre gallery paris the madonna in grnen the madonna in the meadow in the belvedere gallery vienna and the cardellino madonna the madonna of the goldfinch of the uffizi florence we turn from one to another of these three beautiful pictures always in doubt as to which is the greatest fortunately it is a question which there is no occasion to decide as every lover of art may be the happy possessor of all three in that highest mode of possession attained by devoted study in each one we have the typical tuscan landscape filling the whole picture with its tranquil beauty the glad green earth blossoms with dainty flowers the fair blue sky above is reflected in the placid surface of a lake from its shores rise gently undulating hills where towers show the signs of happy activity in the foreground of this peaceful scene sits a beautiful woman with two charming children at her knee they belong to the landscape as naturally as the trees and flowers they partake of its tranquil placid happiness illustration raphaelmadonna in the meadow almost identical in general style of composition the three pictures show many points of dissimilarity when we come to a closer study of the figures considered as a type of womanly beauty the belle jardinire is perhaps the most commonplace of the three virgins or to put it negatively the least attractive she is distinctly of the peasant class gentle amiable and entirely unassuming the madonna in the meadow is a maturer woman more dignified more beautiful the smooth braids of her hair are coiled about the head accentuating its lovely outline the falling mantle reveals the finely modelled shoulders the madonna of the goldfinch is a still higher type of loveliness uniting with gentle dignity a certain delicate highbred grace which raphael alone could impart her face is charmingly framed in the soft hair which falls modestly about it one wonders if any modern coiffeur could invent so many styles of hair dressing as does this gifted young painter of the sixteenth century turning from the mother to the children we find the same general types repeated in the three pictures but with some difference of motif the christchild of the belle jardinire is looking up fondly to his mother in the vienna picture he is eagerly interested in the cross which the little st john gives him in the uffizi picture he is more serious and strokes the goldfinch with an air of abstraction meditating on the holy things his mother has been reading to him the arrangement of the three figures is the same in all the pictures and is so entirely simple that we forget the greatness of the art the virgin dominating the composition brings into unity the two smaller figures this unity is somewhat less perfect in the belle jardinire because the little st john is almost neglected in the intense absorption of mother and child in each other once again in the later days at rome raphael recurred to the pastoral madonna type of this florentine period and painted the picture known as the casa alba madonna we have again the same smiling landscape and the same charming children but a virgin of an altogether new order a turbaned roman beauty of superb junolike physique she does not belong to the idyllic character of her surroundings it is as if some brilliant exotic had been transplanted from her native haunts to quiet fields where hitherto the modest lily had bloomed alone as raphaels first inspiration for the pastoral madonna came from the influence of leonardo da vinci it is of interest to compare his work with that of the great lombard himself critics tell us that the madonna pictures in which he came nearest to his model are the madonna in the meadow and the holy family of the lamb madrid these we may place beside the madonna of the rocks which is the only entirely authentic da vinci madonna which we have it is only the skilled connoisseur who in travelling from paris to vienna and from vienna to madrid can hold in memory the qualities of technique which link together the three pictures but for general characteristics of composition the black and white reproductions may suffice leonardo availed himself of his intimate knowledge of nature to choose from her storehouse something which is unique rather than typical the rock grotto doubtless has a real counterpart but we must go far to find it in the river gleaming beyond we see the painters characteristic treatment of water which raphael was glad to adopt the triangular arrangement of the figures the relation of the virgin to the children the simple childish beauty of the latter and their attitude towards each otherall these points suggest the source of raphaels similar conceptions the virgins hair falls over her shoulders entirely unbound in gentle waving ripples illustration leonardo da vincimadonna of the rocks we do not need to be told though the historian has taken pains to record it that a feature of personal beauty by which leonardo was always greatly pleased was curled and waving hair we see it in the first touch of his hand when as a boy in the workshop of verrochio he painted the wavyhaired angel in his masters baptism and here again in the virgin we find it the crowning element of her mysterious loveliness we try in vain to penetrate the secret of her smileit is as evasive as it is enchanting and herein lies the distinguishing difference between leonardo and raphael the former is always mysterious and subtle the latter is always frank and ingenuous while both are true interpreters of nature leonardo reveals the rare and inexplicable raphael chooses the typical and familiar both are possessed of a strong sense of the harmony of nature with human life the smile of the virgin of the rocks is a part of the mystery of her shadowy environment2 the serenity of the madonna in the meadow belongs to the atmosphere of the open fields footnote 2 that the leonardesque smile requires a leonardesque setting is seen i think in the pictures by da vincis imitators the madonna by sodoma recently added to the brera gallery at milan is an example in point here the inevitable smile of mystery seems meaningless in the sunny open landscape among others who were affected by the influence of leonardoand chief of the lombardswas luini his pastoral madonna has however little in common with the landscapes of his master judging from the lovely example in the brera the group of figures is strikingly suggestive of da vinci but the quiet rural pasture in which the virgin sits is luinis own in the distance is a thick clump of trees finely drawn in stem and branch at one side is a shepherds hut with a flock of sheep grazing near the child jesus reaches from his mothers lap to play with the lamb which the little st john has brought a motif similar to raphaels madrid picture and perhaps due in both painters to the example of leonardo it is said by the learned that during the period of the renaissance the love of nature received an immense impulse from the revival of the latin poets and that this impulse was felt most in the large cities in the pictures noted we have seen its effect in florentine and lombard art that it was also felt in isolated places we may see in some of correggios work at parma at about the same time two at least of his madonna pictures are as famous for their beautiful landscapes as for the rare grace and charm of their figures these are the kneeling madonna of the uffizi and la zingarella at naples both show a perfect adaptation of the surroundings to the spirit of the scene in the first it is morning and the gladness of nature reflects the mothers rapturous joy in her awakening babe a brilliant light floods the figures in the foreground and melts across the green slopes into the hazy distance of the seabound horizon in the second it is twilight and a calm stillness broods over all as under the feathery palms the mother bends watchful over her little ones slumbers such were the revelations of nature to the countrybred painter from the little town of correggio turning now to venice for our last examples we find that the love of natural scenery was remarkably strong in this city of water and sky where the very absence of verdure may have created a homesick longing for the green fields it was venetian art which originated that form of pastoral madonna known as the santa conversazione this is usually a long narrow picture showing a group of sacred personages against a landscape setting centering about the madonna and child the composition has none of the formality of the enthroned madonna an underlying unity of purpose and action binds all the figures together in natural and harmonious relations the acknowledged leader of this style of compositionthe inventor indeed according to manywas palma vecchio it is curious that of a painter whose works are so widely admired almost nothing is known even the traditions which once lent color to his life have been shattered by the ruthless hand of the modern investigator the span of his life extended from 1480 to 1528 thus he came at the beginning of the century made glorious by titian and contributed not a little in his own way to its glory it is supposed that he studied under giovanni bellini and at one time was a friend and colleague of lorenzo lotto a child of the mountainsfor he was born in serinaltahe never entirely lost the influence of his early surroundings to the last his figures are grave vigorous sometimes almost rude partaking of the characteristics of the everlasting hills perhaps it was these traits which made the santa conversazione a favorite composition with him he has an intense love of nature in her most luxuriant mood illustration palma vecchiosanta conversazione for a collection of palmas pictures we should choose at least four to represent his treatment of the santa conversazione those at naples dresden munich and vienna the naples picture is considered the most successful of palmas large pictures of this kind but it is not easy for the less critical observer to choose a favorite among the four one general formula describes them all a sunny landscape with hills clad in their greenest garb a tree in the foreground beneath which sits the virgin a comely countrybred matron who seems to have drawn her splendid vigor from the clear bright air on her lap she supports a sprightly little boy who is the centre of attention in the simpler compositions the madonna is at the left and at the right kneel or sit two saints one is a handsome young rustic unkempt and roughly clad sometimes figuring as st john the baptist and sometimes as st roch with him is contrasted a beautiful young female saint usually st catherine where the composition includes other figures the virgin is in the centre with the attendant personages symmetrically grouped on either side in the vienna picture the two additional figures at the left are the aged st celestin and a fine st barbara of all schools of painting the venetian is the least translatable into black and white so rich in colors is the palette which composed it this is especially true of palma and to understand aright his santa conversazione we must read into it the harmony of colors which it expresses the chords of blue red brown and green the shimmering lights and brilliant atmosphere illustration filippino lippimadonna in a rose garden the subject of the santa conversazione should not be left without a brief reference to other venetians who added to the popularity of this charming style of picture berenson mentions seven by palmas pupil bonifazio veronese and one by his friend lorenzo lotto cima cariani paris bordone and last but not least the great titian3 lent their gifts to the subject so that we have abundant evidence of the venetian love of natural scenery it remains to consider one more form of the pastoral madonna that which represents the virgin and child in a garden inclosed in allusion to the symbolism of solomons song 412 the subject is found among the woodcuts of albert drer but i have never seen it in any german painting footnote 3 see particularly titians works in the louvre of which the vierge au lapin is an especially charming pastoral in italian art there are two famous pictures of this class by francia in the munich gallery and by filippino lippi or so attributed in the pitti at florence in both the motif is the same in the foreground a square inclosure surrounded by a rosehedge with a hilly landscape in the distance the virgin kneeling before her child in the centre filippino lippis is one of those pictures whose beauty attracts crowds of admirers to the canvas copyists are kept busy repeating the composition for eager purchasers and it has made its way all over the world the circle of graceful angels who with the boy st john join the mother in adoring the christchild is one of the chief attractions of the picture it is a pretty conceit that one of these angels showers rose leaves upon the babe the pastoral madonna is the sort of picture which can never be outgrown the charm of nature is as perennial as is the beauty of motherhood and the two are always in harmony here then is a proper subject for modern madonna art a field which has scarcely been opened by the artists of our own day such pastoral madonnas as have been painted within recent years are all more or less artificial in conception compared with the idyllic charm of the sixteenth century pictures they seem like pretty scenes in a wellmounted opera we are looking for better things chapter v the madonna in a home environment a subject so sacred as the madonna was long held in too great reverence to permit of any common or realistic treatment the pastoral setting brought the mother and her babe into somewhat closer and more human relations than had before been deemed possible but art was slow to presume any further upon this familiarity the madonna as a domestic subject represented in the interior of her home was hesitatingly adopted and has been so rarely treated even down to our own times as to form but a small group of pictures in the great body of art illustration schongauerholy family the northern painters naturally led the way peculiarly homeloving in their tastes their ideal woman is the hausfrau and it was with them no lowering of the madonnas dignity to represent her in this capacity a picture in the style of quentin massys hangs in the munich gallery and shows a flemish bedroom of the fifteenth century at the left stands the bed and on the right burns the fire with a kettle hanging over it the virgin sits alone with her babe at her breast more frequently a domestic scene of this sort includes other figures belonging to the holy family a typical german example is the picture by schongauer in the belvedere gallery at vienna the virgin is seated in homely surroundings intent upon a bunch of grapes which she holds in her hands and which she has taken from a basket standing on the floor beside her long waving hair falls over her shoulders a snowy kerchief is folded primly in the neck of her dress she is the impersonation of virgin modesty her baby boy stands on her lap nestling against his mother his eyes fixed on the fruit his eager little face glowing with pleasure beyond are seen the cattle which joseph is feeding he pauses at the door a bundle of hay in his arms to look in with fond pride at his young wife and her child schongauers work belongs to the latter part of the fifteenth century and there was nothing similar to it in italy at the same period it is true that madonnas in domestic settings have been attributed to contemporaneous italians but they were probably by some flemish hand illustration raphaelmadonna dell impannata giulio romano a pupil of raphael was perhaps the first of the italians to give any domestic touch to the subject of the madonna and child his madonna della catina of the dresden gallery is well known it is so called from the basin in which the christchild stands while the little st john pours in water from a pitcher for the bath another picture by the same artist shows the madonna seated with her child in the interior of a bedchamber this was one of the discoveries of the late senator giovanni morelli the critic and is in a private collection in dresden to giulio romano also according to recent criticism is due the domestic madonna known as the impannata and usually attributed to raphael it is probable that both artists had a hand in it the master in the arrangement of the composition the pupil in its execution a bed at one side is concealed by a green curtain in the rear is the clothcovered window which gives the picture its name elizabeth and mary magdalene have brought home the child who springs to his mothers arms smiling back brightly at his friends one other madonna from raphaels brush the orleans has an interior setting but the domestic environment here is undoubtedly the work of some flemish painter of later date by the seventeenth century the holy family in a home environment can be found somewhat more often in various localities by the french painter mignard there is a wellknown picture in the louvre called la vierge la grappe by f barocci of urbino there is an example in the national gallery known as the madonna del gatto in which the child holds a bird out of the reach of a cat a similar motif certainly not a pleasant one is seen in murillos holy family of the bird in madrid by salimbeni in the pitti is a holy family in an interior showing the boy jesus and his cousin st john playing with puppies rembrandts domestic madonna pictures equally homely as to environment are by no means scenes of hilarity but rather of frugal contentment two similar works bear the title of le mnage du menuisierthe carpenters home in both the scene is the interior of a common room devoted to work and household purposes joseph is seen in the rear at his bench while the central figures are the mother and child in the louvre picture the virgins mother is present caressing her grandchild who is held at his mothers breast the composition at st petersburg hermitage gallery is simpler and shows the virgin contemplating her babe as he lies asleep in the cradle another wellknown picture by rembrandt is in the munich gallery where again we have signs of the carpenters toil but where the laborer has stopped for a moment to peep at the babe who has gone off to dreamland at his mothers breast and now sleeps sweetly in her lap let those who think such pictures too homely for a sacred theme compare them with the simplicity of the gospels part ii madonnas classed according to their significance as types of motherhood chapter vi the madonna of love the mater amabilis undoubtedly the most popular of all madonna subjectscertainly the most easily understoodis the mater amabilis the mothers mood may be read at a glance she is showing in one of a thousand tender ways her motherly affection for her child she clasps him in her arms holding him to her breast pressing her face to his kissing him caressing him or playing with him love is written in every line of her face love is the keynote of the picture the style of composition best adapted to such a theme is manifestly the simplest the more formal types of the enthroned and glorified madonnas are the least suitable for the display of maternal affection while the portrait madonna and the madonna in landscape or domestic scenes are readily conceived as the mater amabilis nevertheless these distinctions have not by any means been rigidly regarded in art this is manifest in some of the illustrations in part i as the enthroned madonna by quentin massys where the mother kisses her child and angelicos madonna in glory where she holds him to her cheek gathering our examples from so many methods of composition we are in the midst of a multitude of pictures which no man can number and which set forth every conceivable phase of motherliness let us make raphael our startingpoint from the same master whose influence led him to the study of external nature he learned also the study of human nature to the interpretation of motherlove he brought all the fresh ardor of youth and a sunny temperament which saw only joy in the face of nature one after another of the series of his florentine pictures gives us a new glimpse of the loving relation between mother and child the belle jardinire gazes into her boys face in fond absorption the tempi madonna holds him to her heart pressing her lips to his soft cheek in the orleans and colonna pictures she smiles indulgently into his eyes as he lies across her lap plucking at the bosom of her dress other pictures show the two eagerly reading together from the book of wisdom the conestabile and ansidei madonnas the painters later work evinces a growing maturity of thought in the holy family of francis i how strong and tender is the mothers attitude as she stoops to lift her child from his cradle in the chair madonna how protecting is the capacious embrace with which she gathers him to herself in brooding love no technical artistic education is necessary for the appreciation of such pictures all who have known a mothers love look and understand and look again and are satisfied correggio touches the heart in much the same way he too saw the world through rosecolored glasses his interpretation of life is full of buoyant enjoyment beside the tranquil joy of raphaels ideals his figures express a tumultuous gladness an overflowing gayety this is the more curious because of the singular melancholy which is attributed to him the outer circumstances of his life moved in a quiet groove which was almost humdrum he passed his days in comparative obscurity at parma far from the great art influences of his time but isolation seemed the better to develop his rare individuality he was the architect of his own fortunes and wrought out independently a style peculiar to himself his most famous madonna pictures are large compositions crowded with figures of extravagant attitudes and expression the fame of these more pretentious works rests not so much upon their inner significance as upon their splendid technique they are unsurpassed for masterly handling of color and for triumphs of chiaroscuro there are better qualities of sentiment in the smaller pictures where the mother is alone with her child it is here that we find something worthy to compare with raphael there are several of these produced in rapid succession during the period when the artist was engaged upon the frescoes of s giovanni parma and soon after marriage had opened his heart to sweet domestic influences the first was the uffizi picture so widely known and loved the mother has gathered up her mantle so that it covers her head and drops at one side on a step forming a soft blue cushion for the babe here the little darling lies looking up into his mothers face kneeling on the step below she bends over him with her hands playfully outstretched in a transport of maternal affection following this came the picture now in the national gallery called the madonna della cesta from the basket that lies on the ground it is a domestic scene in the outer air the mother is dressing her babe and smilingly arrests his hand which on a sudden impulse he has stretched towards some coveted object the same face is almost exactly repeated in the madonna of the hermitage gallery st petersburg who offers her breast to her boy at that moment turning about to receive some fruit presented by a child angel there are two duplicates of this picture in other galleries the zingarella the gypsy is so called from the gypsy turban worn by the madonna the mother supposed to be painted from the artists wife sits with the child asleep on her lap with motherly tenderness she bends so closely over him that her forehead touches his little head it is unfortunate that this beautiful work is not better known it is in the naples gallery a comparison of these pictures discloses a remarkable variety in action and grouping on the other hand the madonnas are quite similar in general type with the exception of the zingarella who is the most motherly they are all in a playful mood the same playfulness but of a more sweet and motherly kind lights the face of the madonna della scala the composition is somewhat in the portrait style showing the mother in half length seated under a sort of canopy the babe clings closely to her neck turning about at the spectator with a glance half shy and half mischievous his coyness awakens a smile of tender amusement in the gentle young face above him the picture has an interesting history it was originally painted in fresco over the eastern gate of parma where vasari saw and admired it in after years the wall which it decorated was incorporated into a small new church of which it formed the rear wall to accommodate the high level of the madonna the building was somewhat elevated and being entered by a flight of steps was known as s maria della scala of the staircase the name attached itself to the picture even after the church was destroyed in 1812 and the fresco removed to the town gallery the marks of defacement which it bears are due to the votive offerings which were formerly fastened upon itamong them a silver crown worn by the madonna as late as the eighteenth century though such scars injure its artistic beauty they add not a little to the romantic interest which invests it illustration correggiomadonna della scala beside such names as raphael and correggio history furnishes but one other worthy of comparison for the portrayal of the mater amabilisit is titian his madonna is by no means uniformly motherly there are times when we look in vain for any softening of her aristocratic features when her stately dignity seems quite incompatible with demonstrativeness4 but when love melts her heart how gracious is her unbending how winning her smile once she goes so far as to play in the fields with her little boy quieting a rabbit with one hand for him to admire la vierge au lapin louvre in other pictures she holds him lying across her lap smiling thoughtfully upon him such an one is the madonna with sts ulfo and brigida in the madrid gallery the child is taking the flowers st brigida offers him and his mother looks down with the pleased expression of fond pride again when her babe holds his two little hands full of the roses his cousin st john has brought him she smiles gently at the eagerness of the two children uffizi gallery footnote 4 see the madonna of the cherries in the belvedere at vienna and the madonna and saints in the dresden gallery illustration titianmadonna and saints detail another similar composition reveals a still sweeter intimacy between mother and son the babe stretches out his hand coaxingly towards his mothers breast but she draws her veil about her gently denying his appeal a more beautiful mother or a more bewitching babe it were hard to find three fine halflength figures of saints complete this composition each of great interest and individuality but not necessary to the unity of actionthe madonna alone making a complete picture there are two copies of this work one in the belvedere at vienna and one in the louvre at paris the motif of this picture is not unique in art as will have been remarked in passing the first duty of maternity and one of its purest joys is to sustain the newborn life at the mothers breast a coarse interpretation of the subject desecrates a holy shrine while a delicate rendering such as raphaels or titians invests it with a new beauty other pictures of this class should be mentioned in the same connection there is one in the hermitage gallery at st petersburg attributed by late critics to the littleknown painter bernardino de conti the madonnas face her hair drawn smoothly over her temples has a beautiful matronliness still another is the madonna of the green cushion by solario in the louvre here the babe lies on a cushion before his mother who bends over him ecstatically her fair young face aglow with maternal love as she sees his contentment we have noticed that in one of corregios pictures the babe lies asleep on his mothers lap it is interesting to trace this pretty motif through other works of art no phase of motherhood is more touching than the watchful care which guards the child while he sleeps nor is infancy ever more appealing than in peaceful and innocent slumber mrs browning understood this well when she wrote her beautiful poem interpreting the thoughts of the virgin mary to the child jesus hopes and fears joy and pity are alternately stirred in the heart of the watcher as she bends over the tiny face scanning every change that flits across it each verse suggests a subject for a picture we should naturally expect that raphael would not overlook so beautiful a theme as the mother watching her sleeping child nor are we disappointed the madonna of the diadem in the louvre belongs to this class of pictures like the pastoral madonnas of the florentine period it includes the figure of the little st john to whom in this instance the proud mother is showing her babe daintily lifting the veil which covers his face the seventeenth century produced many pictures of this class among them a beautiful work by guido reni in rome deserves mention being executed with greater care than was usual with him sassoferrato and carlo dolce frequently painted the subject their madonnas often seem affected not to say sentimental after the simpler and nobler types of the earlier period but nowhere is their peculiar sweetness more appropriate than beside a sleeping babe the corsini picture by carlo dolce is an exquisite nursery scene its popularity depends more perhaps upon the babe than the mother like lady isobels child in another poem of motherhood by mrs browning he sleeps fast warm as if its mothers smile laden with loves dewy weight and red as rose of harpocrate dropt upon its eyelids pressed lashes to cheek in a seald rest in northern madonna art the mater amabilis is the preminent subject this fact is due partly to the german theological tendency to subordinate the mother to her divine son but more especially to the characteristic domesticity of teutonic peoples from van eyck and schongauer through drer and holbein down to rembrandt and rubens we trace this strongly marked predilection in every style of composition regardless of proprieties van eyck does not hesitate to occupy his richly dressed enthroned madonna at frankfort with giving her breast to her babe and drer portrays the same maternal duties in the virgin on the crescent moon holbeins meyer madonna splendid with her jewelled crown is not less motherly than schongauers young virgin sitting in a rude stable rembrandt in humble dutch interiors rubens in numerous holy families modelled upon the flemish life about him always conceive of the virgin mother as delighting in her maternal cares as has been said of drers madonnaand the description applies equally well to many others in the northshe suckles her son with a calm feeling of happiness she gazes upon him with admiration as he lies upon her lap she caresses him and presses him to her bosom without a thought whether it is becoming to her or whether she is being admired illustration drermadonna and child this entire absence of posing on the part of the german virgin is one of the most admirable elements in this art this characteristic is perfectly illustrated in drers portrait madonna of the belvedere gallery at vienna this is an excellent specimen of the master who alone of the germans is considered the peer of his great italian contemporaries frankly admired both by titian and raphael he has in common with them the supreme gift of seeing and reproducing natural human affections his work however is as thoroughly german as theirs is italian the madonna of this picture has the round maidenly face of the typical german ideal a transparent veil droops over the flowing hair covered by a blue drapery above the mother holds her child high in her arms bending her face over him the babe is a beautiful little fellow full of vivacity he holds up a pear gleefully to meet his mothers smile the picture is painted with great delicacy of finish the mater amabilis is the subject par excellence of modern madonna art carrying on its surface so much beauty and significance it is naturally attractive to all figure painters while other madonna subjects are too often beyond the comprehension of either the artist or his patron this falls within the range of both the shop windows are full of pretty pictures of this kind in all styles of treatment there are the portrait madonnas by gabriel max already mentioned and pastoral madonnas by bouguereau by carl mller by n barabino and by dagnanbouveret others carry the subject into the more formal compositions of the enthroned and enskied madonnas being as we have seen not without illustrious predecessors among the old masters of these we have guays mater amabilis where the mother leans from her throne to support her child playing on the step below with his cousin st john and mary l macombers picture where the enthroned madonna folds her babe in her protecting arms as if to shield him from impending evil illustration bodenhausenmadonna and child by bodenhausen we have the extremely popular mater amabilis in gloria where a girlish young mother her long hair streaming about her stands in upper air poised above the great ball of the earth holding her sweet babe to her heart pictures like these constantly reiterate the story of a mothers lovean old old story which begins again with every new birth chapter vii the madonna in adoration the madre pia the first tender joys of a mothers love are strangely mingled with awe her babe is a precious gift of god which she receives into trembling hands a new sense of responsibility presses upon her with almost overwhelming force hers is the highest honor given unto woman she accepts it with solemn joy deeming herself all too unworthy this spirit of humility has been idealized in art in the form of madonna known as the madre pia it represents the virgin mary adoring her son sometimes she kneels before him sometimes she sits with clasped hands holding him in her lap whatever the variation in attitude the thought is the same it is an expression of that higher finer aspect of motherhood which regards infancy as an object not only of love but of reverent humility it is a recognition of the great mystery of life which invests even the helpless babe with a dignity commanding respect a picture with so serious an intention can never be widely understood the meaning is too subtile for the casual observer an outgrowth of medival pietism it was superseded by more popular subjects and has never since been revived the subject had its origin as an idealized nativity set in pastoral surroundings which suggest the bethlehem manger theologically it represented the virgin as the first worshipper of her divine son but though the sacred mystery of marys experience sets her forever apart as blessed among women she is the type of true motherhood in all generations the madonna in adoration is properly speaking a fifteenth century subject it belongs primarily to that most mystic of all schools of art the umbrian centering in the town of perugia nowhere else was painting so distinctly an adjunct of religious services chiefly designed to aid the worshipper in prayer and contemplation as an exponent of the typical qualities of the perugian school stands the artist who is known by its name perugino his favorite subject is the madre pia and his best picture of the kind is the madonna of the national gallery having once seen her here the traveller recognizes her again and again in other galleries in the many replicas of this charming composition the madonna kneels in the foreground adoring with folded hands the child who is supported in a sitting posture on the ground by a guardian angel the virgins face is full of fervent and exalted emotion perugino had no direct imitator of his madre pia but his bolognese admirer francia treated the subject in a way that readily suggests the source of his inspiration his madonna of the rose garden in munich instantly recalls perugino the artist has however chosen a novel motif in representing the moment when the virgin is just sinking on her knees as if overcome by emotion between the umbrian school and the florentine a reciprocal influence was exerted if the latter taught the former many secrets of composition and technical execution the umbrians in turn imparted something of their mysticism to their more matteroffact neighbors while the umbrian school of the fifteenth century was occupied with the madre pia florence also was devoted to the same subject sculpture led the race and in the front ranks was luca della robbia founder of the school which bears his family name beginning as a worker in marble his inventive genius presently wrought out a style of sculpture peculiarly his own this was the enamelled terracotta basrelief showing pure white figures against a background of pale blue they were made chiefly in circular medallions lunettes and tabernacles and were scattered throughout the churches and homes of tuscany associated with luca in his work was his nephew andrea who in turn had three sculptor sons giovanni girolamo and luca ii so great was the demand for their ware that the della robbia studios became a veritable manufactory from which hundreds of pieces went forth of these a goodly number represent the madonna in adoration while it is difficult to trace every one of these with absolute correctness to its individual author the majority seem to be by andrea who as it would appear had a special fondness for the subject it must be acknowledged that the nephew is inferior to his uncle in his ideal of the virgin less original than luca in his conceptions and less noble in his results his work notwithstanding has many charming qualities which are specially appropriate to the character of the particular subject under consideration there is indeed a peculiar value in low relief for purposes of idealization it has an effect of spiritualizing the material and giving the figures an ethereal appearance andrea profited by this advantage and in addition showed great delicacy of judgment in subduing curves and retaining simplicity in his lines we may see all this in the popular tabernacle which he designed and of which there are at least five and probably more copies the madonna kneels prayerfully before her babe who lies on the ground by some lily stalks in the sky above are two cherubim and hands holding a crown there is a girlish grace in the kneeling figure and a rare sweetness in the face entirely free from sentimentality a severe simplicity of drapery and the absence of all unnecessary accessories are points of excellence worth noting the composition was sometimes varied by the introduction of different figures in the sky other cherubim or the head of the almighty with the dove only second in popularity to this was andreas circular medallion of the nativity with the virgin and st john in adoration there are two copies of this in the florentine academy one in the louvre and one in berlin the effect of crowding so many figures into a small compass is not so pleasing as the classical simplicity of the former composition illustration andrea della robbiamadonna in adoration contemporary with the della robbias was another florentine family of artists equally numerous of the five rossellini antonio is of greatest interest to us as a sculptor who had some qualities in common with the famous porcelain workers like them he had a special gift for the madonna in adoration we can see this subject in his best style of treatment in the beautiful nativity in san miniato which may be regarded as one of the most charming productions of the best period of tuscan art5 the tourist will consider it a rich reward for his climb to the quaint old church on the ramparts overhanging the arno if perchance his wanderings lead him on another occasion to the hill rising on the opposite side he will find in the cathedral of fiesole a fitting companion in the altarpiece by mino da fiesole this is a decidedly unique rendering of the madre pia the virgin kneels in a niche facing the spectator adoring the christchild who sits on the steps below her turning to the little baptist who kneels at one side on a still lower step footnote 5 cc perkins in tuscan sculptors illustration lorenzo di credinativity passing from the sculpture of florence to its painting it is fitting that we mention first of all the friend and fellowpupil of the umbrian perugino lorenzo di credi the two had much in common trained together in the workshop of the sculptor verrocchio in those days of intense religious stress they both became followers of the prophetprior of san marco savonarola their religious earnestness naturally found expression in the beautiful subject of the madre pia the florentine artist though not less devout than his friend introduces into his work an element of joy characteristic of his surroundings and more attractive than the somewhat melancholy types of umbria his adoration in the uffizi is an admirable example of his best work following the fashion made popular by the della robbias the artist chose for his composition the round picture or tondo by this elimination of unnecessary corners the attention centres in the beautiful figure of the virgin which occupies a large portion of the circle in exquisite keeping with the modest loveliness of her face a delicate transparent veil is knotted over her smooth hair and falls over the round curves of her neck in expression and attitude she is the perfect impersonation of the spirit of humility joyfully submissive to her high calling reverently acknowledging her unworthiness this picture may be taken as a typical example of the subject in florentine painting lorenzo himself repeated the composition many times and numerous other works could be mentioned strikingly similar in treatment by ghirlandajo in the florence academy by signorelli in the national gallery by albertinelli in the pitti by filippo lippi in the berlin gallery by filippino lippi in the pitti and so on through the list in many cases the subject seems to have been chosen not so much from any devotional spirit on the part of the painter as from force of imitation of the prevailing florentine fashion this is especially true in the case of filippo lippi who does not bear the best of reputations although a brother in the carmelite monastery his love of worldly pleasures often led him astray if we are to believe the gossip of the old annalists we may allow much for the exaggerations of scandal but still be forced to admit that his candid realism is plain evidence of a closer study of nature than of theology browning has given us a fine analysis of his character in the poem bearing his name fra lippo lippi the artist monk caught in the streets of the city on his return from some midnight revel explains his constant quarrel with the rules of art laid down by ecclesiastical authorities they insist that his business is to the souls of men and that it is quite from the mark of painting to make faces arms legs and bodies like the true on his part he claims that it will not help the interpretation of soul by painting body ill an intense lover of every beautiful line and color in gods world he believes that these things are given us to be thankful for not to pass over or despise obliged to devote himself to a class of subjects with which he had little sympathy he compromised with his critics by adopting the traditional forms of composition and treating them after the manner of genre painters in types drawn from the ordinary life about him the kneeling madre pia he painted three times two of the pictures are in the florence academy and the third and best is in the berlin gallery illustration filippo lippimadonna in adoration in the madonna of the uffizi he broke away somewhat from tradition and rendered quite a new version of the subject the virgin is seated with folded hands adoring her child who is held up before her by two boy angels his type of childhood is by no means pretty though altogether natural the virgin cannot be called either intellectual or spiritual but where as a noted critic has asked can we find a face more winsome and appealing certainly she is a lovely woman and if you get simple beauty and naught else thats somewhat and youll find the soul you have missed within yourself when you return him thanks the idea of the seated madre pia comparatively rare in florentine art is quite frequent in northern italy sometimes the setting is a landscape in the foreground of which the madonna sits adoring the babe lying on her lap examples are by basaiti paduan in the national gallery and by a painter of titians school in berlin much more common is the enthroned madonna in adoration and for this we may turn to the pictures of the vivarini bartolommeo and luigi or alvise these men were of muranese origin and in the very beginning of venetian arthistory were at the head of their profession until finally eclipsed by the rival family of the bellini among their works we find by each one at least three pictures of the type described as the most worthy of description we may select the altarpiece by luigi in the church of the redentore as it is one of the most popular madonnas in venice no collection is complete without it a green curtain forms the background against which the plain marble thronechair is brought into relief the virgin sits wrapt in her own thoughts an impersonation of tranquil dignity a heavy wimple falls low over her forehead entirely concealing her hair and with its severe simplicity accentuating the chaste beauty of her face two fascinating little cherubs sit on a parapet in front playing on lutes and lulled by their gentle music the sweet babe sleeps on serenely unconscious of it all illustration luigi vivarinimadonna and child before such pictures as this gleaming in the dim light of quiet chapels many a heart before unbelieving may learn a new reverence for the mysterious sanctity of motherhood chapter viii the madonna as witness in proportion to a mothers ideals and ambitions for her child does her love take on a higher and purer aspect the noblest mother is the most unselfish she regards her child as a sacred charge only temporarily committed to her keeping her care is to nurture and train him for his part in life this is the object of her constant endeavor thus she comes to look upon him as hers and yet not hers in one sense he is her very own in another he belongs to the universal life which he is to serve there is no conflict between the two ideas they are the obverse sides of one great truth both must be recognized for a complete understanding of life what is true of all motherhood finds a supreme illustration in the character of the virgin mary she understood from the first that her son had a great mission to fulfil that his work had somewhat to do with a mighty kingdom never for a moment did she lose sight of these things as she pondered them in her heart her highest joy was to present him to the world for the fulfilment of his calling as a subject of art this phase of the madonnas character requires a mode of treatment quite unlike that of the mater amabilis or the madre pia the attitude and expression of the virgin are appropriate to her office as the christbearer both mother and child no longer absorbed in each other direct their glance towards the people to whom he is given for a witness isaiah 554 these may be the spectators looking at the picture or the saints and votaries filling the composition the mothers lap is the throne for the child from which standing or sitting he gives his royal blessing it will be readily understood that so lofty a theme can not be common in art in our own day it has with the madre pia passed almost entirely out of the range of art subjects modern painters do not try such heights franz defregger is alone in having made an honest and earnest effort not without success to express his conception of the theme to his enthroned madonna at dlsach and his less wellknown madonna in glory let us pay this passing word of honor to approach our subject in the most systematic way we will go back to the beginnings of madonna art mrs jameson tells us that the group of virgin and son was in its first intention a theological symbol and not a representation it was a device set up in the orthodox churches as a definite formalization of a creed the first madonnas showed none of the aspects of ordinary motherhood in attitude gesture or expression the theological element in the picture was the first consideration we may take as a representative case the virgin nikepeja of victory supposed to be the same which eudocia wife of the emperor theodosius ii discovered in her travels in palestine and sent to constantinople whence it was finally brought to st marks venice the virgina halflength figureholds the child in front of her like a doll as if exhibiting him to the gaze of the worshippers before the altar over which the picture hung both faces look directly out at the spectator with grave and stiff solemnity the progress of painting and the growing love of beauty at length wrought a change the time came when art saw the possibility of uniting with the religious conception of previous centuries a more natural ideal of motherhood thus while the madonna continues to be preminently a witness of her sons greatness it is not at the sacrifice of motherly tenderness in venetian arthistory giovanni bellini stands at the period when the old was just merging into the new we have already seen how greatly he and his contemporaries differed from the painters of a later time taking advantage of all the progressive methods of the day they did not relinquish the religious spirit of their predecessors hence their work embodies the best elements of the old and new as we examine the bellini madonnas one after another we can not fail to notice how delicately they interpret the relation of the mother to her child loving and gracious as she is she is not the mater amabilis she is too preoccupied though not too cold for caresses neither is she the madre pia though by no means lacking in humility her thoughts are of the future rather than of the present true to a mothers instinct she encircles her child with a protecting arm but her face is turned not to his but to the world both are looking steadfastly forward to the great work before them their eyes have the farseeing look of those absorbed in noble dreams their faces are full of sweet earnestness not of the ascetic sort but joyful with a calm tranquil gladness this description applies almost equally well to a halfdozen or more of bellinis madonnas in various styles of composition for the sake of definiteness we may specify the madonna between st paul and st george in the venice academy the virgin is in halflength against a scarlet curtain supporting the child who stands on the coping of a balcony in technical qualities alone the picture is a notable one for precision of drawing breadth of light and shade and brilliant color in christian sentiment it is among the rare treasures of italian art the national gallery and the brera contain others which are very similar in style and conception the three enthroned madonnas which have already been noticed are not less remarkable for religious significance there is a peculiar freshness and vivacity in the san giobbe picture both virgin and child are alert and eager welcoming the future with smiling and youthful enthusiasm the frari madonna is of a more subdued type but is not less true to her ideal the virgin of san zaccaria is more thoughtful and reflective but she holds her child up bravely that he may give his blessing to mankind illustration giovanni bellinimadonna between st george and st paul detail it will have been noticed that the throne is an especially appropriate setting for the madonna as witness it is one of the functions of royalty that the queen should show the prince to his people we therefore turn naturally to this class of pictures for examples to those of bellini just cited we may add from the others mentioned in the second chapter the madonnas by cima by palma and by montagna in venetian art and by luini and by botticelli in the lombard and florentine schools respectively luinis picture is one which readily touches the heart the virgin unites the sweetness of fresh young motherhood with womanly dignity of character her smile has nothing of mystery in it it is simply sweet and winning the christchild is a lovely boy steadying himself against his mothers breast and yet with an air of selfreliance the two understand each other well illustration luinimadonna with st barbara and st anthony one could hardly imagine two more dissimilar spirits than luini and botticelli to luinis virgin the consciousness of her sons greatness is a proud honor accepted seriously but gladly to botticelli on the other hand it brings a profound melancholy this is so marked that at first sight almost every one is repelled by botticelli and yields only after long familiarity to the mysterious fascination of the sadeyed madonna who holds her babe almost listlessly as her head droops with the weight of her sorrow her expression is the same whatever her attitude when she presses her babe to her bosom as the mater amabilis in the borghese gallery at rome in the dresden gallery and louvre or when as witness to her sons destiny she holds him forth to be seen of men it is in this last capacity that her mood is most intelligible she seems oppressed rather than humbled by her honors reluctant rather than glad to assume them yet with proud dignity determined to do her part though her heart break in the doing her nature is too deep to accept the joy without counting the cost and her vision looks beyond bethlehem to calvary this is well illustrated in the picture of the berlin gallery6 the queen mother rises with the prince to receive the homage of humanity the boy old beyond his years gravely raises his right hand to bless his people the other still clinging with infantile grace to the dress of his mother lovely rosecrowned angels hold court on either side bearing lighted tapers in jars of roses footnote 6 the berlin gallery contains two enthroned madonnas attributed to botticelli the description here and on page 40 makes it clear that the reference is to the picture numbered 102 this does not appear in berensons list of botticellis works but is treated as authentic by crowe and cavalcaselle the madonna of the pomegranate is another work by botticelli which belongs in this class of pictures it is a tondo in the uffizi showing the figures in half length the virgin encircled by angels holds the child half reclining on her lap her face is inexpressibly sad and the child shares her mood as he raises his little hand to bless the spectator two angels bear the virgins flowers roses and lilies two others hold books they bend towards the queen as the petals of a rose bend towards the centre with the serious grace peculiar to botticelli illustration botticellimadonna of the pomegranate in connection with the peculiar type of melancholy exhibited on the face of botticellis madonna it will be of interest to refer to the work of francia the two artists were in some points kindred spirits both felt the burden of lifes mystery and sorrow francia as we have seen imbibed from the works of perugino something of the spirit of mysticism common to the umbrian school but while there is a certain resemblance between his madonna and peruginos the former has less of sentimentality than the latter and more real melancholy like botticellis virgin she acts her part halfheartedly as if the sword had already begun to pierce her heart francias favorite madonna subjects were of the higher order the madre pia and the madonna as witness in treating the latter his christchild is always in keeping with the mother a grave little fellow who gives the blessing with almost touching dignity enthroned madonnas illustrating the theme are those of the hermitage at st petersburg of the belvedere at vienna and the famous bentivoglio madonna in s jacopo maggiore at bologna the lastnamed is one of the works which enable us to understand raphaels high praise of the bolognese master it is a noble composition full of strong religious feeling illustration murillomadonna and child it is a long leap from the fifteenth to the seventeenth centuries taking us from a period of genuine religious fervor in art into an age of artificial imitation in the midst of the decadence of old ideals and the birth of art methods entirely new arose one who seemed to be the reincarnation of the old spirit in a form peculiar to his age and race this was murillo the peasantpainter of spain than whom was never artist more pious not even excepting the angelic brother of san marco he alone in the seventeenth century kept alive the pure flame of religious fervor which had burned within the devout italians of the early school through all his pictures of the virgin and child we can see that the madonna as the christbearer is the ideal he always has in view he falls short of it not through any lack of earnestness but because his type of womanhood is incapable of expressing such lofty idealism his virgins are modelled upon the simple andalusian maidens sweet timid darkeyed creatures their faces glow with gentle affection as they look wistfully out of the picture or raise their eyes to heaven as if dimly discerning the heights which they have never reached the pitti madonna is one of this sweet company and perhaps the loveliest of them all both she and her beautiful boy are full of gentle earnestness and if they are too simpleminded to realize what is in store for them they are none the less ready to do the fathers will one more picture remains for us to consider as an illustration of the madonna as witness had we mentioned it first nothing further could have been said on the subject the sistine madonna is the greatest ever produced from every point of view we have already noted the superiority of its artistic composition over all other enskied madonnas and are the more ready to appreciate its higher merits for its strongest hold upon our admiration is in its moral and religious significance its theme is the transfiguration of loving and consecrated motherhood mother and child united in love move towards the glorious consummation of the heavenly kingdom illustration raphaelsistine madonna it has been said that raphael made no preparatory studies for this madonna but in a larger sense he spent his life in preparation for it he had begun by imitating the mystic sweetness of peruginos types drawn by an intuitive delicacy of perception to this spiritual idealism while yet too inexperienced to express any originality then by an inevitable reaction he threw himself into the creation of a purely naturalistic madonna and carried the mater amabilis to its utmost perfection having mastered all the secrets of womans beauty he returned once more to the higher realm of idealism to send forth his matured conception of the madonna as the christbearer the sistine madonna is above all words of praise all extravagance of expression is silenced before her simplicity hers is the beauty of symmetrically developed womanhood the perfect poise of her figure is not more marked than the perfect poise of her character not one false note not one exaggerated emphasis jars upon the harmony of body soul and spirit confident but entirely unassuming serious but without sadness joyous but not to mirthfulness eager but without haste she moves steadily forward with steps timed to the rhythmic music of the spheres the child is no burden but a part of her very being the two are one in love thought and purpose sharing the secret of his sacred calling the mother bears her son forth to meet his glorious destiny art can pay no higher tribute to mary the mother of jesus than to show her in this phase of her motherhood we sympathize with her maternal tenderness lavishing fond caresses upon her child we go still deeper into her experience when we see her bowed in sweet humility before the cares and duties she is called upon to assume but we are admitted to the most cherished aspirations of her soul when we see her oblivious of self carrying her child forth to the service of humanity it is thus that she becomes one of his witnesses unto the people it is thus that all generations shall call her blessed bibliography mrs anna jameson the legends of the madonna boston 1896 crowe and cavalcaselle history of painting
