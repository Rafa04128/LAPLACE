point represents the point vertically over the observers head and the circumference represents his horizon the plan of each map is such that the direction of a star or constellation as respects the compasspoints and its elevation also above the horizon at the given season can be at once determined two illustrations of the use of the maps will serve to explain their nature better than any detailed description suppose first thatat one of the hours named under map ithe observer wishes to find castor and polluxturning to map i he sees that these stars lie in the lower lefthand quadrant and very nearly towards the point marked se that is they are to be looked for on the sky towards the southeast also it is seen that the two stars lie about onefourth of the way from the centre towards the circumference hence on the sky the stars will be found about onefourth of the way from the zenith towards the horizon castor will be seen immediately above pollux next suppose that at one of the hours named the observer wishes to learn what stars are visible towards the west and northwestturning the map until the portion of the circumference marked w nw is lowermost he sees that in the direction named the square of pegasus lies not very high above the horizon one diagonal of the square being vertical the other nearly horizontal above the square is andromeda to the right of which lies cassiopeia the stars beta and epsilon of this constellation lying directly towards the northwest while the star alpha lies almost exactly midway between the zenith and the horizon above andromeda a little towards the left lies perseus algol being almost exactly towards the west and onethird of the way from the zenith towards the horizon because onethird of the way from the centre towards the circumference of the map almost exactly in the zenith is the star delta aurig the four maps are miniatures of maps i iv vii and x of my constellation seasons fourthmagnitude stars however being omitted plates ii iii iv and v illustrating chapters ii iii iv and v plates ii and iv contain four starmaps they not only serve to indicate the configuration of certain important stargroups but they illustrate the construction of maps such as the observer should make for himself when he wishes to obtain an accurate knowledge of particular regions of the sky they are all made to one scale and on the conical projectionthe simplest and best of all projections for maps of this sort the way in which the meridians and parallels for this projection are laid down is described in my handbook of the stars with a little practice a few minutes will suffice for sweeping out the equidistant circular arcs which mark the parallels and ruling in the straight meridians the dotted line across three of the maps represents a portion of the horizontal circle midway between the zenith and the horizon at the hour at which the map is supposed to be used at other hours of course this line would be differently situated plates iii and v represent fiftytwo of the objects mentioned in the abovenamed chapters as reference is made to these figures in the text little comment is here required it is to be remarked however that the circles and especially the small circles do not represent the whole of the telescopes field of view only a small portion of it the object of these figures is to enable the observer to know what to expect when he turns his telescope towards a difficult double star many of the objects depicted are very easy doubles these are given as objects of reference the observer having seen the correspondence between an easy double and its picture as respects the relation between the line joining the components and the apparent path of the double across the telescopes field of view will know how to interpret the picture of a difficult double in this respect and as all the small figures are drawn to one scale he will also know how far apart he may expect to find the components of a difficult double thus he will have an exact conception of the sort of duplicity he is to look for and this iscrede expertoa great step towards the detection of the stars duplicity plates vi and vii illustrating chapters vi and vii the views of mercury venus and mars in these plates except the smaller view of jupiter in plate vii are supposed to be seen with the same power the observer must not expect to see the details presented in the views of mars with anything like the distinctness i have here given to them if he place the plate at a distance of six or seven yards he will see the views more nearly as mars is likely to appear in a good threeinch aperture the chart of mars is a reduction of one i have constructed from views by mr dawes i believe that nearly all the features included in the chart are permanent though not always visible i take this opportunity of noting that the eighteen orthographic pictures of mars presented with my shilling chart are to be looked on rather as maps than as representing telescopic views they illustrate usefully the varying presentation of mars towards the earth the observer can obtain other such illustrations for himself by filling in outlines traced from those given at the foot of plate vi with details from the chart it is to be noted that mars varies in presentation not only as respects the greater or less opening out of his equator towards the north or south but as respects the apparent slope of his polar axis to the right or left the four projections as shown or inverted or seen from the back of the plate held up to the light give presentations of mars towards the sun at twelve periods of the martial yearviz at the autumnal and vernal equinoxes at the two solstices and at intermediate periods corresponding to our terrestrial months in fact by means of these projections one might readily form a series of sunviews of mars resembling my sunviews of the earth in the first view of jupiter it is to be remarked that the three satellites outside the disc are supposed to be moving in directions appreciably parallel to the belts on the discthe upper satellites from right to left the lower one from left to right in general the satellites when so near to the disc are not seen in a straight line as the three shown in the figure happen to be of the three spots on the disc the faintest is a satellite the neighbouring dark spot its shadow the other dark spot the shadow of the satellite close to the planets disc halfhours with the telescope chapter i a halfhour on the structure of the telescope there are few instruments which yield more pleasure and instruction than the telescope even a small telescopeonly an inch and a half or two inches perhaps in aperturewill serve to supply profitable amusement to those who know how to apply its powers i have often seen with pleasure the surprise with which the performance even of an operaglass well steadied and directed towards certain parts of the heavens has been witnessed by those who have supposed that nothing but an expensive and colossal telescope could afford any views of interest but a wellconstructed achromatic of two or three inches in aperture will not merely supply amusement and instructionit may be made to do useful work the student of astronomy is often deterred from telescopic observation by the thought that in a field wherein so many have laboured with abilities and means perhaps far surpassing those he may possess he is little likely to reap results of any utility he argues that since the planets stars and nebul have been scanned by herschel and rosse with their gigantic mirrors and at pulkova and greenwich with refractors whose construction has taxed to the utmost the ingenuity of the optician and mechanic it must be utterly useless for an unpractised observer to direct a telescope of moderate power to the examination of these objects now passing over the consideration that a small telescope may afford its possessor much pleasure of an intellectual and elevated character even if he is never able by its means to effect original discoveries two arguments may be urged in favour of independent telescopic observation in the first place the student who wishes to appreciate the facts and theories of astronomy should familiarize himself with the nature of that instrument to which astronomers have been most largely indebted in the second place some of the most important discoveries in astronomy have been effected by means of telescopes of moderate power used skilfully and systematically one instance may suffice to show what can be done in this way the wellknown telescopist goldschmidt who commenced astronomical observation at the age of fortyeight in 1850 added fourteen asteroids to the solar system not to speak of important discoveries of nebul and variable stars by means of a telescope only five feet in focal length mounted on a movable tripod stand the feeling experienced by those who look through a telescope for the first timeespecially if it is directed upon a planet or nebulais commonly one of disappointment they have been told that such and such powers will exhibit jupiters belts saturns rings and the continentoutlines on mars yet though perhaps a higher power is applied they fail to detect these appearances and can hardly believe that they are perfectly distinct to the practised eye the expectations of the beginner are especially liable to disappointment in one particular he forms an estimate of the view he is to obtain of a planet by multiplying the apparent diameter of the planet by the magnifying power of his telescope and comparing the result with the apparent diameter of the sun or moon let us suppose for instance that on the day of observation jupiters apparent diameter is 45 and that the telescopic power applied is 40 then in the telescope jupiter should appear to have a diameter of 1800 or half a degree which is about the same as the moons apparent diameter but when the observer looks through the telescope he obtains a viewinteresting indeed and instructivebut very different from what the above calculation would lead him to expect he sees a disc apparently much smaller than the moons and not nearly so welldefined in outline in a line with the discs centre there appear three or four minute dots of light the satellites of the planet and perhaps if the weather is favourable and the observer watchful he will be able to detect faint traces of belts across the planets disc yet in such a case the telescope is not in fault the planet really appears of the estimated size in fact it is often possible to prove this in a very simple manner if the observer wait until the planet and the moon are pretty near together he will find that it is possible to view the planet with one eye through the telescope and the moon with the unaided eye in such a manner that the two discs may coincide and thus their relative apparent dimensions be at once recognised nor should the indistinctness and incompleteness of the view be attributed to imperfection of the telescope they are partly due to the nature of the observation and the low power employed and partly to the inexperience of the beginner it is to such a beginner that the following pages are specially addressed with the hope of affording him aid and encouragement in the use of one of the most enchanting of scientific instrumentsan instrument that has created for astronomers a new sense so to speak by which in the words of the ancient poet subjecere oculis distantia sidera nostris theraque ingenio supposuere suo in the first place it is necessary that the beginner should rightly know what is the nature of the instrument he is to use and this is the more necessary because while it is perfectly easy to obtain such knowledge without any profound acquaintance with the science of optics yet in many popular works on this subject the really important points are omitted and even in scientific works such points are too often left to be gathered from a formula when the observer has learnt what it is that his instrument is actually to do for him he will know how to estimate its performance and how to vary the application of its powerswhether illuminating or magnifyingaccording to the nature of the object to be observed let us consider what it is that limits the range of natural vision applied to distant objects what causes an object to become invisible as its distance increases two things are necessary that an object should be visible it must be large enough to be appreciated by the eye and it must send light enough thus increase of distance may render an object invisible either through diminution of its apparent size or through diminution in the quantity of light it sends to the eye or through both these causes combined a telescope therefore or as its name implies an instrument to render distant objects visible must be both a magnifying and an illuminating instrument illustration fig 1 let ef fig 1 be an object not near to ab as in the figure but so far off that the bounding lines from a and b would meet at the point corresponding to the point p then if a large convex glass ab called an objectglass be interposed between the object and the eye all those rays which proceeding from p fall on ab will be caused to converge nearly to a point p the same is true for every point of the object emf and thus a small image emf will be formed this image will not lie exactly on a flat surface but will be curved about the point midway between a and b as a centre now if the lens ab is removed and an eye is placed at m to view the distant object emf those rays only from each point of the object which fall on the pupil of the eye whose diameter is about equal to mp suppose will serve to render the object visible on the other hand every point of the image emf has received the whole of the light gathered up by the large glass ab if then we can only make this light available it is clear that we shall have acquired a large increase of light from the distant object now it will be noticed that the light which has converged to p diverges from p so that an eye placed that this diverging pencil of rays may fall upon it would be too small to receive the whole of the pencil or if it did receive the whole of this pencil it clearly could not receive the whole of the pencils proceeding from other parts of the image emf something would be gained though even in this case since it is clear that an eye thus placed at a distance of ten inches from emf which is about the average distance of distinct vision would not only receive much more light from the image emf than it would from the object emf but see the image much larger than the object it is in this way that a simple objectglass forms a telescope a circumstance we shall presently have to notice more at length but we want to gain the full benefit of the light which has been gathered up for us by our objectglass we therefore interpose a small convex glass ab called an eyeglass between the image and the eye at such a distance from the image that the divergent pencil of rays is converted into a pencil of parallel or nearly parallel rays call this an emergent pencil then all the emergent pencils now converge to a point on the axial line mm produced beyond m and an eye suitably placed can take in all of them at once thus the whole or a large part of the image is seen at once but the image is seen inverted as shown this is the telescope as it was first discovered and such an arrangement would now be called a simple astronomical telescope let us clearly understand what each part of the astronomical telescope does for us the objectglass ab gives us an illuminated image the amount of illumination depending on the size of the objectglass the eyeglass enables us to examine the image microscopically we may apply eyeglasses of different focal length it is clear that the shorter the focal length of ab the nearer must ab be placed to the image and the smaller will the emergent pencils be but the greater the magnifying power of the eyeglass if the emergent pencils are severally larger than the pupil of the eye light is wasted at the expense of magnifying power therefore the eyeglass should never be of greater focal length than that which makes the emergent pencils about equal in diameter to the pupil of the eye on the other hand the eyeglass must not be of such small focal length that the image appears indistinct and contorted or dull for want of light illustration fig 2 let us compare with the arrangement exhibited in fig 1 that adopted by galileo surprise is sometimes expressed that this instrument which in the hands of the great florentine astronomer effected so much should now be known as the nonastronomical telescope i think this will be readily understood when we compare the two arrangements in the galilean telescope a small concave eyeglass ab fig 2 is placed between the objectglass and the image in fact no image is allowed to be formed in this arrangement but the convergent pencils are intercepted by the concave eyeglass and converted into parallel emergent pencils now in fig 2 the concave eyeglass is so placed as to receive only a part of the convergent pencil a p b and this is the arrangement usually adopted by using a concave glass of shorter focus which would therefore be placed nearer to m p the whole of the convergent pencil might be received in this as in the former case but then the axis of the emergent pencil instead of returning as we see it in fig 1 towards the axis of the telescope would depart as much from that axis thus there would be no point on the axis at which the eye could be so placed as to receive emergent pencils showing any considerable part of the object the difference may be compared to that between looking through the small end of a coneshaped roll of paper and looking through the large end in the former case the eye sees at once all that is to be seen through the roll supposed fixed in position in the latter the eye may be moved about so as to command the same range of view but at any instant sees over a much smaller range to return to the arrangement actually employed which is illustrated by the common operaglass we see that the full illuminating power of the telescope is not brought into play but this is not the only objection to the galilean telescope it is obvious that if the part c d of the objectglass were covered the point p would not be visible whereas in the astronomical arrangement no other effect is produced on the visibility of an object by covering part of the objectglass than a small loss of illumination in other words the dimensions of the field of view of a galilean telescope depend on the size of the objectglass whereas in the astronomical telescope the field of view is independent of the size of the objectglass the difference may be readily tested if we direct an operaglass upon any object we shall find that any covering placed over a part of the objectglass becomes visible when we look through the instrument interfering therefore pro tanto with the range of view a covering similarly placed on any part of the objectglass of an astronomical telescope does not become visible when we look through the instrument the distinction has a very important bearing on the theory of telescopic vision in considering the application of the telescope to practical observation the circumstance that in the galilean telescope no real image is formed is yet more important a real image admits of measurement linear or angular while to a virtual image such an image for instance as is formed by a common lookingglass no such process can be applied in simple observation the only noticeable effect of this difference is that whereas in the astronomical telescope a stop or diaphragm can be inserted in the tube so as to cut off what is called the ragged edge of the field of view which includes all the part not reached by full pencils of light from the objectglass there is no means of remedying the corresponding defect in the galilean telescope it would be a very annoying defect in a telescope intended for astronomical observation since in general the edge of the field of view is not perceptible at night the unpleasant nature of the defect may be seen by looking through an operaglass and noticing the gradual fading away of light round the circumference of the field of view the properties of reflection as well as of refraction have been enlisted into the service of the astronomical observer the formation of an image by means of a concave mirror is exhibited in fig 3 as the observers head would be placed between the object and the mirror if the image formed as in fig 3 were to be microscopically examined various devices are employed in the construction of reflecting telescopes to avoid the loss of light which would resulta loss which would be important even with the largest mirrors yet constructed thus in gregorys telescope a small mirror having its concavity towards the great one is placed in the axis of the tube and forms an image which is viewed through an aperture in the middle of the great mirror a similar plan is adopted in cassegrains telescope a small convex mirror replacing the concave one in newtons telescope a small inclinedplane reflector is used which sends the pencil of light off at rightangles to the axis of the tube in herschels telescope the great mirror is inclined so that the image is formed at a slight distance from the axis of the telescope in the two first cases the object is viewed in the usual or direct way the image being erect in gregorys and inverted in cassegrains in the third the observer looks through the side of the telescope seeing an inverted image of the object in the last the observer sees the object inverted but not altered as respects right and left the lastmentioned method of viewing objects is the only one in which the observers back is turned towards the object yet this method is called the front viewapparently quasi lucus a non lucendo illustration fig 3 it appears then that in all astronomical telescopes reflecting or refracting a real image of an object is submitted to microscopical examination of this fact the possessor of a telescope may easily assure himself for if the eyeglass be removed and a small screen be placed at the focus of the objectglass there will appear upon the screen a small picture of any object towards which the tube is turned but the image may be viewed in another way which requires to be noticed if the eye placed at a distance of five or six inches from the image be directed down the tube the image will be seen as before in fact just as a single convex lens of short focus is the simplest microscope so a simple convex lens of long focus is the simplest telescope1 but a singular circumstance will immediately attract the observers notice a real picture or the image formed on the screen as in the former case can be viewed at varying distances but when we view the image directly it will be found that for distinct vision the eye must be placed almost exactly at a fixed distance from the image this peculiarity is more important than it might be thought at first sight in fact it is essential that the observer who would rightly apply the powers of his telescope or fairly test its performance should understand in what respect an image formed by an objectglass or objectmirror differs from a real object the peculiarities to be noted are the curvature indistinctness and false colouring of the image the curvature of the image is the least important of the three defects nameda fortunate circumstance since this defect admits neither of remedy nor modification the image of a distant object instead of lying in a plane that is forming what is technically called a flat field forms part of a spherical surface whose centre is at the centre of the objectglass hence the centre of the field of view is somewhat nearer to the eye than are the outer parts of the field the amount of curvature clearly depends on the extent of the field of view and therefore is not great in powerful telescopes thus if we suppose that the angular extent of the field is about half a degree a large or lowpower field the centre is nearer than the boundary of the field by about 1320th part only of the fields diameter the indistinctness of the image is partly due to the obliquity of the pencils which form parts of the image and partly to what is termed spherical aberration the first cause cannot be modified by the opticians skill and is not important when the field of view is small spherical aberration causes those parts of a pencil which fall near the boundary of a convex lens to converge to a nearer ie shorter focus than those which fall near the centre this may be corrected by a proper selection of the forms of the two lenses which replace in all modern telescopes the single lens hitherto considered the false colouring of the image is due to chromatic aberration the pencil of light proceeding from a point converges not to one point but to a short line of varying colour thus a series of coloured images is formed at different distances from the objectglass so that if a screen were placed to receive the mean image in focus a coloured fringe due to the other images out of focus and therefore too large would surround the mean image newton supposed that it was impossible to get rid of this defect and therefore turned his attention to the construction of reflectors but the discovery that the dispersive powers of different glasses are not proportional to their reflective powers supplied opticians with the means of remedying the defect let us clearly understand what is the discovery referred to if with a glass prism of a certain form we produce a spectrum of the sun this spectrum will be thrown a certain distance away from the point on which the suns rays would fall if not interfered with this distance depends on the refractive power of the glass the spectrum will have a certain length depending on the dispersive power of the glass now if we change our prism for another of exactly the same shape but made of a different kind of glass we shall find the spectrum thrown to a different spot if it appeared that the length of the new spectrum was increased or diminished in exactly the same proportion as its distance from the line of the suns direct light it would have been hopeless to attempt to remedy chromatic aberration newton took it for granted that this was so but the experiments of hall and the dollonds showed that there is no such strict proportionality between the dispersive and refractive powers of different kinds of glass it accordingly becomes possible to correct the chromatic aberration of one glass by superadding that of another illustration fig 4 this is effected by combining as shown in fig 4 a convex lens of crown glass with a concave lens of flint glass the convex lens being placed nearest to the object a little colour still remains but not enough to interfere seriously with the distinctness of the image but even if the image formed by the objectglass were perfect yet this image viewed through a single convex lens of short focus placed as in fig 1 would appear curved indistinct coloured and also distorted because viewed by pencils of light which do not pass through the centre of the eyeglass these effects can be diminished but not entirely removed together by using an eyepiece consisting of two lenses instead of a single eyeglass the two forms of eyepiece most commonly employed are exhibited in figs 5 and 6 fig 5 is huyghens eyepiece called also the negative eyepiece because a real image is formed behind the fieldglass the lens which lies nearest to the objectglass fig 6 represents ramsdens eyepiece called also the positive eyepiece because the real image formed by the objectglass lies in front of the fieldglass illustration fig 5 illustration fig 6 the course of a slightly oblique pencil through either eyepiece is exhibited in the figures the lenses are usually planoconvex the convexities being turned towards the objectglass in the negative eyepiece and towards each other in the positive eyepiece coddington has shown however that the best forms for the lenses of the negative eyepiece are those shown in fig 5 the negative eyepiece being achromatic is commonly employed in all observations requiring distinct vision only but as it is clearly unfit for observations requiring micrometrical measurement or reference to fixed lines at the focus of the objectglass the positive eyepiece is used for these purposes for observing objects at great elevations the diagonal eyetube is often convenient its construction is shown in fig 7 abc is a totally reflecting prism of glass the rays from the objectglass fall on the face ab are totally reflected on the face bc and emerge through the face ac in using this eyepiece it must be remembered that it lengthens the sliding eyetube which must therefore be thrust further in or the object will not be seen in focus there is an arrangement by which the change of direction is made to take place between the two glasses of the eyepiece with this arrangement known as the diagonal eyepiece no adjustment of the eyetube is required however for amateurs telescopes the more convenient arrangement is the diagonal eyetube since it enables the observer to apply any eyepiece he chooses just as with the simple sliding eyetube illustration fig 7 we come next to the important question of the mounting of our telescope the best known and in some respects the simplest method of mounting a telescope for general observation is that known as the altitudeandazimuth mounting in this method the telescope is pointed towards an object by two motionsone giving the tube the required altitude or elevation the other giving it the required azimuth or direction as respects the compass points for small altazimuths the ordinary pillarandclaw stand is sufficiently steady for larger instruments other arrangements are needed both to give the telescope steadiness and to supply slow movements in altitude and azimuth the student will find no difficulty in understanding the arrangement of slidingtubes and rackwork commonly adopted this arrangement seems to me to be in many respects defective however the slow movement in altitude is not uniform but varies in effect according to the elevation of the object observed it is also limited in range and quite a little series of operations has to be gone through when it is required to direct the telescope towards a new quarter of the heavens however expert the observer may become by practice in effecting these operations they necessarily take up some time performed as they must be in the dark or by the light of a small lantern and during this time it often happens that a favourable opportunity for observation is lost these disadvantages are obviated when the telescope is mounted in such a manner as is exhibited in fig 8 which represents a telescope of my own construction the slow movement in altitude is given by rotating the rod he the endless screw in which turns the small wheel at b whose axle in turn bears a pinionwheel working in the teeth of the quadrant a the slow movement in azimuth is given in like manner by rotating the rod he the lanternwheel at the end of which turns a crownwheel on whose axle is a pinionwheel working in the teeth of the circle c the casings at e and e in which the rods he and he respectively work are so fastened by elastic cords that an upward pressure on the handle h or a downward pressure on the handle h at once releases the endless screw or the crownwheel respectively so that the telescope can be swept at once through any desired angle in altitude or azimuth this method of mounting has other advantages the handles are conveniently situated and constant in position also as they do not work directly on the telescope they can be turned without setting the tube in vibration illustration fig 8 i do not recommend the mounting to be exactly as shown in fig 8 that method is much too expensive for an altazimuth but a simple arrangement of belted wheels in place of the toothed wheels a and c might very readily be prepared by the ingenious amateur telescopist and i feel certain that the comfort and convenience of the arrangement would amply repay him for the labour it would cost him my own telescopethough the large toothedwheel and the quadrant were made inconveniently heavy through a mistake of the workman who constructed the instrumentworked as easily and almost as conveniently as an equatorial still it is well for the observer who wishes systematically to survey the heavensand who can afford the expenseto obtain a wellmounted equatorial in this method of mounting the main axis is directed to the pole of the heavens the other axis at right angles to the first carries the telescopetube one of the many methods adopted for mounting equatorials is that exhibitedwith the omission of some minor detailsin fig 9 a is the polar axis b is the axis called the declination axis which bears the telescope the circles c and d serve to indicate by means of verniers revolving with the axes the motion of the telescope in right ascension and declination respectively the weight w serves to counterpoise the telescope and the screws s s s s serve to adjust the instrument so that the polar axis shall be in its proper position the advantage gained by the equatorial method of mounting is that only one motion is required to follow a star owing to the diurnal rotation of the earth the stars appear to move uniformly in circles parallel to the celestial equator and it is clear that a star so moving will be kept in the field of view if the telescope once directed to the star be made to revolve uniformly and at a proper rate round the polar axis illustration fig 9 the equatorial can be directed by means of the circles c and d to any celestial object whose right ascension and declination are known on the other hand to bring an object into the field of view of an altazimuth it is necessary either that the object itself should be visible to the naked eye or else that the position of the object should be pretty accurately learned from starmaps so that it may be picked up by the altazimuth after a little searching a small telescope called a finder is usually attached to all powerful telescopes intended for general observation the finder has a large field of view and is adjusted so as to have its axis parallel to that of the large telescope thus a star brought to the centre of the large field of the finder indicated by the intersection of two lines placed at the focus of the eyeglass is at or very near the centre of the small field of the large telescope if a telescope has no finder it will be easy for the student to construct one for himself and will be a useful exercise in optics two convex lenses not very different in size from those shown in fig 1 and placed as there shownthe distance between them being the sum of the focal lengths of the two glassesin a small tube of card wood or tin will serve the purpose of a finder for a small telescope it can be attached by wires to the telescopetube and adjusted each night before commencing observation the adjustment is thus manageda low power being applied to the telescope the tube is turned towards a bright star this is easily effected with a low power then the finder is to be fixed by means of its wires in such a position that the star shall be in the centre of the field of the finder when also in the centre of the telescopes field when this has been done the finder will greatly help the observations of the evening since with high powers much time would be wasted in bringing an object into the field of view of the telescope without the aid of a finder yet more time would be wasted in the case of an object not visible to the naked eye but whose position with reference to several visible stars is known since while it is easy to bring the point required to the centre of the finders field in which the guiding stars are visible it is very difficult to direct the telescopes tube on a point of this sort a card tube with wire fastenings such as we have described may appear a very insignificant contrivance to the regular observer with his wellmounted equatorial and carefullyadjusted finder but to the first attempts of the amateur observer it affords no insignificant assistance as i can aver from my own experience without ita superior finder being wantingour halfhours would soon be wasted away in that most wearisome and annoying of all employments trying to pick up celestial objects it behoves me at this point to speak of starmaps such maps are of many different kinds there are the observatory maps in which the places of thousands of stars are recorded with an amazing accuracy our beginner is not likely to make use of or to want such maps as these then there are maps merely intended to give a good general idea of the appearance of the heavens at different hours and seasons plate i presents four maps of this sort but a more complete series of eight maps has been published by messrs walton and maberly in an octavo work and my own constellationseasons give at the same price twelve quarto maps of four of which those in plate i are miniatures showing the appearance of the sky at any hour from month to month or on any night at successive intervals of two hours but maps intermediate in character to these and to observatory maps are required by the amateur observer such are the societys six gnomonic maps the set of six gnomonic maps in johnstones atlas of astronomy and my own set of twelve gnomonic maps the societys maps are a remarkably good set containing on the scale of a teninch globe all the stars in the catalogue of the astronomical society down to the fifth magnitude the distortion however is necessarily enormous when the celestial sphere is presented in only six gnomonic maps in my maps all the stars of the british association catalogue down to the fifth magnitude are included on the scale of a sixinch globe the distortion is scarcely a fourth of that in the societys maps the maps are so arranged that the relative positions of all the stars in each hemisphere can be readily gathered from a single view and black duplicatemaps serve to show the appearance of the constellations it is often convenient to make small maps of a part of the heavens we may wish to study closely my handbook of the stars has been prepared to aid the student in the construction of such maps in selecting maps it is well to be able to recognise the amount of distortion and scalevariation this may be done by examining the spaces included between successive parallels and meridians near the edges and angles of the maps and comparing these either with those in the centre of the map or with the known figures and dimensions of the corresponding spaces on a globe we may now proceed to discuss the different tests which the intending purchaser of a telescope should apply to the instrument the excellence of an objectglass can be satisfactorily determined only by testing the performance of the telescope in the manner presently to be described but it is well to examine the quality of the glass as respects transparency and uniformity of texture bubbles scratches and other such defects are not very important since they do not affect the distinctness of the field as they would in a galilean telescopea little light is lost and that is all the same remark applies to dust upon the glass the glass should be kept as free as possible from dirt damp or dust but it is not advisable to remove every speck which despite such precaution may accidentally fall upon the objectglass when it becomes necessary to clean the glass it is to be noted that the substance used should be soft perfectly dry and free from dust silk is often recommended but some silk is exceedingly objectionable in textureold silk perfectly soft to the touch is perhaps as good as anything if the dust which has fallen on the glass is at all gritty the glass will suffer by the method of cleaning commonly adopted in which the dust is gathered up by pressure the proper method is to clean a small space near the edge of the glass and to sweep from that space as centre in this way the dust is pushed before the silk or washleather and does not cut the glass it is well always to suspect the presence of gritty dust and adopt this cautious method of cleaning the two glasses should on no account be separated in examining an eyepiece the quality of the glass should be noted and care taken that both glasses but especially the fieldglass are free from the least speck scratch or blemish of any kind for these defects will be exhibited in a magnified state in the field of view hence the eyepieces require to be as carefully preserved from damp and dust as the objectglass and to be more frequently cleaned the tube of the telescope should be light but strong and free from vibration its quality in the last respect can be tested by lightly striking it when mounted the sound given out should be dead or nonresonant the inside of the tube must absorb extraneous light and should therefore be coloured a dull black and stops of varying radius should be placed along its length with the same object sliding tubes rackwork etc should work closely yet easily the telescope should be well balanced for vision with the small astronomical eyepieces but as there is often occasion to use appliances which disturb the balance it is well to have the means of at once restoring equilibrium a cord ring running round the tube pretty tightly so as to rest still when the tube is inclined and bearing a small weight will be all that is required for this purpose it must be slipped along the tube until the tube is found to be perfectly balanced nothing is more annoying than after getting a star well in the field to see the tube shift its position through defective balance and thus to have to search again for the star even with such an arrangement as is shown in fig 8 though the tube cannot readily shift its position it is better to have it well balanced the quality of the stand has a very important influence on the performance of a telescope in fact a moderately good telescope mounted on a steady stand working easily and conveniently will not only enable the observer to pass his time much more pleasantly but will absolutely exhibit more difficult objects than a finer instrument on a rickety illarranged stand a good observingchair is also a matter of some importance the least constraint or awkwardness of position detracting considerably from the power of distinct vision such at least is my own experience but the mere examination of the glasses tube mounting c is only the first step in the series of tests which should be applied to a telescope since the excellence of the instrument depends not on its size the beauty of its mounting or any extraneous circumstances but on its performance the observer should first determine whether the chromatic aberration is corrected to ascertain this the telescope should be directed to the moon or better to jupiter and accurately focussed for distinct vision if then on moving the eyepiece towards the objectglass a ring of purple appears round the margin of the object and on moving the eyeglass in the contrary direction a ring of green the chromatic aberration is corrected since these are the colours of the secondary spectrum to determine whether the spherical aberration is corrected the telescope should be directed towards a star of the third or fourth magnitude and focussed for distinct vision a cap with an aperture of about onehalf its diameter should then be placed over the objectglass if no new adjustment is required for distinct vision the spherical aberration is corrected since the mean focal length and the focal length of the central rays are equal if when the cap is on the eyepiece has to be pulled out for distinct vision the spherical aberration has not been fully corrected if the eyepiece has to be pushed in the aberration has been overcorrected as a further test we may cut off the central rays by means of a circular card covering the middle of the objectglass and compare the focal length for distinct vision with the focal length when the cap is applied the extent of the spherical aberration may be thus determined but if the first experiment gives a satisfactory result no other is required a star of the first magnitude should next be brought into the field of view if an irradiation from one side is perceived part of the objectglass has not the same refractive power as the rest and the part which is defective can be determined by applying in different positions a cap which hides half the objectglass if the irradiation is double it will probably be found that the objectglass has been too tightly screwed and the defect will disappear when the glass is freed from such undue pressure if the objectglass is not quite at right angles to the axis of the tube or if the eyetube is at all inclined a like irradiation will appear when a bright star is in the field the former defect is not easily detected or remedied nor is it commonly met with in the work of a careful optician the latter defect may be detected by cutting out three circular cards of suitable size with a small aperture at the centre of each and inserting one at each end of the eyetube and one over the objectglass if the tube is rightly placed the apertures will of course lie in a right line so that it will be possible to look through all three at once if not it will be easy to determine towards what part of the objectglass the eyetube is directed and to correct the position of the tube accordingly the best tests for determining the defining power of a telescope are close double or multiple stars the components of which are not very unequal the illuminating power should be tested by directing the telescope towards double or multiple stars having one or more minute components many of the nebul serve as tests both for illumination and defining power as we proceed we shall meet with proper objects for testing different telescopes for the present let the following list suffice it is selected from admiral smyths tests obtained by diminishing the aperture of a 6in telescope having a focal length of 812 feet a twoinch aperture with powers of from 60 to 100 should exhibit alpha piscium 35 delta cassiopei 95 mag 4 and 712 gamma leonis 32 polaris 186 mag 212 and 912 a fourinch powers 80 to 120 should exhibit xi urs majoris 24 sigma cassiopei 31 mag 6 and 8 gamma ceti 26 delta geminorum 71 mag 4 and 9 the tests in the first column are for definition those in the second for illumination it will be noticed that though in the case of polaris the smaller aperture may be expected to show the small star of less than the 9th magnitude a larger aperture is required to show the 8th magnitude component of sigma cassiopei on account of the greater closeness of this double in favourable weather the following is a good general test of the performance of a telescopea star of the 3rd or 4th magnitude at a considerable elevation above the horizon should exhibit a small well defined disc surrounded by two or three fine rings of light a telescope should not be mounted within doors if it can be conveniently erected on solid ground as every movement in the house will cause the instrument to vibrate unpleasantly further if the telescope is placed in a warm room currents of cold air from without will render observed objects hazy and indistinct in fact sir w herschel considered that a telescope should not even be erected near a house or elevation of any kind round which currents of air are likely to be produced if a telescope is used in a room the temperature of the room should be made as nearly equal as possible to that of the outer air when a telescope is used out of doors a dewcap that is a tube of tin or pasteboard some ten or twelve inches long should be placed on the end of the instrument so as to project beyond the objectglass for glass is a good radiator of heat so that dew falls heavily upon it unless the radiation is in some way checked the dewcap does this effectually it should be blackened within especially if made of metal after use says old kitchener the telescope should be kept in a warm place long enough for any moisture on the objectglass to evaporate if damp gets between the glasses it produces a fog which opticians call a sweat or even a seaweedlike vegetation by which a valuable glass may be completely ruined the observer should not leave to the precious hours of the night the study of the bearing and position of the objects he proposes to examine this should be done by dayan arrangement which has a twofold advantagethe time available for observation is lengthened and the eyes are spared sudden changes from darkness to light and vice vers besides the eye is illfitted to examine difficult objects after searching by candlelight amongst the minute details recorded in maps or globes of the effect of rest to the eye we have an instance in sir j herschels rediscovery of the satellites of uranus which he effected after keeping his eyes in darkness for a quarter of an hour kitchener indeed goes so far as to recommend with a crede experto an interval of sleep in the darkness of the observingroom before commencing operations i have never tried the experiment but i should expect it to have a bad rather than a good effect on the eyesight as one commonly sees the eyes of a person who has been sleeping in his dayclothes look heavy and bloodshot the object or the part of an object to be observed should be brought as nearly as possible to the centre of the field of view when there is no apparatus for keeping the telescope pointed upon an object the best plan is so to direct the telescope by means of the finder that the object shall be just out of the field of view and be brought by the earths motion across the centre of the field thus the vibrations which always follow the adjustment of the tube will have subsided before the object appears the object should then be intently watched during the whole interval of its passage across the field of view it is important that the student should recognise the fact that the highest powers do not necessarily give the best views of celestial objects high powers in all cases increase the difficulty of observation since they diminish the field of view and the illumination of the object increase the motion with which owing to the earths motion the image moves across the field and magnify all defects due to instability of the stand imperfection of the objectglass or undulation of the atmosphere a good objectglass of three inches aperture will in very favourable weather bear a power of about 300 when applied to the observation of close double or multiple stars but for all other observations much lower powers should be used nothing but failure and annoyance can follow the attempt to employ the highest powers on unsuitable objects or in unfavourable weather the greatest care should be taken in focussing the telescope when high powers are used this is a matter of some delicacy it would be well if the eyepieces intended for a telescope were so constructed that when the telescope is focussed for one this might be replaced by any other without necessitating any use of the focussing rackwork this could be readily effected by suitably placing the shoulder which limits the insertion of the eyepiece it will be found that even in the worst weather for observation there are instants of distinct vision with moderate powers during which the careful observer may catch sight of important details and similarly in the best observing weather there are moments of unusually distinct vision well worth patient waiting for since in such weather alone the full powers of the telescope can be employed the telescopist should not be deterred from observation by the presence of fog or haze since with a hazy sky definition is often singularly good the observer must not expect distinct vision of objects near the horizon objects near the eastern horizon during the time of morning twilight are especially confused by atmospheric undulations in fact early morning is a very unfavourable time for the observation of all objects the same rules which we have been applying to refractors serve for reflectors the performance of a reflector will be found to differ in some respects however from that of a refractor mr dawes is we believe now engaged in testing reflectors and his unequalled experience of refractors will enable him to pronounce decisively on the relative merits of the two classes of telescopes we have little to say respecting the construction of telescopes whether it is advisable or not for an amateur observer to attempt the construction of his own telescope is a question depending entirely on his mechanical ability and ingenuity my own experience of telescope construction is confined to the conversion of a 3feet into a 512feet telescope this operation involved some difficulties since the aperture had to be increased by about an inch i found a tubing made of alternate layers of card and calico well pasted together to be both light and strong but for the full length of tube i think a core of metal is wanted a learned and ingenious friend mr sharp fellow of st johns college informs me that a tube of tin covered with layers of brown paper well pasted and thicker near the middle of the tube forms a light and strong telescopetube almost wholly free from vibration suffer no inexperienced person to deal with your objectglass i knew a valuable glass ruined by the proceedings of a workman who had been told to attach three pieces of brass round the cell of the double lens what he had done remained unknown but ever after a wretched glare of light surrounded all objects of any brilliancy one word about the inversion of objects by the astronomical telescope it is singular that any difficulty should be felt about so simple a matter yet i have seen in the writings of more than one distinguished astronomer wholly incorrect views as to the nature of the inversion one tells us that to obtain the correct presentation from a picture taken with a telescope the view should be inverted held up to the light and looked at from the back of the paper another tells us to invert the picture and hold it opposite a lookingglass neither method is correct the simple correction wanted is to hold the picture upside downthe same change which brings the top to the bottom brings the right to the left ie fully corrects the inversion in the case however of a picture taken by an herschelian reflector the inversion not being complete a different method must be adopted in fact either of the abovenamed processes incorrect for the ordinary astronomical would be correct for the herschelian telescope the latter inverts but does not reverse right and left therefore after inverting our picture we must interchange right and left because they have been reversed by the inversion this is effected either by looking at the picture from behind or by holding it up to a mirror illustration plate ii chapter ii a halfhour with orion lepus taurus etc any of the halfhours here assigned to the constellationseasons may be taken first and the rest in seasonal or cyclic order the following introductory remarks are applicable to each if we stand on an open space on any clear night we see above us the celestial dome spangled with stars apparently fixed in position but after a little time it becomes clear that these orbs are slowly shifting their position those near the eastern horizon are rising those near the western setting careful and continuous observation would show that the stars are all moving in the same way precisely as they would if they were fixed to the concave surface of a vast hollow sphere and this sphere rotated about an axis this axis in our latitude is inclined about 5112 to the horizon of course only one end of this imaginary axis can be above our horizon this end lies very near a star which it will be well for us to become acquainted with at the beginning of our operations it lies almost exactly towards the north and is raised from 50 to 53 according to the season and hour above the horizon there is an easy method of finding it we must first find the greater bear it will be seen from plate 1 that on a spring evening the seven conspicuous stars of this constellation are to be looked for towards the northeast about half way between the horizon and the point overhead or zenith the length of the set of stars being vertical on a summers evening the great bear is nearly overhead on an autumn evening he is towards the northwest the length of the set of seven being somewhat inclined to the horizon finally on a winters evening he is low down towards the north the length of the set of seven stars being nearly in a horizontal direction having found the seven stars we make use of the pointers alpha and beta shown in plate 1 to indicate the place of the polestar whose distance from the pointer alpha is rather more than three times the distance of alpha from beta now stand facing the polestar then all the stars are travelling round that star in a direction contrary to that in which the hands of a watch move thus the stars below the pole are moving towards the right those above the pole towards the left those to the right of the pole upwards those to the left of the pole downwards next face the south then all the stars on our left that is towards the east are rising slantingly towards the south those due south are moving horizontally to the right that is towards the west and those on our right are passing slantingly downwards towards the west it is important to familiarise ourselves with these motions because it is through them that objects pass out of the field of view of the telescope and by moving the tube in a proper direction we can easily pick up an object that has thus passed away whereas if we are not familiar with the varying motions in different parts of the celestial sphere we may fail in the attempt to immediately recover an object and waste time in the search for it the consideration of the celestial motions shows how advantageous it is when using an altazimuth to observe objects as nearly as possible due south of course in many cases this is impracticable because a phenomenon we wish to watch may occur when an object is not situated near the meridian but in examining double stars there is in general no reason for selecting objects inconveniently situated we can wait till they come round to the meridian and then observe them more comfortably besides most objects are higher and therefore better seen when due south northern objects and especially those within the circle of perpetual apparition often culminate that is cross the meridian or north and south line at too great a height for comfortable vision in this case we should observe them towards the east or west and remember that in the first case they are rising and in the latter they are setting and that in both cases they have also a motion from left to right if we allow an object to pass right across the field of view the telescope being fixed the apparent direction of its motion is the exact reverse of the true direction of the stars motion this will serve as a guide in shifting the altazimuth after a star has passed out of the field of view the following technical terms must be explained that part of the field of view towards which the star appears to move is called the preceding part of the field the opposite being termed the following part the motion for all stars except those lying in an oval space extending from the zenith to the pole of the heavens is more or less from right to left in the inverted field now if we suppose a star to move along a diameter of the field so as to divide the field into two semicircles then in all cases in which this motion takes places from right to left that semicircle which contains the lowest point apparently of the field is the northern half the other is the southern half over the oval space just mentioned the reverse holds thus the field is divided into four quadrants and these are termed north following nf and south following sf north preceding np and south preceding sp the student can have no difficulty in interpreting these terms since he knows which is the following and which the preceding semicircle which the northern and which the southern in the figures of plates 3 and 5 the letters nf np c are affixed to the proper quadrants it is to be remembered that the quadrants thus indicated are measured either way from the point and feather of the diametral arrows next of the apparent annual motion of the stars this takes place in exactly the same manner as the daily motion if we view the sky at eight oclock on any day and again at the same hour one month later we shall find that at the latter observation as compared with the former the heavens appear to have rotated by the twelfth part of a complete circumference and the appearance presented is precisely the same as we should have observed had we waited for two hours the twelfth part of a day on the day of the first observation our survey of the heavens is supposed to be commenced during the first quarter of the year at ten oclock on the 20th of january or at nine on the 5th of february or at eight on the 19th of february or at seven on the 6th of march or at hours intermediate to these on intermediate days we look first for the great bear towards the northeast as already described and thence find the polestar turning towards which we see towards the right and downwards the two guardians of the pole beta and gamma urs minoris immediately under the polestar is the dragons head a conspicuous diamond of stars just on the horizon is vega scintillating brilliantly overhead is the brilliant capella near which the milky way is seen passing down to the horizon on either side towards the quarters sse and nnw for the present our business is with the southern heavens however facing the south we see a brilliant array of stars sirius unmistakeably overshining the rest orion is shining in full glory his leading brilliant betelgeuse2 being almost exactly on the meridian and also almost exactly half way between the horizon and the zenith in plate 2 is given a map of this constellation and its neighbourhood let us first turn the tube on sirius it is easy to get him in the field without the aid of a finder the search will serve to illustrate a method often useful when a telescope has no finder having taking out the eyepiecea lowpower one supposedirect the tube nearly towards sirius on looking through it a glare of light will be seen within the tube now if the tube be slightly moved about the light will be seen to wax and wane according as the tube is more or less accurately directed following these indications it will be found easy to direct the tube so that the objectglass shall appear full of light when this is done insert the eyepiece and the star will be seen in the field but the telescope is out of focus therefore we must turn the small focussing screw observe the charming chromatic changesgreen and red and blue light purer than the hues of the rainbow scintillating and coruscating with wonderful brilliancy as we get the focus the excursions of these light flashes diminish untilif the weather is favourablethe star is seen still scintillating and much brighter than to the naked eye but reduced to a small disc of light surrounded in the case of so bright a star as sirius with a slight glare if after obtaining the focus the focussing rack work be still turned we see a coruscating image as before in the case of a very brilliant star these coruscations are so charming that we may be excused for calling the observers attention to them the subject is not without interest and difficulty as an optical one but the astronomers object is to get rid of all these flames and sprays of coloured light so that he has very little sympathy with the admiration which wordsworth is said to have expressed for outoffocus views of the stars we pass to more legitimate observations noticing in passing that sirius is a double star the companion being of the tenth magnitude and distant about ten seconds from the primary but our beginner is not likely to see the companion which is a very difficult object vowing to the overpowering brilliancy of the primary orion affords the observer a splendid field of research it is a constellation rich in double and multiple stars clusters and nebul we will begin with an easy object the star delta plate 3 or mintaka the uppermost of the three stars forming the belt is a wide double the primary is of the second magnitude the secondary of the seventh both being white the star alpha betelgeuse is an interesting object on account of its colour and brilliance and as one of the most remarkable variables in the heavens it was first observed to be variable by sir john herschel in 1836 at this period its variations were most marked and striking this continued until 1840 when the changes became much less conspicuous in january 1849 they had recommenced and on december 5th 1852 mr fletcher observed alpha orionis brighter than capella and actually the largest star in the northern hemisphere that a star so conspicuous and presumably so large should present such remarkable variations is a circumstance which adds an additional interest to the results which have rewarded the spectrumanalysis of this star by mr huggins and professor miller it appears that there is decisive evidence of the presence in this luminary of many elements known to exist in our own sun amongst others are found sodium magnesium calcium iron and bismuth hydrogen appears to be absent or more correctly there are no lines in the stars spectrum corresponding to those of hydrogen in the solar spectrum secchi considers that there is evidence of an actual change in the spectrum of the star an opinion in which mr huggins does not coincide in the telescope betelgeuse appears as a rich and brilliant gem says lassell a rich topaz in hue and brilliancy differing from any that i have seen turn next to beta rigel the brightest star below the belt this is a very noted double and will severely test our observers telescope if small the components are well separated see plate 3 compared with many easier doubles the secondary is also of the seventh magnitude so that neither as respects closeness nor smallness of the secondary is rigel a difficult object it is the combination of the two features which makes it a testobject kitchener says a 134inch objectglass should show rigel double in earlier editions of his work he gave 234inches as the necessary aperture smyth mentions rigel as a test for a 4inch aperture with powers of from 80 to 120 a 3inch aperture however will certainly show the companion rigel is an orange star the companion blue turn next to lambda the northernmost of the set of three stars in the head of orion this is a triple star though an aperture of 3 inches will show it only as a double the components are 5 apart the colours pale white and violet with the full powers of a 312inch glass a faint companion may be seen above lambda the star zeta the lowest in the belt may be tried with a 312inch glass it is a close double the components being nearly equal and about 212 apart see plate 3 for a change we will now try our telescope on a nebula selecting the great nebula in the sword the place of this object is indicated in plate 2 there can be no difficulty in finding it since it is clearly visible to the naked eye on a moonless nightthe only sort of night on which an observer would care to look at nebul a low power should be employed the nebula is shown in plate 3 as i have seen it with a 3inch aperture we see nothing of those complex streams of light which are portrayed in the drawings of herschel bond and lassell but enough to excite our interest and wonder what is this marvellous lightcloud one could almost imagine that there was a strange prophetic meaning in the words which have been translated canst thou loose the bands of orion telescope after telescope had been turned on this wonderful object with the hope of resolving its light into stars but it proved intractable to herschels great reflector to lassells 2feet reflector to lord rosses 3feet reflector and even partially to the great 6feet reflector then we hear of its supposed resolution into stars lord rosse himself writing to professor nichol in 1846 i may safely say there can be little if any doubt as to the resolvability of the nebulaall about the trapezium is a mass of stars the rest of the nebula also abounding with stars and exhibiting the characteristics of resolvability strongly marked it was decided therefore that assuredly the great nebula is a congeries of stars and not a mass of nebulous matter as had been surmised by sir w herschel and therefore astronomers were not a little surprised when it was proved by mr huggins spectrumanalysis that the nebula consists of gaseous matter how widely extended this gaseous universe may be we cannot say the general opinion is that the nebul are removed far beyond the fixed stars if this were so the dimensions of the orion nebula would be indeed enormous far larger probably than those of the whole system whereof our sun is a member i believe this view is founded on insufficient evidence but this would not be the place to discuss the subject i shall merely point out that the nebula occurs in a region rich in stars and if it is not like the great nebula in argo clustered around a remarkable star it is found associated in a manner which i cannot look upon as accidental with a set of smallmagnitude stars and notably with the trapezium which surrounds that very remarkable black gap within the nebula the fact that the nebula shares the proper motion of the trapezium appears inexplicable if the nebula is really far out in space beyond the trapezium a very small proper motion of the trapezium alone would long since have destroyed the remarkable agreement in the position of the dark gap and the trapezium which has been noticed for so many years but whether belonging to our system or far beyond it the great nebula must have enormous dimensions a vast gaseous system it is sustained by what arrangements or forces we cannot tell nor can we know what purposes it subserves mr huggins discovery that comets have gaseous nuclei so far as the two he has yet examined show may suggest the speculation that in the orion nebula we see a vast system of comets travelling in extensive orbits around nuclear stars and so slowly as to exhibit for long intervals of time an unchanged figure but of such speculations we may say with sir j herschel there is no end to return to our telescopic observationsthe trapezium affords a useful test for the lightgathering power of the telescope large instruments exhibit nine stars but our observer may be well satisfied with his instrument and his eyesight if he can see five with a 312inch aperture3 a good 3inch glass shows four distinctly but with smaller apertures only three are visible the whole neighbourhood of the great nebula will well repay research the observer may sweep over it carefully on any dark night with profit above the nebula is the starcluster 362 h the star iota double as shown in plate 3 below the nebula is involved in a strong nebulosity and in searching over this region we meet with delicate double triple and multiple stars which make the survey interesting with almost any power that may be applied above the nebula is the star sigma a multiple star to an observer with a good 312inch glass sigma appears as an octuple star it is well seen however as a fine multiple star with a smaller aperture some of the stars of this group appear to be variable the star rho orionis is an unequal easy double the components being separated by nearly seven seconds the primary is orange the smaller star smaltblue see plate 3 the middle star of the belt epsilon has a distant blue companion this star like iota is nebulous in fact the whole region within the triangle formed by stars gamma kappa and beta is full of nebulous double and multiple stars whose aggregation in this region i do not consider wholly accidental we have not explored half the wealth of orion but leave much for future observation we must turn however to other constellations below orion is lepus the hare a small constellation containing some remarkable doubles among these we may note xi a white star with a scarlet companion gamma a yellow and garnet double and iota a double star white and pale violet with a distant red companion the star kappa leporis is a rather close double white with a small green companion the intensely red star r leporis a variable will be found in the position indicated in the map still keeping within the boundary of our map we may next turn to the fine cluster 2 h vii in monoceros this cluster is visible to the naked eye and will be easily found the nebula 2 h iv is a remarkable one with a powerful telescope the star 11 monocerotis is a fine triple star described by the elder herschel as one of the finest sights in the heavens our observer however will see it as a double see plate 3 delta monocerotis is an easy double yellow and lavender we may now leave the region covered by the map and take a survey of the heavens for some objects well seen at this season towards the southeast high up above the horizon we see the twinstars castor and pollux the upper is castor the finest double star visible in the northern heavens the components are nearly equal and rather more than 5 apart see plate 3 both are white according to the best observers but the smaller is thought by some to be slightly greenish pollux is a coarse but fine triple star in large instruments multiple the components orange grey and lilac there are many other fine objects in gemini but we pass to cancer the fine cluster prsepe in cancer may easily be found as it is distinctly visible to the naked eye in the position shown in plate 1 map i in the telescope it is seen as shown in plate 3 the star iota cancri is a wide double the colours orange and blue procyon the firstmagnitude star between prsepe and sirius is finely colouredyellow with a distant orange companion which appears to be variable below the twins almost in a line with them is the star alpha hydr called al fard or the solitary one it is a 2nd magnitude variable i mention it however not on its own account but as a guide to the fine double epsilon hydr this star is the middle one of a group of three lying between pollux and al fard rather nearer the latter the components of epsilon hydr are separated by about 312 see plate 3 the primary is of the fourth the companion of the eighth magnitude the former is yellow the latter a ruddy purple the period of epsilon hydr is about 450 years the constellation leo minor now due east and about midway between the horizon and the zenith is well worth sweeping over it contains several fine fields let us next turn to the western heavens here there are some noteworthy objects to begin with there are the pleiades showing to the naked eye only six or seven stars in the telescope the pleiades appear as shown in plate 3 the hyades also show some fine fields with low powers aldebaran the principal star of the hyades as also of the constellation taurus is a noted red star it is chiefly remarkable for the close spectroscopic analysis to which it has been subjected by messrs huggins and miller unlike betelgeuse the spectrum of aldebaran exhibits the lines corresponding to hydrogen and no less than eight metalssodium magnesium calcium iron bismuth tellurium antimony and mercury are proved to exist in the constitution of this brilliant red star on the right of aldebaran in the position indicated in plate 1 map i are the stars zeta and beta tauri if with a low power the observer sweep from zeta towards beta he will soon findnot far from zeta at a distance of about onesixth of the distance separating beta from zeta the celebrated crab nebula known as 1 m this was the first nebula discovered by messier and its discovery led to the formation of his catalogue of 103 nebul in a small telescope this object appears as a nebulous light of oval form no traces being seen of the wisps and sprays of light presented in lord rosses well known picture of the nebula here i shall conclude the labours of our first halfhour among the stars noticing that the examination of plate 1 will show what other constellations besides those here considered are well situated for observation at this season it will be remarked that many constellations well seen in the third halfhour chapter iv are favourably seen in the first also and vice vers for instance the constellation ursa major wellplaced towards the northeast in the first quarter of the year is equally wellplaced towards the northwest in the third and similarly of the constellation cassiopeia the same relation connects the second and fourth quarters of the year illustration plate iii chapter iii a halfhour with lyra hercules corvus crater etc the observations now to be commenced are supposed to take place during the second quarter of the yearat ten oclock on the 20th of april or at nine on the 5th of may or at eight on the 21st of may or at seven on the 5th of june or at hours intermediate to these on intermediate days we again look first for the great bear now near the zenith and thence find the polestar turning towards the north we see cassiopeia between the polestar and the horizon towards the northwest is the brilliant capella and towards the northeast the equally brilliant vega beneath which and somewhat northerly is the cross in cygnus the milky way passes from the eastern horizon towards the north low down and so round to the western horizon in selecting a region for special observation we shall adopt a different plan from that used in the preceding halfhour the region on the equator and towards the south is indeed particularly interesting since it includes the nebular region in virgo within this space nebul are clustered more closely than over any corresponding space in the heavens save only the greater magellanic cloud but to the observer with telescopes of moderate power these nebul present few features of special interest and there are regions of the sky now well situated for observation which at most other epochs are either low down towards the horizon or inconveniently near to the zenith we shall therefore select one of these the region included in the second map of plate 2 and the neighbouring part of the celestial sphere at any of the hours above named the constellation hercules lies towards the east a quadrant taken from the zenith to the eastern horizon passes close to the last star eta of the great bears tail through beta a star in bootes head near beta herculis between the two alphas which mark the heads of hercules and ophiuchus and so past beta ophiuchi a thirdmagnitude star near the horizon and here we may turn aside for a moment to notice the remarkable vertical row of six conspicuous stars towards the eastsoutheast these are counting them in order from the horizon zeta epsilon and delta ophiuchi epsilon alpha and delta serpentis let the telescope first be directed towards vega this orb presents a brilliant appearance in the telescope its colour is a bluishwhite in an ordinary telescope vega appears as a single star but with a large objectglass two distant small companions are seen a nineinch glass shows also two small companions within a few seconds of vega in the great harvard refractor vega is seen with no less than thirtyfive companions i imagine that all these stars and others which can be seen in neighbouring fields indicate the association of vega with the neighbouring stream of the milky way let our observer now direct his telescope to the star epsilon lyr or rather let him first closely examine this star with the naked eye the star is easily identified since it lies to the left of vega forming with zeta a small equilateral triangle a careful scrutiny suffices to indicate a peculiarity in this star if our observer possesses very good eyesight he will distinctly recognise it as a nakedeye double but more probably he will only notice that it appears lengthened in a north and south direction4 in the finder the star is easily divided applying a low power to the telescope itself we see epsilon lyr as a wide double the line joining the components lying nearly north and south the southernmost component the upper in the figure is called epsilon1 the other epsilon2 seen as a double both components appear white now if the observers telescope is sufficiently powerful each of the components may be seen to be itself double first try epsilon1 the northern pair the line joining the components is directed as shown in plate 3 the distance between them is 32 their magnitudes 5 and 612 and their colours yellow and ruddy if the observer succeeds in seeing epsilon1 fairly divided he will probably not fail in detecting the duplicity of epsilon2 though this is a rather closer pair the distance between the components being only 26 the magnitudes are 5 and 512 both being white between epsilon1 and epsilon2 are three faint stars possibly forming with the quadruple a single system let us next turn to the third star of the equilateral triangle mentioned aboveviz to the star zeta lyr this is a splendid but easy double it is figured in plate 3 but it must be noticed that the figure of zeta and the other nine small figures are not drawn on the same scale as epsilon lyr the actual distance between the components of zeta lyra is 44 or about onefourth of the distance separating epsilon1 from epsilon2 the components of zeta are very nearly equal in magnitude in colour topaz and green the topaz component being estimated as of the fifth magnitude the green component intermediate between the fifth and sixth magnitudes we may now turn to a star not figured in the map but readily found it will be noticed that the stars epsilon alpha beta and gamma form with two small stars towards the left a somewhat regular hexagonal figurea hexagon in fact having three equal long sides and three nearly equal short sides alternating with the others the star eta lyr forms the angle next to epsilon it is a wide and unequal double as figured in plate 3 the larger component is azure blue the smaller is violet and being only of the ninth magnitude is somewhat difficult to catch with apertures under 3 inches the star delta2 lyr is orange delta1 blue in the same field with these are seen many other stars the stars gamma1 and gamma2 may also be seen in a single field the distance between them being about half the moons mean diameter the former is quadruple the components being yellow bluish pale blue and blue turn next to the stars beta and gamma lyr the former a multiple the latter an unequal double star it is not however in these respects that these stars are chiefly interesting but for their variability the variability of gamma has not indeed been fully established though it is certain that having once been less bright gamma is now considerably brighter than beta the change however may be due to the variation of beta alone this star is one of the most remarkable variables known its period is 12d 21h 53m 10s in this time it passes from a maximum brilliancythat of a star of the 34 magnitudeto a minimum lustre equal to that of a star of the 43 magnitude thence to the same maximum brilliancy as before thence to another minimum of lustrethat of a star of the 45 magnitudeand so to its maximum lustre again when the cycle of changes recommences these remarkable changes seem to point to the existence of two unequal dark satellites whose dimensions bear a much greater proportion to those of the bright components of beta lyr than the dimensions of the members of the solar system bear to those of the sun in this case at any rate the conjecture hazarded about algol that the star revolves around a dark central orb would be insufficient to account for the observed variation nearly midway between beta and gamma lies the wonderful ringnebula 57 m of which an imperfect idea will be conveyed by the last figure of plate 3 this nebula was discovered in 1772 by darquier at toulouse it is seen as a ring of light with very moderate telescopic power in a good 312inch telescope the nebula exhibits a mottled appearance and a sparkling light larger instruments exhibit a faint light within the ring and in lord rosses great telescope wisps of stars are seen within and faint streaks of light stream from the outer border of the ring this nebula has been subjected to spectrumanalysis by mr huggins it turns out to be a gaseous nebula in fact ringnebulof which only seven have been detectedseem to belong to the same class as the planetary nebul all of which exhibit the linespectrum indicative of gaseity the brightest of the three lines seen in the spectrum of the ringnebula in lyra presents a rather peculiar appearance since it consists says mr huggins of two bright dots corresponding to sections of the ring and between these there is not darkness but an excessively faint line joining them this observation makes it probable that the faint nebulous matter occupying the central portion is similar in constitution to that of the ring the constellation hercules also contains many very interesting objects let us first inspect a nebula presenting a remarkable contrast with that just described i refer to the nebula 13 m known as halleys nebula plate 3 this nebula is visible to the naked eye and in a good telescope it is a most wonderful object perhaps no one ever saw it for the first time without uttering a shout of wonder it requires a very powerful telescope completely to resolve this fine nebula but the outlying streamers may be resolved with a good 3inch telescope sir w herschel considered that the number of the stars composing this wonderful object was at least 14000 the accepted views respecting nebul would place this and other clusters far beyond the limits of our sidereal system and would make the component stars not very unequal on the average to our own sun it seems to me far more probable on the contrary that the cluster belongs to our own system and that its components are very much smaller than the average of separate stars perhaps the whole mass of the cluster does not exceed that of an average firstmagnitude star the nebul 92 m and 50 h may be found after a little searching from the positions indicated in the map they are both well worthy of study the former being a very bright globular cluster the latter a bright and large round nebula the spectra of these as of the great cluster resemble the solar spectrum being continuous though of course very much fainter the star delta herculis seen at the bottom of the map is a wide and easy doublea beautiful object the components situated as shown in plate 3 are of the fourth and eighth magnitude and coloured respectively greenishwhite and grapered the star kappa herculis is not shown in the map but may be very readily found lying between the two gammas gamma herculis and gamma serpentis see frontispiece map 2 rather nearer the latter it is a wide double the components of fifth and seventh magnitude the larger yellowishwhite the smaller ruddy yellow5 ras algethi or alpha herculis is also beyond the limits of the map but may be easily found by means of map 2 frontispiece it is properly speaking a multiple star considered as a double the arrangement of the components is that shown in plate 3 the larger is of magnitude 312 the smaller of magnitude 512 the former orange the latter emerald the companion stars are small and require a good telescope to be well seen ras algethi is a variable changing from magnitude 3 to magnitude 312 in a period of 6613 days the star rho herculis is a closer double the components are 37 apart and situated as shown in plate 3 the larger is of magnitude 4 the smaller 512 the former bluishwhite the latter pale emerald there are other objects within the range of our map which are well worthy of study such are mu draconis a beautiful miniature of castor gamma1 and gamma2 draconis a wide double the distance between the components being nearly 62 both grey and gamma1 and gamma2 coron a nakedeye double the components being 6 apart and each double with a good 3inch telescope we turn however to another region of the sky low down towards the south is seen the small constellation corvus recognised by its irregular quadrilateral of stars of the two upper stars the lefthand one is algorab a wide double the components placed as in plate 3 235 apart the larger of magnitude 3 the smaller 812 the colours pale yellow and purple there is a red star in this neighbourhood which is well worth looking for to the right of corvus is the constellation crater easily recognised as forming a tolerably wellmarked small group the star alkes or alpha crateris must first be found it is far from being the brightest star in the constellation and may be assumed to have diminished considerably in brilliancy since it was entitled alpha by bayer it will easily be found however by means of the observers star maps if now the telescope be directed to alkes there will be found following him at a distance of 425 s and about one minute southerly a small red star r crateris like most red stars this one is a variable a somewhat smaller blue star may be seen in the same field there is another red star which may be found pretty easily at this season first find the stars eta and omicron leonis the former forming with regulus now lying towards the southwest and almost exactly midway between the zenith and the horizon the handle of the sickle in leo the other farther off from regulus towards the right but lower down now sweep from omicron towards eta with a low power6 there will be found a sixthmagnitude star about onefourth of the way from omicron to eta south following this will be found a group of four stars of which one is crimson this is the star r leonis like r crateris and r leporis it is variable next let the observer turn towards the south again above corvus in the position shown in the frontispiece there are to be seen five stars forming a sort of wide v with somewhat bowed legs at the angle is the star gamma virginis a noted double in 1756 the components were 612 seconds apart they gradually approached till in 1836 they could not be separated by the largest telescopes since then they have been separating and they are now 412 seconds apart situated as shown in plate 3 they are nearly equal in magnitude 4 and both pale yellow the star gamma leonis is a closer and more beautiful double it will be found above regulus and is the brightest star on the blade of the sickle the components are separated by about 315 seconds the larger of the second the smaller of the fourth magnitude the former yelloworange the latter greenishyellow lastly the star iota leonis may be tried it will be a pretty severe test for our observers telescope the components being only 24 apart and the smaller scarcely exceeding the eighth magnitude the brighter fourth magnitude is pale yellow the other light blue chapter iv a halfhour with bootes scorpio ophiuchus etc we now commence a series of observations suited to the third quarter of the year and to the following hoursten oclock on the 22nd of july nine on the 8th of august eight on the 23rd of august seven on the 8th of october and intermediate hours on days intermediate to these we look first for the great bear towards the northwest and thence find the polestar turning towards the north we see capella and beta aurig low down and slightly towards the left of the exact north point the milky way crosses the horizon towards the northnortheast and passes to the opposite point of the compass attaining its highest point above the horizon towards eastsoutheast this part of the milky way is well worth observing being marked by singular variations of brilliancy near arided the principal star of cygnus and now lying due eastsome twentyfive degrees from the zenith there is seen a straight dark rift and near this space is another larger cavity which has been termed the northern coalsack the space between gamma delta and beta cygni is covered by a large oval mass exceedingly rich and brilliant the neighbouring branch extending from epsilon cygni is far less conspicuous here but near sagitta becomes brighter than the other which in this neighbourhood suddenly loses its brilliancy and fading gradually beyond this point becomes invisible near beta ophiuchi the continuous stream becomes patchyin parts very brilliantwhere it crosses aquila and clypeus in this neighbourhood the other stream reappears passing over a region very rich in stars we see now the greatest extent of the milky way towards this part of its length ever visible in our latitudesjust as in spring we see its greatest extent towards monoceros and argo illustration plate iv i may note here in passing that sir john herschels delineation of the northern portion of the milky way though a great improvement on the views given in former works seems to require revision and especially as respects the very remarkable patches and streaks which characterise the portion extending over cepheus and cygnus it seems to me also that the evidence on which it has been urged that the stars composing the milky way are on an average comparable in magnitude to our own sun or to stars of the leading magnitudes is imperfect i believe for instance that the brilliant oval of milky light in cygnus comes from stars intimately associated with the leading stars in that constellation and not far removed in space proportionately beyond them of course if this be the case the stars whose combined light forms the patch of milky light must be far smaller than the leading brilliants of cygnus however this is not the place to enter on speculations of this sort i return therefore to the business we have more immediately in hand towards the east is the square of pegasus low down towards the horizon towards the south is scorpio distinguished by the red and brilliant antares and by a train of conspicuous stars towards the west is bootes his leading brilliantthe ruddy arcturuslying somewhat nearer the horizon than the zenith and slightly south of west bootes as a constellation is easily found if we remember that he is delineated as chasing away the greater bear thus at present he is seen in a slightly inclined position his head marked by the thirdmagnitude star beta lying due west some thirty degrees from the zenith it has always appeared to me by the way that bootes originally had nobler proportions than astronomers now assign to him it is known that canes venatici now occupy the place of an upraised arm of bootes and i imagine that corona borealis though undoubtedly a very ancient constellation occupies the place of his other arm giving to the constellation the extent thus implied it exhibits better than most constellations the character assigned to it one can readily picture to oneself the figure of a herdsman with upraised arms driving ursa major before him this view is confirmed i think by the fact that the arabs called this constellation the vociferator bootes contains many beautiful objects partly on this account and partly because this is a constellation with which the observer should be specially familiar a map of it is given in plate 4 arcturus has a distant pale lilac companion and is in other respects a remarkable and interesting object it is of a ruddy yellow colour schmidt indeed considers that the star has changed colour of late years and that whereas it was once very red it is now a yellow star this opinion does not seem well grounded however the star may have been more ruddy once than now though no other observer has noticed such a peculiarity but it is certainly not a pure yellow star at present at any rate as seen in our latitude owing probably to the difference of colour between vega capella and arcturus photometricians have not been perfectly agreed as to the relative brilliancy of these objects some consider vega the most brilliant star in the northern heavens while others assign the superiority to capella the majority however consider arcturus the leading northern brilliant and in the whole heavens place three only before him viz sirius canopus and alpha centauri arcturus is remarkable in other respects his proper motion is very considerable so great in fact that since the time of ptolemy the southerly motion alone of arcturus has carried him over a space nearly half as great again as the moons apparent diameter one might expect that so brilliant a star apparently travelling at a rate so great compared with the average proper motions of the stars must be comparatively near to us this however has not been found to be the case arcturus is indeed one of the stars whose distance it has been found possible to estimate roughly but he is found to be some three times as far from us as the small star 61 cygni and more than seven times as far from us as alpha centauri the star delta bootis is a wide and unequal double the smaller component being only of the ninth magnitude above alkaid the last star in the tail of the greater bear there will be noticed three small stars these are theta iota and kappa bootis and are usually placed in starmaps near the upraised hand of the herdsman the two which lie next to alkaid iota and kappa are interesting doubles the former is a wide double see plate 5 the magnitudes of components 4 and 8 their colours yellow and white the larger star of this pair is itself double the star kappa bootis is not so wide a double see plate 5 the magnitudes of the components 5 and 8 their colours white and faint bluea beautiful object the star xi bootis is an exceedingly interesting object it is double the colours of the components being orangeyellow and ruddy purple their magnitudes 312 and 612 when this star was first observed by herschel in 1780 the position of the components was quite different from that presented in plate 5 they were also much closer being separated by a distance of less than 312 seconds since that time the smaller component has traversed nearly a full quadrant its distance from its primary first increasing till in 1831 the stars were nearly 712 seconds apart and thence slowly diminishing so that at present the stars are less than 5 seconds apart the period usually assigned to the revolution of this binary system is 117 years and the period of periastral passage is said to be 1779 it appears to me however that the period should be about 108 years the epoch of last periastral passage 1777 and of next periastral passage therefore 1885 the angular motion of the secondary round the primary is now rapidly increasing and the distance between the components is rapidly diminishing so that in a few years a powerful telescope will be required to separate the pair not far from xi is pi bootis represented in plate 5 as a somewhat closer double but in realitynow at any ratea slightly wider pair since the distance between the components of xi has greatly diminished of late both the components of pi are white and their magnitudes are 312 and 6 we shall next turn to an exceedingly beautiful and delicate object the double star epsilon bootis known also as mirac and on account of its extreme beauty called pulcherrima by admiral smyth the components of this beautiful double are of the third and seventh magnitude the primary orange the secondary seagreen the distance separating the components is about 3 seconds perhaps more it appears to have been slowly increasing during the past ten or twelve years smyth assigns to this system a period of revolution of 980 years but there can be little doubt that the true period is largely in excess of this estimate observers in southern latitudes consider that the colours of the components are yellow and blue not orange and green as most of our northern observers have estimated them a little beyond the lower lefthand corner of the map is the star delta serpentis in the position shown in the frontispiece map 3 this is the star which at the hour and season depicted in map 2 formed the uppermost of a vertical row of stars which has now assumed an almost horizontal position the components of delta serpentis are about 312 seconds apart their magnitudes 3 and 5 both white the stars theta1 and theta2 serpentis form a wide double the distance between the components being 2112 seconds they are nearly equal in magnitude the primary being 412 the secondary 5 both are yellow the primary being of a paler yellow colour than the smaller star but the observer may not know where to look for theta serpentis since it falls in a part of the constellation quite separated from that part in which delta serpentis lies in fact theta lies on the extreme easterly verge of the eastern half of the constellation it is to be looked for at about the same elevation as the brilliant altair and as to azimuth about midway between altair and the south the stars alpha1 and alpha2 libr form a wide double perhaps just separable by the naked eye in very favourable weather the larger component is of the third the smaller of the sixth magnitude the former yellow the latter light grey the star beta libr is a beautiful lightgreen star to the naked eye in the telescope a wide double pale emerald and light blue in scorpio there are several very beautiful objects the star antares or cor scorpionis is one of the most beautiful of the red stars it has been termed the sirius of red stars a term better merited perhaps by aldebaran save for this that in our latitude antares is like sirius always seen as a brilliant scintillator because always low down whereas aldebaran rises high above the horizon antares is a double star its companion being a minute green star in southern latitudes the companion of antares may be seen with a good 4inch but in our latitudes a larger opening is wanted mr dawes once saw the companion of antares shining alone for seven seconds the primary being hidden by the moon he found that the colour of the secondary is not merely the effect of contrast but that this small star is really a green sun the star beta scorpionis is a fine double the components 131 apart their magnitudes 2 and 512 colours white and lilac it has been supposed that this pair is only an optical double but a long time must elapse before a decisive opinion can be pronounced on such a point the star sigma scorpionis is a wider but much more difficult double the smaller component being below the 9th magnitude the colour of the primary 4 is white that of the secondary maroon the star xi scorpionis is a neat double the components 72 apart their magnitudes 412 and 712 their colours white and grey this star is really triple a fifthmagnitude star lying close to the primary in ophiuchus a constellation covering a wide space immediately above scorpio there are several fine doubles among others 39 ophiuchi distance between components 121 their magnitudes 512 and 712 their colours orange and blue the star 70 ophiuchi a fourthmagnitude star on the right shoulder of ophiuchus is a noted double the distance between the components about 512 their magnitudes 412 and 7 the colours yellow and red the pair form a system whose period of revolution is about 95 years 36 ophiuchi variable distance 52 magnitudes 412 and 612 colours red and yellow rho opiuchi distance 4 colours yellow and blue magnitudes 5 and 7 between alpha and beta scorpionis the fine nebula 80 m may be looked for or more closely thusbelow beta is the wide double omega1 and omega2 scorpionis about as far to the right of antares is the star sigma scorpionis and immediately above this is the fifthmagnitude star 19 the nebula we seek lies between 19 and omega nearer to 19 about twofifths of the way towards omega this nebula is described by sir w herschel as the richest and most condensed mass of stars which the firmament offers to the contemplation of astronomers there are two other objects conveniently situated for observation which the observer may now turn to the first is the great cluster in the swordhand of perseus see plate 4 now lying about 28 above the horizon between ne and nne the stars gamma and delta cassiopei see map 3 of frontispiece point towards this cluster which is rather farther from delta than delta from gamma and a little south of the produced line from these stars the cluster is well seen with the naked eye even in nearly full moonlight in a telescope of moderate power this cluster is a magnificent object and no telescope has yet revealed its full glory the view in plate 5 gives but the faintest conception of the glories of chi persei sir w herschel tried in vain to gauge the depths of this cluster with his most powerful telescope he spoke of the most distant parts as sending light to us which must have started 4000 or 5000 years ago but it appears improbable that the cluster has in reality so enormous a longitudinal extension compared with its transverse section as this view would imply on the contrary i think we may gather from the appearance of this cluster that stars are far less uniform in size than has been commonly supposed and that the mere irresolvability of a cluster is no proof of excessive distance it is unlikely that the faintest component of the cluster is farther off than the brightest a seventhmagnitude star in the proportion of more than about 20 to 19 while the ordinary estimate of star magnitudes applied by herschel gave a proportion of 20 or 30 to 1 at least i can no more believe that the components of this cluster are stars greatly varying in distance but accidentally seen in nearly the same direction or that they form an enormously long system turned by accident directly towards the earth than i could look on the association of several thousand persons in the form of a procession as a fortuitous arrangement next there is the great nebula in andromedaknown as the transcendantly beautiful queen of the nebul it will not be difficult to find this object the stars epsilon and delta cassiopei map 3 frontispiece point to the star beta andromed almost in a vertical line above this star are two fourthmagnitude stars mu and gamma and close above nu a little to the right is the object we seekvisible to the naked eye as a faint misty spot to tell the truth the transcendantly beautiful queen of the nebul is rather a disappointing object in an ordinary telescope there is seen a long oval or lenticular spot of light very bright near the centre especially with low powers but there is a want of the interest attaching to the strange figure of the great orion nebula the andromeda nebula has been partially resolved by lord rosses great reflector and it is said more satisfactorily by the great refractor of harvard college in the spectroscope mr huggins informs us the spectrum is peculiar continuous from the blue to the orange the light there appears to cease very abruptly there is no indication of gaseity lastly the observer may turn to the pair mizar and alcor the former the middle star in the great bears tail the latter 15 off it seems quite clear by the way that alcor has increased in brilliancy of late since among the arabians it was considered an evidence of very good eyesight to detect alcor whereas this star may now be easily seen even in nearly full moonlight mizar is a double star and a fourth star is seen in the same field of view with the others see plate 5 the distance between mizar and its companion is 144 the magnitude of mizar 3 of the companion 5 their colours white and pale green respectively chapter v a halfhour with andromeda cygnus etc our last halfhour with the double stars c must be a short one as we have already nearly filled the space allotted to these objects the observations now to be made are supposed to take place during the fourth quarter of the yearat ten oclock on october 23rd or at nine on november 7th or at eight on november 22nd or at seven on december 6th or at hours intermediate to these on intermediate days we look first as in former cases for the great bear now lying low down towards the north towards the northeast a few degrees easterly are the twinstars castor and pollux in a vertical position castor uppermost above these a little towards the right we see the brilliant capella and between capella and the zenith is seen the festoon of perseus cassiopeia lies near the zenith towards the north and the milky way extends from the eastern horizon across the zenith to the western horizon low down in the east is orion half risen above horizon turning to the south we see high up above the horizon the square of pegasus low down towards the southsouthwest is fomalhaut pointed to by beta and alpha pegasi towards the west about halfway between the zenith and the horizon is the noble cross in cygnus below which towards the left we see altair and his companions beta and gamma aquil while towards the right we see the brilliant vega during this halfhour we shall not confine ourselves to any particular region of the heavens but sweep the most conveniently situated constellations illustration plate v first however we should recommend the observer to try and get a good view of the great nebula in andromeda which is not conveniently situated for observation but is so high that after a little trouble the observer may expect a more distinct view than in the previous quarter he will see beta andromed towards the southeast about 18 from the zenith mu and nu nearly in a line towards the zenith and the nebula about halfway between beta and the zenith with a similar object it will be well to take another view of the great cluster in perseus about 18 from the zenith towards the eastnortheast see the pointers gamma and delta cassiopei in map 4 frontispiece the cluster being between delta cassiopei and alpha persei not very far off is the wonderful variable algol now due east and about 58 above the horizon the variability of this celebrated object was doubtless discovered in very ancient times since the name algol or the demon seems to point to a knowledge of the peculiarity of this slowly winking eye to goodricke however is due the rediscovery of algols variability the period of variation is 2d 20h 48m during 2h 14m algol appears of the second magnitude the remaining 634 hours are occupied by the gradual decline of the star to the fourth magnitude and its equally gradual return to the second it will be found easy to watch the variations of this singular object though of course many of the minima are attained in the daytime the following may help the observer on october 8th 1867 at about halfpast eleven in the evening i noticed that algol had reached its minimum of brilliancy hence the next minimum was attained at about a quarterpast eight on the evening of october 11th the next at about five on the evening of october 14th and so on now if this process be carried on it will be found that the next evening minimum occurred at about 10h circiter on the evening of october 31st the next at about 11h 30m on the evening of november 20th thus at whatever hour any minimum occurs another occurs six weeks and a day later at about the same hour this would be exact enough if the period of variation were exactly 2d 20m 48s but the period is nearly a minute greater and as there are fifteen periods in six weeks and a day it results that there is a difference of about 13m in the time at which the successive recurrences at nearly the same hour take place hence we are able to draw up the two following tables which will suffice to give all the minima conveniently observable during the next two years starting from a minimum at about 11h 45m on november 20th 1867 and noticing that the next 43day period with the 13m added gives us an observation at midnight on january 2nd 1868 and that successive periods would make the hour later yet we take the minimum next after that of january 2nd viz that of january 5th 1868 8h 48m and taking 43day periods with 13m added to each we get the series h m jan 5 1868 8 45 pm feb 17 8 58 mar 31 9 11 may 13 9 24 june 25 9 37 aug 7 9 50 sept 19 10

pm on october 31st 1867 we get in like manner the series h m dec 13 1867 10 13 pm jan 25 1868 10 26 mar 8 10 39 apr 20 10 52 june 2 11 5 june 5 7 53 8 july 18 8 6 aug 30 8 19 oct 12 8 32 nov 24 8 45

obtained thus suppose the observer wants to look for a minimum during the last fortnight in august 1868 the first table gives him no information the latter gives him a minimum at 8h 19m pm on august 30 hence of course there is a minimum at 11h 31m pm on august 27 and there are no other conveniently observable minima during the fortnight in question the cause of the remarkable variation in this stars brilliancy has been assigned by some astronomers to the presence of an opaque secondary which transits algol at regular intervals others have adopted the view that algol is a luminous secondary revolving around an opaque primary of these views the former seems the most natural and satisfactory it points to a secondary whose mass bears a far greater proportion to that of the primary than the mass even of jupiter bears to the sun the shortness of the period is also remarkable it may be noticed that observation points to a gradual diminution in the period of algols variation and the diminution seems to be proceeding more and more rapidly hence assuming the existence of a dark secondary we must suppose that either it travels in a resisting medium which is gradually destroying its motion or that there are other dependent orbs whose attractions affect the period of this secondary in the latter case the decrease in the period will attain a limit and be followed by an increase however interesting as the subject may be it is a digression from telescopic work to which we now return within the confines of the second map in plate 4 is seen the fine star gamma andromed at the hour of our observations it lies high up towards ese it is seen as a double star with very moderate telescopic power the distance between the components being upwards of 10 their magnitudes 3 and 512 their colours orange and green perhaps there is no more interesting double visible with low powers the smaller star is again double in firstclass telescopes the components being yellow and blue according to some observers but according to others both green below gamma andromed lie the stars beta and gamma triangulorum gamma a fine nakedeye triple the companions being delta and eta triangulorum a fine object with a very low power to the right is alpha triangulorum certainly less brilliant than beta below alpha are the three stars alpha beta and gamma arietis the first an unequal and difficult double the companion being purple and only just visible under favourable circumstances with a good 3inch telescope the last an easy double interesting as being the first ever discovered by hook in 1664 the colours of components white and grey immediately below alpha arietis is the star alpha ceti towards the right of which a little lower is mira a wonderful variable this star has a period of 33113 days during a fortnight it appears as a star of the 2nd magnitudeon each side of this fortnight there is a period of three months during one of which the star is increasing while during the other it is diminishing in brightness during the remaining five months of the period the star is invisible to the naked eye there are many peculiarities and changes in the variation of this star into which space will not permit me to enter immediately above mira is the star alpha piscium at the knot of the fishes connecting band this is a fine double the distance between the components being about 312 their magnitudes 5 and 6 their colours pale green and blue see plate 5 close to gamma aquarii see frontispiece map 4 above and to the left of it is the interesting double zeta aquarii the distance between the components is about 312 their magnitudes 4 and 412 both whitish yellow the period of this binary seems to be about 750 years turning next towards the southwest we see the secondmagnitude star epsilon pegasi some 40 above the horizon this star is a wide but not easy double the secondary being only of the ninth magnitude its colour is lilac that of the primary being yellow towards the right of epsilon pegasi and lower down are seen the three fourthmagnitude stars which mark the constellation equuleus of these the lowest is alpha to the right of which lies epsilon equulei a fifthmagnitude star really triple but seen as a double star with ordinary telescopes plate 5 the distance between the components is nearly 11 their colours white and blue their magnitudes 512 and 712 the primary is a very close double which appears however to be opening out rather rapidly immediately below equuleus are the stars alpha1 and alpha2 capricorni seen as a nakedeye double to the right of and above beta both alpha1 and alpha2 are yellow alpha2 is of the 3rd alpha1 of the 4th magnitude in a good telescope five stars are seen the other three being blue ashcoloured and lilac the star beta capricorni is also a wide double the components yellow and blue with many telescopic companions to the right of equuleus towards the westsouthwest is the constellation delphinus the upper lefthand star of the rhombus of stars forming the head of the delphinus is the star gamma delphini a rather easy double see plate 5 the components being nearly 12 apart their magnitudes 4 and 7 their colours golden yellow and flushed grey turn we next to the charming double albireo on the beak of cygnus about 36 above the horizon towards the west the components are 3412 apart their magnitudes 3 and 6 their colours orangeyellow and blue it has been supposed perhaps on insufficient evidence that this star is merely an optical double it must always be remembered that a certain proportion of stars amongst those separated by so considerable a distance must be optically combined only the star chi cygni is a wide double variable star the components are separated by nearly 26 their magnitudes 5 and 9 their colours yellow and light blue chi may be found by noticing that there is a cluster of small stars in the middle of the triangle formed by the stars gamma delta and beta cygni see map 4 frontispiece and that chi is the nearest star of the cluster to beta the star phi cygni which is just above and very close to beta albireo does not belong to the cluster chi is about half as far again from phi as phi from albireo but as chi descends to the 11th magnitude at its minimum the observer must not always expect to find it very easily it has been known to be invisible at the epoch when it should have been most conspicuous the period of this variable is 406 days the star 61 cygni is an interesting one so far as observation has yet extended it would seem to be the nearest to us of all stars visible in the northern hemisphere it is a fine double the components nearly equal 512 and 6 both yellow and nearly 19 apart the period of this binary appears to be about 540 years to find 61 cygni note that epsilon and delta cygni form the diameter of a semicircle divided into two quadrants by alpha cygni arided on this semicircle on either side of alpha lie the stars nu and alpha cygni nu towards epsilon now a line from alpha to nu produced passes very near to 61 cygni at a distance from nu somewhat greater than half the distance of nu from alpha the star mu cygni lies in a corner of the constellation rather farther from zeta than zeta from epsilon cygni a line from epsilon to zeta produced meets kappa pegasi a fourthmagnitude star and mu cygni a fifthmagnitude star lies close above kappa pegasi the distance between the components is about 512 their magnitudes 5 and 6 their colours white and pale blue the star psi cygni may next be looked for but for this a good map of cygnus will be wanted as psi is not pointed to by any wellmarked stars a line from alpha parallel to the line joining gamma and delta and about onethird longer than that line would about mark the position of psi cygni the distance between the components of this double is about 312 their magnitudes 512 and 8 their colours white and lilac lastly the observer may turn to the stars gamma1 and gamma2 draconis towards the northwest about 40 above the horizon they are included in the second map of plate 2 they form a wide double having equal fifthmagnitude components both grey see plate 5 chapter vi halfhours with the planets in observing the stars we can select a part of the heavens which may be conveniently observed and in this way in the course of a year we can observe every part of the heavens visible in our northern hemisphere but with the planets the case is not quite so simple they come into view at no fixed season of the year some of them can never be seen by night on the meridian and they all shift their place among the stars so that we require some method of determining where to look for them on any particular night and of recognising them from neighbouring fixed stars the regular observer will of course make use of the nautical almanac but dietrichsen and hannays almanac will serve every purpose of the amateur telescopist i will briefly describe those parts of the almanac which are useful to the observer it will be found that three pages are assigned to each month each page giving different information if we call these pages i ii iii then in order that page i for each month may fall to the left of the open double page and also that i and ii may be open together the pages are arranged in the following order i ii iii iii i ii i ii iii and so on now page iii for any month does not concern the amateur observer it gives information concerning the moons motions which is valuable to the sailor and interesting to the student of astronomy but not applicable to amateur observation illustration plate vi we have then only pages i and ii to consider across the top of both pages the right ascension and declination of the planets venus jupiter mars saturn mercury and uranus are given accompanied by those of two conspicuous stars this information is very valuable to the telescopist in the first place as we shall presently see it shows him what planets are well situated for observation and secondly it enables him to map down the path of any planet from day to day among the fixed stars this is a very useful exercise by the way and also a very instructive one the student may either make use of the regular maps and mark down the planets path in pencil taking a light curve through the points given by the data in his almanac or he may lay down a set of meridians suited to the part of the heavens traversed by the planet and then proceed to mark in the planets path and the stars taking the latter either from his maps or from a convenient list of stars9 my handbook of the stars has been constructed to aid the student in these processes it must be noticed that old maps are not suited for the work because through precession the stars are all out of place as respects ra and dec even the societys maps constructed so as to be right for 1830 are beginning to be out of date but a matter of 20 or 30 years either way is not important10 my maps handbook and zodiacchart have been constructed for the year 1880 so as to be serviceable for the next fifty years or so next below the table of the planets we have a set of vertical columns these are in order the days of the month the calendarin which are included some astronomical notices amongst others the diameter of saturn on different dates the hours at which the sun rises and sets the suns right ascension declination diameter and longitude then eight columns which do not concern the observer after which come the hours at which the moon rises and sets the moons age and lastly so far as the observer is concerned an important column about jupiters system of satellites next we have at the foot of the first page the hours at which the planets rise south and set and at the foot of the second page we have the dates of conjunctions oppositions and of other phenomena the diameters of venus jupiter mars and mercury and finally a few words respecting the visibility of these four planets after the thirtysix pages assigned to the months follow four pp 4246 in which much important astronomical information is contained but the points which most concern our observer are i a small table showing the appearance of saturns rings and ii a table giving the hours at which jupiters satellites are occulted or eclipsed reappear c we will now take the planets in the order of their distance from the sun we shall see that the information given by the almanac is very important to the observer mercury is so close to the sun as to be rarely seen with the naked eye since he never sets much more than two hours and a few minutes after the sun or rises by more than that interval before the sun it must not be supposed that at each successive epoch of most favourable appearance mercury sets so long after the sun or rises so long before him it would occupy too much of our space to enter into the circumstances which affect the length of these intervals the question in fact is not a very simple one all the necessary information is given in the almanac we merely notice that the planet is most favourably seen as an evening star in spring and as a morning star in autumn11 the observer with an equatorial has of course no difficulty in finding mercury since he can at once direct his telescope to the proper point of the heavens but the observer with an altazimuth might fail for years together in obtaining a sight of this interesting planet if he trusted to unaided nakedeye observations in looking for him copernicus never saw mercury though he often looked for him and mr hind tells me he has seen the planet but once with the naked eyethough this perhaps is not a very remarkable circumstance since the systematic worker in an observatory seldom has occasion to observe objects with the unaided eye by the following method the observer can easily pick up the planet across two uprights fig 10 nail a straight rod so that when looked at from some fixed point of view the rod may correspond to the suns path near the time of observation the rod should be at rightangles to the line of sight to its centre fasten another rod at right angles to the first from the point at which the rods cross measure off and mark on both rods spaces each subtending a degree as seen from the point of view thus if the point of view is 912 feet off these spaces must each be 2 inches long and they must be proportionately less or greater as the eye is nearer or farther illustration fig 10 now suppose the observer wishes to view mercury on some day whereon mercury is an evening star take for instance june 9th 1868 we find from dietrichsen that on this day at noon mercurys ra is 6h 53m 23s and the suns 5h 11m 31s we need not trouble ourselves about the odd hours after noon and thus we have mercurys ra greater than the suns by 1h 41m 52s now we will suppose that the observer has so fixed his uprights and the two rods that the sun seen from the fixed point of view appears to pass the point of crossing of the rods at halfpast seven then mercury will pass the crossrod at 11m 52s past nine but where to learn this we must take out mercurys declination which is 24 43 18 n and the suns which is 22 59 10 n the difference 1 44 8 n gives us mercurys place which it appears is rather less than 134 degree north of the sun thus about 1h 42m after the sun has passed the crossrod mercury will pass it between the first and second divisions above the point of fastening the sun will have set about an hour and mercury will be easily found when the telescope is directed towards the place indicated it will be noticed that this method does not require the time to be exactly known all we have to do is to note the moment at which the sun passes the point of fastening of the two rods and to take our 1h 42m from that moment this method it may be noticed in passing may be applied to give nakedeye observations of mercury at proper seasons given in the almanac by a little ingenuity it may be applied as well to morning as to evening observations the suns passage of the crossrod being taken on one morning and mercurys on the next so many minutes before the hour of the first observation in this way several views of mercury may be obtained during the year such methods may appear very insignificant to the systematic observer with the equatorial but that they are effective i can assert from my own experience similar methods may be applied to determine from the position of a known object that of any neighbouring unknown object even at night the crossrod must be shifted or else two crossrods used when the unknown precedes the known object if two crossrods are used account must be taken of the gradual diminution in the length of a degree of right ascension as we leave the equator even simpler methods carefully applied may serve to give a view of mercury to show this i may describe how i obtained my first view of this planet on june 1st 1863 i noticed that at five minutes past seven the sun as seen from my study window appeared from behind the gableend of mr st aubyns house at stoke devon i estimated the effect of mercurys northerly declination different of course for a vertical wall than for the crossrod in fig 8 which in fact agrees with a declinationcircle and found that he would pass out opposite a particular point of the wall a certain time after the sun i then turned the telescope towards that point and focussed for distinct vision of distant objects so that the outline of the house was seen out of focus as the calculated time of apparition approached i moved the telescope up and down so that the field swept the neighbourhood of the estimated point of apparition i need hardly say that mercury did not appear exactly at the assigned point nor did i see him make his first appearance but i picked him up so soon after emergence that the outline of the house was in the field of view with him he appeared as a halfdisc i followed him with the telescope until the sun had set and soon after i was able to see him very distinctly with the naked eye he shone with a peculiar brilliance on the still bright sky but although perfectly distinct to the view when his place was indicated he escaped detection by the undirected eye12 mercury does not present any features of great interest in ordinary telescopes though he usually appears better defined than venus at least as the latter is seen on a dark sky the phases are pleasingly seen as shown in plate 6 with a telescope of moderate power for their proper observation however the planet must be looked for with the telescope in the manner above indicated as he always shows a nearly semicircular disc when he is visible to the naked eye we come next to venus the most splendid of all the planets to the eye in the telescope venus disappoints the observer however her intense lustre brings out every defect of the instrument and especially the chromatic aberration a dark glass often improves the view but not always besides an interposed glass has an unpleasant effect on the field of view perhaps the best method of observing venus is to search for her when she is still high above the horizon and when therefore the background of the sky is bright enough to take off the planets glare the method i have described for the observation of mercury will prove very useful in the search for venus when the sun is above the horizon or but just set of course when an object is to be looked for high above the horizon the two rods which support the crossrods must not be upright but square to the line of view to that part of the sky but the observer must not expect to see much during his observation of venus in fact he can scarcely do more than note her varying phases see plate 6 and the somewhat uneven boundary of the terminator our leading observers have done so little with this fascinating but disappointing planet that amateurs must not be surprised at their own failure i suppose the question whether venus has a satellite or at any rate whether the object supposed to have been seen by cassini and other old observers were a satellite must be considered as decided in the negative that cassini should have seen an object which dawes and webb have failed to see must be considered utterly improbable leaving the inferior planets we come to a series of important and interesting objects first we have the planet mars nearly the last in the scale of planetary magnitude but far from being the least interesting of the planets it is in fact quite certain that we obtain a better view of mars than of any object in the heavens save the moon alone he may present a less distinguished appearance than jupiter or saturn but we see his surface on a larger scale than that of either of those giant orbs even if we assume that we ever obtain a fair view of their real surface nor need the moderately armed observer despair of obtaining interesting views of mars the telescope with which beer and mdler made their celebrated series of views was only a 4inch one so that with a 3inch or even a 2inch aperture the attentive observer may expect interesting views in fact more depends on the observer than on the instrument a patient and attentive scrutiny will reveal features which at the first view wholly escape notice in plate 6 i have given a series of views of mars much more distinct than an observer may expect to obtain with moderate powers i add a chart of mars a miniature of one i have prepared from a charming series of tracings supplied me by mr dawes the views taken by this celebrated observer in 1852 1856 1860 1862 and 1864 are far better than any others i have seen the views by beer and mdler are good as are some of secchis though they appear badly drawn nasmyths and phillips delarues two views are also admirable and lockyer has given a better set of views than any of the others but there is an amount of detail in mr dawes views which renders them superior to any yet taken i must confess i failed at a first view to see the full value of mr dawes tracings faint marks appeared which i supposed to be merely intended to represent shadings scarcely seen a more careful study shewed me that every mark is to be taken as the representative of what mr dawes actually saw the consistency of the views is perfectly wonderful when compared with the vagueness and inconsistency observable in nearly all other views and this consistency is not shown by mere resemblance which might have been an effect rather of memory unconsciously exerted than observation the same feature changes so much in figure as it appears on different parts of the disc that it was sometimes only on a careful projection of different views that i could determine what certain features near the limb represented but when this had been done and the distortion through the effect of foreshortening corrected the feature was found to be as true in shape as if it had been seen in the centre of the planets disc in examining mr dawes drawings it was necessary that the position of mars axis should be known the data for determining this were taken from dr oudemanns determinations given in a valuable paper on mars issued from mr bishops observatory but instead of calculating mars presentation by the formul there given i found it convenient rather to make use of geometrical constructions applied to my charts of the terrestrial planets taking mdlers startpoint for martial longitudes that is the longitudeline passing near dawes forked bay i found that my results agreed pretty fairly with those in prof phillips map so far as the latter went but there are many details in my charts not found in prof phillips nor in mdlers earlier charts i have applied to the different features the names of those observers who have studied the physical peculiarities presented by mars mr dawes name naturally occurs more frequently than others indeed if i had followed the rule of giving to each feature the name of its discoverer mr dawes name would have occurred much more frequently than it actually does on account of the eccentricity of his orbit mars is seen much better in some oppositions than in others when best seen the southern hemisphere is brought more into view than the northern because the summer of his northern hemisphere occurs when he is nearly in aphelion as is the case with the earth by the way the relative dimensions and presentation of mars as seen in opposition in perihelion and in opposition in aphelion are shown in the two rows of figures in and near quadrature mars is perceptibly gibbous he is seen thus about two months before or after opposition in the former case he rises late and comes to the meridian six hours or so after midnight in the latter case he is well seen in the evening coming to the meridian at six his appearance and relative dimensions as he passes from opposition to quadrature are shown in the last three figures of the upper row mars polar caps may be seen with very moderate powers i add four sets of meridians plate 6 by filling in which from the charts the observer may obtain any number of views of the planet as it appears at different times passing over the asteroids which are not very interesting objects to the amateur telescopist we come to jupiter the giant of the solar system surpassing our earth more than 1400 times in volume and overweighing all the planets taken together twice over jupiter is one of the easiest of all objects of telescopic observation no one can mistake this orb when it shines on a dark sky and only venus can be mistaken for it when seen as a morning or evening star sometimes both are seen together on the twilight sky and then venus is generally the brighter seen however at her brightest and at her greatest elongation from the sun her splendour scarcely exceeds that with which jupiter shines when high above the southern horizon at midnight jupiters satellites may be seen with very low powers indeed the outer ones have been seen with the naked eye and all are visible in a good operaglass their dimensions relatively to the disc are shown in plate 7 their greatest elongations are compared with the disc in the lowpower view jupiters belts may also be well seen with moderate telescopic power the outer parts of his disc are perceptibly less bright than the centre more difficult of observation are the transits of the satellites and of their shadows still the attentive observer can see the shadows with an aperture of two inches and the satellites themselves with an aperture of three inches the minute at which the satellites enter on the disc or pass off is given in dietrichsens almanac the nautical almanac also gives the corresponding data for the shadows the eclipses of the satellites in jupiters shadow and their occultations by his disc are also given in dietrichsens almanac in the inverting telescope the satellites move from right to left in the nearer parts of their orbit and therefore transit jupiters disc in that direction and from left to right in the farther parts also note that before opposition i the shadows travel in front of the satellites in transiting the disc ii the satellites are eclipsed in jupiters shadow iii they reappear from behind his disc on the other hand after opposition i the shadows travel behind the satellites in transiting the disc ii the satellites are occulted by the disc iii they reappear from eclipse in jupiters shadow conjunctions of the satellites are common phenomena and may be waited for by the observer who sees the chance an eclipse of one satellite by the shadow of another is not a common phenomenon in fact i have never heard of such an eclipse being seen that a satellite should be quite extinguished by anothers shadow is a phenomenon not absolutely impossible but which cannot happen save at long intervals the shadows are not black spots as is erroneously stated in nearly all popular works on astronomy the shadow of the fourth for instance is nearly all penumbra the really black part being quite minute by comparison the shadow of the third has a considerable penumbra and even that of the first is not wholly black these penumbras may not be perceptible but they affect the appearance of the shadows for instance the shadow of the fourth is perceptibly larger but less black than that of the third though the third is the larger satellite in transit the first satellite moves fastest the fourth slowest the others in their order the shadow moves just as fast appreciably as the satellite it belongs to sometimes the shadow of the satellite may be seen to overtake apparently the disc of another in such a case the shadow does not pass over the disc but the disc conceals the shadow this is explained by the fact that the shadow if visible throughout its length would be a line reaching slantwise from the satellite it belongs to and the end of the shadow that is the point where it meets the disc is not the point where the shadow crosses the orbit of any inner satellite thus the latter may be interposed between the end of the shadowthe only part of the shadow really visibleand the eye but the end of the shadow cannot be interposed between the satellite and the eye if a satellite on the disc were eclipsed by another satellite the black spot thus formed would be in another place from the black spot on the planets body i mention all this because simple as the question may seem i have known careful observers to make mistakes on this subject a shadow is seen crossing the disc and overtaking apparently a satellite in transit it seems therefore on a first view that the shadow will hide the satellite and observers have even said that they have seen this happen but they are deceived it is obvious that if one satellite eclipse another the shadows of both must occupy the same point on jupiters body thus it is the overtaking of one shadow by another on the disc and not the overtaking of a satellite by a shadow which determines the occurrence of that as yet unrecorded phenomenon the eclipse of one satellite by another13 the satellites when far from jupiter seem to lie in a straight line through his centre but as a matter of fact they do not in general lie in an exact straight line if their orbits could be seen as lines of light they would appear in general as very long ellipses the orbit of the fourth would frequently be seen to be quite clear of jupiters disc and the orbit of the third might in some very exceptional instances pass just clear of the disc the satellites move most nearly in a straight line apparently when jupiter comes to opposition in the beginning of february or august and they appear to depart most from rectilinear motion when opposition occurs in the beginning of may and november at these epochs the fourth satellite may be seen to pass above and below jupiters disc at a distance equal to about onesixth of the discs radius the shadows do not travel in the same apparent paths as the satellites themselves across the disc but in an inverting telescope below from august to january and above from february to july we come now to the most charming telescopic object in the heavensthe planet saturn inferior only to jupiter in mass and volume this planet surpasses him in the magnificence of his system seen in a telescope of adequate power saturn is an object of surpassing loveliness he must be an unimaginative man who can see saturn for the first time in such a telescope without a feeling of awe and amazement if there is any object in the heavensi except not even the suncalculated to impress one with a sense of the wisdom and omnipotence of the creator it is this his fashioning hand is indeed visible throughout space but in saturns system it is most impressively manifest saturn to be satisfactorily seen requires a much more powerful telescope than jupiter a good 2inch telescope will do much however in exhibiting his rings and belts i have never seen him satisfactorily myself with such an aperture but mr grover has not only seen the abovenamed features but even a penumbra to the shadow on the rings with a 2inch telescope saturn revolving round the sun in a long periodnearly thirty yearspresents slowly varying changes of appearance see plate 7 at one time the edge of his ring is turned nearly towards the earth seven or eight years later his rings are as much open as they can ever be then they gradually close up during a corresponding interval open out again exhibiting a different face and finally close up as first seen the last epoch of greatest opening occurred in 1856 the next occurs in 1870 the last epoch of disappearance occurred in 186263 the next occurs in 1879 the successive views obtained are as in plate 7 in order from right to left then back to the righthand figure but sloped the other way inverting the page we have this figure thus sloped and the following changes are now indicated by the other figures in order back to the first but sloped the other way and still inverted thus returning to the righthand figure as seen without inversion the division in the ring can be seen in a good 2inch aperture in favourable weather the dark ring requires a good 4inch and good weather saturns satellites do not like jupiters form a system of nearly equal bodies titan the sixth is probably larger than any of jupiters satellites the eighth also japetus is a large body probably at least equal to jupiters third satellite but rhea dione and tethys are much less conspicuous and the other three cannot be seen without more powerful telescopes than those we are here dealing with so far as my own experience goes i consider that the five larger satellites may be seen distinctly in good weather with a good 312inch aperture i have never seen them with such an aperture but i judge from the distinctness with which these satellites may be seen with a 4inch aperture titan is generally to be looked for at a considerable distance from saturnalways when the ring is widely open japetus is to be looked for yet farther from the disc in fact when saturn comes to opposition in perihelion in winter only this can happen japetus may be as far from saturn as onethird of the apparent diameter of the moon i believe that under these circumstances or even under less favourable circumstances japetus could be seen with a good operaglass so also might titan transits eclipses and occulations of saturns satellites can only be seen when the ring is turned nearly edgewise towards the earth for the orbits of the seven inner satellites lying nearly in the plane of the rings would if visible throughout their extent then only appear as straight lines or as long ellipses cutting the planets disc the belts on saturn are not very conspicuous a good 312inch is required so far as my experience extends to show them satisfactorily the rings when turned edgewise either towards the earth or sun are not visible in ordinary telescopes neither can they be seen when the earth and sun are on opposite sides of the rings in powerful telescopes the rings seem never entirely to disappear the shadow of the planet on the rings may be well seen with a good 2inch telescope which will also show balls division in the rings the shadow of the rings on the planet is a somewhat more difficult feature the shadow of the planet on the rings is best seen when the rings are well open and the planet is in or near quadrature it is to be looked for to the left of the ball in an inverting telescope at quadrature preceding opposition and to the right at quadrature following opposition saturn is more likely to be studied at the latter than at the former quadrature as in quadrature preceding opposition he is a morning star the shadow of the rings on the planet is best seen when the rings are but moderately open and saturn is in or near quadrature when the shadow lies outside the rings it is best seen as the dark ring takes off from the sharpness of the contrast when the shadow lies within the ring it would take more space than i can spare here to show how it is to be determined independently whether the shadow lies within or without the ring but the nautical almanac gives the means of determining this point when in the table for assigning the appearance of the rings l is less than l the shadow lies outside the ring when l is greater than l the shadow lies within the ring uranus is just visible to the naked eye when he is in opposition and his place accurately known but he presents no phenomena of interest i have seen him under powers which made his disc nearly equal to that of the moon yet could see nothing but a faint bluish disc neptune also is easily found if his place be accurately noted on a map and a good finder used we have only to turn the telescope to a few stars seen in the finder nearly in the place marked in our map and presently we shall recognise the one we want by the peculiarity of its light what is the lowest power which will exhibit neptune as a disc i do not know but i am certain no observer can mistake him for a fixed star with a 2inch aperture and a few minutes patient scrutiny in favourable weather illustration plate vii chapter vii halfhours with the sun and moon the moon perhaps is the easiest of all objects of telescopic observation a very moderate telescope will show her most striking features while each increase of power is repaid by a view of new details yet in one sense the moon is a disappointing object even to the possessor of a firstclass instrument for the most careful and persistent scrutiny carried on for a long series of years too often fails to reward the observer by any new discoveries of interest our observer must therefore rather be prepared to enjoy the observation of recognised features than expect to add by his labours to our knowledge of the earths nearest neighbour although the moon is a pleasing and surprising telescopic object when full the most interesting views of her features are obtained at other seasons if we follow the moon as she waxes or wanes we see the true nature of that rough and bleak mountain scenery which when the moon is full is partially softened through the want of sharp contrasts of light and shadow if we watch even for half an hour only the changing form of the ragged line separating light from darkness on the moons disc we cannot fail to be interested the outlying and isolated peak of some great mountainchain becomes gradually larger and is finally merged in the general luminous surface great circular spaces enclosed with rough and rocky walls many miles in diameter become apparent some with flat and perfectly smooth floors variegated with streaks others in which the flat floor is dotted with numerous pits or covered with broken fragments of rock occasionally a regularlyformed and unusually symmetrical circular formation makes its appearance the exterior surface of the wall bristling with terraces rising gradually from the plain the interior one much more steep and instead of a flat floor the inner space is concave or cupshaped with a solitary peak rising in the centre solitary peaks rise from the level plains and cast their long narrow shadows athwart the smooth surface vast plains of a dusky tint become visible not perfectly level but covered with ripples pits and projections circular wells which have no surrounding wall dip below the plain and are met with even in the interior of the circular mountains and on the tops of their walls from some of the mountains great streams of a brilliant white radiate in all directions and can be traced for hundreds of miles we see again great fissures almost perfectly straight and of great length although very narrow which appear like the cracks in moist clayey soil when dried by the sun14 but interesting as these views may be it was not for such discoveries as these that astronomers examined the surface of the moon the examination of mere peculiarities of physical condition is after all but barren labour if it lead to no discovery of physical variation the principal charm of astronomy as indeed of all observational science lies in the study of changeof progress development and decay and specially of systematic variations taking place in regularlyrecurring cycles and it is in this relation that the moon has been so disappointing an object of astronomical observation for two centuries and a half her face has been scanned with the closest possible scrutiny her features have been portrayed in elaborate maps many an astronomer has given a large portion of his life to the work of examining craters plains mountains and valleys for the signs of change but until lately no certain evidenceor rather no evidence save of the most doubtful characterhas been afforded that the moon is other than a dead and useless waste of extinct volcanoes whether the examination of the remarkable spot called linnwhere lately signs were supposed to have been seen of a process of volcanic eruptionwill prove an exception to this rule remains to be seen the evidence seems to me strongly to favour the supposition of a change of some sort having taken place in this neighbourhood the sort of scrutiny required for the discovery of changes or for the determination of their extent is far too close and laborious to be attractive to the general observer yet the kind of observation which avails best for the purpose is perhaps also the most interesting which he can apply to the lunar details the peculiarities presented by a spot upon the moon are to be observed from hour to hour or from day to day according to the size of the spot as the suns light gradually sweeps across it until the spot is fully lighted then as the moon wanes and the suns light gradually passes from the spot the series of observations is to be renewed a comparison of them is likelyespecially if the observer is a good artist and has executed several faithful delineations of the region under observation to throw much light upon the real contour of the moons surface at this point in the two lunar views in plate 7 some of the peculiarities i have described are illustrated but the patient observer will easily be able to construct for himself a set of interesting views of different regions it may be noticed that for observation of the waning moon there is no occasion to wait for those hours in which only the waning moon is visible during the night of course for the observation of a particular region under a particular illumination the observer has no choice as to hour but for generally interesting observations of the waning moon he can wait till morning and observe by daylight the moon is of course very easily found by the unaided eye in the day time when not very near to the sun and the methods described in chapter v will enable the observer to find the moon when she is so near to the sun as to present the narrowest possible sickle of light one of the most interesting features of the moon when she is observed with a good telescope is the variety of colour presented by different parts of her surface we see regions of the purest whiteregions which one would be apt to speak of as snowcovered if one could conceive the possibility that snow should have fallen where now at least there is neither air nor water then there are the socalled seas large grey or neutraltinted regions differing from the former not merely in colour and in tone but in the photographic quality of the light they reflect towards the earth some of the seas exhibit a greenish tint as the sea of serenity and the sea of humours where there is a central mountain within a circular depression the surrounding plain is generally of a bluish steelgrey colour there is a region called the marsh of sleep which exhibits a pale red tint a colour seen also near the hyrcinian mountains within a circumvallation called lichtenburg the brightest portion of the whole lunar disc is aristarchus the peaks of which shine often like stars when the mountain is within the unillumined portion of the moon the darkest regions are grimaldi and endymion and the great plain called plato by modern astronomersbut by hevelius the greater black lake the sunobservation of the sun is perhaps on the whole the most interesting work to which the possessor of a moderately good telescope can apply his instrument those wonderful varieties in the appearance of the solar surface which have so long perplexed astronomers not only supply in themselves interesting subjects of observation and examination but gain an enhanced meaning from the consideration that they speak meaningly to us of the structure of an orb which is the source of light and heat enjoyed by a series of dependent worlds whereof our earth isin size at leasta comparatively insignificant member swayed by the attraction of this giant globe jupiter and saturn uranus and neptune as well as the four minor planets and the host of asteroids sweep continuously in their appointed orbits in ever new but ever safe and orderly relations amongst each other if the suns light and heat were lost all life and work among the denizens of these orbs would at once cease if his attractive energy were destroyed these orbs would cease to form a system the sun may be observed conveniently in many ways some more suited to the general observer who has not time or opportunity for systematic observation others more instructive though involving more of preparation and arrangement the simplest method of observing the sun is to use the telescope in the ordinary manner protecting the eye by means of darkgreen or neutraltinted glasses some of the most interesting views i have ever obtained of the sun have resulted from the use of the ordinary terrestrial or erecting eyepiece capped with a dark glass the magnifying power of such an eyepiece is in general much lower than that available with astronomical eyepieces but vision is very pleasant and distinct when the sun is thus observed and a patient scrutiny reveals almost every feature which the highest astronomical power applicable could exhibit then owing to the greater number of intervening lenses there is not the same necessity for great darkness or thickness in the coloured glass so that the colours of the solar features are seen much more satisfactorily than when astronomical eyepieces are employed in using astronomical eyepieces it is convenient to have a rotating wheel attached by which darkening glasses of different power may be brought into use as the varying illumination may require those who wish to observe carefully and closely a minute portion of the solar disc should employ dawes eyepiece in this a metallic screen placed in the focus keeps away all light but such as passes through a minute hole in the diaphragm another convenient method of diminishing the light is to use a glass prism light being partially reflected from one of the exterior surfaces while the refracted portion is thrown out at another very beautiful and interesting views may be obtained by using such a pyramidal box as is depicted in fig 11 illustration fig 11 this box should be made of black cloth or calico fastened over a light framework of wire or cane the base of the pyramid should be covered on the inside with a sheet of white glazed paper or with some other uniform white surface captain noble i believe makes use of a surface of plaster of paris smoothed while wet with plateglass the door b c enables the observer to change power without removing the box while larger doors d e and g f enable him to examine the image a dark cloth such as photographers use being employed if necessary to keep out extraneous light the image may also be examined from without if the bottom of the pyramid be formed of a sheet of cutglass or oiled tissuepaper when making use of the method just described it is very necessary that the telescopetube should be well balanced a method by which this may be conveniently accomplished has been already described in chapter i but undoubtedly for the possessor of a moderately good telescope there is no way of viewing the suns features comparable to that now to be described which has been systematically and successfully applied for a long series of years by the rev f howlett to use his own words any one possessing a good achromatic of not more than three inches aperture who has a little dexterity with his pencil and a little time at his disposal all the better if it be at a somewhat early hour of the morning may by this method deliberately and satisfactorily view measure and if skill suffice delineate most of those interesting and grand solar phenomena of which he may have read or which he may have seen depicted in various works on physical astronomy15 the method in question depends on the same property which is involved in the use of the pyramidal box just described supplemented where exact and systematic observation is required by the fact that objects lying on or between the lenses of the eyepiece are to be seen faithfully projected on the white surface on which the suns image is received in place however of a box carried upon the telescopetube a darkened room or true camera obscura contains the receiving sheet a chamber is to be selected having a window looking towards the southa little easterly if possible so as to admit of morning observation all windows are to be completely darkened save one through which the telescope is directed towards the sun an arrangement is to be adopted for preventing all light from entering by this window except such light as passes down the tube of the telescope this can readily be managed with a little ingenuity mr howlett describes an excellent method the following perhaps will sufficiently serve the purposes of the general observera plain frame portable is to be constructed to fit into the window to the four sides of this frame triangular pieces of cloth impervious to light are to be attached their shape being such that when their adjacent edges are sewn together and the flaps stretched out they form a rectangular pyramid of which the frame is the base through the vertex of this pyramid near which of course the cloth flaps are not sewn together the telescope tube is to be passed and an elastic cord so placed round the ends of the flaps as to prevent any light from penetrating between them and the telescope it will now be possible without disturbing the screen fixed in the window to move the telescope so as to follow the sun during the time of observation and the same arrangement will serve for all seasons if so managed that the elastic cord is not far from the middle of the telescopetube for in this case the range of motion is small compared to the range of the tubes extremity a large screen of good drawingpaper should next be prepared this should be stretched on a light frame of wood and placed on an easel the legs of which should be furnished with holes and pegs that the screen may be set at any required height and be brought square to the tubes axis a large tsquare of light wood will be useful to enable the observer to judge whether the screen is properly situated in the last respect we wish now to direct the tube towards the sun and this without dazzling the eyes as by the ordinary method this may be done in two ways we may either before commencing workthat is before fastening our elastic cord so as to exclude all lightdirect the tube so that its shadow shall be a perfect circle when of course it is truly directed then fasten the cord and afterwards we can easily keep the sun in the field by slightly shifting the tube as occasion requires or if the elastic cord has already been fastened we may remove the eyetube and shift the telescopetube aboutthe direction in which the sun lies being roughly knownuntil we see the spot of light received down the telescopes axis grow brighter and brighter and finally become a spot of sunlight if a card be held near the focus of the telescope there will be seen in fact an image of the sun the telescope being now properly directed the eyetube may be slipped in again and the sun may be kept in the field as before there will now be seen upon the screen a picture of the sun very brilliant and pleasing but perhaps a little out of focus the focusing should therefore next be attended to the increase of clearness in the image being the test of approach to the true focus and again it will be well to try the effect of slight changes of distance between the screen and the telescopes eyepiece mr howlett considers one yard as a convenient distance for producing an excellent effect with almost any eyepiece that the state of the atmosphere will admit of of course the image becomes more sharply defined if we bring the screen nearer to the telescope while all the details are enlarged when we move the screen away the enlargement has no limits save those depending on the amount of light in the image but of course the observer must not expect enlargement to bring with it a view of new details after a certain magnitude of image has been attained still there is something instructive i think in occasionally getting a very magnified view of some remarkable spot i have often looked with enhanced feelings of awe and wonder on the gigantic image of a solar spot thrown by means of the diagonal eyepiece upon the ceiling of the observingroom blurred and indistinct through overmagnifying yet with a new meaning to me there the vast abysm lies pictured vague imaginings of the vast and incomprehensible agencies at work in the great centre of our system crowd unbidden into my mind and i seem to feelnot merely think aboutthe stupendous grandeur of that lifeemitting orb to return however to observationby slightly shifting the tube different parts of the solar disc can be brought successively upon the screen and scrutinized as readily as if they were drawn upon a chart with a power ofsay about 60 or 80 linearthe most minute solar spot properly so called that is capable of formation mr howlett believes they are never less than three seconds in length or breadth will be more readily detected than by any other method see plate 7 as also will any facul mottling or in short any other phenomena that may then be existing on the disc drifting clouds frequently sweep by to vary the scene and occasionally an arial hail or snowstorm mr howlett has more than once seen a distant flight of rooks pass slowly across the disc with wonderful distinctness when the sun has been at a low altitude and likewise much more frequently the rapid dash of starlings which very much closer at hand frequent his churchtower an eclipse of the sun or a transit of an inferior planet is also much better seen in this way than by any other method of observing the solar disc in plate 7 are presented several solar spots as they have appeared to mr howlett with an instrument of moderate power the grotesque forms of some of these are remarkable and the variations the spots undergo from day to day are particularly interesting to the thoughtful observer a method of measuring the spots may now be described it is not likely indeed that the ordinary observer will care to enter upon any systematic series of measurements but even in his case the means of forming a general comparison between the spots he sees at different times cannot fail to be valuable also the knowledgewhich a simple method of measurement suppliesof the actual dimensions of a spot in miles roughly is calculated to enhance our estimate of the importance of these features of the solar disc i give mr howletts method in his own words cause your optician to rule for you on a circular piece of glass a number of fine graduations the 200th part of an inch apart each fifth and tenth line being of a different length in order to assist the eye in their enumeration insert this between the anterior and posterior lenses of a huygenian eyepiece of moderate power say 80 linear direct your telescope upon the sun and having so arranged it that the whole disc of the sun may be projected on the screen count carefully the number of graduations that are seen to exactly occupy the solar diameter it matters not in which direction you measure your diameter provided only the sun has risen some 18 or 20 above the horizon and so escaped the distortion occasioned by refraction16 next let us suppose that our observer has been observing the sun on any day of the year say if you choose at the time of its mean apparent diameter namely about the first of april or first of october and has ascertained that as is the case with mr howletts instrument sixtyfour graduations occupy the diameter of the projected image now the semidiameter of the sun at the epochs above mentioned according to the tables given for every day of the year in the nautical almanac the same as in dietrichsen and hannays very useful compilation is 16 2 and consequently his mean total diameter is 32 4 or 1924 if now we divide 1924 by 64 this will of course award as nearly as possible 30 as the value in celestial arc of each graduation either as seen on the screen or as applied directly to the sun or any heavenly body large enough to be measured by it since the suns diameter is about 850000 miles each graduation in the case above specified corresponds to one64th part of 850000 milesthat is to a length of 13256 miles on the suns surface any other case can be treated in precisely the same manner it will be found easy so to place the screen that the distance between successive graduations as seen projected upon the screen may correspond to any desired unit of linear measurementsay an inch then if the observer use transparent tracingpaper ruled with faint lines forming squares halfaninch in size he can comfortably copy directly from the screen any solar phenomena he may be struck with a variety of methods of drawing will suggest themselves mr howlett in the paper i have quoted from above describes a very satisfactory method which those who are anxious to devote themselves seriously to solar observation will do well to study it is necessary that the observer should be able to determine approximately where the suns equator is situated at the time of any observation in order that he may assign to any spot or set of spots its true position in relation to solar longitude and latitude mr howlett shows how this may be done by three observations of the sun made at any fixed hour on successive days perhaps the following method will serve the purpose of the general observer sufficiently well the hour at which the sun crosses the meridian must be taken for the special observation now to be described this hour can always be learnt from dietrichsens almanac but noon civil time is near enough for practical purposes now it is necessary first to know the position of the ecliptic with reference to the celestial equator of course at noon a horizontal line across the suns disc is parallel to the equator but the position of that diameter of the sun which coincides with the ecliptic is not constant at the summer and winter solstices this diameter coincides with the other or is horizontal at noon at the spring equinox the sun which travels on the ecliptic is passing towards the north of the equator crossing that curve at an angle of 2312 so that the ecliptic coincides with that diameter of the sun which cuts the horizontal one at an angle of 2312 and has its left end above the horizontal diameter and at the autumn equinox the sun is descending and the same description applies only that the diameter inclined 2312 to the horizon which has its right end uppermost now represents the ecliptic for intermediate dates use the following little table date dec 22jan 5jan 20feb 4feb 19mar 5 mar 21 circiter june 6may 21 may 5 apr 20apr 5 inclination of left left left left left left left ecliptical diameter of sun to the 0 0 624

and draw a diameter inclined according to above table this diameter would represent the suns equator if the axis of the sun were square to the eclipticplane but this axis is slightly inclined the effect of which is that on or about june 10 the sun is situated as shown in fig 14 with respect to the ecliptic ab on or about september 11 he is situated as shown in fig 13 on or about december 11 as shown in fig 12 and on or about march 10 as shown in fig 15 the inclination of his equator to the ecliptic being so small the student can find little difficulty in determining with sufficient approximation the relation of the suns polar axis to the ecliptic on intermediate days since the equator is never more inclined than in figs 12 and 14 never more opened out than in figs 13 and 15 having then drawn a line to represent the suns ecliptical diameter inclined to the horizontal diameter as above described and having with this line to correspond to ab in figs 1215 drawn in the suns equator suitably inclined and opened out he has the suns actual presentation at noon as seen with an erecting eyepiece holding his picture upside down he has the suns presentation as seen with an astronomical eyepieceand finally looking at his picture from behind without inverting it he has the presentation seen when the sun is projected on the screen hence if he make a copy of this last view of his diagram upon the centre of his screen and using a low power bring the whole of the suns image to coincide with the circle thus drawn to a suitable scale on the screen he will at once see what is the true position of the different sunspots after a little practice the construction of a suitably sized and marked circle on the screen will not occupy more than a minute or two illustration fig 12 illustration fig 13 illustration fig 14 illustration fig 15 it must be noticed that the suns apparent diameter is not always the same he is nearer to us in winter than in summer and of course his apparent diameter is greater at the former than at the latter season the variation of the apparent diameter corresponds inversely to the variation of distance as the suns greatest distance from the earth is 93000000 miles pretty nearly and his least 90000000 his greatest mean and least apparent diameters are as 93 9112 and 90 respectively that is as 62 61 and 60 respectively mr howlett considers that with a good 3inch telescope applied in the manner we have described all the solar features may be seen except the separate granules disclosed by firstclass instruments in the hands of such observers as dawes huggins or secchi facul may of course be well seen they are to be looked for near spots which lie close to the suns limb when the suns general surface is carefully scrutinised it is found to present a mottled appearance this is a somewhat delicate feature it results undoubtedly from the combined effect of the granules separately seen in powerful instruments sir john herschel has stated that he cannot recognise the marbled appearance of the sun with an achromatic mr webb however has seen this appearance with such a telescope of moderate power used with direct vision and certainly i can corroborate mr howlett in the statement that this appearance may be most distinctly seen when the image of the sun is received within a welldarkened room my space will not permit me to enter here upon the discussion of any of those interesting speculations which have been broached concerning solar phenomena we may hope that the great eclipse of august 1868 which promises to be the most favourable for effective observation that has ever taken place will afford astronomers the opportunity of resolving some important questions it seems as if we were on the verge of great discoveriesand certainly if persevering and welldirected labour would seem in any case to render such discoveries due as mans just reward we may well say that he deserves shortly to reap a harvest of exact knowledge respecting solar phenomena the end footnotes footnote 1 such a telescope is most powerful with the shortest sight it may be remarked that the use of a telescope often reveals a difference in the sight of the two eyes in my own case for instance i have found that the left eye is very shortsighted the sight of the right eye being of about the average range accordingly with my left eye a 512foot objectglass alone forms an effective telescope with which i can see jupiters moons quite distinctly and under favourable circumstances even saturns rings i find that the full moon is too bright to be observed in this way without pain except at low altitudes footnote 2 betelgeusecommonly interpreted the giants shoulderibtaljauza the words however really signify the armpit of the

with an 8inch equatorial footnote 4 sir w herschel several times saw epsilon lyr as a double bessel also relates that when he was a lad of thirteen he could see this star double i think persons having average eyesight could see it double if they selected a suitable hour for observation my own eyesight is not good enough for this but i can distinctly see this star wedged whenever the line joining the components is inclined about 45 to the horizon and also when lyra is near the zenith footnote 5 they were so described by admiral smyth in 1839 mr main in 1862 describes them as strawcoloured and reddish while mr webb in 1865 saw them paleyellow and lilac footnote 6 or the observer may sweep from omicron towards nu looking for r about twofifths of the way from omicron to nu footnote 7 here a

a zodiacchart which will enable the student to mark in the path of a planet at any season of the year from the recorded places in the almanacs footnote 10 it is convenient to remember that through precession a star near the ecliptic shifts as respects the ra and dec lines through an arc of one degreeor nearly twice the moons diameterin about 72 years all other stars through a less arc footnote 11 mercury is best seen when in quadrature to the sun but not as i have seen stated at those quadratures in which he attains his maximum elongation from the sun this will appear singular because the maximum elongation is about 27 the minimum only about 18 but it happens that in our northern latitudes mercury is always south of the sun when he attains his maximum elongation and this fact exercises a more important effect than the mere amount of elongation footnote 12 it does not seem to me that the difficulty of detecting mercury is due to the difficulty of identifying it amongst the surrounding stars during the short time that it can be seen hinds introduction to astronomy there are few stars which are comparable with mercury in brilliancy when seen under the same light footnote 13 i may notice another error sometimes made it is said that the shadow of a satellite appears elliptical when near the edge of the disc the shadow is in reality elliptical when thus situated but appears circular a moments consideration will show that this should be so the part of the disc concealed by a satellite near the limb is also elliptical but of course appears round footnote 14 from a paper by mr breen in the popular science review october 1864 footnote 15 intellectual observer for july 1867 to which magazine the reader is referred for full details of mr howletts method of observation and for illustrations of the appliances he made use of and of some of his results footnote 16 as the sun does not attain such an altitude as 18 during two months in the year it is well to notice that the true length of the suns apparent solar diameter is determinable even immediately after sunrise if the line of graduation is made to coincide with the horizontal diameter of the picture on the screenfor refraction does not affect the length of this diameter footnote 17 the words left and right indicate which end of the suns ecliptical diameter is uppermost at the dates in upper or
