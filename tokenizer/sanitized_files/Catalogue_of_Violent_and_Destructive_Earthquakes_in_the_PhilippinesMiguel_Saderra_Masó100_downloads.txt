earthquakes in the philippines with an appendix earthquakes in the marianas islands 15991909 by rev miguel saderra mas s j assistant director of the weather bureau manila bureau of printing 1910 catalogue of violent and destructive earthquakes in the philippines 15991909 introductionthe occasion for publishing this catalogue of philippine earthquakes which were of violent and destructive character has been furnished by a request from prof john milne for a list of such phenomena to be included in the general earthquake catalogue which this eminent seismologist is preparing under the auspices of the british association for the advancement of science the said general catalogue has been undertaken with a view toward reducing to uniformity and completing those published years ago by robert mallet 1859 and perrey 18441871 the form adopted for professor milnes new catalogue is very concise comprising only the date intensity and region together with principal localities affected it will contain only the earthquakes of intensities vii to x according to the scale of de rossiforel and these will be divided into three classes class i will be formed by the earthquakes of sufficient force to produce cracks in buildings and to throw down chimneys they correspond to force vii of de rossiforel class ii consists of the earthquakes which not only threw down chimneys but also walls and some weak structures force viii of de rossiforel class iii comprises the earthquakes which caused general destruction force ix and x of de rossiforel as this classification is as purely conventional as every other and adopted only in the catalogue mentioned we do not employ it in the present catalogue of philippine earthquakes but retain the almost universally adopted scale of de rossiforel we shall also present more details as to the towns and buildings damaged the number of victims and other disastrous effects than enter into the catalogue of professor milne hence the differences between the list prepared for professor milne as well as the partial catalogue published in our monthly bulletin for february of the present year consist in the following 1 this catalogue contains also several earthquakes whose intensities were between vi and vii while in the former only such figure as according to their effects were decidedly of force vii 2 the new catalogue is more complete as to details concerning the towns etc which have been destroyed it is to be regretted that we are unable to present here a complete historical catalogue of all the destruction wrought in the archipelago by earthquakes since the time when legaspi and urdaneta first set foot on these shores but the old chroniclers who dwell upon the political happenings with an attention to detail which is occasionally overdone were invariably laconic when there was question of earthquakes and similar natural phenomena as a rule they were satisfied with mentioning the occurrence in a general and therefore vague way without any attempt at precision as to dates and places still the writers in the philippines did nothing worse than imitate their colleagues throughout the rest of the world this fact is responsible for the great contrast exhibited by our catalogue as regards the number and details of earthquakes which occurred prior to 1800 records of which have been preserved and the same data for the period from 1800 to the present time this same difference is observable in all catalogues of a similar nature even in those which cover phenomena which occurred in europe as to the philippine writers an additional excuse is found in the peculiar conditions of life in these islands as far as we know only two earthquakes which took place during the period which alone can come under considerationthat is since the discovery of the archipelagohave claimed a considerable number of victims and these in the capital because outside of manilaif we except two or three of the principal citiesthe buildings which could become dangerous during an earthquake have always been few moreover in a country in which fires consume every year thousands of dwellings and where the terrible typhoons frequently destroy whole towns with heavy loss of lives the damage done by earthquakes has rarely been so great as to impress those occurrences indelibly upon the memory this is beyond doubt one of the reasons why prior to the beginning of the nineteenth century hardly any data can be found concerning the numerous earthquakes which during the preceding two centuries must have occurred in the visayas and above all on the large island of mindanao the first earthquake of which the chronicles contain a mention is that of 1599 there is no reasonable doubt that during the twentyeight years which had then elapsed since the founding of manila by legaspi several strong and possibly even destructive earthquakes occurred in this part of luzon island but as the author of the verdadera relacin de la grande destruccin del ao 1645 tells us when first founded manila consisted of wooden houses roofed with a certain kind of palm leaves the same which the natives use in their buildings hence the damage done by these earthquakes must have been insignificant much more terrible were the losses caused by conflagrations which within a few years twice wiped out the entire city the first bishop of manila domingo de salazar seeing the city exposed to such general destructions by fire like the one of february 14 1583 gave the first impulse to the construction of stone buildings and worked indefatigably in this direction in person he explored the surroundings of manila in quest of stone quarries and by the middle of the year 1591 he had nearly finished his palace and the cathedral when financial difficulties caused a temporary suspension of the work at the same time a great number of public and private buildings were under construction the enthusiasm for structures of stone or brick with tile roofs did not diminish during the next fifty years the chroniclers tell us that the spaniards began to build their houses of stone and tiles without the so necessary precautions against earthquakes beautiful structures and dwelling houses were reared so high and spacious that they resembled palaces magnificent churches with lofty and graceful towers within the walls of manila as well as outside of them all of which made the city very beautiful and gay and contributed equally to health and pleasure the disaster of 1645 commonly called the earthquake of st andrew as it occurred on the feast of this apostle november 30 razed nearly every one of these buildings to the ground and since then the style and appearance of buildings has changed greatly throughout the archipelago with a correspondingly great saving of lives in the subsequent earthquakes masonry arches were henceforth banished from the churches the heavy walls of the latter were further strengthened by massive buttresses and the towers were given truly enormous substructures but even with these precautions there is at present hardly one out of the hundreds of churches built during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries which did not some time or other require important repairs of its masonry work or even partial reconstruction owing to earthquake damages the only structure of this class which thus far has withstood all convulsions is the church of st agustin manila nevertheless as we have stated before the chroniclers hardly mention all this destruction except in a very general and cursory manner i do not hesitate to say they were accustomed to see similar havoc created nearly every year in one part of the archipelago or the other by some severe typhoon accompanied by far greater loss of lives and property and consequently much more felt by the people than the destruction of a church convento municipal building tribunal one or two bridges or other masonry structure in the present catalogue our aim has been to present all that is known of the various violent and destructive earthquakes on record the first column of each page contains the ordinal number of the disturbance for purposes of reference in the second the date is given as accurately as it could be ascertained roman numerals being used to designate the months unfortunately of some earthquakes only the year is known of others the year and month of one no 32 the approximate hour has been recorded but not the day of the month while of another no 38 the hour has been preserved for posterity but whether the phenomenon occurred during february or march the records leave undecided in the third column will be found in the first place the intensity of the disturbance roman numerals representing the degrees of the scale of de rossiforel ix then the region affected most and finally the damages caused if known and other information if available in describing the epicentral regions the present distribution of the archipelago into provinces has been used throughout the catalogue this division is shown on the first of the two maps of the philippines which accompany this catalogue plate i as to the designation benguet occasionally occurring in the text where provinces are enumerated but not found on the map we beg to offer the excuse that the region thus named is exceedingly well known in the philippines as it contains baguio the health resort of the islands for the readers outside of the archipelago we remark that benguet is at present a subprovince of the mountain province of which it forms the southernmost part the location of baguio is shown on the map on plate ii a similar remark applies to lepanto and bontoc likewise divisions of the mountain province whose capitals cervantes and bontoc are indicated on the same map as we would hardly be justified in assuming that every reader is in possession of a detailed map of the philippines and a knowledge of the general distribution and the main directions of the principal mountain systems of an earthquake country is important we add a second map on which these data are shown by means of dashes together with the most important seismic regions and the positions of the principal towns bays etc mentioned in the text plate ii near the left margin of this second map will be found an index of the seismic regions just mentioned each of them being represented by its ordinal number large roman figures near each of these ordinals is placed the corresponding number of earthquakes since 1862 contained in the catalogue arabic figures which is followed in brackets by an analysis of the said number in which roman figures designate the degrees of the earthquake scale of de rossiforel while small arabic figures written like exponents give the number of earthquakes of each degree of intensity in drawing the map on plate ii it was not intended to represent the epicentric area of every individual earthquake center which would have crowded the map beyond reasonable limits but rather to show the principal seismic regions hence most of these curves contain more than one focus the approximate position of each of the latter has however been indicated by a star while the figure placed close to the star gives the number of earthquakes which proceeded from the said center a word must be said in apology for the constant use in the following list of the spanish word convento this word which means monastery cloister or convent is universally used in the philippines to designate also the habitation of the clergy attached to a parish church although these are as a rule spacious buildings and were formerly inhabited wellnigh exclusively by friars they can not properly be called monasteries wherefore in order to avoid lengthy circumlocutions the spanish word convento has been retained the reader who is not familiar with this country may find it strange that in reporting earthquake damages so much emphasis appears to be laid on the harm done to churches and conventos this is easily explained by the fact that these buildings were often the only structures within the meizoseismal area and built nearly everywhere in the most substantial manner in the present catalogue we have also included by way of an appendix the earthquakes which are known to have occurred in the marianas or ladrones group of islands while their number is too small to warrant separate publication we believe that the data concerning them will be welcome to the earthquake investigator catalogue of violent and destructive earthquakes in the philippines no date intensity epicenter and effects y m d h m 1 1599 vi 25 3 20 ix manila and neighboring provinces damaged many private buildings in manila cracked the vault of the jesuit church so badly that it had to be demolished and replaced by a ceiling fissured the walls and ruined the roof of santo domingo church 2 1600 i 2 0 0 viii earthquake of destructive force and long duration in manila extent of damage unknown 3 1600 xi vi violent and protracted earthquake 4 1601 i 16 0 viii manila and adjacent provinces did considerable damage to some churches and many private houses in manila its duration was unusually great it being said that during 7 minutes the shocks were almost continuous there were several dead and a great number of injured the repetitions were frequent throughout the year 5 1608 xii 3 vileyte island violent chiefly in the vii country around dulag and palo e coast of northern leyte it does not appear to have been destructive 6 1610 xi ix manila and provinces east of it several writers call it a terrible earthquake which progressed from e to w 7 1620 ix panay island great convulsions of the ground the aclan river changed its course the few stone buildings in the affected districts as for instance the church at passi province of iloilo were badly cracked the wooden structures either fell owing to the snapping of the uprights or remained inclined in various directions the provinces which suffered most were those of iloilo and capiz 8 1627 viii x northern luzon the historians mention it as one of the earthquakes which caused the greatest convulsions in northern luzon especially in ilocos norte and cagayan but above all in the region of the central central cordillera lepanto and bontoc the data are somewhat vague it is said that part of the northern caraballo mountains subsided 9 1628 ix camarines and albay a destructive earthquake in which it is said a mountain burst and emitted a river of water and mud which swept away the town of camarines and others the name of camarines was at the time used to designate the present town of camalig and the district near the southern slopes of mayon volcano the flood mentioned was probably an avalanche of water sand volcanic ashes and lapilli such as also on other occasions have occurred on the slopes of the same volcano during periods of torrential rains no date intensity epicenter and effects y m d h m 10 1636 xii 21 ix western mindanao destructive earthquake the epicenter appears to have been in illana bay great landslides are reported to have occurred at point flechas which is between the bays of illana and sibuguey 11 1641 i 4 x northern luzon destructive earthquake accompanied by great landslides in the mountains and eruptions of water and mud in the region of northern luzon which comprises the provinces of the ilocos of cagayan and the cordillera central all the historians of the archipelago mention this cataclysm which occurred shortly after the almost simultaneous eruptions of sanguir and jolo 12 1645 xi 30 20 x the most terrible earthquake recorded in the annals of the archipelago it might almost be said that from manila to cagayan and ilocos norte it left no stone upon the other in the capital where during the preceding fifty years a great number of stone buildings had been erected magnificent churches palaces and public buildings as well as private residences and villas the destruction was frightful ten churches were wrecked entirely to wit the royal chapel cathedral santo domingo those of the recollects and franciscans santiago san antonio nuestra seora de guia and the parish churches of binondo and san miguel only san agustin and the jesuit church remained standing twelve monasteries colleges and hospitals were likewise converted into ruins no better fared the palace of the governorgeneral the real audiencia and up to 150 of the finest residences which as one author puts it in other cities would have been considerable palaces the rest of the private houses were damaged to so great an extent that the majority had to be demolished the number of persons killed exceeded 600 and the total of killed and injured is stated to have been 3000 outside of manila there was a general destruction of villas and other buildings which had been erected on both banks of the pasig river throughout the neighboring provinces the masonry structures built by the missionaries suffered the same fate as those in manila from the farthest provinces in the north were reported great alterations of the surface with almost complete disappearance of some native villages changes in the courses of rivers subsidences of plains eruptions of sand etc all the writers of the time qualify this disturbance as the most disastrous earthquake not only in luzon but likewise in mindoro marinduque and the other islands south of luzon on the other hand the provinces of camarines and albay appear to have suffered little or nothing 13 1645 xii 5 23 viii the earthquake of november 30 was followed by almost daily repetitions and countless aftershocks one of which on december 5 was of such intensity as to finish the wrecking of many buildings leaving as a chronicler writes the city in such condition that it was impossible to walk through it aftershocks of variable force continued to be very frequent throughout an entire year that is until the end of 1646 no date intensity epicenter and effects y m d h m 14 1646 iii vi according to several chroniclers the aforementioned aftershocks were more were more frequent and of greater intensity during the month of march some of them assuming a violent character 15 1648 viii southern luzon very violent earthquake damaging many buildings von hoff 16 1653 v 1 vi earthquake in manila and surrounding provinces 17 1658 viii 20 17 ix destructive earthquake some historians maintain that it was as severe as that of 1645 but it caused fewer ruins partly on account of its short duration partly because it found buildings of less height and greater power or resistance than those erected before 1645 nevertheless it destroyed the monastery of santa clara and did great damage to the churches and monasteries of the dominicans and recollects likewise to the archiepiscopal palace the jesuit college and a considerable number of private buildings the epicentral region appears to have included only the southern part of luzon 18 1665 vi 19 viii destructive in manila and adjacent provinces in the ruins of numerous houses 19 persons perished and many more were injured of public buildings only the jesuit church is mentioned as having suffered to some extent 19 1675 ii viii destructive in northern mindoro and batangas province mention is made of extensive landslides the opening of many fissures and the subsidence of large tracts on the beach of the northeast coast of mindoro the repetitions were many and severe 20 1683 viii 24 vii damaged some buildings in manila 21 1687 ii vi several violent earthquakes which however caused no notable damages 22 1699 vii many chroniclers assure us that during this year and the following destructive earthquakes visited manila but there is great confusion as to the days and months in which they occurred 23 1716 ix 24 vii vicinity of taal volcano violent in manila and the provinces of rizal laguna cavite and batangas connected with an eruption of the volcano at each spasm of the latter the earth shook so violently that many buildings in manila and the provinces mentioned suffered much harm especially those in the vicinity of lake bombon within which is situated the said volcano 24 1728 xi 28 ix remarkable on account of its having been very perceptible throughout the entire archipelago caused considerable damage in manila and towns in southern luzon 25 1730 ix destructive in the provinces of tayabas and laguna ruined the church and the church and convento at mauban and other buildings in this and other towns of the two provinces 26 1743 ix destructive in tayabas province wrecking masonry structures in the town of tayabas and others no date intensity epicenter and effects y m d h m 27 1749 viii 12 9 ix a violent eruption of taal volcano which caused great havoc in all the towns on the shores of lake bombon the shocks which accompanied each of the intermittent outbursts of the volcano were so severe that they left hardly any building undamaged throughout the provinces in the neighborhood of manilarizal laguna cavite batangas tayabas and in northern mindoro the convulsions of the ground were very remarkable displacement occurred and fissures both wide and deep opened in the entire province of batangas and likewise in cavite province up to lake bay as the shocks occurred during many days the majority of manilas inhabitants abandoned the walled city and lived under tents or in structures of bamboo and nipa the greatest force of the earthquakes and consequently the greatest upheavals seem to have occurred in the region stretching from taal volcano toward talim island lake bay and the antipolo mountain range repetitions and aftershocks were frequent during nearly a year 28 1754 v 15 21 x another eruption of taal volcano the most terrible in the history of the islands all the towns which surrounded lake bombon were destroyed completely when rebuilt they were placed at a distance from the lake there occurred most violent earthquakes which produced disasters in the neighboring provinces equal too if not exceeding those of 1749 the spasms separated by intervals of greater or less duration lasted 7 months the principal outbursts being always accompanied by very intense earthquakes which made themselves felt throughout a large part of luzon on mindoro island and northern panay 29 1766 xii 7 10 45 vii a violent earthquake but did very slight damage in manila during the month many more earthquakes of less intensity were felt in fact they had been frequent ever since the preceding august there exist no data concerning the provinces around manila 30 1767 ii 8 1 5 vii manila and neighboring provinces violent earthquake preceded and followed by numerous shocks of smaller intensity 31 1767 xi 13 15 25 vii very violent in manila a few walls fell and tile roofs sagged slight repetitions marked the succeeding days nothing is known of the happenings in the nearby provinces 32 1770 xii 23 viii destructive earthquake mr sonnerat states that it wrecked many houses in manila this traveler was at the time on board a ship in the very bay of manila hence it is very strange that he does not give the day of the month on which the disaster took place 33 1771 ii 1 viii very severe earthquake which laid in ruins several buildings in manila express mention being made of the church of nuestra seora de guia in ermita a suburb of manila this is probably the same disturbance which according to some writers in the beginning of february damaged the church of antipolo and others in la laguna and cavite provinces 34 1783 iv 19 vi violent earthquake in dapitan and the whole of northwestern mindanao 35 1787 v 13 6 viii very violent in southern panay especially in the province of iloilo no date intensity epicenter and effects y m d h m 36 1787 vii 13 7 x panay island a terrible earthquake which left the whole island strewn with ruins of 15 to 20 churches and conventos in iloilo province only two or three remained standing in the two other provinces capiz and antique the destruction was less universal even the thick walls of the fort at iloilo were breached in many places there were subsidences in the plains and landslides in the mountains and mighty fissures opened it is stated that the victims were numerous in one building 15 persons perished 37 1796 ix many writers assert that during this year a most violent earthquake shook manila and was followed by severe repetitions during the succeeding 20 days but although all agree that the quake was destructive not one of them gives precise information as to its effects 38 1797 ii 14 vii a violent earthquake but not destructive iii in manila took place between february 11 and march 7 it fissured walls and ruined tile roofs 39 1811 x 5 ix destructive earthquake in camarines province it wrecked many churches conventos and other buildings throughout the province from san miguel bay to the vicinity of albay 40 1814 ii 2 vii albay violent earthquakes which preceded and accompanied the great eruption of mayon volcano province of albay several towns situated on the slopes of the mountain were destroyed by this outburst while others at a greater distance suffered less severely 41 1818 vii dapitan northwestern mindanao several violent earthquakes with countless repetitions distributed through 6 months 42 1824 i vii earthquake violent in manila and destructive in cagayan and isabela provinces northeastern luzon 43 1824 ix 29 ix central luzon destructive making many ruins throughout the provinces of tayabas laguna rizal and nueva ecija the churches of cavinti and lukban were destroyed that of antipolo and others badly damaged 44 1824 x 26 ix destructive in manila and neighboring provinces spoiled the bridge of spain and the barracks in its vicinity the church of saint francis and others and many private houses frightened by the continual repetitions people left the city to live in nipa houses and under tents the undulations seemed to come from northnorthwest 45 1828 xi 9 18 30 viii destructive earthquake damaged several churches in manila likewise the prison and many private residences the shocks appeared to advance from south to north 46 1830 i 18 17 ix southern luzon destructive in the provinces of rizal laguna and tayabas in manila the damage was confined to the cracking of walls and the falling of such as had little power of resistance but toward laguna and tayabas the destruction was greater the complete destruction of the church and convento of mauban is expressly mentioned no date intensity epicenter and effects y m d h m 47 1836 i 5 vii very violent earthquake in western mindanao the epicenter was in illana bay severe shocks were felt in cotabato and zamboanga 250 kilometers distant from each other 48 1840 ix destructive earthquake in sorsogon and masbate ruined the masonry buildings in sorsogon bay extensive subsidences occurred the sea invaded the town causing great destruction and claiming many victims 49 1852 ix 16 18 45 ix central luzon destructive earthquake which made itself felt with violence in the provinces of rizal laguna cavite batangas tayabas bataan zambales pampanga bulacan and nueva ecija in manila it damaged severely a great number of buildings among them the cathedral and the churches of the jesuits san miguel and paco the church and convento at pandacan near manila and many houses it is stated that the damage was relatively vastly greater in the provinces of bataan cavite and batangas where many fissures opened and subsidences and landslides occurred the zone most severely chastised seems to have stretched from the zambales mountain range as far as the coasts of batangas and northern mindoro aftershocks were frequent until the middle of october 50 1852 ix 25 vi very strong earthquake in camarines and albay provinces 51 1852 xii 24 ix destructive earthquake in batangas province and northern mindoro ruined many buildings among which were the church of taal and the church and convento of bauang the church of batangas likewise suffered severely 52 1853 viii destructive earthquake in camarines province made ruins in many towns of the southeastern part of the province express mention being made of the church convento tribunal and the schools of pulangui 53 1855 iii 22

other churches except san agustin the palace of the governorgeneral the audiencia the barracks warehouses etc all in all 46 public buildings in ruins and 25 others badly damaged of private houses 570 were destroyed 531 left tottering total 1172 buildings in ruins or badly damaged the number of victims was appalling it is estimated that in manila and the surrounding towns alone the number of killed reached 400 that of the injured 2000 the catastrophe likewise involved many towns in rizal laguna and cavite where it destroyed churches and a great number of houses 60 1863 vi 9 vii violent earthquake which in manila and neighboring towns brought to the ground several buildings left in a tottering condition by the preceding disturbance 61 1864 i 3 vi origin south of illana bay it was felt very strongly both at zamboanga and cotabato the former west the latter east of the bay mentioned 62 1865 xi 23 4 vi strong earthquake which caused great excitement in manila and adjacent

strong and prolonged earthquake 67 1868 iv 4 vi leyte island very strong earthquake 68 1868 vi 29 8 11 vi panay island very strong earthquake in iloilo and other towns of the southern part of the island frequent but weak shocks had been felt since june 7 69 1869 viii 16 15 ix masbate island disastrous earthquake destroyed the few masonry buildings extant on the island and ruined or inclined hundreds of houses of wood or light materials large trees fell fissures opened and vast landslides occurred in the mountains and along the coasts especially in the south of the island countless repetitions followed over 100 of the more severe ones having been counted during the first fortnight after the earthquake 70 1869 x 1 11 35 viii neighboring provinces east and south of manila and northern mindoro on luzon the provinces chiefly affected were rizal laguna cavite and batangas in manila this earthquake did considerable damage to quite a number of buildings in the provinces of cavite and batangas a few churches and conventos were wrecked there was no loss of life repetitions were frequent during the 5 days immediately following the earthquake no date intensity epicenter and

mindanao a violent earthquake whose epicenter lay between the gulf of davao and the province of misamis during the months of november and december occurred many repetitions some of them very intense 75 1871 ii 21 4 ix camiguin island destructive earthquake which affected only the extreme north of the island where subsequently on the 30th of april a volcano which had been believed extinct burst forth again near its base this great earthquake was the first of a series of shocks which preceded the eruption it ruined many buildings constructed of wood and rent asunder the massive walls of the churches at mambajao and catarman while in the mountains it caused many landslides between february 21 and april 30 the date of the volcanic eruption four violent earthquakes were felt on camiguin and the neighboring islands of mindanao cebu bohol etc aside from countless shocks of less intensity with the eruption the earthquakes ceased completely 76 1871 vi 28 5 30 vi district of davao southeastern mindanao violent earthquake throughout the region surrounding davao gulf with frequent aftershocks during the ensuing 8 days 77 1871 vii 11 21 19 vi very strong earthquake remarkable for its wide extension as it was felt strongly in all the provinces of luzon north of the sixteenth parallel of north latitude repetitions were frequent for three or four days 78 1871 x 4 20 30 vii district of davao southeastern mindanao a very violent earthquake shaking the region around the gulf of davao 79 1871 xi 5 9 vii surigao northeastern mindanao very violent and prolonged earthquake in the province of surigao also remarkable for its extension being felt intensely throughout eastern mindanao and perceptible on all the visayan islands 80 1871 xi 29 16 30 vii very violent earthquake in western mindanao and on the islands of basilan and jolo it caused slight damage to several buildings at zamboanga 81 1871 xii 8 17 30 ix destructive earthquake throughout the districts of lanao cotabato and davao mindanao it is reported that at cotabato and pollok not a single building remained standing the happenings in the moro villages and forts are not known even in davao at a distance of 200 kilometers it developed great violence within one hour three series of most violent shocks were experienced accompanied by subterraneous rumblings no date intensity epicenter and effects y m d h m 82 1871 xii 9 7 30 viii most violent earthquake in the same regions of lanao and cotabato which completed the devastation of the preceding also in this earthquake several separate groups of shocks could be distinguished which occurred within the space of a little more than half an hour the subterranean noises were much stronger than on the preceding day and caused consternation during the first few days following these quakes occurred uncounted repetitions some of which like the principal earthquakes were perceptible not only throughout mindanao but likewise in the visayas up to distances exceeding 500 kilometers 83 1871 xii 19 22 30 vii very violent earthquake throughout the length of eastern mindanao from surigao to davao it was likewise very perceptible on samar and leyte islands for a number of days there were many repetitions some of them very intense notably those which took place on the 21st and 22d 84 1872 i 26 19 30 vii violent earthquake close to the coast of zambales near the town of agno the shock was repeated ten to twelve times accompanied by subterraneous noises an extraordinary wave was seen in the sea close to the coast and in the agno river which empties
