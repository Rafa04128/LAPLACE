study of maya hieroglyphs that the interpretation of the conventionalized animal figures which so frequently occur in the maya codices should be undertaken the peabody museum committee on central american research therefore requested dr a m tozzer to prepare a paper on the subject and to secure the valuable cooperation of dr glover m allen a zoologist familiar with the animals of mexico and central america to aid in the identification of the various species of animals which under varying forms are used in connection with the glyphs while it is possible that some of the determinations given in this paper may require further confirmation it is evident that the combined studies of dr tozzer and dr allen cannot fail to be useful to students of the maya hieroglyphic writing f w putnam

papers iv 368 23 no 1 24 introduction the various peoples inhabiting mexico and central america in early precolumbian times were accustomed to record various events especially in regard to their calendar and the religious ceremonials in relation to it on long strips of skin or bark these were usually painted on both sides and folded together like a screen several of these codices are still in existence from the nahua and zapotec areas in mexico but only three have come down to us from the maya region which is included in the peninsula of yucatan the states of tabasco and chiapas in mexico and portions of guatemala and honduras these three manuscripts are the dresden codex in the royal public library at dresden the trocortesianus formerly considered to have been two the troano and the cortesianus in the national archaeological museum at madrid and the peresianus in the national library at paris these precolumbian manuscripts have all been published in facsimile see bibliography these remains of a once extensive literature show evidence not only of considerable intellectual attainments on the part of their authors but also of a high degree of artistic skill in the drawings and hieroglyphics the frequent occurrence in these manuscripts of representations of animals showing various degrees of elaboration and conventionalization has led us to undertake the task of identifying these figures as far as possible and studying the uses and significance of the several species a field practically untouched284 frstemann in his various commentaries on the maya codices 1902 1903 1906 brinton 1895 and derosnytn3 1876 have only commented briefly upon this side of the study of the manuscripts seler 1904a and some others have written short papers on special animals during the preparation of this paper there has appeared a brief account by stempell 1908 of the animals in the maya codices the author has however omitted a number of species and as we believe misidentified others in making our identifications we have given the reasons for our determinations in some detail and have stated the characteristics employed to denote the several species we have not limited ourselves entirely to the maya manuscripts as we have drawn upon the vast amount of material available in the stone carvings the stucco figures and the frescoes found throughout the maya area this material has by no means been exhausted in the present paper in addition to the figures from the maya codices and a comparatively few from other sources in the maya region we have introduced for comparison in a number of cases figures from a few of the ancient manuscripts of the nahuas and the zapotecs to the north the calendar of these two peoples is fundamentally the same as that of the mayas the year is made up in the same way being composed of eighteen months of twenty days each with five days additional at the end of the year there is therefore a more or less close connection as regards subject matter in all the precolumbian codices of mexico and central america but the manner of presentation differs among the different peoples of this region footnotes 284 the first two parts of dr selers treatise die tierbilder der mexikanischen und der mayahandschriften published in the zeitschrift fr ethnologie vol 41 have appeared during the time when this paper was passing through the press the most excellent and exhaustive treatment by dr seler would seem to render the present paper unnecessary it has seemed best however to continue with its publication inasmuch as its field is narrower and more space is devoted to the maya side of the question to the exclusion of the mexican dr seler on the other hand while by no means neglecting the maya has spent more time in explaining the mexican figures i synoptic consideration of the meaning and occurrence of animal forms before taking up the different animals in the codices it may be well to consider some of the more common ways in which the figures occur and their connection with the surrounding figures manner of representation the entire body of the animal may be represented realistically or the head alone may be shown the animal head is frequently attached to a human body the animal may appear conventionalized to a greater or less extent and the head in turn may change in the same way until only a single characteristic of the animal remains by which to identify it as for example the spots of the jaguar or the feathering around the eye of the macaw in the case of the glyphs a term employed to designate the regular and usually square characters appearing in lines or columns throughout the codices and inscriptions we find both the realistic drawing and that where conventionalism has come in the tonalamatl the maya codices are made up for the most part of the records of the sacred period of two hundred and sixty days a period called in nahuatl tonalamatl and other numerical calculations the tonalamatl was used for purposes of divination in order to find out whether good or bad fortune was in store for an individual it is not necessary at this place to go into the different means taken to record this period of time or its methods of use it may be well however to explain the usual distribution of the pictures in the codices including those of animals in connection with the representation of the tonalamatl a normal period is shown in dresden 6c7c a column of five day signs occurs in the middle of 6c with a single red dot over it to the right of this column stretches a horizontal line of numbers consisting of alternate groups of black and red lines and dots under each pair of red and black numbers there is usually a human form and over each pair a group of four glyphs belonging to the figure below schellhas 1904 has classified the various figures of gods appearing in these vignettes of the tonalamatl and lettered them references throughout the paper will be made to the gods by letters and the reader is referred to schellhas paper animal figures often take the place of these gods as in the second picture in dresden 7c where the screech owl is shown with human body the greater number of animal figures in the codices occur in some connection with these tonalamatls mythological animals where figures are shown with human body and animal head standing alone in the place usually occupied by one of the various deities in the tonalamatl there can be little doubt that they have a mythological meaning and are to be taken either as gods themselves or as representing certain of the gods all of the animals are by no means shown in this position the screech owl or moan bird as in dresden 10a appears most frequently in this way the king vulture dresden 8a the dog dresden 7a and the parrot dresden 40b come next in descending importance the animals represented as copulating as in dresden 13c might also be considered as mythological animals as well as the full drawings of the jaguar dresden 8a and the other animals when they occur alone in the regular vignette of the tonalamatl the four priests in dresden 25a28a should also be regarded as representing in all probability the dog as a mythological animal the idea of worshipping animals as gods in themselves is strengthened by noting the ease with which the maya people worshipped the horse which was left behind by cortes in his march from mexico across to honduras villagutierre 1701 pp 100101 astronomical ideas animals frequently have a part to play in relation to the constellations throughout the codices and to a less degree in the stone carvings we find what have usually been considered to be glyphs for several of the constellations numerous calculations in the codices make it clear that the mayas had a good knowledge of astronomy these glyphs are usually oblong in shape and three or more are arranged together end to end we have called these the constellation bands various attempts have been made to identify these signs of the various constellations animals frequently are pictured below these bands the dog with fire brands in his paws and often attached to his tail is shown in several places coming head downward from one of these bands as in dresden 36a the peccary is also shown in the same position although the fire brands do not appear dresden 68a a figure with macaw head occurs once standing beneath one of these bands with fire brands in his hands dresden 40b the serpent as in dresden 36a the lizardcrocodilelike animal in dresden 74 the turtle trocortesianus 71a the vulture dresden 38b the turkey trocortesianus 10b and the deer trocortesianus 47a all appear in connection with these constellation bands it is impossible at this time to decide upon the part these various animals play in relation to distinct constellations in addition to the animals named several of the gods especially god b are found below these bands one of these signs the one identified by frstemann as standing for saturn is composed of the head of the crocodile more or less conventionalized frstemann 1902 p 27 identifies the turtle with the summer solstice and the snail as the animal associated with the winter solstice there does not seem to be any one animal used in connection with any one of the cardinal points in trocortesianus 88c the dog seems to be associated with the north as shown by the glyph which is ordinarily regarded as connected with that direction the ape with the west and an unidentifiable bird sitting on a cimi death sign with the south the east is connected in this place with a human figure it should be stated however that it is not absolutely certain that the usual assignment of the cardinal points each to its special direction is correct the signs for the east and west as well as those for the north and south may be reversed with the exception of the assignment of the offeringglyphs to the various cardinal points which will be discussed later p 290 this is almost the only case where a clear relation can be made out between the various animals and the signs for the four directions there is no definite relation as is seen for example in the vaticanus 3773 17 18 where the quetzal is noted perched on the tree of the east the eagle on that of the north the humming bird on that of the west and the jaguar on the tree of the south copulation the conception the period of pregnancy the infant baptism and possibly the naming of children are shown in both the trocortesianus 9195 and the dresden 1323 animals are frequently shown copulating with various gods or with one another in dresden 13c the deer and god m and the vulture and the dog in 19c the vulture and a woman in trocortesianus 91d a god and a woman and in 92d an armadillo and a deer both with female figures these animals probably represent in some way the totems of the man or woman in question and are shown in place of the human figure the lacandones a maya people show at the present time the remains of a totemic system tozzer 1907 pp 4042 the deer ke gens is found at the present time in the greater number of cases where copulation is shown a god and a female figure are pictured the presentation of the newborn children by women with bird headdresses also occurring in this same section of both manuscripts is discussed later p 291 animal sacrifices various ceremonials occurring at intervals throughout the maya year which included sacrifices to the gods evidently took up a large part of the time of the people animals composed by far the major part of the gifts made to the gods this was especially true in regard to the ceremonies occurring at the beginning of each year according to the maya calendar there were four days only which could come at the beginning of the year and these came in succession landa 1864 pp 210233 the first bishop of yucatan gives a minute description of the rites of the four years which were named according to the initial day he also relates the manner in which the various animals are employed as offerings in these rites and also in others taking place at the beginning of the various months289 the rites which took place at the beginning and the end of the year are shown in dresden 2528 and in trocortesianus 3437 the dog the deer and the turkey are the most important of the animals shown as being offered to the gods in this connection it will not be necessary to consider these animals in detail at this place as they are each taken up later offerings shown by glyphs it is however in another connection than that just considered that the animals are shown as offerings far more frequently throughout the maya manuscripts in the ceremonies of the four years the animals and birds are for the most part represented entire and purely as pictures offerings are also shown in the form of glyphs these may occur in connection with the figures of the gods or in the lines of hieroglyphs above the pictures when they are used in the former relation they are usually shown as resting in a bowl or dish dresden 35a it frequently happens that when a god is making an offering represented by the entire animal or a glyph of the animal in the main picture there is a corresponding glyph of the offering above in the line of hieroglyphics dresden 23b the fish iguana turkey deer and possibly the lizard are the usual animals shown as glyphs in this connection the frigate bird occurs once in the dresden 35a and once in the trocortesianus 34a as an offering the dog curiously enough does not seem to be represented by an offeringglyph although he has a glyph of his own when appearing in other connections the iguana and fish are shown entire although drawn very small the head is the only part usually shown of the turkey and the haunch of venison of the deer the head and feet of the lizard as has been noted may also be shown by a glyph the turkey and iguana glyphs are very often found with a kan sign indicating an offering of maize and bread as well as that of the animal in connection with glyphs showing various offerings of food there is one which occurs especially in the trocortesianus as in 106a this shows a row of points themselves running to a point over a kan sign this as will be pointed out later p 318 may also represent an iguana the jar containing a representation of the honey comb as in trocortesianus 107b might come in here in the consideration of the offeringglyphs in many instances the common offerings shown by glyphs are found associated with the signs for the four cardinal points but there does not seem to be any strict uniformity as to the special offering associated with each direction in dresden 29b the lizard glyph is found in the same group with the sign commonly assigned to the east the turkey with the south the iguana with the west and the fish with the north while in dresden 29c the deer is associated with the east the fish with the south the iguana with the west and the turkey with the north the iguana is usually found with the sign for the west and the fish with that of the south the others vary greatly in the assignment of the various directions schellhas 1904 p 17 considers that the fish the lizard the sprouting kernel of maize or according to frstemann parts of a mammal game and a vultures head are symbols of the four elements the head which schellhas interprets as that of the vulture is certainly the head of a turkey he remarks that these signs of the four elements appear with god b in the dresden manuscript other gods as he also notes are found with these four offeringglyphs there seems to be a fifth glyph however as in dresden 29b which we have interpreted as that of a lizard animals as rain bearers various animals are associated with the rain and water the serpent is most frequently represented in this connection snails fish the turtle and the frog as well as the lizardcrocodile figure in dresden 74 are naturally found associated with water the vultureheaded figure in dresden 38b and the vulture as a bird in trocortesianus 10a both appear in the rain the peccary dresden 68a and the turkey trocortesianus 10b appear associated with the rain as well as with the constellation bands the scorpion trocortesianus 7a encloses the rain within its legs the connection of an old female figure occurring in many places in the codices with the rain will be discussed later p 316 when considering the serpent it remains at this place to comment upon the woman in trocortesianus 30b from whose breasts water is flowing she is represented as having animal figures seated on her two outstretched hands and on her right foot together with another animal at her side god b sits on her left foot this picture immediately recalls representations in the mexican codices where the various parts of the body of a god are associated with various day signs ten of which have animal names in the maya picture a jaguar is shown on the right hand a peccary on the left a dog on the right foot and a rabbit beside the body at her right the peccary is not represented among the nahua day signs but the other three are found namely the oceolotl jaguar itzcuintli dog and tochtli rabbit animal headdresses animal figures appear perhaps most frequently as headdresses of the various gods in the codices here as elsewhere from all that can be made out the religious character is uppermost as in addition to being a decoration they undoubtedly have some religious signification birds occur by far most commonly in this connection both male and female figures seems to have these headdresses the same bird is often found as the headdress of several different gods as for example the turkey which appears with gods a b c e and n the vulture on the other hand when used as a headdress for male figures appears exclusively with god f the whole bird is seldom represented on the headdress of the male figures it is usually only the head and a part of the body of the bird which forms but a portion of the whole headcovering landa 1864 p 148292 notes the dress of the leader in the rites he wears a jacket of red feathers worked with other feathers and from it hang long plumes he also wears a feather headdress entire birds appear as the sole headcovering only in connection with female figures and then only in one section of the dresden 1618 and a parallel passage in the trocortesianus 9495 in both these places the conception and the bearing of children are shown together with their baptism the bird above the head of each female figure seems to be a badge of office possibly the totems which are held by the women and given to the children the parrot quetzal vulture screech owl and the horned owl appear in this connection it is to be noted that the birds associated with these women are not really represented as headdresses at all they are quite different from the head decoration composed of a birds head and feathers seen in other parts of the manuscripts in the dresden especially these birds above the womens heads are shown in almost every case standing with the claws clasping the necklace at the back of the neck landa 1864 pp 144154 gives an interesting account of the method of baptising children he also states p 304292 that in the month yaxkin an old woman brought the little girls to the general feast this old woman was dressed in a garment of feathers it was understood that this devoted old woman was not permitted to become intoxicated293 lest she should lose in the road the plume of her office the serpent appears as a headdress exclusively with female figures and then usually when the woman is in the act of offering something or is associated with water or rain the centipede occurs only with god d quadrupeds are employed as headdresses only very seldom the head of a deer is in three places used as a part of the head decoration of god m and the head of a jaguar appears in two places only secular occupations animals appear frequently in scenes showing various occupations these although appearing at first sight as secular have to do with the religion of the people and they show in every case acts undertaken in behalf of the deities it is almost exclusively in the trocortesianus that these religioussecular occupations are shown hunting scenes occur in one section of this codex 3849 the whole aim of the hunt in these pages is to obtain animals for sacrifice in almost every case the various animals are shown as being captured alive either in a pitfall or a trap of the jerkup type this was undoubtedly in order that the animal might be killed the moment it was offered to the gods by having its heart cut out deer are most commonly represented in this hunting section although peccaries and armadillos also appear fishing is shown in one place at least dresden 33a the practice of agriculture is shown in trocortesianus 2428 the sprouting grain is represented as being eaten by a vulture and a jaguar certain gods in this section which relates to the planting of maize are shown as being attacked by vultures and blowflies another occupation of the natives depicted in the trocortesianus 103112 is apiculture this again has clearly some religious significance potterymaking is shown in the same manuscript 95101 it is however a purely religious ceremony the renewal of the incenseburners is shown animals occur very infrequently in this section the quetzal and two vultures are noted seated on top of an ovenlike covering under which is the head of god c probably representing the idol there are several other occupations shown in this codex such as weaving 79c and the gathering of the sap of the rubber tree 102b but as animals do not occur in any connection with these operations it is not necessary to dwell upon them animal glyphs it remains finally to speak of the various animals which are represented in glyph form as well as drawn in full in the pictures proper the creatures pictured in the codices are often accompanied by their glyphs which appear in the lines of signs directly above in many cases the animal pictured below is not represented by its glyph above and vice versa the animal glyph may appear without its picture below the same is seen also in connection with the representation of the gods and their glyphs both the picture and the glyph usually appear but either may appear alone many times when the glyph either of a god or an animal is shown with no accompanying picture the reason seems to be that there is no room for the latter on account of the numerical calculations which take up all the space there are some animals in the codices which are represented by glyphs very frequently among these are the screech owl the moan the bird of death which has several different glyphs by which it is recognized the dog which in addition to its own glyph may be represented by the day sign oc the king vulture the turtle the bee if we consider the day sign cauac stands for this insect and the centipede among the animals whose glyphs only seldom appear may be mentioned the macaw the peccary the treetoad god p the quetzal and the jaguar the glyph for the black vulture trocortesianus 26c the ape trocortesianus 88c the deer peresianus 10 the eagle trocortesianus 107c and the serpent trocortesianus 106c seem to appear but once it might also be well to mention in this place the glyphs for various molluscs which are used not to represent the shell but to give the value of zero to the numerical calculations in the inscriptions glyphs frequently occur which represent animals either showing the whole body or simply the head in the eastern faade of the monjas at chichen itza there are glyphs for both the king and the black vulture and the peccary the macaw and the turtle seem also to be represented by glyphs in the inscriptions the tun period glyph shows vulturelike characteristics and the uinal period glyph certainly resembles the lizard the glyphs representing the various animal offerings have already been discussed under a special heading p 289 footnotes 289 p 162 las mugeres no usavan destos derrammamientos aunque eran harto santeras mas de todas las cosas que aver podian que son aves del cielo animales de la tierra o pescados de la agua siempre les embadurnavan los rostros al demonio con la sangre dellos p 164 y otras cosas que tenian ofrecian a algunos animales les sacavan el corazon y lo ofrecian a otros enteros unos vivos otros muertos unos crudos otros guisados que sin las fiestas en las quales para la solemnidad de ellas se secrificavan animales tambien por alguna tribulacion o necessidad p 254 tenian buscados todos animales y savandijas del campo que podian aver y en la tierra avia y con ellos se juntavan en el patio del templo en el qual se ponian los chaques sacavan con liberalidad los coraones a las aves y animales y echavanlos a quemar en el fuego y sino podian aver los animales grandes como tigres leones o largartos hazian los coraones de su encienso y si los matavan trayanles los coraones para aquel fuego 292 vestido salia con un jaco de pluma colorado y labrado de otras plumas de colores y que le cuelgan de los estremos otras plumas largas y una como coroza en la cabea de las mesmas plumas 292 y a las nias se les dava una vieja vestida de un habito de plumas que las traia alli y por esto la llamavan ixmol la allegadera aquella devota vieja allegaria con que se emborachava en casa por no perder la pluma del officio en el camino 293 intoxication was obligatory with the men in many of the religious rites this is reported by the early spanish historians and is the case at the present time among the lacandones see tozzer 1907 p 136 ii zoological identification and ethnological explanation of animal forms in the descriptions of the animals which follow the general plan will be to consider first the identification purely from a zoological point of view and secondly the connection and wherever possible the meaning of the use of the various animal figures wherever they occur mollusca fasciolaria gigantea representations of this marine shell are found in several places in the codices it is the only large fususlike species on the western coast of the gulf of mexico and indeed is the largest known american shell it is therefore not strange that it should have attracted the attention of the mayas and found a place in their writings several figures are shown that represent fasciolaria pl 1 figs 19 one in the codex vaticanus 3773 pl 1 fig 3 in common with those shown in pl 1 figs 2 6 9 has the spire represented by segments of successively smaller size the species of fasciolaria occurring on the yucatan and adjacent coasts is characterized by numerous prominent bosses or projections on its later whorls and these too appear in conventionalized form in most of the representations in pl 1 fig 2 the second whorl and in figs 6 9 the third whorl is shown with three stout tubercles in side view corresponding to those found in this region of the shell figs 7 8 pl 1 are glyphs representing the same species but as in fig 4 the spire is omitted though the knobs are present round spots of color are evidently intended by the markings on the shells shown in figs 3 5 6 pl 1 fig 5 shows a further modification of the spire which here is made like the head of a serpent the mollusca in the codices are not always associated with the water although this is usually the case god n pl 1 fig 1 sitting with the shell around his body is represented as in the rain and the shells in pl 1 figs 4 6 appear under water the snail maya vsot is considered by the nahuas as the symbol of birth and death the first idea is well brought out in pl 1 fig 2 where the human figure is emerging from a shell the same idea among the mayas is seen in pl 1 fig 1 where god n is coming from a shell as god n is usually associated with the end of the year we may have here the complementary idea of death associated with the shell the same meaning is brought out in the bologna codex pl 1 fig 3 where the shell is decorated with flint points the symbol of death as the tortoise is often identified with the summer solstice as previously pointed out so the snail is associated with the winter solstice frstemanns identification of the headdress of god d dresden 5c god a dresden 9c 13a and god e dresden 11c as representing snails is not clear stempell 1908 p 739 also follows the same course thinking that the knoblike prominences represent the stalked eyes of snails this seems quite unlikely as such representations are usually short and occur in too widely dissimilar connections moreover there are sometimes three of these instead of but a single pair dresden 14a a similar attempt has been made by brinton to identify the headdress of the death god god a as the snail the headdress in dresden 13a and 13b associated with god a looks far more like the head and upper jaw of some mammal oliva a univalve shell frequently represented is of an oval shape pointed at each end with a longitudinal lip and a short spire at one extremity this is doubtless a species of oliva a marine shell mr charles w johnson informs us that o reticulata is the species occurring on the yucatan shores while o splendidula is found in other parts of the gulf of mexico representations of this shell are shown in pl 1 figs 1012 in figs 10 11 the lip and spire are apparent but in fig 12 the lip only is seen as a white fissure against the general dark background an earthenware vessel representing a tapir pl 28 fig 1 shows a string of oliva shells about the animals neck and similar strings very often decorate the belts worn by the personages represented on the stelae of copan the shell in the codices is found in most cases to represent zero in the maya numerical calculations just as a bar has the meaning five and a dot one so the shell often has the signification of zero this is seen especially in the numeration by position in the codices pl 1 figs 7 8 1014 other mollusca in addition to the species just described at least two or three others occur in the nuttall codex but so conventionalized that it is out of the question to hazard a guess at their identity one pl 1 figs 16 17 is a bivalve with long pointed shell another pl 1 figs 1820 is rounder with conventionalized scrolllike markings figs 21 22 pl 1 may be a side view of the closed bivalve shown in figs 16 17 or possibly a species of cowry in like manner fig 13 is probably a side view of the mollusc shown in fig 14 for it is seen that in each case the figure showing the two opened valves has a bipartite extended foot whereas that of the single valve is simple this doubling of the single median foot of the bivalve may be an artistic necessity for the sake of balance or perhaps represents both foot and siphon at the same end figs 23 24 pl 1 seem to represent molluscs still further reduced and conventionalized these molluscs from the nuttall codex pl 1 figs 1524 are almost all found represented in the blue water whereas those which stand for zero in the maya codices have no immediate association with either water or rain insecta the honey bee melipona a portion of the trocortesianus appears to treat of apiculture as previously noted or at all events contains numerous figures of bees some of which are shown in pl 2 as stated by stempell 1908 p 735 this is doubtless a species of melipona probably m fulvipes or domestica it is well known that this bee was kept by the ancient mexicans and what appear to be improvised hives are shown in pl 2 figs 7 10 where the combs are noted depending from the ceiling or walls these combs are seen to be composed of cells roughly foursided for the most part though in fig 11 several hexagonal cells are present in the mass of comb held by the black god m darwin in his origin of species has called attention to the form of the comb built by this bee and considers its irregular cells of from three to six sides intermediate in their degree of perfection between those of the bumble bee bombus and the honey bee of europe apis mellifica the caban form in connnectiontn4 with the hive in fig 10 may have some phonetic signifiancetn5 as kab is honey in maya this sign occurs very frequently in the pages devoted to apiculture the figures of the bees in the codex show a number of interesting variations in figs 13 5 11 the insect is less conventionalized than in figs 4 6 pl 2 the hairy feet are well indicated as well as the segmented body and a single pair of wings all the figures show an anterodorsal view so that on account of the size of the first pair of legs only the tops of the second pair appear in pl 2 figs 1 3 5 in fig 2 however two pairs are seen and in figs 4 6 the anthropomorphic tendency is further shown by providing the insect with two pairs of limbs each with four or five digits and a conventionalized face eyes and mouth in pl 2 fig 1 the bee is represented without mouthparts but antennae only this may indicate a drone or a queen bee that takes no active part in the work of gathering honey or making comb fig 2 is perhaps the least reduced of any of the figures and shows the worker bee with antennae and mouthparts the socalled cloud balls of the day sign cauac pl 2 fig 8 may represent the honey comb cauac is usually supposed to have some connection with lighteningtn6 and thunder although valentini agrees with the authors in associating cauac with the bees and honey the cauaclike forms in pl 2 figs 7 10 have been described above as hives the representation of legs in the full drawing of a bee as four large limbs an anterior and a posterior pair coupled with the method of drawing the insect as seen from above and in front may have led to its final expression by an xshaped mark shown in connection with the hives pl 2 figs 7 10 the x is also seen in the day sign cauac apiculture was common among the various peoples of central america and mexico las casas speaks of hives of bees and gomara states that the bees were small and the honey rather bitter clavigero vol 1 p 68300 mentions six varieties of bees which were found in mexicothe first is the same as the common bee of europe the second differs from the first only in having no sting and is the bee of yucatan and chiapas which makes the fine clear honey of aromatic flavor the third species resembles in its form the winged ants but is smaller than the common bee and without a sting the fourth is a yellow bee smaller than the common one but like it furnished with a sting the fifth is a small bee without a sting which constructs hives of an orbicular form in subterranean cavities and the honey is sour and somewhat bitter the tlalpipiolli which is the sixth species is black and yellow of the size of the common bee but has no sting the natives of the country at the present time often cultivate hives of bees in logs which they hollow out for this purpose and keep in a specially constructed shelter it is however rather the ceremonial side of apiculture that is the interesting feature and this is clearly emphasized in the trocortesianus the section in this manuscript 80b 103112 as has been noted is taken up almost exclusively with the culture of the bee and in all probability represents a definite religious ceremony or series of rites which are connected intimately with bees and honey landa 1864 p 292300 states that in the month tzoz the natives prepare for a ceremony in behalf of the bees which takes place in the following month tzec in the month mol another fiesta is undertaken in behalf of these insects so that the gods may provide an abundance of flowers for the bees landa 1864 p 306301 it seems clear therefore that we have represented in the pages of the trocortesianus referred to the rites carried out in this connection the more or less realistic drawings of the bees pl 2 figs 16 9 represent the god of the bees and to him offerings of food and incense are being made pl 2 fig 11 shows the war god m with his eagle headdress offering a mass of honey in the comb to the god of the bees curiously enough the bee does not seem to be represented in the dresden codex frstemanns identification of the headdress of the goddess in dresden 9a as a bee does not seem to us to be correct in addition to the bees there occurs in the nuttall codex 4 pl 3 fig 4 a curious representation of an insect with a pointed beaklike structure and a spine at the posterior extremity of its humanlike body it is engaged in apparent conflict with a man and may represent a hornet blowfly sarcophaga two figures in the trocortesianus pl 3 figs 1 2 are of special interest since they appear to have been frequently regarded as picturing snakes attacking men these are thickbodied sinuous creatures distinguished by the curious conformation of the mouth and by a lateral row of dots that may represent the metameric spiracles or as commonly a demarcation between dorsal and ventral surfaces that these are maggots of a blowfly sarcophaga there can be little doubt not only on account of their mouth parts which are similar to those of the agave maggot see later but also because of their relation to god f whom they are devouring the latter in fig 1 is doubtless dead as shown by the closed eye and it is the habit of the blowfly to deposit its eggs in the nasal cavity of dead animals as well as elsewhere on the body the fact that in each case a maggot is attacking the gods nose may indicate that this habit was known to the artist who consequently shows the larvae in this position in pl 3 fig 2 the gods eye is not closed but his passive attitude while the maggot devours his hand and nose does not indicate that he is in full possession of his strength in addition to the blowfly a screwfly chrysomyia lays its eggs on the bodies of animals often on persons sleeping and these may hatch almost at once into small maggots that penetrate the skin it may be therefore that the larvae here considered belong to this genus in addition to god f in trocortesianus 24d there is another representation of the same god being attacked by a vulture this bird is evidently eating his nose in this case the god is shown with the closed eye as in 27d in trocortesianus 25d the fly seems to be attacking the mouth of god f from the fact that no other god is ever found in this connection it may be suggested that there may be some relation between god f as a god of human sacrifice and the fact that his dead body is being eaten by blowflies and vultures a portion of the body of the person sacrificed was usually eaten by those taking part in the ceremony lepidopterous insects in trocortesianus 28c pl 3 fig 3 is shown a second insect larva with curiously formed mouth parts it is represented as attacking agave which is springing from the ground as shown by the caban signs in the codex hough 1908 p 591 has shown this to be the larva of acentrocneme kollari felder called by the mexicans guson and in nahuatl mescuillin this grub he says is white about an inch long and tunnels the fleshy leaves of the agave it is greatly prized as an article of food for gusones to this day are collected in april boiled wrapped in the epidermis of the agave sold on the streets of mexico and are eaten with avidity to all appearances they are nourishing and palatable and it is said that connoisseurs prefer them to oysters or swallows nests hough believes that the discovery of the sapyielding quality of the agave was through search for these larvae in the nuttall codex occur numerous representations of insects some of which appear to represent butterflies or moths pl 3 figs 58 but these are quite unidentifiable that shown in fig 6 is colored blue in the original while the others are of various colors possibly the round markings on the wings in figs 5 8 represent the ocelli on the wings of certain species of moths in this connection too it is interesting to compare the conventionalized butterfly with its single eye and pointed antennae from the aubin manuscript pl 3 fig 9 with one drawn on the same plan from the nuttall codex pl 3 fig 8 myriapoda representations of a centipede probably a species of scolopendra occur in the dresden codex and in several others examined that shown in pl 5 fig 1 from the vaticanus 3773 is perhaps the least conventionalized303 this figure appears partly to encircle a temple behind which the major portion of its length is hidden and hence is not here shown the bipartite structure coming from the animals head doubtless represents the mouthparts and at its base on either side arise antennae the first pair only of legs is shown with a pinching claw possibly intended as a conventionalized hand while the rest are simple the plumes decorating the posterior extremity are of course extraneous and represent the tail of the quetzal or trogon in the dresden codex god d constantly appears in connection with a headdress from which depends a centipede greatly reduced and conventionalized two forms of this centipede are shown in pl 3 figs 15 18 the body appears to consist of four or five segments each with its pair of ambulatory appendages though there may not always be the same number of each terminated by a circular segment with a conventionalized threeknobbed structure apparently corresponding to the portion that bears the quetzal plume in pl 5 fig 1 the outline of the head in pl 3 fig 15 is shown in dotted line but by solid line in fig 18 one of the antennae appears to be omitted from the former figure also but both are present in the latter the insectlike head is made on much the same plan as that of the bee pl 2 fig 11 the facial portion divided by a median line into a right and a left half with a small triangle below for a mouth the eyes however instead of being circular like those of the bee are made as narrow elongated projections extending inward from the dorsal margin of the facial disc the glyphs for god d in dresden 7b pl 3 fig 11 dresden 7c and dresden 14b pl 3 fig 12 undoubtedly show three forms of the sign for god d only one of which fig 12 is given by schellhas 1904 p 22 among the signs of this god in each of these cases the centipede head surrounded by dots is shown in connection with the main part of the glyph in dresden 44b pl 3 fig 13 there is a glyph which seems to show the same centipede head although it has no connection with god d in the place where it is found in dresden 27 pl 3 fig 14 moreover still another variant of the glyph for god d seems to occur this shows a prefix clearly representing the centipede and the moon sign is the main part of the glyph directly beside this in the codex is found the ahaulike sign for god d and god d himself is represented in the middle section of the page the association of god d with the centipede may be explained by the fact that as this god is regarded as the moon or night god so the centipede is an animal which frequents dark places another point in this connection may be made if we consider the head of the centipede in the headdress and in the glyphs as representing the day sign akbal pl 3 fig 10 as akbal in maya means night it must be admitted however that the head might represent the day sign chuen almost as well as akbal the centipede is connected with death and destruction in the same way as the owl both are shown in vaticanus 3773 13 associated with the house of drought crustacea with one possible exception no crustaceans were found depicted in the maya codices but we have introduced figures of two from the nuttall codex the first of these pl 4 fig 5 is probably a crayfish perhaps cambarus montezumae it seems unlikely that the socalled spanish lobster palinurus can be intended or the powerful spined antennae would have been shown it is interesting to note that the stalked eyes are clearly pictured the second example seems to be a crab pl 4 fig 6 two large chelae of nearly equal size are simply drawn and four rounded projections at the top of the figure appear to represent the walking legs its rotund form and subequal chelae suggest the land crab geocarcinus but exact determination is of course impossible what is certainly a large crab perhaps of the same species is shown in trocortesianus 88c pl 36 fig 1 in connection with a dog whose feet it seems about to pinch with its two large chelae the shell is ornamented in a conventionalized way as if with scales arachnida in codex borbonicus 9 pl 4 fig 4 there is represented a stoutbodied form of spider with two sharply pointed chelicerae projecting from the conventionalized mouth these characteristics together with the absence of any web suggest a large predacious species probably the tarantula tarantula sp which is common in mexico the acute powers of observation shown by the artist are evinced in this figure since he draws the spider correctly with eight legs instead of the six or ten sometimes seen in drawings by our own illustrators arachnoidea the scorpion maya sinaan figures prominently in the trocortesianus two drawings from which are shown pl 4 figs 1 2 as here conventionalized the jointed appendages are represented as composed of an indefinite number of round segments the large chelate pedipalps are also prominently figured but the smaller walking legs are commonly omitted in pl 4 fig 1 however there is a pair of posterior chelate appendages which are probably added to give a more anthropoid cast to the figure the slight projections along the sides of the body in pl 4 fig 2 probably do not represent the legs in another drawing trocortesianus 44b these are also present but further reduced so as not to exceed the heavy fringe of spines surrounding the body in pl 4 fig 1 the fringe alone appears the formidable nature of the scorpion is of course due to the poisonous sting at the tip of the attenuated abdomen or tail in the maya pictures this portion is usually shown as a grasping organ thus in fig 1 it is similar to the chela and holds a cord by which a deer has been caught in fig 2 the tail is terminated by a hand the same thing is seen in trocortesianus 44b where the hand seizes a cord by which a deer is snared the scorpion is represented in the drawings with a conventionalized face that is very characteristic the facial disc is divided into three parts by a median area of straight or irregular lateral boundaries ending anteriorly in two inturned scrolls suggesting the alae of the nose a circular eye is present in each of the lateral divisions of the face while from the oral region projects a forked tongue it is of course hazardous to attempt a specific identification of these figures but as pointed out by stempell 1908 p 739 there are two large scorpions in yucatan centruroides margaritatus and c gracilis which are probably the species pictured in the codices the representations of the scorpion in the trocortesianus are almost always associated with scenes of the hunt as the deer is caught in a trap so frstemann considers that pl 4 fig 1 shows a trap with five appliances the tail one alone being effective brinton 1895 p 75 notes that the mayas applied the term sinaan ek scorpion stars to a certain constellation and suggests that it was derived from the spaniards there is certainly some association between the scorpion and water as in trocortesianus 7a the fore and hind legs of the animal enclose a body of water the scorpion tail alone appears in trocortesianus 31a and 82a as the tail of a god its significance is difficult to make out destruction is indicated by the scorpion in the aubin manuscript as suggested by seler 19001901 p 71 in the nuttall codex there is a remarkably beautiful conventionalization of a scorpion pl 4 fig 3 in which the tripartite nature of the head is still preserved though it is so reduced as to resemble the calyx of a flower the tail as elsewhere and the legs are present pisces figures of fish maya kai occur commonly in the maya codices in various connections as well as in the stone carvings but none of these seems certainly identifiable among the representations however there are clearly several species one pl 5 figs 2 6 79 pl 6 fig 9 has a single dorsal fin powerful teeth and a generally ferocious aspect and may represent some large predacious variety perhaps a tunny the distinct operculum in most of the figures would preclude their representing a shark other figures picture similar fish without the prominent teeth pl 5 fig 4 5 pl 6 figs 2 6 10 13 in two cases the scales are diagramatically shown by straight or crescentric lines pl 5 fig 4 8 a third species of fish is shown provided with two dorsal fins pl 6 figs 3 11 pl 7 fig 6 the last an excellent stone carving others pl 6 figs 7 1417 represent fishes without dorsal fins one of which fig 7 from its length may be an eel possibly muraena in the nuttall codex occurs a remarkable fish with an unmistakable wing arising just behind the head nearly at the dorsal line while this may represent a flying fish exocetus the head is so birdlike that the whole may be merely a combination figure of frequent occurrence in the dresden is a glyph two modifications of which are here shown pl 6 figs 4 5 stempell suggests that the vertical lines on the posterior portion of such figures may be gill slits and that hence they may represent sharks in which these orifices are without an operculum as with the molluscs so with the fish we naturally find them usually associated with the water this may be seen especially well in the nuttall codex in dresden 33a pl 6 fig 13 the fish is clearly associated with the operation of fishing as two figures are seated on the edge of a body of water in the act of casting a net an eel is shown in the water under god b in dresden 65b pl 6 fig 7 and fish are shown just below the claws of a crocodile in text figure 1 in dresden 44a god b holds a fish in his hands as will be pointed out later p 314 this god is frequently associated with water in dresden 44c a fish appears between god b and an unidentifiable deity in the maya codices the greater number of representations of fish are in connection with sacrifice in dresden 27 pl 6 fig 6 the fish is pictured resting on two kan signs the symbol of maize or bread and these in turn on a flat bowl in dresden 29b pl 5 fig 9 the fish is represented between the red and black numbers of the tonalamatl here again the fish is shown as an offering in two cases only do we find the fish used as a part of the headdress and in each case the fish is graphically shown as held in the mouth of a heron one of these is in the dresden codex 36b pl 5 fig 3 and one in the stone carving of the temple of the cross at palenque pl 15 fig 5 fish are often represented on the stone carvings as feeding upon a water plant this is seen in the border at the bottom of the lower chamber of the temple of the tigers at chichen itza pl 5 figs 2 4 pl 6 fig 2 in several instances at copan fish are shown as forming the sides of the great cycle glyph at the beginning of an initial series pl 6 figs 1417 it has often been suggested that as the word fish in maya is kai usually written cay there may be some phonetic significance here combining the fish kai with the usually drumlike sign for stone tun making kai tun or katun this is the term usually given not to the great cycle but to the period composed of twenty tuns and is probably derived from kal meaning twenty and tun a stone amphibia frogs figures undoubtedly representing frogs maya mutvs or uo or toads are found in several places in the codices and in the stone carvings but it is quite impossible to refer them definitely to any of the numerous species occurring in central america if indeed the artists had any one species in mind in the trocortesianus frogs are not uncommon in 31a there are four pl 7 fig 1 with water coming from their mouths they are characterized by their stout tailless bodies flattened heads and toothless mouths in 101d pl 7 figs 2 3 there are two the first painted blue with spots of darker blue and the second white and represented as broken in two in the middle the signs of death above the latter clearly show that a dead animal is indicated pl 7 fig 6 shows the end of altar o from copan on which a frog and a fish are pictured the former in dorsal view the latter in lateral aspect the peculiar pointed snout of this frog is similar to that of the frog shown in pl 7 fig 7 also in dorsal view a somewhat similar creature pl 29 fig 6 we have included and though it may represent an opossum it has little to distinguish it from the figures of frogs309 god b in trocortesianus 12b should be associated with the frog his legs are those of a frog and he appears as if swimming in the water frog in maya is uo which is also the name of the second month of the maya year the first day of this month according to landa corresponds to august 5 of our year and this is the height of the rainy season in the maya region the sign for uo does not however resemble a frog in any way the frog above one of the figures in the lower chamber of the temple of the tigers at chichen itza pl 7 fig 7 has clearly some relation to the name or totem of the warrior the nahua custom is seen here toads are probably intended in pl 7 figs 4 5 in these the great breadth of the head and mouth together with the short inflated body combine to produce a very toadlike appearance it is not unlikely that they represent the huge marine toad bufo marinus common from southern mexico to brazil and in the west indies there seems to be no distinction in the treatment of frogs and toads in the codices treetoad hyla eximia of great interest are the figures in trocortesianus 26a and b pl 8 figs 1 3 showing a god with expanded finger tips and characterized further by the presence of two parallel black stripes from the hinder and lower margins of the eye respectively the knoblike finger tips at once suggest one of the treetoads and the presence of the two lines seems to indicate hyla eximia as the species represented in this treetoad there is a long black lateral line running posteriorly from the tympanum and above it a shorter line just as in the drawings it appears to be a common species in the valley of mexico though but little seems to have been written of its habits at the beginning of the rainy season it repairs to pools of water to breed and is then very noticeable from its loud voice no doubt its importance in the maya economy was from its conspicuousness at the beginning of the rainy period this fact is brought out more strongly when we consider that these gods representing the treetoad are associated with agriculture and the sowing of grain at the beginning of the rainy season frstemann 1902 p 35 identifies these figures as god f they are quite unlike the usual representation of this god and are clearly god p as schellhas 1904 p 39 indicates it is interesting to note that the two black lines behind the eye are also seen in the other gods shown in trocortesianus 26a and b although the knoblike finger tips are lacking the glyph for this treetoad god is recognized in the fifth place at the top of the same page pl 8 fig 2 by the same two black lines under and behind the eye reptilia serpent it would be impossible in the present paper to enter into any lengthy discussion of the use of the serpent maya kan in mexico and central america it seems to be one of the main elements in the religion and consequently in the art of the mayas and mexican peoples it is represented again and again in many forms and varied combinations it underlies the whole general trend of maya art the serpent is often associated with feathers the culture hero of the nahuas quetzalcoatl feathered serpent corresponds to a similar god among the mayas kukulcan also meaning feathered serpent the feathers of the quetzal are the ones commonly used in connection with the serpent any attempt at identification of the species represented is beset by grave difficulties for so conventionalized have the figures often become that except in the case of the rattlesnake with its rattles there are no characteristic marks by which the species may be known it is natural to suppose that the species used for artistic purposes would be those that are most noteworthy because of their size coloring or venomous qualities no doubt a number of harmless species were also used in the religious ceremonies311 such may be those used as hair ornaments in many of the figures pl 8 figs 713 15 and in which no indication of a rattle is to be seen the fierce eye of these reptiles is shown by means of an exaggerated overhanging brow occasionally embellished by recurved crests pl 8 figs 10 11 13 15 these crests are sometimes shown as two or three stalked knobs pl 10 fig 7 that stempell was misled into identifying as the eyes of snails various heads of snakes usually with fangs exposed and tongue protruding are pictured in pl 8 figs 4 6 pl 9 figs 2 46 one snake with a spiny back is shown in pl 8 fig 5 but obviously it represents merely the artists endeavor to present as terrifying a creature as possible various types of rattlesnakes are shown in pl 9 the presence of the rattle is of course the characteristic and this portion alone is likewise used in one case at least as a glyph pl 9 fig 7 it cannot be denied however that some or most of the snakes in which no rattles appear are nevertheless intended for rattlers it may have been that the figures were so well understood that the addition of rattles in the drawings was quite unnecessary this however is quite conjectural the species of rattlesnake is probably crotalus basiliscus or c terrificus of southern mexico and adjacent regions not c horridus or adamanteus as supposed by stempell since these two species are confined to the united states among the figures shown on pl 9 it is noteworthy that five of the rattlesnakes show no fangs some are spotted but in a wholly arbitrary manner three are unmarked one is shown coiled about the base of a tree pl 9 fig 5 another coiled ready to strike though the rattle is pictured trailing on the ground instead of being held erect in the center of the coil as usually is done pl 9 fig 9 a rattlesnake is shown held in the hand of a man in pl 9 fig 8 in pl 10 fig 1 is shown a rattleless snake with prominent fang coiled about the top of an altar which may represent a tree or bush from the latter fact it might be concluded that it was a tree or bushinhabiting species possibly the deadly bushmaster lachesis lanceolatus other figures pl 10 figs 3 7 pl 11 figs 1 2 are introduced here as examples of the curious head ornamentation frequently found in the drawings the two first are merely serpents with the jaws extended to the utmost and with a characteristic head decoration the last is provided with an elaborate crest the size and markings of the two serpents shown in pl 11 as well as their want of rattles suggest that they may represent some species of large boidae as loxocemus bicolor or boa sp after having commented upon the various serpents occurring in the codices and in several other places we will now take up the manner and connection in which the various figures occur we shall pass over completely the use of the serpent column at chichen itza the importance of the serpent motive in the development of the masked panel as worked out by spinden and the countless representations of the plumed serpent in the whole field of maya design and decoration in the single temple of the tigers at chichen itza the feathered serpent occurs in the round as a column decoration supporting the portico as carved on the wooden lintel at the entrance to the painted chamber again and again on the frescoes of this room313 in the lower chamber as dividing the basrelief into zones or panels and finally as the center of the whole composition of this basrelief it will be seen therefore that it will be necessary in a short paper to limit ourselves to the representations of the serpent in the maya codices the serpent is most frequently associated with god b schellhas 1904 p 17 fewkes 1894 frstemann 1906 and thomas 1882 seem to agree that god b is to be identified as kukulcan the most important of the deities of the mayas and as pointed out before appearing in the nahua mythology as quetzalcoatl and in the quiche myths as gucumatz it was also noted that the name means both in maya and in nahuatl the feathered serpent or the bird serpent other authorities consider god b as itzamna another of the main gods of the mayas seler interprets god b as the counterpart of the nahua rain god tlaloc it is certain that when god b and the serpent are associated together water and rain are usually indicated god h the chicchan god also has some relation to the serpent as pointed out by schellhas 1904 pp 2830 this god often appears characterized by a skinspot or a scale of the serpent on his temple of the same shape as the hieroglyph of the day chicchan serpent the glyph belonging to this deity also shows the chicchan sign as its distinguishing mark similar signs appear on the body of the serpent in many places as in trocortesianus 30a pl 11 fig 1 we have already noted that the serpent god b and water are frequently shown together so the serpent also appears associated with water and rain when no figure of god b is present from this connection it can be argued that there is some relation between the serpent and the coming of the rains these facts would give strength to the theory that god b is to be identified as a rain god in dresden 33a 35a god b is seated on the open jaws of a serpent while the body of the reptile encloses a blue field evidently signifying water the number nineteen appears on this blue color it will be noted that there are nineteen spots on the serpents in pl 11 figs 1 2 in trocortesianus 3a6a corresponding scenes seem to be shown the body of the serpent encloses water and here the number eighteen appears in each case god b occurs always in front of the serpent and his head appears as the head of the reptile in the first instance in dresden 35a 36a the head of god b is pictured as the head of the serpent in the midst of the water in dresden 37b pl 10 fig 8 b is holding a snake in the water water appears in connection with the serpent and god b in many places in the trocortesianus in 9 god b is pictured pouring water from a jar a common method of showing the idea of rain in the codices in 12b b again is shown perhaps representing a frog and behind him a serpent the reptiles in 13b18b are all associated with the idea of rain the turtle and frog also appearing in this section in 30a pl 11 fig 1 god b and a female figure are both pouring water from a jar as they stand on the body of a serpent in 32a the black god l is seen in the rain and a serpent is near while in 32b and 33b pl 9 fig 1 the serpent forms the belt of god l and a female figure and water are seen in both cases the blue color of the snake and of god b in 31b pl 11 fig 2 may also suggest water god b also occurs in connection with the serpent in dresden 42a pl 8 fig 14 where the god is seated on the reptile in trocortesianus 10b where the head of the same god is the head of the snake and in trocortesianus 19a where god b again and god a are each seated on the open jaws of a serpent the astronomical role of the serpent is noted in dresden 56b 57b pl 10 fig 3 trocortesianus 5b 12b 15b and 67b where the snake is shown in connection with a line of constellation signs the kin or sun sign prominent in most of the drawings in the battle of the constellations in dresden 60 the serpent appears forming a sort of altar the seat of a figure which is supported by another figure a serpent head also appears at the foot of the latter figure that the serpent appears associated with the idea of time seems clear from the fact of the long number series in dresden 61 62 pl 10 fig 7 and 69 which are shown in the spaces made by the winding of the serpents bodies in trocortesianus 13a16a four large reptiles appear in connection with the lines of day signs the study of the serpent used as a headdress is interesting as noted previously quite a different kind of snake seems to be represented when used in this connection two other points come out in this investigation namely that it is only with female figures that the serpent is employed as a headdress and in far the greater number of cases the women are shown either in the act of offering something or of pouring water from a jar the usual type of serpent headdress is seen in dresden 9c pl 8 fig 11 15b pl 8 fig 12 18a pl 8 fig 13 22b pl 8 fig 10 and 23b pl 8 fig 8 in the first case the offering is a jicara or gourd of some sacred drink baltvse in the second and third examples the dish is clearly shown but the offering is unidentifiable in the fourth case maize a kan sign and in the last a fish resting on a dish in dresden 20a pl 8 fig 15 a woman with serpent headdress is seen associated with the moanheaded figure possibly in the act of offering it as a sacrifice in dresden 39b pl 8 fig 7 43b pl 8 fig 9 and 70 a similar serpent headdress is shown on a female figure in the act of pouring water from a jar in trocortesianus the serpent headdresses differ in type only and in two out of the four cases where they appear water is shown flowing from the breasts 30b of the female figure or from the mouth 32b the woman thus represented in connection with the water is god i the water goddess of schellhas she is as he notes 1904 p 31 usually the figure of an old woman evidently we have here the personification of water in its quality of destroyer a goddess of floods and cloudbursts we are not at all sure that we have here a distinct god as similar female figures with serpent headdresses occur frequently in the dresden codex with no suggestion of water the failure to find any distinct glyph for this goddess seems to strengthen the view of not considering her as a separate deity finally in our consideration of headdresses the serpent is to be seen in trocortesianus 79c on the head of the first woman who is weaving possibly a conventionalized serpent forms the head covering of the second figure who is represented as dead the serpent in dresden 26c28c pl 10 fig 1 coiled around the altar which rises from a tun sign is not easily explained in 25c the altar is replaced by god b and in the former cases the reptiles may stand for this god with whom they are often associated316 the serpent seems closely connected with the idea of offerings as the body of a snake is shown in several instances as the support of the jar containing the various gifts in trocortesianus 34a 34b 35a 35b 36a 36b and possibly 52c pl 9 fig 3 finally the serpent is to be noted in a number of miscellaneous connectionsin dresden 36b pl 19 fig 11 as being attacked by a black vulture317 in trocortesianus 40b pl 9 fig 4 a rattlesnake is biting the foot of one of the hunters and in trocortesianus 66b where the serpent has a human head and arm coming from its open jaws this is a very frequent method of representing the serpent in the maya stone carvings in trocortesianus 60c 100d pl 9 fig 8 twice 106a and 111b the rattlesnake is shown as a sprinkler for the holy water in the hand in the first second and fourth examples of god d landa 1864 p 150317 describes in the ceremony of the baptism of children that the leader of the rite wore on his head a kind of mitre embroidered with plumage in some manner and in his hand a small holywater sprinkler of wood carved skillfully of which the filaments were the tails of serpents similar to serpents with rattles in spite of the importance of the serpent in the manuscripts and stone carvings it never seems to appear as a separate deity with one exception no glyph is to be found representing this reptile as is the case with many of the animals trocortesianus 106c pl 9 fig 7 is this exception showing the rattles of a snake which are found in the line of glyphs above two of the bees no serpent appears in the picture the nahuatl day couatl has the signification serpent as suggested before in discussing the meaning of the name quetzalcoatl or quetzalcouatl this day sign occurs throughout the mexican manuscripts as the head of a serpent pl 8 figs 4 6 pl 9 fig 2 pl 10 figs 2 46 iguana of the lizards represented the iguana maya hu is the most striking and is readily identified on account of the prominent spines along the back as noted by stempell there are two or three species of large lizards in central america commonly called iguana and it is probable that the one here considered is the ctenosaura acanthura of yucatan or iguana tuberculata of south and central america in the manuscripts the iguana is almost exclusively represented as an offering pl 12 figs 16 it is usually found on top of the kan sign meaning maize or bread318 and this in turn resting in a bowl pl 12 figs 3 4 6 landa 1864 p 230318 gives a pleasing confirmation of this offering of an iguana with bread it is possible that the object shown in trocortesianus 12b pl 12 fig 13 may be the conventionalized representation of this lizard it must be admitted that this interpretation is very doubtful the triangular points suggest the lizard but the pointed character of the sign as a whole in no way resembles the back of this reptile it is found associated with three kan signs in cakchiquel a dialect of the maya stock kan according to guzman and brinton 1893 p 24 is the name applied to the female of the iguana or the lizard and this is believed to be the original sense of the maya term it may also be noted that the nahua day sign cuetzpalin meaning lizard is the one which corresponds with the maya day kan pl 12 figs 10 12 14 show representations of the day corresponding to cuetzpalin in the aubin and nuttall codices these show a stout spineless species with a short thick tail and may be the gila monster heloderma horridum a large and somewhat poisonous species having much these proportions further offerings are shown in pl 12 figs 7 8 these seem to be the heads and forefeet of lizards but from the shape of the head perhaps not of iguanas in stela d of copan the uinal period glyph seems to be represented by a spineless lizard covered with scales pl 12 fig 9 froglike characteristics also appear this stone monument is remarkable from the fact that the glyphs are all more or less realistic representations of human and animal forms it should be noted that there certainly seems to be some connection between the uinal period glyph and the lizard pl 13 fig 9 represents a uinal glyph from the temple of the foliated cross at palenque and the lizard form is clearly seen in the eyebrow and the upper jaw compare also pl 13 fig 11 and pl 28 fig 3 a collection of glyphs of this period shows clearly the lizardlike character of the face that some connection existed between the lizard and the idea of rain seems clear from a reference in the relacion de la ciudad de merida 1900 p 51319 finally the lizard is shown in dresden 3a pl 12 fig 11 directly in front of god h beside the scene of human sacrifice crocodile the text figure 1 shows a dorsal view of a crocodile maya ayin carved on the top of altar t at copan the general form is considerably conventionalized with limbs elongated and provided with human hands and long toes the protuberances of the back are roughly shown by oval markings which are here continued on the legs the large scales of the ventral surfaces also appear at the sides of the body and along the posterior edges of the limbs the tail is shortened and bifurcate the most interesting portion however is the head the snout is distinctly pinched in at the base though broadened again distally in the alligator the snout is broad and tapers but little as in other representations of the crocodile the lower jaw does not appear and even in this dorsal view the artist seems to have deemed it necessary to show the row of teeth as if in side view or as though they projected laterally from the mouth what may represent ears or ear plugs are shown one on each side behind the eyes there are few other examples of full drawings of the crocodile in the maya writings dresden 74 shows an animal which has been considered to represent a crocodile or alligator but it seems to have more of the characteristics of a lizard illustration fig 1 top of altar t copan figures of a crocodile crocodilus americanus are frequent in the nuttall codex where there is one large figure of the entire animal pl 13 fig 8 making its way along under water it is shown with numerous dorsal spines a long tail and powerful claws curiously however it has no lower jaw and the same is true of the numerous glyphs representing the head of the animal this is so pronounced a characteristic that it may be doubted if the openmouthed head and the single limb shown in pl 13 fig 2 really picture the same animal though otherwise apparently referable to the crocodile in the various glyphs showing the head of this species the prominent elongate eyebrow and the absence of the lower jaw are noteworthy points while the teeth may vary in number from three to six the glyphs pl 13 figs 1 37 represent the nahua day sign cipactli corresponding to the maya day imix in the band of constellation signs in dresden 52b pl 13 fig 10 there occurs a single figure with a long curled eyebrow and lacking the lower jaw in the upper jaw three teeth are indicated a comparison of this figure with the glyphs in the nuttall codex seems to leave little doubt that it represents a crocodile this is the sign which frstemann 1906 p 206 interprets as standing for saturn pl 13 fig 12 is certainly the same sign as it stands in relatively the same position in the constellation band on dresden 53a it represents the highly conventionalized head of a crocodile on stela 10 from piedras negras maler 19011903 pl 19 the same glyph is seen the range of the alligator in north america does not extend to yucatan hence the crocodile which does occur there is taken as the original of all these figures there is nothing in the latter that would distinguish it from the alligator turtles representations of the turtle maya ak are not uncommon among the mayas at uxmal there is a ruined building called casa de las tortugas on which at intervals around the cornice there are carvings of turtles turtles of at least two species occur in the trocortesianus with one exception they seem to be limited to this codex that shown on pl 14 figs 13 5 is a large species with the dorsal scutes represented by large diamondshaped pieces there is little that might be considered distinctive about these turtles although one pl 14 fig 5 has the anterior paddles much larger than the posterior indicating a sea turtle what is doubtless the same turtle is pictured in several places in the nuttall codex in one of the figures in the latter manuscript the shell is shown apparently in use as a shield pl 14 fig 4 this would indicate one of the large sea turtles and there is not much doubt that either the loggerhead turtle thalassochelys cephalo or the hawksbill chelone imbricata is here intended quite another species is that shown in pl 14 fig 6 that this is a freshwater turtle is plainly indicated by the parasitic leeches that are noted fastened by their round suckingdiscs to the sides of its body the long neck pointed snout and apparent limitation of the dorsal spinous scutes to the central area of the back may indicate the snapping turtle chelydra serpentina or possibly a species of the genus cinosternum probably c leucostomum it is hardly likely that it is one of the true softshelled turtles trionyx as the range of that genus is not known to include mexico the turtle from nuttall 43 pl 14 fig 11 may belong to the same species as its scutes seem rather few or it may be that the view shown here is of the ventral side and that the scales indicate the small plastron of one of the sea turtles the turtle appears alone as one of the figures in the tonalamatl in several cases in the trocortesianus 13a 17a pl 14 fig 3 72b pl 14 fig 6 it is found associated with the toad appearing in the rain in trocortesianus 17b pl 14 fig 2 and alone in the rain in 13a in trocortesianus 81c pl 14 fig 5 it appears in front of an unidentifiable god schellhas has called the turtle an animal symbolical of the lightning basing his opinion as brinton 1895 p 74 tells us on dresden 40b where a human figure with animal head is holding two torches in his hands this figure does not seem to us to represent a turtle as is commonly supposed but a parrot as will be pointed out later p 343 frstemann 1902 p 27 identifies the turtle with the summer solstice as has been noted before explaining that the animal is slow of motion and is taken to represent the time when the sun seems to stand still he bases his theory 1904 p 423 in part on the fact that the sign for the maya month kayab which is the month in which the summer solstice occurs shows the face of the turtle pl 14 fig 10 this undoubtedly is correct but he seems to us wrong in classing as turtles the figure in dresden 40b pl 25 fig 1 with its accompanying glyph pl 25 fig 6 the turtle is found in connection with two sun kin signs beneath a constellation band in trocortesianus 71a resting upon his body are three cauac signs the single representation of the turtle in the dresden codex is on page 49 pl 14 fig 12 where a god is pictured with a turtles head the heavy sharp beak indicates that he represents one of the sea turtles previously mentioned he is shown transfixed by a spear and corresponds to the other figures in the lower parts of pp 4650 these all have some connection with the venus period which is considered in these pages323 a number of glyphs representing the turtle are found throughout the codices pl 14 figs 710 they are all characterized by the heavy beak it may be noted that these glyphs are virtually the same as the sign for the first a in landas alphabet as the turtle is called ak or aak in maya the reason is clear for the selection of this sign for an a sound these turtle glyphs often occur alone one however pl 14 fig 7 is found in connection with the swimming turtle in trocortesianus 17a pl 14 fig 3 figs 79 agree in having the small scrolls at the posterior end of the eye the head shown in pl 14 fig 10 has quite a different eye though otherwise similar its resemblance to the glyph on pl 25 fig 9 is marked and suggests the parrot schellhas 1904 p 44 gives in his fig 64 a glyph for the turtle which seems clearly to be a glyph for the parrot pl 25 fig 7 aves herons ardea herodias hydranassa tricolor ruficollis only a few water birds are shown in the maya works several are found however that seem to picture herons pl 15 figs 17 the best of these fig 5 a carving from the west side panel of the temple of the cross at palenque shows a crested heron standing on one foot and holding in its bill a fish a second figure pl 15 fig 1 is from the stucco ornament from the palace house b at palenque it is less carefully executed but seems to be a longnecked bird with a crest and outspread wings curiously conventionalized in the nuttall codex there is another unmistakable heron pl 15 fig 4 with the same general characteristics though the crest is less prominent here represented as a series of erectile feathers separated at their tips this elongation of the crest seems to be carried still farther in what seems to be the head and neck of a heron from dresden 37b pl 15 fig 3 with erectile feathers at intervals along its length the heron is seldom employed as a headdress in the lower chamber of the temple of the tigers at chichen itza one of the warriors wears a bird headdress pl 15 fig 2 which from the length of the bill is probably made from a herons head though the crest seems greatly exaggerated the basrelief on which this is found is strongly nahua in feeling and execution this head covering may indicate according to the nahua fashion the tribe to which the warrior belongs again in dresden 36a pl 15 fig 7 a man is shown wearing as a headdress the head and neck of a heron that holds in its bill a fish this head resembles very closely that of the heron in fig 1 what appears to be a similar head is shown in pl 15 fig 6 it is interesting to note that the heron with a fish pl 15 fig 5 from palenque also forms a part of a complicated headdress it is of course uncertain to which of the several herons occurring in central america these representations refer possibly the great blue heron ardea herodias or the louisiana heron hydranassa tricolor ruficollis is intended it seems not unlikely also that one of the white egrets may be shown as their crests are fairly conspicuous frigatebird fregata aquila we have included here two figures pl 15 figs 8 9 that undoubtedly represent a single species of bird it is characterized by a deeply forked tail and long beak which has part way on its length a circular object surrounded by a circle of dots it seems still problematical what this object may be in one figure fig 9 the beak is strongly hooked in the other fig 8 it is straight but as the latter is plainly a much more carelessly made drawing we may infer that the hooked bill is more nearly correct this would exclude the terns sterna to which stempell has referred the figures it seems probable that the frigatebird fregata aquila is the species intended as this is not only a large conspicuous form on these coasts but it has a long and strongly hooked beak and forked tail the length of the beak would probably exclude from consideration the swallowtailed kite that also occurs in the region both these birds are pictured evidently as an offering or sacrifice it is very seldom that the whole bird is represented in this connection and still more infrequent to find anything but the turkey which is the usual bird of sacrifice the figure from the dresden codex pl 15 fig 9 rests upon the usual bowl or jar that from the trocortesianus pl 15 fig 8 is pictured upon a grotesque animal head three kan signs and these upon the jar in the trocortesianus 20c 21c there occur several representations of manlike forms with very peculiar heads the latter are each provided with a beaklike projection on which appears the circle surrounded by dots noted above in connection with the frigatebird brinton concludes that this mystic symbol is a representation of the curious knob on the bill of the male white pelican and therefore identifies these curious figures as pelicans stempell follows brinton in this but considers that they are the brown pelican p fuscus since the white pelican is rare or casual as far south as yucatan unfortunately however for this supposition the brown pelican lacks the curious knob that brinton believed to be represented by the circle of dots moreover this same sign occurs on the drawings of the bills of the frigatebird and the ocellated turkey and is evidently not of specific significance to our minds it is doubtful if the figures under discussion are birds at all and we are unable to assign them a name with any degree of confidence a peculiar glyph occurs in connection with them which may be an aid to their ultimate identification brinton calls the glyph the fish and oyster sign ocellated turkey agriocharis ocellata this turkey maya kuc is an important species in the maya economy and is seen frequently in the manuscripts this is a smaller bird than the more northern true turkey meleagris and is characterized by the presence of curious erect knobs on the top of the naked head these are shown in conventionalized form in the various figures pl 16 and afford a ready means of identification on the bill of the bird shown in trocortesianus 10b pl 16 fig 2 occurs again the curious symbol a circle surrounded by dots previously noted under the frigatebird and pelican it probably has some special significance other figures of ocellated turkeys show but little in addition to the points just discussed one shown in pl 16 fig 7 from codex vaticanus 3773 however has a circular ring about the eye and the wattles are indicated as projections merely in fig 13 they are apparently shown as stalked knobs found elsewhere in connection with serpent head ornaments it is only the head in this latter figure which is considered in this interpretation in the nuttall codex there frequently occur representations of a bird that was evidently used for sacrificial purposes it is shown with erectile head feathers and a ring of circular marks about the eye pl 26 figs 12 14 pl 27 figs 23 or with concentric circles pl 27 fig 1 these figures are not surely identifiable but probably represent this turkey possibly they are the chachalaca ortalis vetula pallidiventris a gallinaceous bird commonly kept in semidomestication in mexico whose bare eye ring and slightly erectile head feathers may be represented by the drawings it is probable that this turkey is the bird represented frequently in the maya codices as a bird of sacrifice the head alone usually appears in this connection among other places in dresden 34a pl 16 fig 10 41c fig 14 29c fig 16 28c fig 17 and in trocortesianus 12b pl 16 fig 11 105b fig 12 107b fig 15 in several of these places the head is represented as resting on one or more kan signs again meaning bread as well as on the vessel or jar in dresden 26c pl 16 fig 9 the whole turkey is pictured as an offering as in the preceding case noted in dresden 35a pl 15 fig 9 the whole bird as an offering may also appear in trocortesianus 4a pl 16 fig 4 corresponding to the offering of venison and iguana on the following pages this representation of the entire bird is very rare although the fish when used as an offering is always represented as a whole and the iguana is in most cases when used in the same connection landa 1864 p 222327 confirms the offering of the heads of birds with bread it is however the sacrifice of a bird probably a turkey by decapitating that is especially interesting as the operation as shown in the dresden codex 25c pl 26 fig 2 26c 27c 28c in the rites of the four years is described in full by landa in the codex a priest is represented as holding in his hand before an altar a headless bird landa 1864 pp 212 218 224 228327 tells us that in the kan the muluc the ix and the cauac years the priests burnt incense to the idol decapitated a gallina undoubtedly a turkey and presented it to the god the turkey is also used as a headdress only in one case however trocortesianus 95c pl 16 fig 5 is the whole bird represented in this connection this is clearly of totemic significance here as it occurs in that part of the codex where birth and infant baptism are shown in many other places there are curious partial representations of bird heads in the front of headdresses which may or may not be identified as heads of turkeys among these are the headdress of god h in dresden 7c of god e in dresden 11e of god c in dresden 13b of god a in dresden 23c and a female divinity in dresden 20a pl 16 fig 13 schellhas 1904 p 43 identifies these birds as vultures that the turkey is connected with the rain seems clear this is especially the case among the nahuas in the aubin manuscript the rain god tlaloc often appears in the disguise of the turkeycock uexolotl and in the vaticanus 3773 14 the turkey pl 16 fig 7 is represented in the house of rain in contrast to the owl shown in the house of drought seler 19021903 p 75 it might be noted also that fewkes 1892 p 228 shows that the turkey is emblematic of the rain among the pueblo peoples the same idea seems to be present among the mayas as we note in the trocortesianus 10b pl 16 fig 2 the turkey is pictured in the rain and surrounded on three sides by bands of constellation signs two methods of capturing the turkey are shown in the trocortesianus 93a and 91a pl 16 figs 1 3 by the first the bird is captured alive in a sort of wicker basket which drops over it at the proper moment the second method is by the twichup or snare which consists of a noose tied to a bent sapling and properly baited in connection with pl 16 fig 1 it may be suggested that possibly this represents a cage rather than a trap in which the bird is confined the lacandones at the present time often keep their totem animals in captivity tozzer 1907 p 40 king vulture sarcorhamphus papa numerous figures of vultures appear in the codices and elsewhere indeed they are among the most common of the birds depicted two species only seem to occur in the writings the king vulture and the black vulture the former is a large black and white bird with the head and the upper part of the neck unfeathered except for numerous short almost bristlelike plumules these naked portions are often colored red and there is a large more or less squarish fleshy knob at the base of the upper ramus of the beak this conspicuous protuberance has been seized upon as a characteristic in the conventionalized figures and serves to identify the king from the black vulture in addition a series of concentric circles about the eye seems to be a rather constant mark of the king vulture though they are also sometimes found in connection with figures which from the absence of the rostral knob must represent black vultures pl 18 figs 18 27 pl 19 figs 7 10 11 in the case of the bird shown in pl 19 fig 1 the knob is hardly apparent and the same is true of pl 19 fig 13 both these may represent king vultures a remarkable figure is that shown in pl 17 fig 4 in which an ocellated turkey and a king vulture confront each other with necks intertwined the short hairlike black feathers of the head are represented in this as well as in pl 17 fig 11 and in the glyph carved in stone pl 17 fig 10 which from the presence of the knob is probably a king vulture the characteristic knob is shown in a variety of ways thus in pl 17 fig 1 it is greatly developed and resembles a large horn with a falcate tip in pl 17 fig 4 it is sharply angular and nearly square frequently it is a circle with a centered ring surmounted by one or two additional rings or terminated by a mitreshaped structure pl 17 figs 2 57 812 a very simple form was found in the carving shown in pl 17 fig 13 where a long projecting knob is seen at the base of the culmen the king vulture seems to have a part to play as a mythological being as it is pictured as a god with human body and bird head in the act of cohabiting with a woman in dresden 19a and with a dog in dresden 13c pl 17 fig 3 moreover the same vulture god is represented on a blue background and under a band of constellation signs in dresden 38b and is also to be noted in dresden 8a frstemann 1906 p 66 shows that the thirteenth day of the maya month is reached in the tonalamatl reckoning at this place this day is cib which corresponds to the nahua day cozcaquauhtli which has the meaning vulture and here as previously noted the vulture god is represented in trocortesianus 22c pl 17 fig 2 and 10a330 the king vulture appears alone in the first instance with a blue background and in the second with a background representing rain rain is also shown in connection with the vulture god in dresden 38b and the black vulture in trocortesianus 18b pl 19 fig 13 the king vulture is found employed as a headdress twice out of the three times it appears in any connection with female figures trocortesianus 26c pl 17 fig 12 with male figure and 94c pl 17 fig 11 and 95c with female figures the last two clearly have to do with the baptism and naming of infants as previously explained the study of the glyph used to indicate the vulture is interesting for we find it recurring again and again throughout the maya codices and often when there is no other drawing of the animal as in dresden 39c pl 17 fig 5 pl 18 fig 19 the first example glyph 6 is clearly the head of the king vulture whereas the second glyph 3 is probably the head of the black vulture the glyph in dresden 38b pl 17 fig 7 appears in connection with the vulture god directly below it in dresden 11b pl 18 fig 1 it occurs alone and no figure appears in the usual place below the tun period glyph pl 17 fig 10 frequently shows vulture characteristics especially in the nostril of the face the teeth however often appearing in the tun glyph would be against this theory the blending of bird and mammal characteristics is not uncommon in the maya drawings however the nahua day sign cozcaquauhtli as previously noted has the meaning vulture and we naturally find this bird frequently represented in the mexican codices in the nuttall codex the head of the king vulture occurs repeatedly as a glyph for this day in its less modified forms pl 18 figs 24 the beak is merely a pair of flattened rami surmounted proximally by the conspicuous quadrangular knob the minute hairlike feathers on the otherwise naked head are shown as a fringe at the throat and crown while a conventionalized ear is represented posteriorly a series of interesting figures pl 18 figs 510 illustrates steps in the further reduction of this head to a small glyph in which only the beak with its large squarish knob remains pl 18 fig 10 black vulture catharista urubu it is difficult to assign any single characteristic to the figures representing the black vulture maya tvsom other than the long raptorial beak a number of drawings probably depict black vultures though this cannot be certainly affirmed such are those shown in pl 18 figs 11 12 14 17 pl 19 figs 24 13 14 stempell considers the vulture shown in pl 18 fig 13 to be a king vulture but it has no knob on the beak and thus is quite likely the black vulture the fact that its head is shaped much like that of the god with the king vulture head pl 17 fig 3 would indicate merely the individuality of the artist the coloring of the species under discussion is uniformly black in the dresden and trocortesianus except in certain cases where the birds are shown in outline only as in pl 19 fig 12 it is not certain however that these two last are black vultures though they suggest the species the two birds shown in pl 19 figs 5 6 are almost surely black vultures and as represented in the manuscript are descending upon a man stempell thinks they may be ravens but this is very doubtful for the raven probably was unknown to the mayas since its range is to the northward what appears to be a crest is seen on the head of the bird in pl 19 fig 4 the black coloring and the shape of the bill otherwise suggest the black vulture though perhaps the crest would indicate the harpy eagle similarly pl 19 fig 14 is provided with a sort of tuft or crest but its general appearance is suggestive of the vulture a pottery whistle text fig 2 from the uloa valley evidently represents a black vulture the head of the bird shows the characteristic wrinkled appearance seen in the drawings with the heavy beak the absence of the rostral knob would preclude its being a king vulture illustration fig 2 pottery whistle vulture uloa valley honduras it is natural that this bird should find an important place in the maya writing as it is an abundant species in the region considered and of great importance as a scavenger the black vulture seems to lack the mythological character associated with the king vulture it appears usually in connection with death and in the role of a bird of prey this is especially true in the trocortesianus where in 24d 26d pl 19 figs 5 6 and 28c it is attacking a human being in the first and last cases represented as dead in 86a and 87a the bird is shown plucking out the eye of a man in dresden 3a pl 19 fig 7 it appears at the top of the tree above the human sacrifice and seems to be in the act of consuming the victim in trocortesianus 91c it also appears in a tree in trocortesianus 40a pl 17 fig 9 and 42a pl 19 fig 1 it is shown as eating the entrails of a deer in the first case the bird looks like a king vulture although this is the only instance where this species is shown as a bird of prey in trocortesianus 28b and 36b pl 18 fig 17 the black vulture appears eating the kan sign in the first example the kan represents the newly sowed corn in the second the kan is held by god f landa 1864 p 230333 records that in the cauac year there was a ceremony to prevent the ants and the birds devouring the corn in dresden 34b and 35b the vulture is shown on top of the headdress of god f evidently the enemy of the harvest and again on 35b pl 19 fig 4 on top of the cauac sign its role as a bird of prey is further shown in dresden 36b pl 19 fig 11 where it is shown attacking a serpent this vulture is associated with god b in dresden 69b with god m in trocortesianus 70a pl 18 fig 12 and with god d in trocortesianus 67a pl 17 fig 1 the last may be the king rather than the black vulture as suggested above the black vulture occurs only once as the usual headdress in dresden 17b pl 18 fig 13 and here in connection with a female figure and the idea of birth two birds probably vultures appear over the enclosure around the head of god c in trocortesianus 100b pl 19 fig 12 in the lower chamber of the temple of the tigers occurs a black vulture in basrelief with a necklace represented pl 19 fig 14 the glyph of the king vulture has already been discussed there are other glyphs which seem to show the black vulture although it is quite possible that no sharp distinction was made between the two in regard to the glyphs at least in one case pl 18 fig 18 the wrinkled skin of the head and neck is indicated much as in the case of the king vulture a few other glyphs are shown pl 18 figs 16 19 22 27 as well as a variety from the nuttall codex in which the minute hairlike feathers of the head are variously represented usually much exaggerated as a sort of crest or comb pl 18 fig 22 is interesting as being the only case in the maya codices where the whole figure is shown in the glyph as noted in the case of the glyphs of the king vulture the greater number of these occur quite alone they seem to indicate that a full drawing of the bird is meant to be understood as occurring below several of the carved glyphs pl 19 figs 810 show the black vulture heads in some detail with the conspicuously open nostril and hooked beak a carving of the entire bird may be shown on stela d from copan pl 28 fig 5 where the naked head and neck are marked off by lines indicating wrinkled skin the same lines on the neck of the bird depicted on pl 28 fig 2 will probably identify it as a vulture and if the square ornament above the beak certainly is part of the figure it is unquestionably the king vulture the knob is not however clearly on the birds beak there are two interesting glyphs which occur on the eastern faade of the monjas at chichen itza the glyphs in this inscription are unlike the usual maya hieroglyphs although several of the socalled constellation signs can be made out the two glyphs in question represent the entire body possibly of a vulture that on pl 17 fig 13 probably the king vulture and that on pl 18 fig 14 the black vulture harpy eagle thrasaetos harpyia in the nuttall codex what is undoubtedly the harpy eagle is of frequent occurrence this great bird is not uncommon in the forests of southern mexico and central america and must have attracted the notice of the people from its size the elongated feathers at the back of the head form a conspicuous crest a feature that characterizes this species in most of the representations a stone carving from chichen itza pl 20 fig 10 pictures a harpy eagle eating an eggshaped object and another similarly engaged is copied from the codex vaticanus 3773 pl 20 fig 14 the former is considered to be a vulture by maudslay but the presence of feathers covering the head excludes this interpretation in two stone glyphs pl 20 fig 1 3 occurs a large bird apparently devouring something held in its talons as in pl 20 fig 10 from this general resemblance it seems probable that both represent the harpy although no crests are shown on the glyphs in the dresden and the trocortesianus occur a few figures of crested birds that probably are the same species the crest feathers are reduced to two however or in some cases what may be a third projecting forward from the base of the bill pl 20 figs 5 7 12 13 the last two figures are not certainly identifiable though it is probable that they represent the harpy the eagle seems to be the bird associated with warriors in the codices seler 19001901 p 89 notes that the eagle and the jaguar are both the mark of brave warriors among the nahuas in the aubin manuscript the warrior god yaotl is always associated with the eagle quauhtli in the maya pantheon god m is usually considered the war god as he is almost always armed with a spear he is seen in dresden 74 pl 20 fig 13 and in trocortesianus 109c with an eagle as a headdress there are other gods however who wear a similar head covering god l appears in dresden 14b pl 20 fig 7 and again in 14c pl 20 fig 5 with an eagle headdress god d in dresden 23c pl 20 fig 11 has an eagle coming from a tun sign on top of his head the eagle is probably represented at the prow of a boat in dresden 43c pl 20 fig 12 in which god b is rowing in trocortesianus 88c pl 20 fig 4 a bird which may represent the eagle appears sitting on a cimi death sign above in the glyphs the character for the south is shown here clearly there is some connection between the signs of the cardinal points in the line of glyphs and the various creatures pictured below there seems to be only one glyph which can in any way be taken for that of the eagle in the maya manuscripts and this appears only once in trocortesianus 107c pl 20 fig 9 this identification may be questioned as there is no drawing of an eagle associated with the glyph attention has already been called to the two stone glyphs in pl 20 figs 1 3 there are various drawings of the glyph for the eagle in the nahua and zapotecan codices pl 20 fig 8 as the nahua day quauhtli has the meaning eagle it is interesting to note in the glyph from the nuttall codex pl 20 fig 8 the tips of the feathers are crowned with stone points a frequent way of representing birds of prey among the mexican peoples yucatan horned owl bubo virginianus mayensis stempell makes a serious mistake by confusing the eared owl shown in full face with that shown in profile in the drawings for he considers both to represent the great horned owl the figures are however quite different in every way the owl in full face view is unquestionably the great horned owl maya ikim the yucatan form of which is recognized by the subspecific title mayensis this is the bird opposed to the moanbird which as will be shown later is associated with death in pl 21 are some truly remarkable figures which seem to represent this horned owl the first modelled in stucco from palenque the second carved in stone from yaxchilan and the third carved in wood from tikal figs 1 and 3 show the bird in flight with extended wings the two erectile tufts of feathers or horns are conspicuously represented in fig 3 at either side of the birds head and between them the flat top of the crown is secondarily divided in like manner into three parts representing the horns and the top of the head the beetling brows heavy hooked beak and spread talons combine to give a fierce and spirited mien to the great bird pl 21 fig 2 may be a greatly conventionalized owl in which the essential characteristics of the bird are reproduced in a rectangular design the large bill is conspicuous in the center and in each upper corner terminates one of the ears the eyes are represented by rectangular areas at the base of the bill each with three vertical bars across it below the beak or at either side of the tip are the feet each with the claw crosshatched what seem to be the reduced and highly conventionalized wings fill the lower corner of each side of the figure the shield in the center of the tablet of the sun at palenque pl 22 fig 6 shows a face in which the motif seems to be the fullface view of the horned owl the hooked bill curves over the mouth at each side of which is the curious scroll seen in the same connection in the figures of pl 21 the ears are somewhat shorter in proportion than usual and below each at the sides of the face is a large earplug similar to that elsewhere found the eyes are still further conventionalized with a decorative scroll surrounding each another example of the conventionalized owls head is on stela 1 from cankuan maler 1908 pl 13 we are not yet ready to advance an explanation of the reason why the owl should occupy such a prominent position in the art of the mayas in only one case is the horned owl found in the maya manuscripts in trocortesianus 95c pl 22 fig 2 this owl appears as the headdress of a woman in that portion of the codex where baptism and naming are shown an owls head seems to be shown on the end of a warriors staff in the basrelief of the lower chamber of the temple of the tigers at chichen itza pl 22 fig 4 pl 22 figs 5 7 show two owls from the aubin manuscript the first is considered to be the screech owl chiqualli and the second the horned owl tecolotl in nahuatl pl 22 figs 1 3 show two drawings of owls from nahua manuscripts yucatan screech owl or moan bird otus choliba thompsoni a second species of owl is represented by the figures on pl 23 this has likewise two feathered tufts or ears on its head and is always shown with the head at least in profile but the tufts one in front the other at the back of the head the facial disc is not very prominent the beak rather long the tail short and the plumage somewhat mottled a dark ring usually surrounds the eye it is with little doubt the screech owl the only other form of eared owl commonly met with in the central american region and in yucatan is represented by the race above indicated this owl under the name of the moan bird338 is always associated with the idea of death among the mayas the familiarity of this species and its mournful quavering cry uttered at night have no doubt led to its association with death and mystery as with owls in other parts of the world this moan bird has an important place in the maya pantheon as it is the representative in many places of god a the death god it appears with a human body in dresden 7c pl 23 fig 1 10a pl 23 fig 8 and 11a pl 23 fig 3 and in trocortesianus 66a pl 23 fig 2 in each of these places it occupies the space in which one of the regular gods is usually found in dresden 10a the day reached in the tonalamatl reckoning is cimi meaning death and here as has been noted is found the moan bird the symbol of death with another sign of death in the circle just above the head of the bird pl 23 fig 8 this owl is used as a headdress itself but always for women dresden 16a pl 23 fig 19 18b pl 23 fig 5 trocortesianus 94c pl 23 fig 4 and 95c pl 23 fig 20 it occurs in both manuscripts in the pages mentioned several times before where birth baptism and the naming of children are shown the curious figure with a head similar to pl 23 fig 21 carried on the back of some of the women is the moan sign referring to the idea of death possibly to stillbirth as copulation and birth are shown in this section of the codex dresden 18c 19c the moan is found associated with man only once in the manuscripts in trocortesianus 73b pl 23 fig 18 he is found perching on a curious framelike structure in which god b is sitting there are several glyphs representing the moan bird or screech owl the first type is easily identifiable as the head of the bird is clearly pictured pl 23 figs 1114 16 this head is frequently associated with the number thirteen dresden 8b it may occur in the line of glyphs dresden 16c and refer to the moan pictured below or it may occur in the line of glyphs with no picture corresponding to it below dresden 53b pl 23 fig 15 from dresden 38c has been placed with these drawings although the identification is not certain it may refer however to the large moan head below on which god b is sitting pl 23 fig 11 the second type of glyph does not resemble in any way the moan but they are clearly signs for it as they are often found in connection with the picture of the moan dresden 7c pl 23 figs 6 7 21 and 10a in both places fig 7 is associated with the number thirteen schellhas also places pl 23 fig 17 among the moan signs illustration figs 3 4 5 6 glyphs of month muan showing moanbird characteristics one of the eighteen maya months is named muan and some of the glyphs appearing for this month in the codices certainly represent the moan or screech owl this is especially so with text figs 36 frstemann 1904a considers that the month muan and consequently the sign as well refer to the pleiades in connection with the screech owl referring to death it is interesting to note that among the nahuas the owl is considered of unlucky augury and is usually found in the house of death and of drought as contrasted with the turkey considered as a bird of good fortune and found in the house of rain copperytailed trogan or quetzal pharomacrus mocinno the quetzal is common locally in certain parts of southern mexico its brilliant metallic green plumage and the greatly elongated tail feathers make it a very notable bird the feathers of the head are erect and stand out as a light crest those of the anterior portion being slightly recurved the delicate erect feathers of the head are well indicated in vaticanus 3773 17 pl 24 fig 9 and the tail also in this figure is only slightly conventionalized with an upward instead of the natural downward sweep in most of the representations the crest feathers are indicatdtn7 by large plumes the most anterior of which project forward they may be even further modified into three knobs shown in dresden 7c pl 24 fig 1 the two characteristics of the quetzal namely its erect head feathers and its extraordinarily long tail feathers are often used separately thus the tail which is commonly drawn with the outer feather of each side strongly curled forward appears by itself in pl 24 fig 8 or it may be seen as a plume in the headdress of a priest or warrior and in other connections as an ornament a greatly conventionalized drawing of the bird is also shown in pl 24 fig 11 in which the head bears a curious knob and the dorsal feather of the tail is upcurled in the manner of the other drawings it is not at once apparent why the long drooping tail feathers should be shown thus recurved possibly these feathers when used by the mayas for plumes curled over by their own weight if held erect so that the representations are a compromise between the natural appearance and that when used as ornament in the head decoration illustration fig 7 quetzal temple of the cross palenque the color of the bird and the very long tail feathers have already been mentioned and these explain the reason of the importance of this bird among the mayas it is claimed by several old authorities that the quetzal was reserved for the rulers and that it was death for any common person to kill this bird for his own use it seems from a statement in landa 1864 p 190341 that birds were domesticated for the feathers this bird occurs again and again in various modifications throughout the maya art the feathers of the quetzal are the ones usually associated with the serpent making the rebus quetzalcoatl the feathered serpent the culture hero of the nahuas or kukulcan which has the same signification among the mayas it is impossible to mention here all the various connections in which the quetzal appears the feathers play an important part in the composition of the headdresses of the priests and warriors especially those in the stone carvings a quotation has already been given from landa showing the use made of feathers in the dress of the people text fig 7 shows perhaps the most elaborate representation of this bird it is found on the sculptured tablet of the temple of the cross at palenque the quetzal is shown seated on top of a branching tree which was long taken to represent a cross a similar representation is seen on the tablet of the temple of the foliated cross from the same ruined city in the codex fejervarymayer there are four trees in each of which there is a bird a quetzal is perched in the one corresponding to the east which is regarded as the region of opulence and moisture seler 1901 p 17 suggests that the quetzal in the tree on the two basreliefs at palenque may represent a similar idea and that temples which would show the other three trees and their respective birds had not been built in that center the representation of the quetzal as an entire bird is after all comparatively rare the most realistic drawing is seen on a jar from copan in the collections of the peabody museum the whole body of the bird is shown as a headdress in a few places in the codices where birth and the naming of children are pictured in dresden 16c pl 24 fig 3 and trocortesianus 94c pl 24 fig 6 the quetzal is the headdress of women in dresden 13b pl 24 fig 2 a partial drawing of the bird is shown as a part of the headdress of god e in dresden 7c pl 24 fig 1 of god h and in trocortesianus 110c of god f the feathers alone appear as a female head decoration in dresden 20c pl 24 fig 8 it occurs as a sacrifice among the rites of the four years in trocortesianus 36b pl 24 fig 12 in trocortesianus 70a pl 24 fig 5 it is found in the act of eating fruit growing over the young god in trocortesianus 100b pl 24 fig 4 the bird is perched over the encased head of god c there seems to be a glyph used for the quetzal in those drawn in pl 24 figs 10 17 it is noticeable that the anterior part only of the head is shown the first is a glyph from the tablet of the temple of the sun at palenque and at least suggests the quetzal by the feathers on the top of the head as also pl 24 fig 13 a glyph from copan stela 10 where the entire head appears in a much conventionalized form other glyphs are shown in pl 24 figs 1416 in which there is a single prominent recurved feather shown over the eye succeeded by a few conventionalized feathers then one or more directed posteriorly it is to be noted that whereas in many previous examples of glyphs the full drawing of the animal or bird has been found in connection with them here with the quetzal glyphs there is no instance where a drawing of the bird occurs with them a curious human figure pl 24 fig 19 with a head decoration similar to the frontal curve and markings on the quetzal glyphs fig 1416 may possibly represent this bird in some relation blue macaw ara militaris a large macaw maya mox or tut is undoubtedly pictured in the figures in pl 25 the least conventionalized drawing found is that shown in dresden 16c pl 25 fig 2 a bird characterized by long narrow tail feathers a heavy bill and a series of scalelike markings on the face and about the eye further conventionalized drawings are found in pl 25 figs 3 10 13 and pl 26 fig 1 in all these the tail is less characteristic though composed of long narrow feathers and the facial markings are reduced to a ring of circular marks about the eye these last undoubtedly represent as supposed by stempell the bare space about the eye found in certain of these large parrots in addition the space between the eye and the base of the bill is partially bare with small patches of feathers scattered at somewhat regular intervals in rows it is probable that this appearance is represented by the additional round marks about the base of the bill in pl 25 figs 1 2 5 8 the last two of which show the head only there has hitherto been some question as to the identity of certain stone carvings similar to that on stela b from copan of which a portion is shown in pl 25 fig 8 this has even been interpreted as the trunk of an elephant or a mastodon but is unquestionably a macaws beak in addition to the ornamental crosshatching on the beak which is also seen on the glyph from the same stela pl 25 fig 5 there is an ornamental scroll beneath the eye which likewise is crosshatched and surrounded by a ring of subcircular marks that continue to the base of the beak the nostril is the large oval marking directly in front of the eye the animal in dresden 40b pl 25 fig 1 has always been considered to be a tortoise schellhas 1904 p 44 and frstemann 1904 this animal together with the dog is found beneath the constellation signs carrying firebrands both are regarded as lightning beasts by comparing the head of the figure shown in pl 25 fig 1 with figs 2 4 5 of the same plate the reasonableness of the identification of this head as that of a macaw and not that of a tortoise appears clear the same figure occurs in trocortesianus 12a pl 25 fig 3 carrying a torch in order to make this point clearer we will take up the consideration of the glyphs at this place rather than at the end of the section as usual as the macaw in pl 25 fig 1 has been hitherto identified as a turtle so the glyph found in connection with it pl 25 fig 6 has been considered to stand for the turtle pl 25 fig 7 is another drawing of the same glyph by comparing the markings on the face of fig 1 it is seen that a similar ring surrounds the eye shown on the glyph the second glyph pl 25 fig 7 is better drawn and shows in addition to the eye ring the slightly erectile feathers at the back of the head comparison with the glyphs representing turtles pl 14 figs 710 hitherto confused with these macaw glyphs shows differences the most important of which are of course the eye ring and the feathers at the back of the head various other glyphs occur which undoubtedly represent the heads either of macaws or smaller parrots they are for the most part glyphs from the stone inscriptions a crest resembling that depicted on the head of the quetzal is found on a glyph on altar q from copan pl 25 fig 10 the eye ring however seems to indicate the macaw which also has slightly erectile feathers on the head much doubt is attached to the identification of the glyph of the month kayaetn8 from stela a quirigua pl 25 fig 9 it resembles closely the glyphs of the turtle pl 14 figs 79 and especially that on pl 14 fig 10 the quirigua glyph has a prominent fleshy tongue however like the parrot from the fact that the glyph is certainly that for the month kayab and the kayab glyphs in the codices pl 14 fig 10 resemble the sign for a in the landa alphabet which seems to stand for ak turtle we are led to identify this as a turtle rather than a parrot the use of the macaw as a lightning beast has already been commented upon the parrot is also used in the codices as a headdress as with several other birds the only places in the manuscripts where the whole bird is shown is in connection with the bearing of children and the baptism here the parrot headdress is seen on women dresden 16c pl 25 fig 2 and trocortesianus 94c pl 25 fig 13 there seems to be an exception to the whole bird appearing as a headdress exclusively with women in trocortesianus 26c pl 26 fig 1 where god f appears with a headdress composed of the whole bird the bird is also seen as a headdress on altar q from copan pl 26 fig 3 the head of the macaw appears as part of the headdress of god h in dresden 11a pl 26 fig 13 god e in dresden 11b pl 26 fig 11 god f in dresden 14b god d in trocortesianus 89a pl 26 fig 5 and of women in dresden 12b pl 26 fig 6 and 19a pl 26 fig 9 in the rites of the four years in trocortesianus 37b there are two birds which are quite different from those we have been considering but which may represent macaws pl 25 fig 12 pl 26 fig 10 in the nuttall codex occur several figures of heavybilled birds that may be macaws or other smaller parrots of the genera amazona or pachyrhynchus they are not however certainly identifiable pl 26 figs 4 7 imperial woodpecker campephilus imperialis we have here introduced two drawings from the nuttall codex pl 27 figs 5 6 which seem to represent the imperial ivorybilled woodpecker a large species that occurs in the forests of certain parts of mexico the figures show a longbilled bird with acutely pointed tail feathers a red crest and otherwise black and white plumage the red crest of the woodpecker is of course highly conventionalized in the drawings where it is shown as of a number of erect feathers instead of the prominent occipital tuft of this bird the crest and particularly the pointed tail feathers and long beak combined with the characteristic coloring seem to leave little doubt as to the identity of the species figured this bird does not seem to appear in the maya drawings raven corvus corax sinuatus there occurs in the nuttall codex a figure of a large black bird pl 27 fig 7 which may be a black vulture but which from the presence of what appear as prominent bristles over the nostril may also be a raven these bristles are rather prominent in ravens and quite lacking in the vulture so that we are led to identify the drawing as representing the former bird we have found no other figures that suggest ravens miscellaneous birds four drawings of birds from the aubin manuscript are shown here pl 27 figs 811 in order that the conventionalization of the bird form may be seen the first two are supposed to represent the parrot cocho and the last two the turkey cock uexolotl there is little in the drawings by which they can be differentiated in the codex the heads of the parrots are colored red there is no doubt however about the identification as they occur in the same relative position on every page of the manuscript and are two of the thirteen birds associated with the thirteen gods the lords of the house of day seler 19001901 pp 3135 from the foregoing it may be seen that where there is no question about the identification the drawing of the bird form is rather carelessly done and no great attempt is made to indicate the special characteristics of the different birds as has been shown previously it is not always possible to identify without question many of the forms appearing in the manuscripts this is especially true with birds in trocortesianus 20c an unidentifiable bird painted blue appears on the top of the staff carried by god f the headdress of this same god in trocortesianus 27c is a bird form and in trocortesianus 55b the tonalamatl figure is a bird whose identity cannot be made out with certainty mammalia opossum didelphis yucatanensis d mesamericana figures representing opossums are not with certainty identifiable in the maya writings we have provisionally identified as a frog the animal shown in pl 29 fig 6 although at first sight the two median round markings might be taken to represent a marsupial pouch stempell considers the animals found in the upper division of dresden 2528 as opossums of one of the above species and this seems very possible they are shown with long tails slightly curved at the tips and with long head and prominent vibrissae a rather similar figure is found in the nuttall codex pl 34 fig 7 there is nothing however that seems to preclude their being dogs and in our opinion they represent this animal ninebanded armadillo tatu novemcinctum this is the common species of armadillo maya wetvs found throughout the warmer portion of mexico and central america where it is frequently used as an article of food and its shelllike covering is utilized in various ways several representations of it occur in the trocortesianus pl 29 figs 14 where it is characterized by its scaly covering long ears and tail and the moveable bands about the body this animal is associated with the bee culture as it is represented twice in trocortesianus 103a pl 29 figs 1 3 seated below a bee under an overhanging roof the hunting scenes in the trocortesianus also show the armadillo in 48a pl 29 fig 4 and in 91a it is shown in a pitfall in the last case the cauac signs are clearly seen on top of the trap whereas in the former case the same signs seem to be indicated by the crosses finally this same animal occurs seated in trocortesianus 92d pl 29 fig 2 facing a female figure there seems to be no glyph used in connection with this animal yucatan brocket mazama pandora among the numerous representations of deer in the maya writings there is but one that appears to show the brocket this occurs in trocortesianus 92a pl 30 fig 2 where a hoofed animal with a single spikelike horn is shown seemingly impaled on a stake set in the bottom of a pitfall as stated by stempell this animal from the character of its horns is probably to be identified as a brocket though there is nothing to preclude its being a young spike buck of some species of odocoileus yucatan deer odocoileus yucatanensis o thomasi several species of small deer maya ke occur in mexico and central america whose relationships are not yet thoroughly understood pls 3032 the species of yucatan and southern mexico have small lyrate antlers with few short tines rather different from the broader type of the more northern species with well developed secondary tines the former type of antlers seems to be indicated by the conventionalized structure shown in pl 32 figs 812 these probably represent the yucatan deer or its ally thomass deer of southern mexico two of the figures both from the nuttall codex show the lower incisor teeth pl 32 figs 8 11 though in other cases these are omitted the larger part of the figures of deer represent the does which have no antlers for this reason it is impossible to distinguish females of the brocket from those of the other species of deer if indeed the mayas themselves made such a distinction the characteristics of deer drawings are the long head and ears the prominently elevated tail with the hair bristling from its posterior side the characteristic position of the tail when the deer is running the hoofs and less often the presence of incisors in the lower jaw only and of a curious oblong mark at each end of the eye possibly representing the large tear gland the deer plays a large part in the maya ceremonials it is an important perhaps the most important animal offering as a sacrifice to the gods several pages of the trocortesianus 3849 are given over to the hunt and the animal usually represented is the deer the hunters are shown the methods of trapping the return from the chase and the rites in connection with the animals slain trocortesianus 48b pl 30 fig 1 shows the usual method of trapping where the deer is caught by a cord around one of the fore legs trocortesianus 91a pictures the same method and 92a pl 30 figs 2 shows where the deer is caught on a spike in another type of trap in trocortesianus 86a pl 31 fig 5 the deer appears with a rope around his body held by a god who is not easily identified interesting descriptions of the hunt are given in several of the early accounts349 it will be noted that the hunt was usually connected with the religious rites and the offering of deer meat and various parts of the body of the deer had a ceremonial importance attention is called to similar practices among the lacandones the inhabitants of the region of the usumacinta at the present time tozzer 1907 where the greater part of the food of the people must first of all be offered to the gods before it may be eaten by the natives the figures of the deer in the codices are clearly associated with god m and the latter may be considered a god of the hunt as well as a god of war it is very unusual to find a quadruped used as a headdress in any way and yet in several cases we find god m has the head of a deer as a sort of head covering trocortesianus 50b pl 31 fig 6 51c pl 31 fig 7 and 68b in the first two cases the god seems to be supplied with a bow and arrow in a passage in landa 1864 p 290350 there is a description of this very scene in the month zip the hunters each took an arrow and a deers head which was painted blue thus adorned they danced god m is found in one case in the dresden in connection with the deer in dresden 13c the animal is represented as female and is shown in intercourse with god m an offering of venison is frequently pictured in the manuscripts landa 1864 p 220350 also furnishes a parallel for this the haunches of venison arranged as offerings in dishes are realistically seen in a number of representations of religious rites as in dresden 28c pl 31 fig 14 in the last of the rites of the dominical days 35a pl 31 fig 12 and in trocortesianus 5a above the serpent enclosing the body of water 65a in front of god b or d and 105b pl 31 fig 13 and 108a pl 31 fig 15 both of which are in connection with the bee ceremonies the head of the deer rather than the legs is also shown as an offering in trocortesianus 69b with god b and trocortesianus 78 pl 31 fig 10 in the line of glyphs the whole deer may be represented as an offering in trocortesianus 2b pl 31 fig 8351 there are some examples in the manuscripts where the deer is pictured quite apart from any idea of the hunt or an offering in trocortesianus 14b it is shown on top of the body of one of the large snakes and in trocortesianus 29c pl 31 fig 3 it appears seated on the end of a snakelike curve the deer occurs in trocortesianus 30b pl 30 fig 6 in connection with the goddess from whose breasts water is flowing god b appears in dresden 41c pl 31 fig 1 seated on a red deer the same animal is also to be noted in dresden 60a pl 30 fig 5 in connection with the combat of the planets351 a deer is seen in trocortesianus 92d seated on a mat opposite a female figure in the same manner as the armadillo on the same page and a dog on the preceding page these as previously noted probably refer to cohabitation on pl 32 fig 9 is a deer from the peresianus and pl 32 fig 12 shows another from stela n east from copan the nahua day maatl signifies deer and we naturally find a large number of glyphs representing this animal among the day signs in the mexican manuscripts pl 31 fig 9 pl 32 figs 8 10 11 yucatan peccary tayassu angulatum yucatanense t ringens peccaries maya qeqem of the t angulatum group are common in mexico and yucatan and a number of local forms have been named the whitelipped peccaries also occur but in the figures it is impossible to distinguish the species these animals are characterized by their prominent snout curly tail bristling dorsal crest and rather formidable tusks as well as by the possession of hoofs by these marks most of the figures are readily identifiable pl 32 fig 1 pl 33 figs 1 2 46 9 the tail is however often omitted as well as the erect line of bristles down the back the presence of hoofs and the possession of a truncated piglike snout are sufficiently characteristic in the dresden codex occur several figures of undoubted peccaries two of these are pictured in pl 32 figs 2 4 in each the hoofs and curly tail appear and in the latter figure the bristling back is conventionally drawn by a series of serrations these marks are sufficient to identify the animals their heads are further conventionalized however by a great exaggeration of the snout beyond that slightly indicated in pl 32 fig 1 and pl 33 figs 6 9 other representations of the peccary are shown in pl 32 fig 5 a man with a peccarys head and fig 7 in which the animals hoofs are replaced by human hands and feet in both cases the form of the head remains characteristic a curious combination is shown in pl 32 fig 3 an animal whose head and fore feet are those of a peccary while the hind feet have five toes and there is a long tail the addition of what look like scales is found in a figure from the dresden pl 32 fig 6 the peccary is found in several different connections in the manuscripts as deer are found associated with the hunt so but to a much more limited extent the peccary it is represented pictured as being captured in snares of the familiar jerkup type similar drawings show this animal caught by the foreleg and held partially suspended trocortesianus 49a pl 33 fig 9352 49c pl 33 fig 1 and 93a pl 33 fig 4 trocortesianus 41b also shows the peccary associated with hunting scenes another realistic drawing of this animal in dresden 62 pl 33 fig 6352 represents him as seated on the open jaws of a serpent connected with a long number series we are unable to explain the signification of the appearance of the animal in this connection the peccary is pictured in trocortesianus 27b pl 33 fig 5 seated on the left hand of the goddess from whose breasts water is flowing the peccary seems to be associated with the sky as it is seen in a conventionalized form in four instances dresden 44b 45b pl 32 fig 4tn9 coming from a band of constellation signs and in dresden 68a pl 32 fig 2 coming from a similar band with god e sitting underneath353 above each of these conventionalized figures occur the corresponding glyph forms pl 33 figs 7 8 which show merely the head with the exaggerated upturned snout there is a striking resemblance between these snouts and those of the stone masklike figures so frequently represented as a faade decoration in northern yucatan the presence in the mouths of the faces there represented of a recurved tusk in addition to other teeth is a further resemblance to the drawings of peccaries stempell 1908 p 718 has reproduced a photograph of these extraordinary carvings and considers them the heads of mastodons apparently solely on account of the shape of the upturned snout whose tip in many of the carvings turns forward they certainly do not represent the heads of mastodons but we are not ready to say that the peccary is the prototype of these carvings although the similarity between the glyphs pl 33 figs 7 8 and the masks is worthy of note one point which does not favor this explanation is the fact that on the eastern faade of the monjas at chichen itza where the masklike panel is seen at its best we find a realistic drawing of a peccary pl 33 fig 2 on the band of glyphs over the doorway and it in no way suggests the head on the panel and is quite different from the head already noted as the glyph of the peccary in the codices bairds tapir tapirella bairdi no undoubted representations of tapirs occur in the manuscripts here considered possibly tapirs did not live in the country occupied by the maya peoples at the present time they are found only to the south of yucatan in central america bairds and dows tapirs are native the latter however more on the pacific coast we have included a drawing of an earthenware vessel pl 28 fig 1 that represents a tapir about whose neck is a string of oliva shells the short prehensile trunk of the tapir is well made and the hoofs are likewise shown a greatly elongated nose is found in many of the drawings of the deities but it does not seem clear that these represent trunks of tapirs or as suggested by stempell mastodons two such heads are shown in pl 39 figs 7 9 these offer a considerable superficial resemblance to that of a tapir but as no other drawings that might be considered to represent this animal are found it seems very questionable if the long noses are other than parts of grotesque masks the superficial resemblance of the curious nose pieces of the masks on the panel of the maya faades to elephants trunks does not seem to us especially significant as otherwise the carvings are quite unlike elephants they have no great tusks as an elephant should but instead short recurved teeth similar to those representing peccary tusks as already pointed out rabbit sylvilagus or lepus rabbits and hares from their familiarity their long ears and their peculiar method of locomotion seem always to attract the notice of primitive peoples several species occur in mexico including the marsh rabbit sylvilagus truei s insonus various races of the cottontail rabbit s floridanus connectens s f chiapensis s f yucatanicus s aztecus s orizabae etc and several jack rabbits lepus alleni pallitans l callotis flavigularis l asellus it is of course quite impossible to determine to which of these species belong the few representations found several drawings shown in pl 30 figs 3 4 7 8 are at once identifiable as rabbits from their long ears round heads and the presence of the prominent gnawing teeth354 in two of the figures pl 30 figs 7 8 the entire animal is shown sitting erect on its haunches the first with one ear in advance of the other a trait more characteristic of the jack rabbit than of the shorteared rabbits for convenience of comparison we have placed beside these two figures one of a deer in much the same position it is at once distinguished however by its long head longer bushy tail and by the marks at each end of the eye what at first sight appear to be two gnawing teeth of the rabbit seem to be the incisors of the lower jaw this is the animal identified by stempell as a dog the animal shown to be a rabbit in dresden 61 pl 30 fig 8 is pictured seated on the open jaws of a serpent in the same way as the peccary on the following page these two animals together with two representations of god b and the black god dresden 61 are each clearly connected with the serpents on which they are sitting the nahua day tochtli signifies rabbit and naturally the animal occurs throughout the mexican manuscripts as representing this day pl 30 figs 3 4 other rodents we have included in pl 29 figs 5 7 8 three undetermined mammals the second of these is characterized by the two prominent gnawing teeth of a rodent and by its long tail it may represent a pack rat neotoma of which many species are described from mexico in its rounded ears and long tail fig 5 somewhat resembles fig 7 but it lacks the gnawing incisors still less satisfactory is fig 8 from trocortesianus 24d at whose identity it seems unsafe to hazard a guess it is shown as eating the corn being sowed by god d jaguar felis hernandezi f h goldmani throughout its range the jaguar maya balam or tvsakmul is the most dreaded of the carnivorous mammals it is therefore natural that the mayas held it in great awe and used it as a symbol of strength and courage a few characteristic figures are shown in pl 34 figs 13 pl 35 figs 514 the species represented is probably felis hernandezi the mexican race of jaguar or one or the other of the more or less nominal varieties named from central america the distinguishing mark of the jaguar in addition to the general form with the long tail short ears and claws is the presence of the rosettelike spots these are variously conventionalized as solid black markings as small circles or as a central spot ringed by a circle of dots pl 35 fig 12 frequently the solid black spots are used either in a line down the back and tail or scattered over the body the tip of the tail is characteristically black and the teeth are often prominent such a figure as this pl 35 fig 10 stempell considers to be a water opossum chironectes for the reason that it is held by the goddess from whose breast water is flowing this can hardly be however for not only are the markings unlike those of the water opossum but the large canine tooth indicates a large carnivore moreover the water opossum is a small animal hardly as big as a rat of shy and retiring habits and so is unlikely to figure in the drawings of the mayas as for the significance of the jaguar in the life of the mayas it may be said that this animal seems to have played a most prominent part at chichen itza the building on top of the southern end of the eastern wall of the ball court usually called the temple of the tigers has a line of jaguars carved in stone as frieze around the outside of the building and in the lower chamber of the same structure the figure of a jaguar maudslay iii pl 43 serves as an altar the front legs and the head of a jaguar often are seen as the support of a seat or altar on which a god is represented as at palenque in the palace house e maudslay iv pl 44 and in the temple of the beau relief holmes 18951897 pl 20 altar f at copan pl 35 fig 7 shows the same idea the head of a puma or jaguar pl 34 fig 6 appears in the basrelief of the lower chamber of the temple of the tigers evidently representing a part of an altar a realistic carving of a jaguar was found on a stone near the temple of the cones at chichen itza maudslay iii pl 52 fig a and another occurs near the present hacienda of chichen itza carved in relief on a ledge of rock in the maya manuscripts the jaguar appears in a number of connections its mythological character is shown in dresden 8a pl 35 fig 5 where it is pictured as the tonalamatl figure the day reached here in the reckoning is ix and this corresponds to the nahua oceolotl which means jaguar in dresden 26 in the pages showing the ceremonies of the years the jaguar is carried on the back of the priest evidently representing one of the year bearers ti cuch haab balam the name of the jaguar is the title given to the four bacabs or chacs the gods of the four cardinal points in trocortesianus 64a two jaguar heads are noted as the end of curious bands of caban signs over a flaming pot the second one is shown as dead a jaguar head is employed in two places in the trocortesianus 34a and 36a as a headdress for a god who is in the act of sowing corn this animal appears very infrequently in the pages of the trocortesianus given over to the hunting scenes 41c 40c 43b and even here it never appears in the same way as the deer and peccary as an animal for sacrifice the jaguar as a predacious beast is noted in trocortesianus 28b pl 35 fig 8 where it is attacking god f in a similar way as the vultures in the preceding picture the jaguar appears in trocortesianus 30b pl 35 fig 10 seated on the right hand of the goddess from whose breasts water is flowing the figure in trocortesianus 12b between the various offerings may be a jaguar or a dog more probably from its connection with an offering the dog a curious modification of the jaguar may be shown in trocortesianus 20a pl 34 fig 2 where a god is seated on the gaping jaws of some animal whose identity is uncertain it may be a serpent although the blacktipped tail from which the head appears to come certainly suggests the jaguar there are several carved glyphs in stone that probably represent jaguars two of these pl 28 fig 4 pl 35 fig 9 have the characteristic round spots but others are unmarked and suggest the jaguar by their general character only pl 35 fig 6 this latter may of course represent the puma quite as well a realistic jaguar head appears as a glyph in trocortesianus 2a pl 35 fig 13 the more usual glyph for the jaguar is more highly conventionalized although the spots and the short rounded ear are still characteristic pl 35 fig 11 a slight modification of this glyph appears in dresden 8a in connection with the full drawing of the animal below the nahua day oceolotl as already noted means jaguar and the jaguar glyph is found among the day signs pl 34 fig 3 seler 1904 p 379 associates the jaguar in the vaticanus and the bologna with tezcatlipoca he notes that the second age of the world in which the giants lived and in which tezcatlipoca shone as the sun is called the jaguar sun tezcatlipoca is supposed to have changed himself into a jaguar puma felis bangsi costaricensis as shown by stempell there can be little doubt that some one of the mainly nominal species of central american puma is represented in dresden 47 pl 34 fig 7 this animal is colored reddish in the original as is the puma is without spots although the tip of the tail as in the pictures of the jaguar is black the animal is represented as being transfixed with a spear358 another animal colored red in dresden 41c seems to represent a puma god b is shown seated upon him a crude figure from the painted chamber of the temple of the tigers pl 34 fig 5 is probably the same species of puma the cleverly executed head shown in profile in pl 34 fig 6 is also perhaps the same animal although it may possibly represent the jaguar one or the other of these two cats is also intended in pl 34 fig 4 a drawing of a piece of pottery coyote canis two figures from the nuttall codex have been included as possibly representing coyotes pl 35 figs 1 2 they are chiefly characterized by their prominent ears and bristling hair and seem to be engaged in active combat coyotes of several species occur in mexico and though not generally regarded as aggressive animals are of a predacious nature no drawings of the coyote have been noted in the maya codices dog canis the dog maya peq evidently played an important part in the life of the mayas as it does with other races of men generally on pls 36 37 we have included certain figures of dogs from several manuscripts these may represent two breeds for it is well known that both a hairy and a hairless variety were found by the early discoverers in mexico359 hairiness is more or less clearly indicated in the following figurespl 36 figs 17 12 pl 37 figs 4 5 the figures of dogs usually agree in having a black mark about the eyes that frequently is produced as a downward curved tongue from the posterior canthus sometimes as in pl 37 figs 13 10 this tongue is not blackened commonly also black patches are elsewhere distributed on the body generally on the back these markings are probably the patches of color separated by white areas that occur frequently in dogs or other animals after long domestication359 we have included among the figures of dogs two in which the eye is differently represented and which are unspotted pl 37 figs 4 6 these modifications may have some special significance but otherwise the animals appear most closely to represent dogs we have already suggested that the animal attired in mans clothing and walking erect in dresden 25a28a is likewise a dog though stempell believes it to represent the opossum in support of which he calls attention to its prominent vibrissae and slightly curled tail the dog played a large part in the religion both of the mayas and the mexican peoples it was connected especially with the idea of death and destruction the lacandones of the present time make a small figure of a dog to place on the grave tozzer 1907 p 47 this is but one of the many survivals of the ancient precolumbian religion found among this people the dog was regarded as the messenger to prepare the way to the other world seler 19001901 pp 8283 gives an interesting parallel of the nahua idea of the dog and his connection with death he paraphrases sahagun as follows the native mexican dogs barked wagged their tails in a word behaved in all respects like our own dogs were kept by the mexicans not only as house companions but above all for the shambles and also in yucatan and on the coast land for sacrifice the importance that the dog had acquired in the funeral rites may perhaps have originated in the fact that as the departed of both sexes were accompanied by their effects the prince by the women and slaves in his service so the dog was assigned to the grave as his masters associate friend and guard and that the persistence of this custom in course of time created the belief that the dog stood in some special relation to the kingdom of the dead it may also be that simply because it was the practice to burn the dead the dog was looked on as the fire gods animal and the emblem of fire the natives got accustomed to speak of him as the messenger to prepare the way in the kingdom of the dead and thus eventually to regard him as such at the time when the spaniards made their acquaintance it was the constant practice of the mexicans to commit to the grave with the dead a dog who had to be of a redyellow color and had a string of unspun cotton round his neck and was first killed by the thrust of a dart in his throat the mexicans believed that four years after death when the soul had already passed through many dangers on its way to the underworld it came at last to the bank of a great river the chicunauhapan which encircled the underworld proper the souls could get across this river only when they were awaited by their little dog who recognizing his master on the opposite side rushed into the water to bring him over sahagun 3 appendix chap 1 as might be expected from the foregoing there are abundant evidences in the manuscripts of the presence of the dog in the various religious rites and especially those which have to do with the other world the kingdom of the dead in trocortesianus 35b 36b 37a 37b the pages showing the rites of the four years the dog appears in various attitudes in 35b and 36b it bears on his back the imix and kan signs in 37a pl 37 fig 8 it is shown as beating a drum and singing in 37b pl 36 fig 2 it is beside a bowl containing kan signs in all of these places the dogs seem to be represented among the various birds and animals which are to be sacrificed for the new years landa 1864 p 216361 states that in the kan year a dog was sacrificed in the muluc year landa 1864 p 222361 records that they offered dogs made of clay with bread upon their backs and a perrito which had black shoulders and was a virgin it has already been noted that two of the dogs represented in trocortesianus 35b and 36b have a kan and imix sign fastened to the back moreover we have also pointed out that the kan sign frequently seems to have the meaning of maize or bread it will be noted that in trocortesianus 36b two human feet are shown on each of which is a doglike animal361 these may indicate the dance in which dogs were carried as noted by landa cogolludo 1688 p 184361 also mentions a similar dance still another reference in landa 1864 p 260362 mentions that in the months muan and pax dogs were sacrificed to the deities reference has already been made to the identification of the four priests at the top of dresden 2528 as having the heads of dogs rather than of opossums it may be suggested that in the rle of the conductor to the other world the dog is represented as carrying on his back in each case the year which has just been completed and therefore is dead this of course would necessitate the identification of god b the jaguar god e and god a as representing in turn the four years the dog according to sahaguns account p 360 was looked upon as the fire gods animal and as an emblem of fire this idea is seen frequently in the maya manuscripts where the dog with firebrands in his paws or attached to his tail is coming head downward from a line of constellation signs as in dresden 36a pl 37 fig 3 40b pl 37 fig 1 or is standing beneath similar signs as in dresden 39a pl 37 fig 2 and probably in trocortesianus 13a his tail alone has the firebrand in trocortesianus 36b firebrands are carried by figures which have been identified by us as dogs in trocortesianus 24c pl 37 fig 6 25c and 90a here the animal is represented as in the air holding his firebrands over a blazing altar beside which god f is seated in two out of the four cases f is shown as dead the dog in these latter examples has his eye composed of the akbal sign this same glyph can also be made out with difficulty on the forehead of the dog shown in dresden 36a pl 37 fig 3 as has been noted akbal means night and possibly death as well it is certain that destruction is indicated in the preceding examples as well as in trocortesianus 87a and 88a pl 37 fig 4 where the dog is holding four human figures by the hair beyer 1908 pp 419422 has identified the dog as the pleiades and various other suggestions have been made that the dog represents some constellation the more common form of spotted dog is shown as a single tonalamatl figure in trocortesianus 25d and 27d pl 36 fig 14 and an unspotted variety in dresden 7a pl 37 fig 10 the dog is frequently shown as copulating with another animal or with a female figure in dresden 13c pl 37 fig 7 the second figure is a vulture in dresden 21b pl 37 fig 5 it is a woman and also in trocortesianus 91c pl 36 fig 12 the same animal appears also in a number of scenes not included in the preceding in trocortesianus 88c pl 36 fig 1 a dog is seated on a crab and seems to be connected with the idea of the north as this sign is noted above the figure in trocortesianus 66b pl 36 fig 3 a dog and another animal pl 32 fig 3 are seated back to back under a shelter in trocortesianus 30b a dog is seated on the right foot of the woman from whose breasts water is streaming in dresden 29a pl 37 fig 12 god b is shown seated on a dog and finally in dresden 30a pl 37 fig 9 god b holds the bound dog by the tail over an altar the dog appears from numerous references to be used in connection with a prayer for rain comargo 1843 in his history of tlaxcallan states that when rain failed a procession was held in which a number of hairless dogs were carried on decorated litters to a place devoted to their use there they were sacrificed to the god of water and the bodies were eaten the glyphs associated with the dog are interesting as we have as in the case with the deer one showing a realistic drawing of a dogs head in trocortesianus 91d pl 37 fig 13 and several others far more difficult of interpretation pl 37 fig 11 seems to stand for the dog as it is found in several places where the dog appears below dresden 21b 40b it is thought by some to represent the ribs of a dog which appear in somewhat similar fashion in pl 37 fig 8 some of the glyphs in the codices for the month kankin show the same element text figs 810 illustration figs 8 9 10 glyphs for maya month kankin ribs of dog the nahua day sign itzcuintli signifies dog and corresponds to the maya oc pl 36 figs 911 this in turn is considered by many to stand for the dog as the animal of death and signifies the end the sore cropped ears of the domesticated dog are supposed to be represented in this sign oc nahua and other day signs for itzcuintli dog are shown in pl 36 figs 4 6 13 bear ursus machetes u horriaeus in northern mexico in chihuahua and sonora occur a black bear ursus machetes and the sonoran grizzly u horriaeus it is unlikely that the mayas had much acquaintance with these animals since they range more to the northward than the area of maya occupation stempell has identified as a bear a figure in dresden 37a pl 35 fig 3 this represents a creature with the body of a man walking erect but with the head apparently of some carnivorous mammal as shown by the prominent canine tooth this appears as a tonalamatl figure the resemblance to a bear is not very clear less doubt attaches to the figure shown in pl 35 fig 4 which seems almost certainly to depict a bear the stout body absence of a tail the plantigrade hind feet and stout claws all seem to proclaim it a bear of one of the two species above mentioned this picture is found in connection with one of the warriors shown in the basrelief of the lower chamber of the temple of the tigers at chichen itza it seems clearly to designate the figure in much the same way as figures are named in the mexican writings ie by having a glyph showing this nearby attention has already been called to the fact that here at chichen itza and especially on this basrelief there is much which shows a strong influence from the north the two figures in trocortesianus 43a are probably bears frstemann 1902 p 68 considers that they are men masked as chacs or bacabs leafnosed bat vampyrus spectrum artibeus jamaicensis or phyllostomus hastatus panamensis several remarkably diabolical representations of bats maya soc usually written zotz occur among the maya remains these all show the prominent nose leaf distinguishing the family phyllostomatidae and as the mayas probably used the largest and most conspicuous of the native species for artistic representation it is likely that some one of the three species above mentioned is the one here shown illustration figs 11 12 13 14 glyphs for maya month zotz bats the bat had a place in the maya pantheon one of the months of the maya year zotz was named after this animal and the glyph for this month shows the characteristic nasal appendage this is to be seen more clearly in the glyphs selected from the stone inscriptions pl 38 figs 1 2 46 than in those from the codices text figs 1114 although the nose leaf is still visible in the latter the day sign akbal night occurs as the eye in the figures from the manuscripts a carving showing the whole body of the bat is used as a glyph in stela d from copan pl 38 fig 3 this may also represent the bat god who is associated with the underworld the god of the caverns this god is pictured on the vase of chama pl 38 fig 7 figured by dieseldorff 1904 pp 665666 and by gordon 1898 pl iii seler 1904a has discussed the presence of this god among the mayas the zapotecs and the nahuas the bat does not seem to occur in the maya manuscripts as a god although there are glyphs which seem to refer to this god dresden 17b as pointed out by seler when there is no other representation of this deity no doubt in the times of the maya civilization these bats haunted the temples by day as they do now and thus became readily endowed with a religious significance illustration fig 15 pottery whistle ape from uloa valley honduras capuchin monkey cebus capucinusc hypoleucus aucttn10 with the possible exception of one or two figures monkeys maya maavs or baac are not represented in the maya codices examined in trocortesianus 88c pl 39 fig 4 occurs a curious nondescript animal with what seem to be hoofs on the forefeet a somewhat bushy tail of moderate length and a head that appears to be distinctly bonneted somewhat as in the representations of the capuchin stempell regards this as a monkey though recognizing that the short bushy tail is unlike that of any central american species the figure seems quite as likely a peccary or possibly a combination of a deer with some other animal a glyph pl 39 fig 5 found directly above the figure just referred to suggests a monkey though it cannot be surely identified a pottery whistle from the uloa valley text fig 15 shows two monkeys standing side by side with a posterior extension for the mouth piece their heads are shaped as in other representations of this monkey with a distinct cap or bonnet and facial discs a pottery stamp from the same locality shows a monkey with a long tail gordon 1898 pl 11 fig f it recalls the drawings of monkeys given by strebel 1899 pls 14 in the nuttall codex are numerous heads and a few other figures of a monkey which from the erect hair of the crown curling tail and distinctly indicated facial area must be the common bonneted or capuchin monkey of central america this species does not occur in yucatan what is undoubtedly the same animal is shown as a head glyph in pl 39 fig 8 from the aubin manuscript the identifications of the headforming glyphs in the nuttall and the aubin manuscripts are certainly correct as the nahua day sign oomatli means ape illustration figs 16 17 18 19 glyphs for maya day chuen text figs 1619 show some of the signs for the day chuen from the maya codices this is the day corresponding to the day oomatli of the nahuas there is little resembling an ape in the maya signs although it has been remarked that the sign may show the open jaws and teeth of this animal frstemann 1897 as noted by schellhas 1904 p 21 alludes to the fact that the figure of god c which occurs also in the sign for the north in the tonalamatl in dresden 4a10a occurs in the day chuen of the maya calendar and this corresponds to the day oomatli the ape in the nahua calendar this would suggest a connection between god c and the ape and this may be seen in the glyphs for god c text figs 2024 frstemann sees an ape whose lateral nasal cavity peculiar to the american ape or monkey is occasionally represented plainly in the hieroglyph picture he also associates god c with the constellation of ursa minor illustration figs 20 21 22 23 24 glyphs of god c it will be seen from the detailed examination of the fauna shown in the codices that after all a comparatively small part of the animal life of the country occupied by the maya speaking peoples is represented the drawings in some cases are fairly accurate so that there is little difficulty in determining the species intended by the artist at other times it is hazardous to state the exact species to which the animal belongs it is only in a comparatively small number of cases however that there is any great doubt attached to the identification it will be noted that the drawings of the dresden manuscript are much more carefully and accurately done than those of the trocortesianus a greater delicacy and a more minute regard for detail characterize the dresden drawings in general in the animals selected for reproduction by the mayas only those were taken which were used either in a purely religious significance for their mythological character and here naturally there is to be noted an anthropomorphic tendency or animals were chosen which were employed as offerings to the many different gods of the maya pantheon the religious character of the whole portrayal of animal life in the codices is clearly manifest and it is this side of the subject which will come out more clearly as the manuscripts are better known footnotes 300 quoted in thomas 1882 pp 115 116 300 en el mes de tzoz se aparejavan los seores de las colmenares para celebrar su fiesta en tzec 301 en este mes mol

serpent is shown behind a low altar 317 frstemann 1906 p 15 agrees with schellhas that this may be a rebus for the name quetzalcoatl or kukulcan as the bird is a vulture rather than a quetzal this could hardly be the case 317 y con isopo en el mano de un palo corto muy labrado y por barbas o pelos del isopo ciertas colas de unas culebras que son como caxcavales 318 brinton 1893 p 25 notes that the equivalent of kan in the nahuatl of miztitlan is xilotl which means ear of corn this seems to show the correctness of the usual identification of the kan sign as meaning maize or bread pan 318 y
