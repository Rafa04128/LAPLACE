jetpropelled but to many 19thcentury people the sewing machine was probably as aweinspiring as a space capsule is to their 20thcentury descendants it was expensive but considering the work it could do and the time it could save the cost was more than justified the sewing machine became the first widely advertised consumer appliance pioneered installment buying and patent pooling and revolutionized the readymade clothing industry it also weathered the protests of those who feared the new machine was a threat to their livelihood the practical sewing machine is not the result of one mans genius but rather the culmination of a century of thought work trials failures and partial successes of a long list of inventors history is too quick to credit one or two men for an important invention and to forget the work that preceded and prodded each man to contribute his share it is no discredit to howe to state that he did not invent the sewing machine howes work with the sewing machine was important and he did patent certain improvements but his work was one step along the way it is for the reader to decide whether it was the turning point since the sewing machine has been considered by some as one of the most important inventions of 19thcentury america of equal importance to this story of the invention is the history of the sewing machines development into a practical popular commodity since many new companies blossomed overnight to manufacture this very salable item a catalog list of more than one hundred and fifty of these 19thcentury companies is included in this study still the list is probably incomplete many of the companies remained in business a very short time or kept their activities a secret to avoid payment of royalties to patent holders evidence of these companies is difficult to find it is hoped that additional information will come to light as a result of this initial attempt to list and date known companies the dating of individual machines based on their serial numbers is also a difficult task individual company records of this type have not survived however using the commercial machines in the patent collection for which we know one limiting datethe date the machine was deposited at the patent officeand using the records that have survived an estimated date based on the serial number can be established for many of the better known machines acknowledgments i am greatly indebted to the late dr frederick lewton whose interest in the history of the sewing machine initiated the collecting of information about it for the smithsonian institutions division of textiles archives and whose outofprint booklet a servant in the house prompted the writing of this work i would also like to thank mr bogart thompson of the singer manufacturing company for his cooperation in arranging for the gift of an excellent collection of 19thcentury sewing machines to the smithsonian and for allowing me to use the singer historical files acknowledgment is also made of the cooperation extended by the henry ford museum and greenfield village for permitting me to study their collection of old sewing machines grace rogers cooper chapter

to 1800 for thousands of years the only means of stitching two pieces of fabric together had been with a common needle and a length of thread the thread might be of silk flax wool sinew or other fibrous material the needle whether of bone silver bronze steel or some other metal was always the same in designa thin shaft with a point at one end and a hole or eye for receiving the thread at the other end simple as it was the common needle fig 2 with its threadcarrying eye had been an ingenious improvement over the sharp bone stick or other object used to pierce a hole through which a lacing then had to be passed1 in addition to utilitarian stitching for such things as the making of garments and household furnishings the needle was also used for decorative stitching commonly called embroidery and it was for this purpose that the needle the seemingly perfect tool that defied improvement was first altered for ease of stitching and to increase production one of the forms that the needle took in the process of adaptation was that of the fine steel hook called an aguja in spain the hook was used in making a type of lace known as punto de aguja during the 17th century after the introduction of chainstitch embroideries from india this hook was used to produce chainstitch designs on a net ground2 the stitch and the fine hook to make it were especially adaptable to this work by the 18th century the hook had been reduced to needle size and inserted into a handle and was used to chainstitchembroider woven fabrics3 in france the hook was called a crochet and was sharpened to a point for easy entry into the fabric fig 3 for stitching the fabric was held taut on a drumshaped frame the hooked needle pierced the fabric caught the thread from below the surface and pulled a loop to the top the needle reentered the fabric a stitchlength from the first entry and caught the thread again pulling a second loop through the first to which it became enchained this method of embroidery permitted for the first time the use of a continuous length of thread at this time the chainstitch was used exclusively for decorative embroidery and from the french name for drumthe shape of the frame that held the fabricthe worked fabric came to be called tambour embroidery the crochet4 or small hooked needle soon became known as a tambour needle in 1755 a new type of needle was invented for producing embroidery stitches this needle had to pass completely through the fabric two times a throughandthrough motion for every stitch the inventor was charles f weisenthal a german mechanic living in london who was granted british patent 701 for a twopointed needle fig 4 the invention was described in the patent as follows the muslin being put into a frame is to be worked with a needle that has two points one at the head and the other point as a common needle which is to be worked by holding it with the fingers in the middle so as not to require turning it might be argued that weisenthal had invented the eyepointed needle since he was the first inventor to put a point at the end of the needle having the eye but since his specifically stated use required the needle to have two points and to be passed completely through the fabric weisenthal had no intention of utilizing the very important advantage that the eyepointed needle provided that of not requiring the passage of the needle through the fabric as in hand sewing while no records can be found to establish that weisenthals patent was put to any commercial use during the inventors lifetime the twopointed needle with eye at midpoint appeared in several 19thcentury sewingmachine inventions the earliest of the known mechanical sewing devices produced a chain or tambour stitch but by an entirely different principle than that used with either needle just described although the idea was incorporated into a patent the machine was entirely overlooked for almost a century as the patent itself was classed under wearing apparel it was entitled an entire new method of making and completing shoes boots splatterdashes clogs and other articles by means of tools and machines also invented by me for that purpose and of certain compositions of the nature of japan or varnish which will be very advantageous in many useful applications this portentously titled british patent 1764 was issued to an english cabinetmaker thomas saint on july 17 1790 along with accounts of several processes for making various varnish compositions the patent contains descriptions of three separate machines the second of these was for stitching quilting or sewing though far from practical the machine incorporated several features common to a modern sewing machine it had a horizontal cloth plate or table an overhanging arm carrying a straight needle and a continuous supply of thread from a spool the motion was derived from the rotation of a hand crank on a shaft which activated cams that produced all the actions of the machine illustration figure 2primitive needle bronze egyptian roman period 30 bcad 642 smithsonian photo 1379a one cam operated the forked needle fig 5 that pushed the thread through a hole made by a preceding thrust of the awl the thread was caught by a looper and detained so that it then became enchained in the next loop of thread the patent described thread tighteners above and below the work and an adjustment to vary the stitches for different kinds of material other than the british patent records no contemporary reference to saints machine has ever been found the stitchingmachine contents of this patent was happened on by accident in 18735 using the patent description a newton wilson of london attempted to build a model of saints machine in 18746 wilson found however that it was necessary to modify the construction before the machine would stitch at all illustration figure 3tambour needle and frame showing the method of forming the chainstitch from the diderot encyclopedia of 1763 vol ii plates brodeur plate ii smithsonian photo 43995c this raised the question whether saint had built even one machine nevertheless the germ of an idea was there and had the inventor followed through the sewing machine might have been classed an 18thcentury rather than a 19thcentury contribution 18001820 there is no doubt that the successful late18thcentury improvements in spinning and weaving methods resulting in increased production of fabrics had a great effect in spurring inventors to ideas of stitching by machinery several efforts were made during the first two decades of the 19th century to produce such machines on february 14 1804 a french patent was issued to thomas stone and james henderson for a new mechanical principle designed to replace handwork in joining the edges of all kinds of flexible material and particularly applicable to the manufacture of clothing7 the machine used a common needle and made an overcast stitch in the same manner as hand sewing a pair of jaws or pincers imitating the action of the fingers alternately seized and released the needle on each side of the fabric the pincers were attached to a pair of arms arranged to be moved backward and forward by any suitable mechanism8 this machine was capable of making curved or angular as well as straight seams but it was limited to carrying a short length of thread necessitating frequent rethreading the machine may have had some limited use but it was not commercially successful on may 30 of the same year john duncan a glasgow manufacturer was granted british patent 2769 for a new and improved method of tambouring or raising flowers figures or other ornaments upon muslins lawns and other cottons cloths or stuffs this machine made the chainstitch using not one but many hooked needles that operated simultaneously the needles attached to a bar or carrier were pushed through the vertically held fabric from the upper right side which in this case was also the outer side after passing through it they were supplied with thread from spools by means of peculiarly formed hooks or thread carriers the thread was twisted around the needle above the hook so as to be caught by it and drawn through to the outer surface the shaft of the needle was grooved on the hook side and fitted with a slider this slider closed upon the retraction of the needle from the fabric holding the thread in place and preventing the hook from catching the fabric was stretched between two rollers set in an upright frame capable of sliding vertically in a second frame arranged to have longitudinal motion the combination of these two motions was sufficient to produce any required design the principle developed by duncan was used on embroidery machines in a modified form for many years of several early attempts his was the first to realize any form of success illustration figure 4weisenthals twopointed needle 1755 illustration figure 5saints sewing machine 1790 smithsonian photo 42490a illustration figure 6chapmans sewing machine first eyepointed needle 1807 smithsonian photo 33299k a type of ropestitching machine which might be considered unimportant to this study must be included because of its use of the eyepointed needle the needle that was to play a most important part in the later development of a practical sewing machine the earliest reference to the use of a needle with an eye not being required to be passed completely through the fabric it was stitching is found in a machine invented by edward walter chapman for which he and william chapman were granted british patent 3078 on october 30 1807 the machine fig 6 was designed to construct belting or flat banding by stitching together several strands of rope that had been laid side by side two needles were required and used alternately one needle was threaded and then forced through the ropes on the opposite side the thread was removed from the eye of the first needle before it was withdrawn the second needle was threaded and the operation repeated the needles could also be used to draw the thread rather than push it through the ropes with the same result while being stitched the ropes were held fast and the sewing frame and supporting carriage were moved manually as each stitch was made such a machine would be applicable only to the work described since the necessity of rethreading at every stitch would make it impractical for any other type of sewing another early machine reported to have used the eyepointed needle to form the chainstitch was invented about 1810 by balthasar krems9 a hosiery worker of mayen germany one knitted article produced there was a peaked cap and krems machine was devised to stitch the turned edges of the cap10 which was suspended from wire pins on a moving wheel the needle of the machine was attached to a horizontal shaft and carried the thread through the fabric the loop of thread was retained by a hookshaped pin to become enchained with the next loop at the reentry of the needle local history reports that this device may have been used as early as 1800 but the inventor did not patent his machine and apparently made no attempt to commercialize it no contemporary references to the machine could be found and use of the machine may have died with the inventor in 1813 illustration figure 7maderspergers 1814 sewing machine illustration from a pamphlet by the inventor entitled beschreibung einer nhmaschine vienna ca 1816 smithsonian photo 49373 about the same time josef madersperger a tailor in vienna austria invented a sewing machine which was illustrated fig 7 and described in a 15page pamphlet published about 181611 on may 12 1817 a vienna newspaper wrote of the madersperger machine the approbation which his machine received everywhere has induced his royal imperial majesty in the year 1814 to give to the inventor an exclusive privilege patent which has already been mentioned before in these papers12 maderspergers 1814 machine stitched straight or curving lines his second machine stitched small semicircles as shown in the illustration and also small circles eggshaped figures and angles of various degrees the machine acclaimed by the art experts must therefore have been intended for embroidery stitching from the contemporary descriptions and the illustration the machine is judged to have made a couched stitchone thread was laid on the surface of the fabric and stitched in place with a short thread carried by a twopointed needle of the type invented by weisenthal two fabrics could have been stitched together but not in the manner required for tailoring the machine must have had many deficiencies in the tension adjustment feed and related mechanical operations for despite the published wishes for success the inventor did not put the machine into practical operation13 years later madersperger again attempted to invent a sewing machine using a different stitch see p 13 illustration figure 8an engraving of thimonnier and his sewing machine of 1830 from sewing machine news 1880 smithsonian photo 10569c a story persists that about 18181819 a machine that formed a backstitch identical to the one used in hand sewing was invented in monkton vermont the earliest record of this machine that this author has found was in the second or 1867 edition of eighty years of progress of the united states the machine is not mentioned in the earlier edition the writer of the article on sewing machines states that john knowles invented and constructed a sewing machine which used a single thread and a twopointed needle with the eye in the middle to form the backstitch this information must have come to light after the first edition was published but from where and by whom is not known other sources state that two men adams and dodge produced this machine in monkton14 while still others credit the reverend john adam dodge assisted by a mechanic by the name of john knowles with the same invention in the same location15 vermont historical societies have been unable to identify the men named or to verify the story of the invention16 the importance of the credibility of this story if proved rests in the fact that it represents the first effort in the united states to produce a mechanical stitching device 18201845 american records of this period are incomplete as a result of the patent office fire of 1836 in which most of the specific descriptions of patents issued to that date were destroyed patentees were asked to provide another description of their patents so that these might be copied but comparatively few responded and only a small percentage was restored thus although the printed index of patents17 lists henry lye as patenting a machine for sewing leather and so forth on march 10 1826 no description of the machine has ever been located many patents whose original claim was for only a mechanical awl to pierce holes in leather or a clamp to hold leather for hand stitching were claimed as sewing devices once a practical machine had evolved but no evidence has ever been found that any of these machines performed the actual stitching operation illustration figure 9an adapted drawing of hunts sewing machine published by the sewing machine news vol 2 no 8 1881 to give some idea of its construction and operation the frame

first man known to have put a mechanical sewing device into commercial operation was barthelemy thimonnier18 a french tailor after several years of fruitless effort he invented a machine for which he received a french patent in 183019 the machine fig 8 made a chainstitch by means of a barbed or hooked needle the vertically held needle worked from an overhanging arm the needle thrust through the fabric laid on the horizontal table caught a thread from the thread carrier and looper beneath the table and brought a loop to the surface of the fabric when the process was repeated the second loop became enchained in the first the needle was moved downward by the depression of a cordconnected foot treadle and was raised by the action of a spring the fabric was fed through the stitching mechanism manually and a regular rate of speed had to be maintained by the operator in order to produce stitches of equal length a type of retractable thimble or presser foot was used to hold the fabric down as required the needle and the entire machine was basically an attempt to mechanize tambour embroidery with which the inventor was quite familiar although this work which served as the machines inspiration was always used for decorative embroidery thimonnier saw the possibilities of using the stitch for utilitarian purposes by 1841 he had 80 machines stitching army clothing in a paris shop but a mob of tailors fearing that the invention would rob them of a livelihood broke into the shop and destroyed the machines thimonnier fled paris penniless four years later he had obtained new financial help improved his machine to produce 200 stitches a minute and organized the first french sewingmachine company20 the revolution of 1848 however brought this enterprise to an early end before new support could be found other inventors had appeared with better machines and thimonniers was passed by in addition to the two french patents thimonnier also received a british patent with his associate jean marie magnin in 1848 and one in the united states in 1850 he achieved no financial gain from either of these and died a poor man while thimonnier was developing his chainstitch machine in france walter hunt21 perhaps best described as a yankee mechanical genius was working on a different kind of sewing machine in the united states sometime between 1832 and 1834 he produced at his shop in new york a machine that made a lockstitch22 this stitch was the direct result of the mechanical method devised to produce the stitching and represented the first occasion an inventor had not attempted to reproduce a hand stitch the lockstitch required two threads one passing through a loop in the other and both interlocking in the heart of the seam at the time hunt did not consider the sewing machine any more promising than several other inventions that he had in mind and after demonstrating that the machine would sew he sold his interest in it for a small sum and did not bother to patent it a descriptionone of few ever publishedand sketch of a rebuilt hunt machine fig 9 appeared in an article in the sewing machine news in 188123 the important element in the hunt invention was an eyepointed needle working in combination with a shuttle carrying a second thread future inventors were thus no longer hampered by the erroneous idea that the sewing machine must imitate the human hands and fingers though hunts machine stitched short straight seams with speed and accuracy it could not sew curved or angular work its stitching was not continuous but had to be reset at the end of a short run the validity of hunts claim as the inventor of the lockstitch and the prescribed method of making it was argued many times especially during the elias howe patent suits of the 1850s the decision against hunt was not a question of invention24 but one of right to ownership or control hunt did little to promote his sewing machine and sold it together with the right to patent to george a arrowsmith illustration figure 10maderspergers 1839 sewing machine maderspergers machine consisted of two major parts the frame which held the material and the stitching mechanism called the hand the hand shown here is an original model photo courtesy of technisches museum fr industrie und gewerbe vienna for over fifteen years from the mid1830s to the early 1850s the machine dropped out of sight when the sewingmachine litigation developed in the 1850s the i m singer company searched out the hunt machine had the inventor rebuild one25 and attempted to use this to break the howe patent the plan did not work the honorable charles mason patent commissioner reported when the first inventor allows his discovery to slumber for eighteen years with no probability of its ever being brought into useful activity and when it is only resurrected to supplant and strangle an invention which has been given to the public and which has been made practically useful all reasonable presumption should be in favor of the inventor who has been the means of conferring the real benefit upon the world26 hunts machine was an invention of the 1830s but only because of the patent litigation was it ever heard of again during the time that a potentially successful sewing machine was being invented and forgotten in america josef madersperger of austria made a second attempt to solve the mechanical stitching problem in 1839 he received a second patent on a machine entirely different from his 1814 effort it was similar to hunts in that it used an eyepointed needle and passed a thread through the loop of the needlethreadthe thread carried by the needleto lock the stitch maderspergers machine was a multipleneedle quilting machine the threaded needles penetrated the fabric from below and were retracted leaving the loops on the surface a thread was drawn through the loops to produce what the inventor termed a chain the first two stitches were twisted before insertion into the next two producing a type of twisted lockstitch the mechanism for feeding the cloth was faulty however and the inventor himself stated in the specifications that much remained to perfect and simplify it before its general application this machine was illustrated fig 10 in the sewing machine times october 25 1907 and mistakenly referred to as the 1814 model madersperger realized no financial gain from either venture and died in a poorhouse in 1850 the first efforts of the 1840s reflected the work of the earlier years in england edward newton and thomas archbold invented and patented a machine on may 4 1841 for tambouring or ornamenting the backs of gloves their machine used a hook on the upper surface to catch the loop of thread but an eyepointed needle from underneath was used to carry the thread up through the fabric the machine was designed to use three needles for three rows of chainstitching if required although the machine was capable of stitching two fabrics together it was never contemplated as a sewing machine in the present use of the term their british patent 8948 stated it was for improvements in producing ornamental or tambour work in the manufacture of gloves the earliest american patent specifically recorded as a sewing machine was us patent 2466 issued to john j greenough on february 21 1842 his machine was a shortthread model that made both the running stitch and the backstitch it used the twopointed needle with eye at midlength which was passed back and forth through the material by means of a pair of pincers on each side of the seam the pincers opened and closed automatically the material to be sewn was held in clamps which moved it forward between the pincers to form a running stitch or moved it alternately backward and forward to produce a backstitch the clamps were attached to a rack that automatically fed the material at a predetermined rate according to the length of stitch required since the machine was designed for leather or other hard material the needle was preceded by an awl which pierced a hole the machine had a weight to draw out the thread and a stopmotion to stop the machinery when a thread broke or became too short the needle was threaded with a short length of thread and required frequent refilling only straight seams could be stitched the feed was continuous to the length of the rack bar then it had to be reset the motions were all obtained from the revolution of a crank it is not believed that any machines other than the patent model fig 11 were ever made little is known of greenough other than his name illustration figure 11greenoughs patent model 1842 smithsonian photo 45525g in the succeeding year on march 4 1843 benjamin w bean received the second american sewingmachine patent us patent 2982 like greenoughs this machine made a running stitch but by a different method in beans machine the fabric was fed between the teeth of a series of gears held in a groove in the gears was a peculiarly shaped needle bent in two places to permit it to be held in place by the gears and with a point at one end and the eye at the opposite end as in a common hand needle the action of the gears caused the fabric to be forced onto and through the threaded needle indefinite straight seams could be stitched as the fabric was continuously forced off the needle by the turning gears fig 12 a screw clamp held the machine to a table or other work surface machines of this and similar types reportedly had some limited usage in the dyeing and bleaching mills27 where lengths of fabric were stitched together before processing improved versions of beans machine were to be patented in subsequent years in england and america the same principle was also used in home machines two decades later the third sewingmachine patent on record in the united states patent office is patent 3389 issued on december 27 1843 to george h corliss better remembered as the inventor and manufacturer of the corliss steam engine it was his interest in the sewing machine however that eventually directed his attention to the steam engine corliss had a general store at greenwich new york a customers complaint that the boots he had purchased split at the seams made corliss wonder why someone had not invented a machine to sew stronger seams than handsewn ones he considered the problem of sewing leather analyzing the steps required to make the saddlers stitch one popularly used in boots and shoes he concluded that a sewing machine to do this type of work must first perforate the leather then draw the threads through the holes and finally secure the stitches by pulling the threads tight the machine corliss invented fig 13 was of the same general type as greenoughs except that two twopointed needles were required to make the saddlers stitch this stitch was composed of two running stitches made simultaneously one from each side28 the machine used two awls to pierce the holes through which the needles passed finger levers approached from opposite sides seized the needles pulled the threads firmly and passed the needles through to repeat the operation the working model that corliss completed could unite two pieces of heavy leather at the rate of 20 stitches per minute corliss lacking capital went to providence rhode island in 1844 to secure backers after months without success he was forced to abandon the sewing machine and accept employment as a draftsman and designer though he considered himself a failure this change of employment placed him on the threshold of his more rewarding life work improvement of the steam engine29 on july 22 1844 james rodgers was granted us patent 3672 the fourth american sewingmachine patent the patent model is not known to be in existence but this machine was of minor importance for it offered only a negligible change in the bean runningstitch machine the same corrugated gears were used but were placed in different positions so that one bend in the needle was eliminated when bean secured a reissue of his patent in 1849 he had adapted it to use a straight needle rodgers machine is not known to have had any commercial success although this type of machine experienced a brief period of popularity by the early 1900s however the runningstitch machine was so little known that when one was illustrated in the sewing machine times in 190730 it excited more curiosity than any of the other early types illustration figure 12beans patent model 1843 smithsonian photo 42490c illustration figure 13corliss patent model 1843 the piece of wood in the foreground is an enlarged model of the needle smithsonian photo 42490 on december 7 1844 the same year that rodgers secured his american patent john fisher and james gibbons were granted british patent 10424 for certain improvements in the manufacture of figured or ornamental lace or net or other fabrics from this superficial description of its work the device might seem to be just another tambouring machine it was not designed specifically for ornamental stitching the machine made a twothread stitch using an eyepointed needle and a shuttle31 several sets of needles and shuttles worked simultaneously the needles were secured to a needlebar placed beneath the fabric the shuttles were pointed at both ends to pass through each succeeding new loop formed by the needles each shuttle was activated by two vibrating arms worked by cams each needle was curved in the form of a bow and in addition to the eye at the point each also had a second eye at the bottom of the curve the shape of the needle together with the position of the eyes permitted the pointed shuttle carrying the second thread to pass freely through the loop in the ascending needle thread the fabric was carried by a pair of cloth rollers capable of sliding in a horizontal plane in both a lateral and a lengthwise direction these combined movements were sufficient to enable the operator to produce almost every embroidered design the ornamenting which might be a yarn cord or gimp was carried by the shuttle thread there was no tension on the shuttle thread which was held in place by the thread from the needle the stitch produced was a form of couching32 it was in no sense a lockstitch fisher who was the inventor readily admitted at a later date that he had not had the slightest idea of producing a sewing machine in the utilitarian meaning of the term although it has not been established that this machine was ever put into practical operation fishers invention was to have a farreaching effect on the development of the sewing machine in england footnotes 1 charles m karch needles historical and descriptive 12 census us vol x 1902 pp 429432 2 florence lewis may

sides even when made by hand it is sometimes misidentified by the casual observer as the lockstitch because of the uniformity of both sides if the saddlers stitch was formed of threads of two different colors the even stitches on one side of the seam and the odd stitches on the reverse side would be of one color and vice versa 29 the life and works of george h corliss privately printed for

turned over to the smithsonian institution the official copies of the corliss drawings and the specifications which had been awarded to the inventor by the patent office it is possible that this may

combination of an eyepointed needle and a shuttle to form a stitch 32 in embroidery couching is the technique of laying a decorative thread on the surface of the fabric and stitching it into place with a second lessconspicuous thread chapter two illustration figure 14howes prepatent model of 1845 and the box used by the inventor to carry the machine to england in 1847 smithsonian photo 45506b elements of a successful machine the requirements for producing a successful practical sewing machine were a support for the cloth a needle to carry the thread through the fabric and a combining device to form the stitch a feeding mechanism to permit one stitch to follow another tension controls to provide an even delivery of thread and the related mechanism to insure the precise performance of each operation in its proper sequence weisenthal had added a point to the eyeend of the needle saint supported the fabric by placing it in a horizontal position with a needle entering vertically duncan successfully completed a chainstitch for embroidery purposes chapman used a needle with an eye at its point and did not pass it completely through the fabric krems stitched circular caps with an eyepointed needle used with a hook to form a chainstitch thimonnier used the hooked needle to form a chainstitch on a fabric laid horizontally and hunt created a new stitch that was more readily adapted to sewing by machine than the hand stitches had been but although each may have had the germ of an idea a successful machine had not evolved there were to be hundreds of patents issued in an attempt to solve these and the numerous minor problems that would ensue but the problems were solved and in spite of its old world inception the successful sewing machine can be credited as an american invention although the invention of the practical sewing machine like most important inventions was a manyman project historians generally give full credit to elias howe jr though such credit may be overly generous howes important role in this history cannot be denied elias howe jr was born on a farm near spencer massachusetts but he left home at an early age to learn the machinists trade33 after serving an apprenticeship in lowell he moved to boston in the late 1830s while employed in the instrument shop of ari davis howe is reported to have overheard a discussion concerning the need for a machine that would sew in 1843 when illness kept him from his job for days at a time he remembered the conversation and the promises of the rich reward that reputedly awaited the successful inventor determined to invent such a machine he finally managed to produce sufficient results to interest george fisher in buying a onehalf interest in his proposed invention by april 1845 howes machine fig 14 was used to sew all the seams of two woolen suits for mens clothing he continued to demonstrate his machine but found that interest was at best indifferent nevertheless howe completed a second machine fig 15 which he submitted with his application for a patent the fifth united states patent no 4750 for a sewing machine was issued to him on september 10 1846 the machine used a grooved and curved eyepointed needle carried by a vibrating arm with the needle supplied with thread from a spool loops of thread from the needle were locked by a thread carried by a shuttle which was moved through the loop by means of reciprocating drivers the cloth was suspended in a vertical position impaled on pins projecting from a baster plate which moved intermittently under the needle by means of a toothed wheel the length of each stitching operation depended upon the length of the baster plate and the seams were necessarily straight when the end of the baster plate reached the position of the needle the machine was stopped the cloth was removed from the baster plate which was moved back to its original position the cloth was moved forward on the pins and the seam continued in his patent specifications howe claimed the following 1 the forming of the seam by carrying a thread through the cloth by means of a curved needle on the end of a vibrating arm and the passing of a shuttle furnished with its bobbin in the manner set forth between the needle and the thread which it carried under combination and arrangement of parts substantially the same with that described 2 the lifting of the thread that passes through the needleeye by means of the liftingrod for the purpose of forming a loop of loose thread that is to be subsequently drawn in by the passage of the shuttle as herein fully described said liftingrod being furnished with a lifting pin and governed in its motion by the guidepieces and other devices arranged and operating substantially as described 3 the holding of the thread that is given out by the shuttle so as to prevent its unwinding from the shuttlebobbin after the shuttle has passed through the loop said thread being held by means of the lever or slippingpiece as herein made known or in any other manner that is substantially the same in its operation and result 4 the manner of arranging and combining the small lever with the sliding box in combination with the springpiece for the purpose of tightening the stitch as the needle is retracted 5 the holding of the cloth to be sewed by the use of a basterplate furnished with points for that purpose and with holes enabling it to operate as a rack in the manner set forth thereby carrying the cloth forward and dispensing altogether with the necessity of basting the parts together the five claims which were allowed howe in his patent have been quoted to show that he did not claim the invention of the eyepointed needle for which he has so often been credited the court judgment34 that upheld howes claim to his patented right to control the use of the eyepointed needle in combination with a shuttle to form a lockstitch was mistakenly interpreted by some as verifying control of the eyepointed needle itself illustration figure 15howes patent model 1846 smithsonian photo 45525b after patenting his invention howe spent three discouraging years in both the united states and in england trying to interest manufacturers in building his sewing machine under license finally for 250 sterling he sold the british patent rights to william thomas and further agreed to adapt the machine to thomas manufacture of umbrellas and corsets35 this did not prove to be a financial success for howe and by 1849 he was back in the united states once again without funds illustration figure 16an enlargement of the stitching area smithsonian photo 45525b on his return howe was surprised to find that other inventors were engaged in the sewingmachine problem and that sewing machines were being manufactured for sale the sixth united states sewingmachine patent no 5942 had been issued to john a bradshaw on november 28 1848 for a machine specifically stated as correcting the defects in the e howe patent bradshaw did not purport that his machine was a new invention his specifications read the curved needle used in howes machine will not by itself form the loop in the thread which is necessary for the flying bobbin with its case to pass through and has therefore to be aided in that operation by a liftingpin with the necessary mechanism to operate it this is a very bungling device and is a great incumbrance to the action of the machine being an impediment in the way of introducing the cloth to be sewed difficult to keep properly adjusted and very frequently gets entangled between the thread and the needle by which the latter is frequently broken this accident happens very often not withstanding all the precaution which it is possible for the most careful operator to exercise and inasmuch as the delay occasioned thereby is very considerable and the needles costly and difficult to replace it is therefore very important that their breaking in this manner be prevented which in my machine is done in the most effectual manner by dispensing with the liftingpin altogether the loop for the flying bobbin to pass through being made with certainty and of the proper form by means of my angular needle moved in a particular manner just before the flyingbobbin case is thrown the shuttle and its bobbin for giving off the thread in howes machine are very defective my neat and simple bobbincase gives off its thread with certainty and uniformity the basterplate in the howe machine is very inconvenient and troublesome in my machine the clamp is a very simple and efficient device the howe machine is stationary and the basterplate or clothholder progressive the bradshaw machine is progressive and the clothholder stationary bradshaws patent accurately described some of the defects of the howe machine but other inventors were later to offer better solutions to the problems illustration figure 17morey and johnson sewing machine 1849 below the machine

machine was not in current manufacture a machine based on it received the seventh united states sewingmachine patent patent 6099 was issued to charles morey and joseph b johnson on february 6 1849 their machine fig 17 was being offered for sale even before the patent was issued this was the first american patent for a chainstitch machine the stitch was made by an eyepointed needle carrying the thread through the fabric the thread was detained by a hook until the loop was enchained by the succeeding one the fabric was held vertically by a baster plate in a manner similar to the howe machine although not claimed in the patent description the morey and johnson machine also had a bar device for stripping the cloth from the needle this bar had a slight motion causing a yielding pressure to be exerted on the cloth although the patent was not granted until february 6 1849 the application had been filed in april of the previous year the machine was featured in the scientific american on january 27 1849 fig 18 morey and johnson machinethese machines are very accurately adjusted in all their parts to work in harmony without this they would be of no use but they are now used in most of the print works and bleach works in new england and especially by the east boston flour company it sews about one yard per minute and we consider it superior to the london sewing machine the specification of which is in our possession it morey and johnson is more simpleand this is a great deal the price of a machine and right to use 13536 an improvement in the morey and johnson machine was patented by jotham s conant for which he was issued a patent on may 8 1849 conants machine offered a slight modification of the cloth bar and of the method of keeping the cloth taut during the stitching operation no successful use of it is known a second improvement of the morey and johnson patent was also issued on may 8 1849 this united states patent no 6439 was to john bachelder for the first continuous but intermittent sewing mechanism as shown in the patent model fig 19 his clothholder consisted of an endless belt supported by and running around three or any other suitable number of cylindrical rollers a series of pointed wires projected from the surface of the belt near the edge immediately adjacent to the needle the wires could be placed at regular or irregular distances as required the shaft of one of the cylindrical rollers which supported the endless clothholder carried a ratchet wheel advanced by the action of a pawl connected to the end of the crankshaft by a small crankpin whose position or distance from the axis of rotation of the shaft could be adjusted illustration figure 18a morey and johnson sewing machine as illustrated in scientific american january 27 1849 smithsonian photo 45771 by this adjustment the extent of the vertical travel of the impelling pawl was regulated to control the length of the stitch a spring catch kept the ratchet wheel in place at the end of each forward rotation of the wheel by the pawl a roller placed over the endless belt at its middle roller pressed the cloth onto the wire points a curved piece of metal was bent over and down upon the top of the belt so that the cloth as it was sewed was carried toward and against the piece by the belt the cloth rose upon and over the piece and was separated from the points when the machine was in motion the cloth was carried forward passed under the needle was stitched and finally passed the separator and off the belt a vertically reciprocating straight eyepointed needle a horizontal supporting surface and a yielding cloth presser were all used but none were claimed as part of the patent these were later specifically claimed in reissues of this patent bachelders one specific claim the endless feed belt was not limited to belt feeding only as he explained in the patent a revolving table or a cylinder might be substituted illustration figure 19bachelders patent model 1849 smithsonian photo 45572 bachelder did not manufacture machines but his patent was sold in the mid1850s to i m singer37 it eventually became one of the most important patents to be contributed to the sewingmachine combination a patent pool which is discussed in more detail on pages 41 and 42 while new ideas and inventors continued to provide the answers to some of the sewingmachine problems elias howe began a series of patent suits to sustain the rights that he felt were his since his interest had never been in constructing machines for sale it was absolutely essential for howe to protect his royalty rights in order to realize any return from his patent he was reported38 to have supervised the construction of 14 sewing machines at a shop39 on gold street in new york toward the close of 1850 sworn contemporary testimony indicates that the machines were of no practical use40 elias stated in his application for his patent extension41 that he made only one machine in 185051 in 1852 he advertised42 territorial rights and machines but apparently did not realize any financial success until he sold a half interest in his patent to george bliss in november 185243 bliss later began manufacturing machines that he initially sold as howes patent however these machines were substantially different from the basic howe machine illustration figure

presser foot and arm serial number 119 the plate however does not fit the machine correctly smithsonian photo 48440d brass plate 48440k on may 18 1853 elias howe granted his first royalty license to wheeler wilson company within a few months licenses were also granted to grover baker a bartholf nichols bliss j a lerow woolridge keene and moore and a b howe the brother of elias these licenses granted the manufacturer the right to use any part of the howe patent44 but it did not mean that the machines were elias howe machines when a royalty license was paid the patent date and sometimes the name was stamped onto the machine for this reason these machines are sometimes mistakenly thought to be elias howe machines they are not howe was also prevented from manufacturing a practical machine unless he paid a royalty to other inventors three of the major manufacturers and howe resolved their differences by forming the sewing machine combination although howe did not enter the manufacturing competition for many years he profited substantially from the royalty terms of the combination in 1860 he applied for and received a sevenyear extension on his patent illustration figure 21blodgett

smithsonian photo 48440e brass plate 48440j there were howe family machines for sale during this period but these were the ones that amasa howe had been manufacturing since 1853 the machine was an excellent one and received the highest medal for sewing machines together with many flattering testimonials at the london international exhibition in 1862 after the publication of this award the demand for amasa howe sewing machines was greatly increased at home and abroad elias took this opportunity to gain entry into the manufacturing business by persuading amasa to let him build a factory at bridgeport connecticut and manufacture the amasa howe machines two years passed before the factory was completed and amasas agents were discouraged the loss could have been regained but the machines produced at bridgeport were not of the quality of the earlier machines amasa attempted to rebuild the bridgeport machines but finally abandoned them and resumed manufacturing machines in new york under his own immediate supervision45 elias formed his own company and continued to manufacture sewing machines in 1867 he requested a second extension of his patent but the request was refused elias howe died in october of the same year meanwhile another important sewing machine of a different principle had also been patented in 1849 this was the machine of sherburne c blodgett a tailor by trade who was supported financially by john a lerow united states patent 6766 was issued to both men on october 2 1849 in the patent the machine was termed as our new rotary sewing machine the shuttle movement was continuous revolving in a circle rather than reciprocating as in the earlier machines automatic tension was initiated restraining the slack thread from interference with the point of the needle illustration figure 22wilsons prepatent model for his reciprocatingshuttle machine 1850 smithsonian photo 45525a the blodgett and lerow machine was built by several shops one of the earliest was the shop of orson c phelps on harvard place in boston phelps took the blodgett and lerow machine to the sixth exhibition of the massachusetts charitable mechanics association in september 1850 and won a silver medal and this praise this machine performed admirably it is an exceedingly ingenious and compact machine able to perform tailors sewing beautifully and thoroughly46 although phelps had won the earliest known premium for a sewing machine and although the machine was produced commercially to a considerable extent figs 20 and 21 one outstanding flaw in its operation could not be overlooked as the shuttle passed around the sixinch circular shuttle race it put a twist in the thread or took one out if the direction was reversed at each revolution this caused a constant breaking of the thread a condition that could not be rectified without changing the principle of operation such required changes were later to lead i m singer another wellknown name into the work of improving this machine also exhibited at the same 1850 mechanics fair was the machine of allen b wilson wilsons machine received only a bronze medal but his inventive genius was to have a far greater effect on the development of the practical sewing machine than the work of blodgett and lerow a b wilson47 was one of the ablest of the early inventors in the field of mechanical stitching and probably the most original wilson a native of willett new york was a young cabinetmaker at adrian michigan in 1847 when he first conceived of a machine that would sew he was apparently unaware of parallel efforts by inventors in distant new england after an illness he moved to pittsfield massachusetts and pursued his idea in earnest by november 1848 he had produced the basic drawings for a machine that would make a lockstitch the needle piercing the cloth left a loop of thread below the seam a shuttle carrying a second thread passed through the loop and as the tension was adjusted a completed lockstitch was formed fig 22 wilsons shuttle was pointed on both ends to form a stitch on both its forward and backward motion a decided improvement over the shuttles of hunt and howe which formed stitches in only one direction after each stitch the cloth was advanced for the next stitch by a sliding bar against which the cloth was held by a stationary presser while the needle was still in the cloth and holding it the sliding bar returned for a fresh grip on the cloth wilson made a second machine on the same principle and applied for a patent he was approached by the owners of the bradshaw 1848 patent who claimed control of the doublepointed shuttle although this claim was without justification as can be seen by examining the bradshaw patent specifications wilson did not have sufficient funds to fight the claim in order to avoid a suit he relinquished to a p kline and edward lee a onehalf interest in his us patent 7776 which was issued on november 12 1850 fig 23 illustration figure 23wilsons patent model 1850 smithsonian photo 45504h inventor wilson had been associated with kline and lee e lee co for only a few months when on november 25 1850 he agreed to sell his remaining interest to his partners for 2000 he retained only limited rights for new jersey and for massachusetts the sale was fruitless for the inventor as no payment was ever made how much money e e lee co realized from the wilson machine is difficult to determine but they ran numerous ads in the 1851 and 1852 issues of scientific american a typical one reads a b wilsons sewing machine justly allowed to be the cheapest

severed relations with lee and kline in early 1851 shortly after meeting nathaniel wheeler who was to become his partner in a happier more profitable enterprise involving the sewing machine illustration figure 26wilsons stationarybobbin patent model 1852 a commercial machine was used since wheeler wilson co had begun manufacturing machines the previous year smithsonian photo 45504b wilson with his two partners was occupying a room in the old sun building at 128 fulton street when wheeler on a business trip to new york city learned of the wilson sewing machine wheeler examined the machine saw its possibilities and at once contracted with e lee co to make 500 of them at the same time he engaged wilson to go with him to watertown connecticut to perfect the machine and supervise its manufacture meanwhile wilson had been working on a substitute for the shuttle he showed his model of the device which became known as the rotary hook to wheeler who was so convinced of its superiority that he decided to develop this new machine and leave wilsons first machine to the others who by degrees had become its owners wilson now applied all his effort to improving the rotary hook for which he received his second patent on august 12 1851 figs 24 and 25 wheeler his two partners warren and woodruff and wilson now formed a new copartnershipwheeler wilson and company they began the manufacture of the machines under the patent which combined the rotary hook and a reciprocating bobbin the rotary hook extended or opened more widely the loop of the needle thread while a reciprocating bobbin carried its thread through the extended loop to avoid litigation which the reciprocating bobbin might have caused wilson contrived his third outstanding inventionthe stationary bobbin this was a feature of the first machine produced by the new company in 1851 though the patent for the stationary bobbin was not issued until june 15 1852 fig 26 in all reciprocatingshuttle machines a certain loss of power is incurred in driving forward stopping and bringing back the shuttle at each stitch also the machines are rather noisy owing to the striking of the driver against the shuttle at each stroke these objections were removed by wilsons rotary hook and stationary bobbin the locking of the needle thread with the bobbin thread was accomplished not by driving a shuttle through the loop of the needle thread but by passing that loop under the bobbin the driving shaft carried the circular rotary hook one of the sewing machines most beautiful contrivances the success of the machine is indicated in an article that appeared in the june 1853 issue of scientific american there are 300 of these machines now in operation in various parts of the country and the work which they can perform cannot be surpassed the time must soon come when every private family that has much sewing to do will have one of these neat and perfect machines indeed many private families have them now the price of one all complete is 125 every machine is made under the eye of the inventor at the companys machine shop watertown connecticut so that every one is warranted agreement between mr

machine of the period the plate is stamped a b wilson patented aug 12 1851 watertown conn no 1 smithsonian photo 45504 this agreement was important to sales as elias howe was known to have sued purchasers of machines as well as rival inventors and companies the business was on a substantial basis by october 1853 and a stock company was formed under the name of wheeler wilson manufacturing company51 a little more than a year later on december 19 1854 wilsons fourth important patent us patent 12116for the fourmotion cloth feedwas issued to him fig 27 in this development the flattoothed surface in contact with the cloth moved forward carrying the cloth with it then it dropped a little so as not to touch the cloth next it moved backward then in the fourth motion it pushed up against the cloth and was ready to repeat the forward movements this simple and effective feed method is still used today with only minor modifications in almost every sewing machine this feed with the rotary hook and the stationary circulardisk bobbin completed the essential features of wilsons machine it was original and fundamentally different from all other machines of that time the resulting wheeler and wilson machine made a lockstitch by means of a curved eyepointed needle carried by a vibrating arm projecting from a rock shaft connected by link and eccentric strap with an eccentric on the rotating hook shaft this shaft had at its outer end the rotary hook provided with a point adapted to enter the loop of needle thread as the hook rotated it passed into and drew down the loop of needlethread which was held by means of a loop check while the point of the hook entered a new loop when the first loop was cast offthe face of the hook being beveled for that purposeit was drawn upward by the action of the hook upon the loop through which it was then passing during the rotation of the hook each loop was passed around a disk bobbin provided with the second thread and serving the part of the shuttle in other machines the fourmotion feed was actuated in this machine by means of a spring bar and a cam in conjunction with the mandrel from the beginning wheeler and wilson had looked beyond the use of the sewing machine solely by manufacturers and had seen the demand for a lightrunning lightweight machine for sewing in the home wilsons inventions lent themselves to this design and wheeler and wilson led the way to the introduction of the machine as a home appliance other manufacturers followed when the stock company was formed mr wilson retired from active participation in the business at his own request his health had not been good and a nervous condition made it advisable for him to be freed from the responsibility of daily routine during this period wilsons inventive contributions to the sewing machine continued as noted and in addition he worked on inventions concerning cotton picking and illuminating gases wheeler and wilsons foremost competitor in the early years of sewingmachine manufacture was the singer company which overtook them by 1870 and finally absorbed the entire wheeler and wilson manufacturing company in 1905 the founder of this most successful 19thcentury company was isaac singer a native of pittstown new york52 successively a mechanic an actor and an inventor singer came to boston in 1850 to promote his invention of a machine for carving printers wooden type he exhibited the carving machine in orson phelps shop where the blodgett and lerow machines were being manufactured because the carving machine evoked but little interest singer turned his attention to the sewing machine as a device offering considerable opportunity for both improvement and financial reward phelps liked singers ideas and joined with george zieber the publisher who had been backing the carvingmachine venture to support singer in the work of improving the sewing machine his improvements in the blodgett and lerow machine included a table to hold the cloth horizontally rather than vertically this had been used by bachelder and wilson also a yielding vertical presser foot to hold the cloth down as the needle was drawn up and a vertically reciprocating straight needle driven by a rotary overhanging shaft the story of the invention and first trial of the machine was told by singer in the course of a patent suit sometime later i explained to them how the work was to be fed over the table and under the presserfoot by a wheel having short pins on its periphery projecting through a slot in the table so that the work would be automatically caught fed and freed from the pins in place of attaching and detaching the work to and from the baster plate by hand as was necessary in the blodgett machine phelps and zieber were satisfied that it would work i had no money zieber offered forty dollars to build a model machine phelps offered his best endeavors to carry out my plan and make the model in his shop if successful we were to share equally i worked at it day and night sleeping but three or four hours a day out of the twentyfour and eating generally but once a day as i knew i must make it for the forty dollars or not get it at all the machine was completed in eleven days about nine oclock in the evening we got the parts together and tried it it did not sew the workmen exhausted with almost unremitting work pronounced it a failure and left me one by one zieber held the lamp and i continued to try the machine but anxiety and incessant work had made me nervous and i could not get tight stitches sick at heart about midnight we started for our hotel on the way we sat down on a pile of boards and zieber mentioned that the loose loops of thread were on the upper side of the cloth it flashed upon me that we had forgot to adjust the tension on the needle thread we went back adjusted the tension tried the machine sewed five stitches perfectly and the thread snapped but that was enough at three oclock the next day the machine was finished i took it to new york and employed mr charles m keller to patent it it was used as a model in the application for the patent53 the first machine was completed about the last of september 1850 the partners considered naming the machine the jenny lind after the swedish soprano who was then the toast of america it was reported54 to have been advertised under that name when the machine was first placed on the market but the name was soon changed to singers perpendicular action sewing machine or simply the singer sewing machinea name correctly anticipated to achieve a popularity of its own according to the contract made by the partners the hurriedly built first machine was to be sent to the patent office with an application in the name of singer and phelps an application was made between the end of september 1850 and march 14 1851 as singer refers to it briefly in the application formally filed on april 16 1851 stating my present invention is of improvements on a machine heretofore invented by me and for which an application is now pending55 illustration figure 28singers patent model 1851 a commercial machine was used bearing the serial number 22 smithsonian photo 45572d in late december 1850 singer had bought phelps interest in the company whether the first application was later abandoned by singer or whether it was rejected is not known56 but a patent on the first application was never issued the final disposition of this first machine has remained a mystery57 illustration figure 29singers perpendicular action sewing machine an engraving from illustrated news june 25 1853 which states the sewing machine has within the last two years acquired a wide celebrity and established its character as one of the most efficient labor saving instruments ever introduced to public notice we must not forget to call attention to the fact that this instrument is peculiarly calculated for female operatives they should never allow its use to be monopolized by men smithsonian photo 48091d a few machines were manufactured in late 1850 and early 1851 and these attracted considerable attention orders began to be received in advance of production the pending patent application did not delay the manufacture and a number of machines were sold before august 12 1851 when the patent was granted the patent model is shown in figure 2858 it made a lockstitch by means of a straight eyepointed needle and a reciprocating shuttle the patent claims as quoted from the specifications were as follows 1 giving to the shuttle an additional forward motion after it has been stopped to close the loop as described for the purpose of drawing the stitch tight when such additional motion is given at and in combination with the feed motion of the cloth in the reverse direction and the final upward motion of the needle as described so that the two threads shall be drawn tight at the same time as described 2 controlling the thread during the downward motion of the needle by the combination of a frictionpad to prevent the slack above the cloth with the eye on the needlecarrier for drawing back the thread for the purposes and in the manner substantially as described 3 placing the bobbin from which the needle is supplied with thread on an adjustable arm attached to the frame substantially as described when this is combined with the carrying of the said thread through an eye or guide attached to and moving with the needlecarrier as described whereby any desired length of thread can be given for the formation of the loop without varying the range of motion of the needle as described the feeding described in the singer patent was by the friction surface of a wheel whose periphery is formed with very fine grooves the edges of which are slightly serrated against which the cloth is pressed by a spring plate or pad although claimed by the inventor in the handwritten specifications it was not allowed as original the machines manufactured by the singer company fig 29 were duplicates of the patent model these machines were quite heavy and intended for manufacturing rather than for family use

encouraged him to improve its reliability and convenience he developed a wooden packing case which doubled as a stand for the machine and a treadle to allow it to be operated by foot because of the dimensions of the packing case singer put the pivot of the treadle toward its center about where the instep of the foot would rest this produced the heelandtoe action treadle a familiar part of the sewing machine until its replacement by the electric motor both hands were freed to guide and arrange the cloth that was being stitched singer also added a flywheel to smooth out the treadle action and later an iron stand with a treadle wide enough for both feet the treadle had been in use for two years before a rival pointed out that it might have been patented to singers chagrin it was then too late for patent laws did not permit patenting a device that had been in public use a new obstacle appeared in the singer companys path when howe demanded 25000 for infringement of his patent singer and zieber decided to fight enlisting the legal aid of edward clark a lawyer and financier howes action was opposed on the basis of hunts machine of 1834 which they stated had anticipated howes invention while they were resisting howe sued three firms that were using and selling singer machines the court order required the selling firms and the purchasers to provide an account of the profits accrued from the sale and the use of the sewing machines and restrained the firms from selling the machines during the pendency of the suit59 as a result of this action a number of singers rivals purchased licenses from howe and advertised that anyone could sell their machines without fear of a suit this gave them a great competitive advantage and singer and clark60 decided it was best to seek a settlement with howe on july 1 1854 they paid him 15000 and took out a license illustration figure 32singers new family sewing machine illustration from a brochure dating about 1858 or 1859 which states a few months since we came to the conclusion that the public taste demanded a sewing machine for family purposes more exclusively a machine of smaller size and of a lighter and more elegant form a machine decorated in the best style of art so as to make a beautiful ornament in the parlor or boudoir a machine very easily operated and rapid in working to supply this public want we have just produced and are now prepared to receive orders for singers new family sewing machine smithsonian photo 48091h in spite of this defeat the singer company could claim several important improvements to the sewing machine and the acquisition of the patents rights to the morey and johnson machine of 1849 which gave them control of the spring or curved arm to hold the cloth by a yielding pressure although this point had not been claimed in the 1849 patent the established principle of patent law allowed that a novel device introduced and used in a patented machine could be covered by a reissue at any time during the life of the patent upon becoming owners of the morey and johnson patent singer applied for a reissue which covered this type of yielding pressure it was granted on june 27 1854 the singer companys acquisition of the bachelder patent had given them control of the yielding pressure bar also illustration figure 33singer family machine 1858 head only smithsonian photo 45524f singers aggressive selling had begun to overcome the publics suspicion of sewing machines he pioneered in the use of lavishly decorated sewingmachine showrooms when the company offices were expanded in the mid1850s fig 30 these were rich with carved walnut furniture gilded ornaments and carpeted floors places in which victorian women were not ashamed to be seen the machines were demonstrated by pretty young women the total effect was a new concept of selling and singer became the drum major of a new and coming industry that had many followers see fig 31 illustration figure 34grover and bakers patent model 1851 smithsonian photo 32003g the first light family sewing machine by the singer company was not manufactured until 1858 figs 32 and 33 comparatively few of these machines were made as they proved to be too small and light the men in the shop dubbed the machine the grasshopper but it was officially called the new family sewing machine or the family machine61 because of its shape singer company brochures of the 1920s referred to it as the turtleback machine since the cost of sewing machines was quite high and the average family income was low clark suggested the adoption of the hirepurchase plan into the american economy thus came the nowfamiliar installment buying singer and clark continued to be partners until 1863 when a corporation was formed at this time singer decided to withdraw from active work he received 40 percent of the stock and retired to paris and later to england where he died in 1875 illustration figure

the mid1850s the basic elements of a successful practical sewing machine were at hand but the continuing court litigation over rival patent rights seemed destined to ruin the economics of the new industry it was then that the lawyer of the grover and baker company another sewingmachine manufacturer of the early 1850s supplied the solution grover and baker were manufacturing a machine that was mechanically good for this early period william o grover was another boston tailor who unlike many others was convinced that the sewing machine was going to revolutionize his chosen trade although the sewing machines that he had seen were not very practical he began in 1849 to experiment with an idea based on a new kind of stitch his design was for a machine that would take both its threads from spools and eliminate the need to wind one thread upon a bobbin after much experimenting he proved that it was possible to make a seam by interlocking two threads in a succession of slipknots but he found that building a machine to do this was a much more difficult task it is quite surprising that while he was working on this idea he did not stumble upon a good method to produce the singlethread as opposed to grover and bakers twothread chainstitch later worked out by another grover was working so intently on the use of two threads that apparently no thought of forming a stitch with one thread had a chance to develop at this time grover became a partner with another boston tailor william e baker and on february 11 1851 they were issued us patent no 7931 for a machine that did exactly what grover had set out to do it made a double chainstitch with two threads both carried on ordinary thread spools the machine figs 34 and 35 used a vertical eyepointed needle for the top thread and a horizontal needle for the underthread the cloth was placed on the horizontal platform or table which had a hole for the entry of the vertical needle when this needle passed through the cloth it formed a loop on the underside the horizontal needle passed through this loop forming another loop beyond which was retained until the redescending vertical needle enchained it and the process repeated the slack in the needle thread was controlled by means of a spring guide the cloth was fed by feeding rolls and a band illustration figure 36grovers patent model for the first portable case 1856 the

by a removable wooden pitman it also could be turned by hand smithsonian photo 45525d a company was organized under the name of grover and baker sewing machine company and soon the partners took jacob weatherill mechanic and orlando b potter lawyer who became the president into the firm potter contributed his ability as a lawyer in lieu of a financial investment and handled the several succeeding patents of grover and baker these patents were primarily for mechanical improvements such as us patent no 9053 issued to grover and baker on june 22 1852 for devising a curved upper needle and an under looper62 to form the doublelooped stitch which became known as the grover and baker stitch one of the more interesting of the patents however was for the box or sewing case for which grover was issued us patent no 14956 on may 27 1856 the inventor stated that when open the box shall constitute the bed for the machine to be operated upon and hanging the machine thereto to facilitate oiling cleansing and repairs without removing it from the box it was the first portable sewing machine fig 36 though the grover and baker company manufactured machines using a shuttle and producing the more common lockstitch both under royalty in their own name and also for other smaller companies potter was convinced that the grover and baker stitch was the one that eventually would be used in both family and commercial machines he as president directed the efforts of the company to that end when the basic patents held by the sewingmachine combination discussed on pp 4142 began to run out in the mid1870s dissolving its purpose and lowering the selling price of sewing machines the grover and baker company began a systematic curtailing of expenses and closing of branch offices all the patents held by the company and the business itself were sold to another company63 but the members of the grover and baker company fared well financially by the strategic move the grover and baker machine and its unique stitch did not have a great influence on the overall development of the mechanics of machine sewing the merits of a doublelooped stitchits elasticity and the taking of both threads from commercial spoolswere outweighed by the bulkiness of the seam and its consumption of three times as much thread as the lockstitch required machines making a similar type of stitch have continued in limited use in the manufacture of knit goods and other products requiring an elastic seam but more importantly grover and bakers astute orlando b potter placed their names in the annals of sewingmachine history by his work in forming the combination believed to be the first trust of any prominence footnotes 33 see biographical sketch pp 138141 34 in the matter of the application of

description of the first machine with detailed improvements for which he was then applying for a patent in my previous machine to which reference has been made the bobbin was carried by the

long for all other purposes quoted from us patent 8294 issued to isaac m singer aug 12 1851 it should be noted that in some instances there was a considerable lapse of time from the date a patent

successful sewing machine assembled the various manufacturers should have been able to produce good machines unencumbered the court order however which restrained several firms from selling singer machines while the howe suit was pending started a landslide soon wheeler wilson and company grover and baker company and several others64 purchased rights from elias howe this gave howe almost absolute control of the sewingmachine business as these companies agreed to his royalty terms of 25 for every machine sold in an attempt to improve his own machine howe was almost immediately caught up in another series of legal battles in which he was the defendant the companies he had defeated were able to accuse him of infringing on patents that they owned to compound the confusion individual companies also were suing each other on various grounds because of this situation orlando b potter president of the grover and baker company advanced in 1856 the idea of a combination of sewingmachine manufacturers he pointed out how the various companies were harming themselves by continuing litigation and tried to convince howe that all would benefit by an agreement of some kind he proposed that elias howe wheeler wilson and company i m singer and company and grover and baker company pool their patents covering the essential features of the machine the three companies had started production about the same time and approved of potters idea howe opposed it as he felt that he had the most to lose by joining the combination he finally consented to take part in potters plan if the others would agree to certain stipulations the first requirement was that at least twentyfour manufacturers were to be licensed the second was that in addition to sharing equally in the profits with the three companies howe would receive a royalty of 5 for each machine sold in the united states and 1 for each machine exported it has been estimated that as a result of this agreement howe received at least 2000000 as his share of the license fees between 1856 and 1867 when his patent expired65 the organization was called the sewingmachine trust andor the sewingmachine combination the important patents contributed to it were 1 the grooved eyepointed needle used with a shuttle to form the lockstitch e howe patent held by e howe 2 the fourmotion feeding mechanism a b wilson patent held by wheeler and wilson company 3 the needle moving vertically above a horizontal workplate bachelder patent a continuous feeding device by belt or wheel bachelder patent a yielding presser resting on the cloth bachelder patent the spring or curved arm to hold the cloth by a yielding pressure morey and johnson patent the heartshaped cam as applied to moving the needle bar singer patent all these patents held by the singer company66 the grover and baker company contributed several patents of relative importance but its most important claim for admission was the fact that potter had promoted the idea the consent of all four memberparties was required before any license could be granted and all were required to have a licenseeven the member companies the fee was 15 per machine a portion of this money was set aside to pay the cost of prosecuting infringers howe received his initial fee and the rest was divided between the four parties the advantage to the licensee was that he was required to pay only one fee most license applications were granted only those manufacturing a machine specifically imitating the product of a licensed manufacturer were refused the combinations three company members each continued to manufacture improve and perfect its own machine other than the joint control of the patents there was no pooling of interests and each company competed to attract purchasers to buy its particular type of machine as did the companies who were licensed by them in 1860 the year howes patent was renewed the general license fee was reduced from 15 to 7 and howes special royalty was reduced to 1 per machine howe remained a member until his patent ran out in 1867 the other members continued the combination until 1877 when the bachelder patent which had been extended twice finally expired by that time the fundamental features of the sewing machine were no longer controlled by anyone open competition by the smaller manufacturers was possible and a slight reduction in price followed many new companies came into beingsome destined to be very shortlived from the beginning to the end of the combination there was an army of independents including infringers and imitators who kept up a constant complaint against it maintaining that its existence tended to retard the improvement of the sewing machine and that the public suffered thereby in the period immediately following the termination of the combination however only a few improvements of any importance were made and most of these were by the member companies footnotes 64 these included

solve the problems of patent litigation another problem faced the wouldbe home users of this new invention the budget limitations of the average family caused a demand for a less expensive machine for this first consumer appliance was a most desirable commodity67 there were many attempts to satisfy this demand but one of the best and most successful grew out of a young mans curiosity james e a gibbs first exposure to the sewing machine was in 1855 when at the age of 24 he saw a simple woodcut illustration of a grover and baker machine the woodcut represented only the upper part of the machine nothing in the illustration indicated that more than one thread was used and none of the stitchforming mechanism was visible gibbs assumed that the stitch was formed with one thread he then proceeded to imagine a mechanism that would make a stitch with one thread his solution was described in his own statement as i was then living in a very out of the way place far from railroads and public conveyances of all kinds modern improvements seldom reached our locality and not being likely to have my curiosity satisfied otherwise i set to work to see what i could learn from the woodcut which was not accompanied by any description i first discovered that the needle was attached to a needle arm and consequently could not pass entirely through the material but must retreat through the same hole by which it entered from this i saw that i could not make a stitch similar to handwork but must have some other mode of fastening the thread on the underside and among other possible methods of doing this the chainstitch occurred to me as a likely means of accomplishing the end i next endeavored to discover how this stitch was or could be made and from the woodcut i saw that the driving shaft which had the driving wheel on the outer end passed along under the cloth plate of the machine i knew that the mechanism which made the stitch must be connected with and actuated by this driving shaft after studying the position and relations of the needle and shaft with each other i conceived the idea of the revolving hook on the end of the shaft which might take hold of the thread and manipulate it into a chainstitch my ideas were of course very crude and indefinite but it will be seen that i then had the correct conception of the invention afterwards embodied in my machine68 illustration figure 39one of the first commercial machines produced by the willcox gibbs sewing machine co in 1857 this machine bears no serial number although the name james e a gibbs is inscribed in two places on the cloth plate it was used as the patent model for gibbs improvement on his 1857 patent issued the following year on august 10 1858 smithsonian photo p 6393 gibbs had no immediate interest in the sewing machine other than to satisfy his curiosity he did not think of it again until january 1856 when he was visiting his father in rockbridge county virginia while in a tailors shop there he happened to see a singer machine gibbs was very much impressed but thought the machine entirely too heavy complicated and cumbersome and the price exorbitant it was then that he recalled the machine he had devised remembering how simple it was he decided to work in earnest to produce a lessexpensive type of sewing machine gibbs had little time to spend on this invention since his family was dependent upon him for support but he managed to find time at night and during inclement weather in contemporary references gibbs is referred to as a farmer but since he is also reported to have had employers it may be surmised that he was a farmhand in any event his decision to try to produce a lessexpensive sewing machine suffered from a lack of proper tools and adequate materials most of the machine had to be constructed of wood and he was forced to make his own needles by the end of april 1856 however his model was sufficiently completed to arouse the interest of his employers who agreed to furnish the money necessary to patent the machine gibbs went to washington where he examined sewingmachine models in the patent office and other machines then on the market completing his investigations gibbs made a trip to philadelphia and showed his invention to a builder of models of new inventions james willcox much impressed with the machine willcox arranged for gibbs to work with his son charles willcox in a small room in the rear of his shop after taking out two minor patents on december 16 1856 and january 20 1857 gibbs obtained his important one us patent no 17427 on june 2 1857 fig 38 his association with charles willcox led to the formation of the willcox gibbs sewing machine company and they began manufacturing chainstitch machines in 1857 fig 39 the machine used a straight needle to make a chainstitch at the forward end of the main shaft was a hook which as it rotated carried the loop of needlethread elongated and held it expanded while the feed moved the cloth until the needle at the next stroke descended through the loop so held when the needle descended through the first loop the point of the hook was again in position to catch the second loop at which time the first loop was cast off and the second loop drawn through it the first loop having been drawn up against the lower edge of the cloth to form a chain illustration figure 40a dolphin sewing machine based on clarks patent of 1858 this design was first used by t j w robertson in 1855 but in his patent issued on may 22 of that year no claim was made for the machine design only for the chainstitch mechanism the same style was used by d w clark in several of his chainstitch patents but he also made no claim for the design stating that the machine may be made in any desired ornamental form the dolphinstyle machines are all chainstitch models of solid brass originally gilt although only about five inches long they are fullsize machines using a fullsize needle smithsonian photo 45505 a gibbs sewing machine on a simple ironframe stand with treadle sold for approximately 50 in the late 1850s69 while a wheeler and wilson70 machine or a grover and baker71 with the same type of stand sold for approximately 100 after the introduction of the gibbs machine the singer company72 brought out a light family machine in 1858 that was also first sold for 100 it was then reduced to 50 but it was not popular because it was too light see discussion of singer machines pp 3435 in 1859 singer brought out its second more successful family machine which sold for 75 like the other companies licensed by the combination willcox and gibbs company paid a royalty for the use of the patents it held although the willcox and gibbs machine was a singlethread chainstitch machine and the company held the gibbs patents the company was required to be licensed to use the basic feed vertical needle and other related patents held by the sewingmachine combination with the approach of the civil war gibbs returned to virginia poor health prevented him from taking an active part in the war but he worked throughout the conflict in a factory processing saltpeter for gunpowder afterward gibbs returned to philadelphia and found that willcox had faithfully protected his sewingmachine interests during his long absence the firm prospered and gibbs finally retired to virginia a wealthy man interestingly gibbs named the virginia village to which he returned in later life raphinederived somewhat incorrectly from the greek word to sew the willcox gibbs sewing machine company is one of the few old companies still in existence it discontinued making and selling familystyle machines many years ago and directed its energies toward specialized commercial sewing machines many of which are based on the original chainstitch principle there was also an everincreasing number of other patentees and manufacturers who in the late 1850s and 1860s attempted to produce a sewing machine that would circumvent both the combination and the high cost of manufacturing a more complicated type of machine some of the more interesting of these are pictured and described in figures 40 through 54 illustration figure 41the cherub sewing machine was another robertson first which was adopted by clark robertsons patent of october 20 1857 once again makes no claim for the design neither does clarks patent of january 5 1858 illustrated here the machine is approximately the same size as the dolphin and is made in the same manner and of the same materials two cherubs form the main support one also supporting the spool and leashing a dragonfly which backs the needle mechanism smithsonian photo 45504d illustration figure 42the foliage sewing machine originated with d w clark once again he did not include the design in his june 8 1858 patent which was aimed at improving the feeding mechanism like most handturned models these required a clamp to fasten them to the table when in operation smithsonian photo 45504c illustration figure 43the sewing shears was another popular machine of unusual style some models were designed to both cut and sew but most derived their names from the method of motivating power the earliest example of the sewingshears machine was invented by joseph hendrick who stated in his patent that he was attempting to produce a simple portable cheap and efficient machine his patent model of october 5 1858 is illustrated smithsonian photo 45504f illustration figure 44the horse sewing machine is among the most unusual of the patents issued for mechanical improvements although james perry the patentee made several claims for the looper feeder and tension he made no mention of the unusual design of the machine for which a patent was issued on november 23 1858 although it was probably one of a kind the horse machine illustrates the extent to which the inventors mind struggled for original design smithsonian photo 45505c illustration figure 45many inventors attempted to cut the cost of manufacturing a complicated machine one of these was albert h hook whose machine is only about four inches high and two inches wide his patent granted november 30 1858 simplified the construction and arrangement of the various parts although hook used a barbed needle reminiscent of the one used by thimonnier his method of forming the stitch was entirely different the thread was passed through the necessary guides and when the cloth was in place the needle was thrust up from below passing through the fabric the needle descended carrying with it a loop of thread as the process was repeated a chainstitch was formed with the enchained loop on the under side in spite of its simple mechanism hooks machine was not a commercial success smithsonian photo 45505d illustration figure 46in addition to mechanical patents a number of design patents were also issued for sewing machines these fall into a separate series in the patent offices numerical records this unusual example featured two semidraped female figures holding the spool of thread a mermaid holding the needle a serpent which served as the presser foot and a heartshaped baster plate the design was patented by w n brown october 25 1859 but no examples other than the patent model are known to have been made smithsonian photo 45504a illustration figure 47the squirrel machine was another interesting design patent s b ellithorp had received a mechanical patent for a twothread stationarybobbin machine on august 26 1857 that same month he published a picture of his machine shown here as republished in the sewing machine news vol 7 no 11 november 1885 the machine was designed in the shape of the ordinary gray squirrel so common throughout this countryan animal that is selected as a type of provident care and forethought for its habits of frugality and for making provision for seasons of scarcity and want in times of plentyand the different parts of the animal are each put to a useful purpose the moving power being placed within its body the needle stock through its head one of its fore feet serving to guide the thread and the other to hold down the cloth while being sewed and the tip of its tail forming a support to the spool from which the thread is supplied although the design patent was not secured until june 7 1859 the inventor was reported to have been perfecting his machine for manufacture in 1857 ellithorp planned to place them in market at a price that will permit families and individuals that have heretofore been deterred from purchasing a machine by the excessive and exorbitant price charged for those now in use to possess one patent rights were sold under the name of ellithorp fox but the machine was never manufactured on a large scale if at all no

researching the history of the invention and the development of the sewing machine many items of related interest concerning the machines economic value came to light the manufacture of the machines was in itself a boost to the economy of the emerging industrial united states as was the production of attachments for specialized stitching and the need for new types of needles and thread moreover the machines ability to speed up production permitted it to permeate the entire field of products manufactured by any type of stitching from umbrellas to tents since this aspect of the story was not completed for this study no attempt will be made to include any definitive statements on the economic importance of the sewing machine at home or abroad this related information is of sufficient interest however to warrant inclusion in this first appendix perhaps these notes will suggest areas of future research for students of american technology readymade clothing whether of the expensive or the inexpensive type the sewing machine was much more than a popular household appliance its introduction had farreaching effects on many different types of manufacturing establishments as well as on the export trade the newly developing readymade clothing industry was not only in a state of development to welcome the new machine but also was in all probability responsible for its immediate practical application and success until the early part of the second quarter of the 19th century the readymade clothing trade in the united states was confined almost entirely to furnishing the clothing required by sailors about to ship out to sea the stores that kept these supplies were usually in the neighborhood of wharf areas but other than the needs of these seamen there was little market for readymade goods out of necessity many of the families in the early years in this country had made their own clothing as wealth was acquired and taste could be cultivated professional seamstresses and tailors were in increasing demand moved into the cities and towns and even visited the smaller villages for as long as their services were needed at the same time a related trade was also growing in the cities especially in new york city that of dealing in secondhand clothing industrious persons bought up old clothes cleaned repaired and refinished them and sold the clothing to immigrants and transients who wished to avoid the high cost of new custommade clothing the repairing of this secondhand clothing led to the purchase of cheap cloth at auctionhalfburnt wetgoods and other damaged yardage when in excess of the repairing needs this fabric was made into garments and sold with the secondhand items many visitors who passed through new york city were found to be potential buyers of this merchandise if a better class of readymade clothes was made available manufacture began to increase tailors of the city began to keep an assortment of finished garments on hand when visitors bought these they were also very likely to buy additional garments for resale at home the latter led to the establishment of the wholesale garmentmanufacturing industry in new york about 183435 most of the readymade clothing establishments were small operations not large factories large quantities of cloth were purchased cutting was done in multiple layers with tailors shears since many seamstresses were needed the garments were farmed out to the girls in their homes the manufacture of garments in quantity meant that the profit on each garment was larger than a tailor could make on a single custommade item the appeal of increased profits influenced many to enter the new industry and due to the ensuing competition the retail cost of each garment was lowered just as the new businesses were getting underway the panic of 1837 ruined most of them but the lower cost and the convenience of readymade clothing had left its mark not only was the garmentmanufacturing business reestablished soon after the panic had subsided but by 1841 the value of clothing sold at wholesale in new york was estimated at 2500000 and by 1850a year before sewing machines were manufactured in any quantitythere were 4278 clothing manufacturing establishments in the united states beside new york city cincinnati was also one of the important readymade clothing centers in 1850 the value of its products amounted to 4427500 and in 1860 to 6381190 boston was another important center with a readymade clothing production of 4567749 in 1860 philadelphia baltimore louisville and st louis all had a large wholesale clothing trade by 1860 here was the ready market for a practical sewing machine73 clothing establishments grew and began to have agencies in small towns and the sewing work was distributed throughout the countryside the new competing sewingmachine companies were willing to deliver a machine for a small sum and to allow the buyer to pay a dollar or two a month until the full amount of the sale was paid this was an extension of the hirepurchase plan buying on credit initiated by clark of the singer company the home seamstresses were eager to buy for they were able to produce more piecework with a sewing machine and therefore earn more money an example of the effect that the sewing machine had on the stitching time required was interestingly established through a series of experiments conducted by the wheeler and wilson company four hand sewers and four sewingmachine operators were used to provide the average figures in this comparative time study the results of which were published in 186174 number of stitches per minute by hand by machine patent leather fine stitching 7 175 binding hats 33 374 stitching vamped shoes 10 210

was also developing in 1860 oliver f winchester a shirt manufacturer of new haven connecticut stated that his factory turned out 800 dozen shirts per week using 400 sewing machines and operators to do the work of 2000 hand sewers the price for hand sewing was then 3 per week which made labor costs 6000 per week the 400 machine operators received 4 per week making the labor cost 1600 per week allowing 150 as the cost of each machine the sewing machines more than paid for themselves in less than 14 weeks increased the operators pay by 1 a week and lowered the retail cost of the item75 the greatest savings of time which was as much as fifty percent was in the manufacture of light goodssuch items as shirts aprons and calico dresses the commissioner of patents weighed the monetary effect that this or any invention had on the economy against the monetary gain received by the patentee when he found that the patentee had not been fairly compensated he had the authority to grant a sevenyear extension to the patent76 the sewing machine also contributed to the popularity of certain fashions readymade cloaks for women were a business of a few years standing when the sewing machine was adopted for their manufacture in 1853 machine sewing reduced the cost of constructing the garment by about eighty percent thereby decreasing its price and increasing its popularity in new york city alone the value of the cloak and mantilla manufacture in 1860 was 61840077 crinolines and hoopskirts were easier to stitch by machine than by hand and these items had a spirited period of popularity due to the introduction of the sewing machine braiding pleating and tucking adorned many costume items because they could be produced by machine with ease and rapidity in addition to using the sewing machine for the manufacture of shirts collars and related mens furnishings the machine was also used in the production of mens and boys suits and reportedly gave a vast impetus to the trade78 the army however was not quite convinced of the sewing machines practical adaptation to its needs although a sewing machine was purchased for the philadelphia quartermaster depot as early as 1851 they had only six by 1860 on march 31 1859 general jesup of the philadelphia depot wrote to a nechard company stating that the machine sewing had been tried but was not used for clothing only for stitching caps and chevrons in another letter on the same day to messers hebrard co louisiana steam clothing factory n orleans jesup states machine sewing has been tried with us and though it meets the requirements of a populous and civilized life it has been found not to answer for the hard wear and tear and limited means of our frontier service particular attention has been paid to this subject and we have abandoned the use of machines for coats jackets and trousers etc and use them on caps and bands that are not exposed to much hard usage79 at this period prior to the civil war the army manufactured its own clothing as the demands of war increased more and more of the armys clothing supplies were furnished on open contractwith no specifications as to stitching80 machine stitching in fact is found in most of the civil war uniforms one of the problems that most probably affected the durability of the machine stitching in the 1850s was the sewing thread a problem that was not solved until the 1860s and which is discussed later under thread for the machine illustration figure 55blakes leatherstitching machine patent model of july 6 1858 the inventor claimed the arrangement of the mechanism used and an auxiliary arm capable of entering the shoe which enabled the outer sole to be stitched both to the inner sole and to the upper part of the shoe smithsonian photo 50361 shoe manufacture another industry that was aided by the new invention was that of shoe manufacture although the earliest sewingmachine patents in the united states reflect the inventors efforts to solve the difficult task of leather stitching and although machines were used to a limited extent in stitching some parts of the shoe in the early and mid1850s it was not until 1858 that a machine was invented that could stitch the sole to the inner sole and to the upper part of the shoe this was the invention of lyman r blake and was patented by him on july 8 1858 the patent model is shown in figure 55 blake formed a chainstitch by using a hooked needle which descended from above to draw a thread through the supporting arm serving as the machines bedplate the arm was shaped to accommodate the stitching of all the parts of the shoe illustration figure 56harris patent thread cutter 1872 smithsonian photo p6397 illustration figure 57wests patent thread cutter 1874 smithsonian

machine in their manufacture the first machine sewed bootees were purchased by the army in 1861 inventors continued their efforts the most prominent of these was gordon mckay who worked on an improvement of the blake machine with robert mathies in 1862 and then with blake in 1864 reportedly the government at first preferred the machinestitched shoes as they lasted eight times longer than those stitched by hand during the war the army purchased 473000 pairs but in 1871 the quartermaster general wrote no complaints regarding the quality of these shoes were received up to february 1867 when a board of survey which convened at harts island new york harbor reported upon the inferior quality of certain machine sewed bootees of the mckay patent issued to the enlisted men at that post the acting quartermaster general col d h rucker april 10 1867 addressed a letter to all the officers in charge of depots with instructions not to issue any more of the shoes in question but to report to this office the quantity remaining in store from these reports it appears that there were in store at that time 362012 pairs m s bootees all of which were ordered to be and have since been sold at public auction81 the exact complaint against the shoes was not recorded possibly the entire shoe was stitched by machine it was found that although machinestitched shoes were more durable in some respects and the upper parts of most shoes continued to be machine stitched pegged soles for the more durable varieties remained the fashion for a decade or more as did custom handstitched shoes for those who could afford them other uses the use of sewing machines in all types of manufacturing that required stitching of any type continued to grow each year while the principal purpose for which they were utilized continued to be the manufacture of clothing items by the year 1900 they were also used for awnings tents and sails cloth bags bookbinding and related book manufacture flags and banners pocketbooks trunks and valises saddlery and harnesses mattresses umbrellas linen and rubber belting and hose to the aggregate sum of nearly a billion dollars97998841382 sewingmachine

common sewing needle but the latter had never become an important permanent industry in the united states since the manufacture of practical sewing machines was essentially an american development and the eyepointed needle a vital component of the machine it followed that the manufacture of needles would also develop here although such a manufacture was established in 185283 foreign imports still supplied much of the need in the 1870s as more highly specialized stitching machines were developed an everincreasing variety of needles was required and the industry grew illustration figure 64the treadle of the machine was also used to help create music george d garvie and george wood received patent 267874 nov 21 1882 for a cover for a sewing machine provided with a musical instrument and means for transmitting motion from the shaft of the sewing machine to the operating parts of the musical instrument although no patent model was submitted by the inventors the musical sewing machine cover was offered for sale as early as october 1882 as shown by this advertisement that appeared in the sewing machine news that month smithsonian photo 57983 soon after the sewing machine was commercially successful special attachments for it were invented and manufactured these ranged from the simplest devices for cutting thread to complicated ones for making buttonholes see figs 56 through 66 illustration figure 65this fanning attachment was commercially available from james morrison co in the early 1870s it sold for one dollar as stated in the advertising brochure from which this engraving was copied other inventors also patented similar implements smithsonian photo 45513 the first patent for an attachment was issued in 1853 to harry sweet for a binder used to stitch a special binding edge to the fabric other related attachments followed among these were the hemmer which was similar to the binder but turned the edge of the same piece of fabric to itself as the stitching was performed guides for stitching braid in any pattern as directed by the movement of the goods below were also developed this was followed by the embroiderer an elaborate form of braider the first machine to stitch buttonholes was patented in 1854 and the first buttonhole attachment in 1856 but the latter was not practical until improvements were made in the late 1860s special devices for refilling the bobbins were invented and patented as early as 1862 and the popularity of tucked and ruffled garments inspired inventors to provide sewingmachine attachments for these purposes also to keep the seamstress cool c d stewart patented an attachment for fanning the operator by an action derived from the treadle fig 65 while electric sewing machines did not become common until the 20th century several 19thcentury inventors considered the possibility of attaching a type of motor to the machine one was the 1871 patent of solomon jones who added an electro motor to an 1865 bartlett machine fig 66 the attachments that were developed during the latter part of the 19th century numbered in the thousands many of these were superfluous most of the basic ones in use today were developed by the 1880s and remain almost unchanged even the recently popular home zigzag machine an outgrowth of the buttonhole machine was in commercial use by the 1870s illustration figure 66jones electro motor patent model of 1871 on a bartlett sewing machine smithsonian photo p63104 sewingmachine improvements have been made from time to time like other mechanical items the machine has become increasingly automatic but the basic principles remain the same one of the more recent developments patented84 in 1933 by valentine naftali et al is for a manufacturing machine that imitates hand stitching this machine uses a twopointed floating needle that is passed completely through the fabricthe very idea that was attempted over one hundred years ago the machine is currently used by commercial manufacturers to produce decorative edgestitching that very closely resembles hand stitching thread for the machine illustration figure 67sixcord cabled thread the need for a good thread durable enough to withstand the action of machine stitching first created a problem and ultimately another new industry in this country when the sewing machine was first developed the inventors necessarily had to use the sewing thread that was available but although the contemporary thread was quite suitable for hand sewing it did not lend itself to the requirements of the machine cotton thread then more commonly a threeply variety had a glazed finish and was wiry silk thread frequently broke owing to abrasion at the needle eye for the most part linen thread was too coarse or the fine variety was too expensive all of the thread had imperfections that went unnoticed in the hands of a seamstress but caused havoc in a machine quality silk thread that would withstand the rigors of machine stitching could be produced but it was quite expensive also a new type of inexpensive thread was needed the obvious answer lay in improving the cotton thread85 in addition to the popular threeply variety cotton thread was also made by twisting together either two single yarns or more than three yarns increasing the number of yarns produced a more cylindrical thread the earliest record of a sixply cotton thread was about 184086 and in 1850 c e bennett of portsmouth new hampshire received a gold medal for superior sixcord or sixply spool cotton at the fair of the american institute but the thread was still wiry and far from satisfactory by the mid1860s the demonstrated need for thread manufacturers in america brought george a clark and william clark third generation cottonthread manufacturers of paisley scotland to newark new jersey where they built a large mill george clark decided that a thread having both a softer finish and a different construction was needed he produced a sixcord cabled thread made up of three twoply yarns see fig 67 the thread was called clarks our new thread which was later shortened to ont the basic machinethread problem was solved when other manufacturers used the sixcord cabled construction they referred to their thread as best sixcord87 or superior sixcord88 to distinguish it from the earlier variety made up of six single yarns in a simple twist another new side industry of the sewing machine was successfully established manufacture and export to 1900 sewing machines were a commodity in themselves both at home and abroad in 1850 there were no establishments exclusively devoted to the manufacture of sewing machines the few constructed were made in small machine shops the industry however experienced a very rapid growth during the next ten years by 1860 there were 74 factories in 12 states89 mainly in the east and midwest90 producing over 111000 sewing machines a year in addition there were 14 factories that produced sewingmachine cases and attachments the yearly value of these products was approximately four and a half million dollars of which the amount exported in 1861 was 61000 although the number of sewingmachine factories dropped from 74 in 1860 to 69 by 1870 the value of the machines produced increased to almost sixteen million dollars the number of sewingmachine companies fluctuated greatly from year to year as many attempted to enter this new field of manufacture some were not able to make a commercial success of their products the civil war did not seem to be an important factor in the number of companies in business in the north although one manufacturer ceased operations in richmond virginia and a vermont firm converted to arms manufacture several companies began operations during the war years of the 69 firms in business in 1870 only part had been in business since 1860 or before some were quite new as a result of the expiration of the howe patent renewal in 1867 probably due to the termination of many of the major patents there were 124 factories in 1880 but the yearly product value remained at sixteen million dollars the 1890 census reports only 66 factories with a yearly production of a little less than the earlier decade but by 1900 the yearly production of a like number of factories had reached a value of over twentyone million of which four and a half million dollars worth were exported annually the total value of american sewing machines exported from 1860 to 1900 was approximately ninety million dollars the manufacture of sewing machines made a significant contribution to the economic development of 19thcentury america footnotes 73 eighth census 1860 manufactures clothing united states census office published government printing office

manufacture in the south was just beginning to blossom when it was curtailed by the outbreak of the civil war see lester sewing machine figure 109 on page 102 ii american sewingmachine companies of the 19th century during the latter half of the 19th century there was a total of two hundred or more sewingmachine companies in the united states although a great many manufacturingtype machines were sold this business was carried on by relatively few companies and most were primarily concerned with the familytype machines a representative number of these family machines together with information concerning both the company and serialnumber dating are found in figures 68 through 132 a great many of the companies were licensed by the combination but in addition some companies were constructing machines that did not infringe the patents other companies infringed the patents but managed to avoid legal action and there were numerous companies that mushroomed into existence after the combination was dissolved in 1877 most of the latter were very shortlived it is difficult to establish the exact dates of some of these companies as many of their records were incomplete or have since disappeared even a great many of the combination records were lost by fire a summary of the existing records kept by the combination is given in figure 37 as will be noted in the subsequent listing only a small percentage of the companies were in business for a period longer than ten years of those that continued longer all but a few had disappeared by 1910 today there are about sixty united states sewingmachine companies most of them manufacture highly specialized sewing machines used for specific types of commercial work only a few produce family or homestyle machines foreign competition has increased and the high cost of skilled labor in this country has made competition in this consumerproduct field increasingly difficult the countless varieties of american family sewing

johnsons extended patent of april 18 1867 although it was small and hand turned it used two threads and a shuttle to form a lockstitch the machine was sufficiently popular for wilson to introduce an improved model in the early 1870s which he called the new buckeye w g wilson continued to manufacture sewing machines until about the mideighties although the buckeye machines were discontinued in the seventies smithsonian photo 45524a illustration figure 78centennial sewing machine 1876 the centennial machine was basically a mclean and hooper sewing machine which was renamed to take advantage of the coming centennial celebration it was based on the patents of j n mclean march 30 1869 and august 2 1870 and made a twothread chainstitch only about five hundred centennial machines were manufactured in 1873 but by 1876 over three thousand had been constructed the machines were advertised on white circulars which were printed in red and blue and engraved with two women sewing one by hand labeled sewing in 1776 and one at a centennial sewing machine labeled sewing in 1876 there is no record that the machines were made after 1876 smithsonian photo 48216t illustration figure

baker machine the nettleton raymond machine and the earlier singlethread windsor machine the improvements were made and patented by edwin clark on december 6 1859 widely advertised the machines sold for 35 with a footpower table they could also be operated by hand over three thousand were manufactured and sold and preparations were being made to continue manufacture of the earlier singlethread windsor originally made by the companys predecessor vermont arms co when the civil war broke out a flood of arms orders arrived and the sewingmachine manufacture was discontinued early in the summer of 1861 the sewingmachine equipment and business was sold to grout white of massachusetts smithsonian photo 48216 illustration figure 80du laney sewing machine of about 1872 most of the small simple

machine was used as a patent model for certain minor improvements in 1859 it has the name eureka painted on the top and the following inscription incised on the baster plate eureka shuttle s m co 469 broadway ny although it is a shuttle machine it carries no patent dates and was not included in the howe royalty records neither is it listed in the obsolescence list published in 1881 the company probably could not pay its royalty fees and was forced out of business almost immediately if this machine had not been used as a patent model no record of the companys existence might remain it should be noted that as in most shuttle machines the head was meant to be set into a treadlepowered table since most tables are very similar they are not required for identification smithsonian photo 48328c

does not certify that a machine is an original howe although elias howe was granted a patent for the lockstitch machine in 1846 he did not establish a sewingmachine factory for about twenty years early in the 1850s and later through the combination however he licensed others to make machines using his patent these machines bore that patent date for which a royalty was being paid among his early licensees was his elder brother amasa who organized the howe sewing machine co in 1854 the amasa howe machines were very good ones and in 1862 amasa won the prize medal at the london international exhibition this immensely increased the popularity of the machine and elias offered to join amasa by building a large factory at bridgeport connecticut to fill the increasing demand for more machines the machines produced at bridgeport however although imitating the amasa howe machines proved inferior in quality amasa found that rather than helping his business reputation his brothers efforts were hurting him and he severed business relations with elias because of their brief association the 1862 prize medal awarded to a b howe was sometimes credited to elias the latter did receive awards for his patent but never for his manufactured machines when the two brothers dissolved their joint venture elias attempted to call his new company the howe sewing machine co but amasas claim that this name had been his exclusive property for many years was upheld by the courts elias then omitted the word sewing and called his company simply the howe machine co after elias died in 1867 the company was run by his sonsinlaw the stockwell brothers to distinguish their machines from those of a b howe they marked each machine with a brass medallion picturing the head and flowing locks of elias howe they also continued to advertise their machine as the original howe in about 1873 b p howe amasas son sold the howe sewing machine co to the stockwell brothers who

existing machines indicates that they were manufactured in 1856 and 1857 and possibly a little longer this one from 1857 bears the serial number 624 so we know that several hundred were manufactured the head is ornately attractive slightly reminiscent of wheeler wilson models and of standard size smithsonian photo 48329b illustration figure 104lady sewing machine of about 1859 the contemporary name of this machine is unknown the unusual design of the head or main support is based in part on the design patent number 216 of isaac f baker issued april 10 1849 for a new and useful design for ornamenting furniture called cora munro who was a character in james fenimore coopers last of the mohicans the design shows a female figure wearing a riding dress and hat that is ornamented with a plume and a bow her right hand holds a riding stick and the left her skirt trunks of trees and foliage complete the baker design which is known to have been used for girandoles of the period a companion design was also patented by baker number 215 which is in the form of a man in military costume and is named major heyward for another character in last of the mohicans the sewing machines based on the cora munro design also use branch designs as the overhanging arms a mother bird sits in the upper branch and descends to feed a young bird as the machine is in operation the one illustrated was used as the machine submitted with a request for patent by george hensel of new york city for which patent 24737 was issued on july 12 1859 since hensels patent application was for an improvement in the feed there was no need for the highly decorative head unless such a machine was commercially available the patent specifications merely state that the head is ornamented another sewing machine of this type was used as the patent model by sidney parker of sing sing new york number 24780 issued on the same date as the hensel patent parkers patent also covered an improved feeding mechanism in the patent description however the inventor states that the general form of the machine is not unlike others now in use by this he might have meant in the design or possibly in the basic structural form other than the two machines described no other examples are known to have survived but lady or cora munro sewing machines were manufactured smithsonian photo 45506d

conn there was a parker sewing machine manufactured by the charles parker co of meriden but his machine was a doublethread chainstitch machine and was licensed by the combination the landfear machine may have been an earlier attempt by a predecessor or closely related company the landfear patent was for a shuttle machine but it also included a mode for regulating stitch length the name chosen for this machine may be incorrect since the singlethread chainstitch mechanism is primarily that of w h johnson but since the johnson patent also was used on other machines the name landfear was assigned the machine was probably another attempt to evade royalty payment to the combination the serial number 262 indicates that at least that many machines were manufactured although this model is the only one known to be in existence the support arm of the machine head is iron cast as a vase of flowers and painted in natural colors the paint on the head is original but the table has been refinished and

machines was patented and manufactured by willford h nettleton and charles raymond whose first patent was received on april 14 1857 the patent model believed to be a commercial machine is beautifully silverplated whether this was a special oneofakind model or whether the inventors tried to make a commercial success of a silverplated machine is not known the machine made a twothread chainstitch taking both threads from commercial spools by october 1857 the inventors had received their second patent this time the machine was brass and giltbrighter but less expensive at the same time nettleton raymond began manufacturing sewingshears machines under the patent of j e hendricks by the latter half of 1858 nettleton raymond had moved from bristol connecticut to brattleboro vermont the patented improvement of the twothread chainstitch machine received that year was in the name of raymond assignor to nettleton although the machines of this type bear neither name nor patent date no record of the price for which they were sold has been found but it would be fair to estimate that it was probably about 25 this style of machine was discontinued when the manufacture of the simpler more profitable new england model began a machine that raymond had initiated just before the partners left bristol smithsonian photo 45505e illustration figure 112raymond patent model march 9 1858

illustration figures 112 and 113new england sewing machines the small handturned sewing machines some of which were called common sense were manufactured by at least three companies and possibly more the earliest ones were those made by nettleton raymond based on charles raymonds patent of march 9 1858 which featured a hinged presser foot acting as the top feed on july 30 1861 raymond received a patent for an improved looper this date is found on all machines later manufactured by the inventor in 1858 nettleton and raymond had moved from bristol connecticut to brattleboro vermont also in brattleboro at this time were thomas h white and samuel barker who were manufacturing a small machine called the brattleboro white left vermont in 1862 and went to massachusetts there in partnership with william grout he also began to manufacture new england machines these were basically the same as the raymond machines after a short time grout left the partnership with white and moved to winchendon there continuing to make new england machines for approximately one more year in 1865 j g folsom of winchendon exhibited a new england machine at the tenth exhibition of the massachusetts charitable mechanics association along with his globe machine whether both machines were manufactured by him or whether he might have been exhibiting one of grouts machines is not known there is no record that new england machines were manufactured after 1865 there is a great similarity between these machines and the improved common sense sewing machines of the 1870s it is believed that the name common sense was given by frugal new englanders to several of the cheaper chainstitch machines of the 1860s illustration figure 114pratts second patent model march 3 1857 probably a commercial machine

manufacture many types of handsome wooden cases were developed to house the mechanisms although such cases increased the total cost they were greatly admired and were purchased whenever family funds permitted the machine was based on the patents of william p uhlinger a mechanical patent for a double chainstitch machine on august 17 1858 antedated may 8 and a patent for the casing on december 28 1858 the machine head was lowered into the casing as the lid was brought forward and closedan idea much ahead of its time this quaker city machine serial number 18 was purchased by benjamin f meadows of lafayette alabama for 150 just prior to the civil war relatively few machines of this type were manufactured and the quaker city sewing machine co existed for only a few years its apparent hope for a southern market was shortlived and it was unable to compete either with the companies licensed under the combination or with those producing less expensive machines smithsonian photo 46953a

and singer and the batchelder patent together with their own design patents in 1867 the company moved from biddeford maine to chicopee falls massachusetts in the same year they began manufacturing a

was manufactured from 18581861 their secondstyle family machine was called the traverse shuttle machineletter a it was manufactured from 1859 to 1865 when they introduced their third family machine and called it the new family sewing machine this style machine continued until about 1883 when the improved family machine appeared in addition to the lockstitch machines singer also manufactured chainstitch machines and many highly specialized manufacturing machines from 1857 through the 1880s the singer machines were marked with two serial numbers it is possible that the numbers were related to the combination royalties paid by the singer company until about 1873 there was a difference of exactly 4000 in the two numbers thus one machine would be marked 12163 and directly below it would be marked 16163 from 1873 the last three digits of the two numbers continued to be the same but the lower number might be much lower in value than either number used in earlier years the larger number is believed to have been a record of total production while the lower number may have referred to a machine of a particular style the singer company records can shed no light on the meaning of the top or lower of the two serial numbers generally in the earlier machines the difference in the two numbers will not affect the dating of a machine by more than one year since dating by serial number can only be estimated the two numbers do not add an appreciable variable prior to 1873 only the larger number however should be considered in dating machines after 1873 serial number year 1100 1850 101900 1851

taken directly from the spoolto form a chainstitch the machine was operated basically by treadle but also by hand the drive wheel is missing on this machine but it would normally appear on the right the name and patent date were painted on the end of the machine this was true of many other machines of this period which is why so many go unidentified once the paint has become worn several thousand

1856 a few of his machines were made in 1850 the article continued several of these machines are nearly finished persons desirous of seeing them can be gratified by calling upon messrs jones lee a watson machine was exhibited by jones lee at the sixth exhibition of the massachusetts charitable mechanics association held in boston in september 1850 in 1853 a watson machine was exhibited at the new york industry of all nations exhibition but this was a singlelooping machine watson received a patent for this singlethread machine on november 25 1856 in the december 13 1856 issue of scientific american a machine called watsons family sewing machine was illustrated and described it was a small machine only 8 by 5 inches manufactured by watson wooster and selling for 10 references to the

the wheeler wilson co watertown connecticut and from 1856 to 1876 it was wheeler wilson mfg co bridgeport connecticut the style of the head changed very little during these years see figs 26 and 27 both a table style with iron legs and a cabinet model were made the head was usually mounted to stitch from left to right in 1861 the company introduced the famous glass presser foot patented on march 5 of that year by j l hyde the presser foot was made of metal but shaped like an open into which was slid a small glass plate with a hole for the needle descent the glass allowed the seamstress to observe the stitching and to produce very closeedge stitching it remained a favorite of many women for years in 1876 the new no 8 machine was introduced and a new series of serial numbers was initiated it is therefore imperative to know that the machine is one of the earlier style machines before using the following list of serial numbers to date the machines approximately as follows

white sewing machines date from 1876 thomas h white had been busy in the manufacture of sewing machines for many years prior to this white is known to have been associated with barker in the manufacture of the brattleboro machine and later with grout in producing one of the several new england machines in 1866 he moved to cleveland ohio and began manufacturing machines for sale under special trade names through selling organizations in 1876 the white sewing machine company was formed and machines were sold under the white name the machine illustrated is a standard lockstitch machine which would have been set into a sewingmachine table and operated by a treadle the small handle was used to start the wheel and thus the stitching operation in the forward direction this

popular and the most reliable of the many chainstitch machines in addition to the basic mechanical patents gibbs also patented the design of the sewingmachine head in 1860 in the specifications he described it as an open ring set on a base or pedestal the lower part of the open section supported the cloth plate the design of the head intentionally or not formed a perfect letter g the initial of the inventor later the machine head as a letter g was incorporated into the companys trademark additional patents were also granted to james willcox for a leg and treadle design and to charles willcox

united states family weaver wagner and williams some of these names may have been a special name given to machines manufactured by one of the known companies but at least a few are names of machines manufactured for a very short time prior to 1881 about which we would like to know more iii chronological list of us sewingmachine patent models in the smithsonian collections there are more than seven hundred sewingmachine patent models and a similar number of attachment models in the smithsonian collections most of these machines were received in 1926 when the patent office disposed of its collection of hundreds of thousands of models prior to 1880 models had been required with the patent application although the requirement was discontinued that year patentees continued to furnish models for another decade or so all models prior to 1836 were lost in a patent office fire of that year but since the sewingmachine patent history dates from the 1840s most of the historically important ones of this subject have been preserved these models form a valuable part of the record of the invention supplementing the drawings and the text of the written specifications the early sewingmachine models were made to order either by the inventor or a commissioned model maker as soon as sewing machines were produced commercially it was less expensive for the patentee to use a commercial machine of the period to which he added his change or improvement than to have a complete model constructed to order some of the commercial machines used in this way are the only examples known to be in existence and as such are of more interest in establishing the history of the manufactured machine than for the minor patented changes during the period of the sewing machine combination many patentees attempted to invent and patent the different machine this was either a radical change in style or an attempt to produce a far lessexpensive type of machine these machines were not always put into commercial production but the patent models give an indication of the extent to which some inventors went to simplify or vary the mechanics of machine sewing the following is

sewing thread from yarns spun at the pawtucket rhode island mill in about 1794 cotton thread did not become a manufactured item at that time slater turned all his interests to producing cottontwist yarns needed for the warps of cotton fabrics by 1809 however the agents of almy and brown partners and distributors for slater were advertising cotton thread as follows factory cotton and thread store no 26 court street opposite concert hall george connell agent for almy and brown of providence and pawtucket manufactories has now for sale from eight to ten thousand weight of yarn for weaving five hundred pounds cotton thread in hanks from no 12 to 60 of a superior quality and very white91 although it was a short hop from the spinning of cotton warps to the twisting of these cotton yarns to form a sewing thread the general manufacture of cotton thread as an industry did not originate in the united states but rather in scotland in the early 19th century napoleons blockade which curtailed great britains importation of silkneeded not only for fabrics but also for making heddle strings for the loomsstimulated the production of cotton thread there james and patrick clark in desperation attempted to substitute cotton for silk in their manufacture of these heddle strings when they were successful they considered that if cotton could be used successfully for this purpose it could also be made suitable for sewing thread in 1812 they built a factory in paisley scotland which had long been noted for its textile industries the thread was sold in hanks about 1820 james sons james and john who were now running j j clark co began to wind the thread on spools for this service they charged an extra halfpenny which was refunded when the empty spool was returned the thread was usually a threeply or socalled threecord thread about 1815 james coats also of paisley started manufacturing thread at ferguslie scotland his two sons took over the company in 1826 and formed the j p coats company another brother andrew coats became the selling agent in the united states about 1840 but the cottonthread industry was not fully launched as reported in an 1853 scientific american there was more american thread made ten years ago than there is today92 it was not until the sixcord cabled cotton thread which was suitable for both machine and hand sewing was perfected that the industry progressed into full operation footnotes 91 william r bagnall textile industries of the united states cambridge mass 1893 vol 1 p 164 vi biographical sketches barthelemy thimonnier the first man known to have put a sewing machine into practical operation barthelemy thimonnier was a frenchman of obscure parentage his father a textile dyer of lyon left that city in 1793 as a result of the revolution and journeyed with his family to larbresle where barthelemy was born in august of that year the family resources were small and although the young thimonnier was able to begin studies at the seminaire de saintjean at lyons he soon was forced to leave school for financial reasons and return to his home then at amplepuis there he learned the tailoring trade and by 1813 was fairly well established in his own shop at that time many of the towns inhabitants were weavers and almost every house possessed one or two looms the noise of the shuttle echoed from these family workshops thimonnier noted the relatively small amount of time needed to weave a fabric compared with the slow painstaking task of sewing a garment by passing the needle in and out for each stitch of each seam when his mind began to dwell on the idea of producing a machine to do this stitching another of the towns occupations supplied him with a clue and an additional incentive this village industry produced a type of embroidery work called point de chainette in which a needle with a small hook was used to form the chainstitch a popular type of decorative stitch long used in countries all over the world it was thimonniers plan to use this type of hooked needle and produce the stitch by machine employing it both as a decorative stitch and a seamforming one in 1825 thimonnier moved to st etienne where he became completely absorbed in the idea of inventing a sewing machine ignorant of any of the principles of mechanics he worked alone and in secret for four years neglecting his tailoring business to the extent that neighbors looked upon him as peculiar if not crazy by 1829 he had not only mastered the mechanical difficulties of bringing his dream to realization but also had made the acquaintance of the man who helped him to success ferrand of lecole des mines of saintetienne became interested in the machine and helped finance thimonnier through his trials and disappointments in 1830 thimonnier received a patent on his machine which produced the chainstitch by means of a needle shaped like a small crochet hook illustration figure 133barthelemy thimonnier 17931857 from an engraving in the sewing machine advance november 15 1880 smithsonian photo 10569a thimonnier together with ferrand and a m beaunier made attempts to introduce his machine in paris by 1841 they were successful in having eighty of thimonniers machines in use sewing army clothing in a shop in paris but the fears of the tailors could not be quieted the machines were destroyed by an ignorant and infuriated mob as had been earlier laborsaving devices such as the jacquard attachment for the loom and hargreaves spinning jenny thimonnier was forced to flee to his home in st etienne once more penniless soon after this jean marie magnin an engineer from villefranchesursane became interested in thimonniers machine and provided the inventor again with financial backing in 1845 under the name of thimonnier and magnin the patent of 1830 was renewed and under it they organized the first french sewingmachine company the machines they manufactured could produce 200 stitches per minute the revolution of 1848 curtailed the manufacture and sale of the machines thimonnier remembering his unpleasant experience in 1841 decided to go to england with magnin where on february 8 1848 they received the english patent for his chainstitch machine he was also granted united states patent 7622 on september 20 1850 this later machine had some advantages over his french machine of 1830 but by this time other inventors had joined the field with machines that were more practical magnin entered a sewing machine which from the description in the catalog must have been thimonniers invention in the crystal palace exhibition in london in 1850 but because it was late in arriving it was overlooked by the judges and not even considered in the competition thimonnier died in poverty at amplepuis on july 5 1857 walter hunt walter hunt was born near martinsburg new york on july 29 1796 although little is known of hunts early childhood we do learn from the author of his obituary which appeared in scientific american july 9 1860 that even as a child he was more interested in people and what he could do for them than in what he could do to insure his own welfare he is said to have devoted his life to his friends frequently giving away his last cent when he did not have enough to provide for himself there is no record that hunt maintained a regular business other than the occupation of inventor his interests were numerous and varied he received his first patent on june 26 1826 for a machine for spinning flax and hemp during the next 33 years he patented 26 ideas in addition he sold or dropped several more his second patent was for a coach alarm and through the years he also received patents for a variety of things including a knife sharpener heating stove ice boat nail machine inkwell fountain pen safety pin bottle stopper sewing machine 1854 paper collars and a reversible metallic heel illustration figure 134walter hunt 17961860 from a daguerreotype owned by his

many rockfilled acres all possible ingenuity was necessary to secure a living the elder howe supplemented his farming by having a small gristmill a sawmill and also by manufacturing cards for the fastgrowing cotton industry of new england elias jrs earliest recollections were of the latter he worked with his brothers and sisters sticking wire teeth into strips of leather to make these cotton cards but not being very good at this his family decided to let him live out with a neighboring farmer children were leased in those days they received their board and keep in exchange for chores they would perform after a few years elias returned home and worked in his fathers mill until he was sixteen then against the wishes of his family he went to lowell massachusetts here he obtained a learners place in a machine shop where cottonspinning machinery was made and repaired in 1837 when a financial panic hit the country howe lost his job he then decided to go to boston and this marked a turning point in his career in boston he met ari davis a maker of mariners instruments and scientific apparatus howe began to work in davis shop a place to which inventors often came to ask advice about their ideas davis sometimes helped them but just as often he shouted at them in angerhe is said to have been one of the noisiest men in boston one day howe overheard his employer bellowing at a man who had brought a knitting machine to the shop to seek davis advice why are you wasting your time over a knitting machine said davis take my advice try something that will pay make a sewing machine it cant be done was the reply cant be done shouted davis dont tell me that whyi can make a sewing machine myself if you do interrupted the capitalist i can make an independent fortune for you davis like most men of many words often talked of more than he planned to do he never attempted to invent a sewing machine but the loud voices interested howe who it is said determined then that he would produce a sewing machine and win the fortune that the prosperouslooking man had asserted was waiting for such a deed a kind of lameness since birth had made physical tasks painful for howe and he perhaps felt that this would offer an opportunity to become independent of hard physical work after marrying on a journeyman machinists pay of 9 a week howes health worsened and by 1843 was so bad that he had to stop work for days at a time his wife was forced to take in sewing to maintain the family it was the sight of his wife toiling at her stitches together with the pressure of poverty that recalled to howe his earlier interest in a machine to sew he decided to make an earnest attempt to invent one watching his wife for hours at a time he tried to visualize a machine that would duplicate the motions of the arm after many trials he conceived the idea of using an eyepointed needle in combination with a shuttle to form a stitch it is possible that as some authors state the solution appeared to him in a dream a manifestation of the subconscious at work others have suggested that he may have learned of hunts machine there is a general similarity in the two not only in the combination of eyepointed needle and shuttle but in the overhanging arm and vertical cloth suspension after conceiving the idea whatever his inspiration howe determined to devote all of his time to producing a working model of his machine elias father who had then started a factory for splitting palm leaves in cambridge gave him permission to set up a lathe and a few tools in the garret of the factory elias moved his family to cambridge soon after his arrival unfortunately the building burned down and howe despaired of finding a place to work he had a friend however in george fisher who had just come into a small inheritance and howe persuaded him to enter into partnership with him for the development of the machine fisher agreed to board howe and his family which now included two children while howe completed the model fisher also agreed to supply 500 for material and tools in exchange for a half interest in a patent if one was obtained illustration figure 135elias howe jr 18191867 from an oil painting in the smithsonian institution presented by the inventors grandson elias howe stockwell smithsonian photo 622 at long last howe was able to spend his full time and concentration on building his machine his family was being fed and had a roof over its head within a few months howe had completed a model and by april 1845 had sewed his first seam see fig 14 in july of that year he sewed all the principal seams of two suits of wool clothes one for george fisher and one for himself several efforts were made to solicit public interest in the new machine one was installed in a public hall in boston and a tailor was employed to operate it at three times the regular wage the reception was similar to that of thimonniers crowds came to see the contraption but when howe tried to interest large clothing establishments in using the machine the protests of the tailors effectively blocked him he took his sewing machine to the quincy hall clothing manufactory and offered to sew up any seams brought to him daily he sat in one of the rooms demonstrating his machine and finally he challenged five of the swiftest seamstresses there to a race ten seams of equal length were prepared for stitching one was given to each of the girls while the remaining five were given to howe howe finished his five a little sooner than the girls each finished one and his seams were declared the strongest and neatest had any curved or angular work been brought he could not have stitched it still howe did not receive a single order the fear of throwing hand sewers out of work was again expressed and in addition the cost of the machine was said to be too high when it was estimated that a large shirtmaker would have to buy thirty or forty such machines the necessary large investment was dismissed as ridiculous howe was not too discouraged in the meantime he had finished a second machine for deposit with the patent specifications as the patent laws then required the second was a better made machine fig 15 and showed several minor changes as soon as the patent was issued on september 10 1846 howe and his partner returned to cambridge without the inventors enthusiasm or love of his own invention george fisher became thoroughly discouraged he had boarded howe and his family for nearly two years had furnished the money needed to purchase the tools and materials for making the two sewing machines had met the expense of obtaining the patent and the trip of howe and himself to washington representing in all an outlay of practically 2000 since no orders for machines had been received from either garment makers or tailors fisher did not see the slightest probability of the machines becoming profitable and regarded his advances of cash as a dead loss howe moved back to his fathers house with a plan to look elsewhere for a chance to introduce the machine obtaining a loan from his father he built another machine and sent it to england by his brother amasa after many discouraging attempts to interest the british amasa met william thomas a manufacturer of umbrellas corsets and leather goods thomas employed many workmen all of whom stitched by hand and he immediately saw the possibilities of a sewing machine he proposed that howe sell the machine to him for 250 sterling about 1250 thomas further proposed to engage the inventor to adapt this machine to the making of corsets at a salary of 3 a week when amasa howe returned to cambridge with the news elias was reluctant to accept thomas offer but had nothing better in sight so the brothers sailed for london in february 1847 taking with them howes first machine and his patent papers thomas later advanced the passage money for howes wife and three children so that they could join howe in england at this point historians disagree on how long howe was in thomas employ and whether he succeeded in adapting the machine to meet thomas needs he was in england long enough however to find himself without employment in a strange country his funds nearly exhausted and his wife ill he hoped to profit by the notice that his work had received and began to build another machine he sent his family home to reduce expenses while he stayed on to finish the machine after working on it for three or four months he was forced to sell it for five pounds and to take a note for that to collect enough for his passage home he sold the note for four pounds cash and pawned his precious first machine and his patent papers he landed in new york in april 1849 with but half a crown in his pocket to show for his labors a short time after he arrived he learned that his wife was desperately ill only with a loan from his father was he able to reach her side before she died friends were found to look after the children and elias returned to work as a journeyman machinist howe discovered much to his surprise that during his absence in england the sewing machine had become recognized in the united states several machines made in boston had been sold to manufacturers and were in daily operation upon investigating them he felt that they utilized all or part of the invention that he had patented in 1846 and he prepared to secure just compensation for its use the first thing he did was to regain his first machine and patent papers from the london pawnshop it was no easy matter for howe to raise the money but by summer he had managed it was sent to london with anson burlingame who redeemed the loans and by autumn of the same year the precious possessions were back in howes hands though howe gained nothing by his english experience william thomas by his modest expenditure obtained all rights to the machine for great britain this later proved to be a valuable property howe then began writing letters to those whom he considered patent infringers requesting them to pay a fee or discontinue the manufacture of sewing machines which incorporated his patented inventions some at first were willing to pay the fee but they were persuaded by the others to stand with them and resist howe this action forced howe to the courts with his fathers aid he began a suit but soon found that considerably more money than either possessed was necessary for such actions howe turned once more to george fisher but years of investing money in howes machine without any monetary return had cooled him to the idea fisher however agreed to sell his half interest and in february 1851 george s jackson daniel c johnson and william e whiting became joint owners with howe these men helped howe to procure witnesses in the furtherance of numerous suits but more money was needed than they could raise the following year a massachusetts man by the name of george w bliss was persuaded to advance the money for the heavy legal expenses needed to protect the patent bliss did this as a speculation and demanded additional security once more elias longsuffering parent came to the rescue and mortgaged his farm to get the necessary collateral only one of these suits was prosecuted to a hearing but this one relatively unimportant in itself set the precedent in it the defense relied on the earlier invention of walter hunt to oppose howes claims the defendant succeeded in proving that hunt invented perfected and sold two machines in 1834 and 1835 which contained all the essential devices in howes machine of 1846 but howe showed that the defendants machine which was a blodgett and lerow contained some features of howes machine which were not in hunts the jury decided the case in favor of howe howe later fought a vigorous battle with isaac singer but after much legal controversy the ultimate decision in that case also was in howes favor the suits and payments to each patent holder for the right to use his idea were choking the sewingmachine industry even howe could not manufacture a practical machine without an infringement finally an agreement was reached and a combination was formed by the major patent holders see pp 4142 in the meantime eight years of the first term of howes patent had expired without producing much revenue this permitted howe upon the death of his partner george bliss to buy bliss half interest for a small sum he became then the sole owner of his patent just as it was to bring him a fortune he obtained a sevenyear extension for his patent in 1860 without any difficulty and in 1867 when he applied for another extension he stated that he had received 1185000 from it though he endeavored to show that because of the machines great value to the public he was entitled to receive at least 150000000 the second application was denied during the civil war howe enlisted as a private soldier in the 17th regiment connecticut volunteers he went into the field and served as an enlisted man on occasion when the government was pressed for funds to pay its soldiers he advanced the money necessary to pay his entire regiment howe did not establish a sewingmachine factory until just before his death in 1867 one of his early licensees had been his elder brother amasa who had organized the howe sewing machine company about 1853 when elias began manufacturing machines on his own he sunk into the bedplate of each machine a brass medallion bearing his likeness elias gave his company the same name that his elder brother had used as this had been amasas exclusive property for many years he took the matter to the courts where the decision went against elias he then organized the howe machine company and began to manufacture sewing machines on october 3 1867 elias died in brooklyn new york at the home of one of his sonsinlaw the company was then carried on by his two sonsinlaw who were stockwell brothers in 1872 the howe sewing machine company was sold by amasas son to the stockwells howe machine company which in turn went out of business in the mid1880s allen benjamin wilson allen b wilson was born in the small town of willett cortlandt county new york in 1824 at sixteen he was apprenticed to a distant relative a cabinetmaker unfortunate circumstances caused him to leave this employ and in 1847 wilson was in adrian michigan working as a journeyman cabinetmaker the place and year are important for it was at this time that he conceived his idea of a sewing machine because of the distant location it is believed that he was not aware of similar efforts being made in new england wilson became ill and for many months could not work at his trade by august 1848 he was able to work again and found employment at pittsfield massachusetts resolving to develop his idea of a sewing machine he worked diligently and by november had made full drawings of all the parts according to his previous conceptions in comparison to the monetary returns received by the inventors howe and singer wilson himself did not receive as great a monetary reward for his outstanding sewingmachine inventions because of his health wilson retired in 1853 when the stock company was formed but he received a regular salary and additional money from the patent renewals wilson petitioned for a second extension of his patents on april 7 1874 stating that due to his early poverty he had been compelled to sell a half interest in a patent his first one for the sum of 200 also he stated that he had not received more than his expenses during the original fourteenyear term wilson also stated that he had received only 137000 during the first sevenyear extension period these figures were verified by his partner the petition was read before both houses of congress and referred to the committee on patents94 there was strong feeling against the extension of the wilson patents the new york daily graphic december 30 1874 reported illustration figure 136allen benjamin wilson 18241888 from a drawing owned by the singer mfg co formerly the drawing was owned by the wheeler wilson mfg co smithsonian photo 32066 so valuable has been this latter fourmotion feed that few or no clothsewing machines are now made without it the joint ownership of this feature of the wilson patents has served to bind the combination of sewingmachine builders together and enabled them to defy competition by force of the monopoly it is this feature which the combination wishes to further monopolize for seven years by act of congress the inventor has probably realized millions for his invention singer admits that his patents which are much less important paid him two millions prior to 1870 since which time he has not been compelled to render an account the wilson patents with their extended terms were worth a much larger sum they have been public property so far as the feed is concerned since june 15 1873 and will remain so if too great a pressure is not brought to bear on congress for their extension a monopoly of this feed motion for seven years more would be worth from ten to thirty millions to the ownerand would cost the people four times as much wilson had not made the millions for he only received a small percentage of the renewals earnings plus his salary from the patents owner the wheeler and wilson manufacturing company the congressional committee on patents made an adverse report in 1874 and again in 1875 and 1876 when applications for an extension were continued wilson died on april 29 1888 isaac merritt singer illustration figure 137 isaac merritt singer 18111875 from a charcoal drawing owned by the singer mfg co smithsonian photo 32066b isaac singer whose name is known around the world as a manufacturer of sewing machines was the eighth child of poor german immigrants isaac was born on october 27 1811 in pittstown new york but most of his early life was spent in oswego he worked as a mechanic and cabinetmaker but acquired an interest in the theater under the name of isaac merritt he went to rochester and became an actor in 1839 during an absence from the theater he completed his first invention a mechanical excavator which he sold for 2000 with the money singer organized a theatrical troupe of his own which he called the merritt players when the group failed in fredericksburg ohio singer was stranded for lack of funds forced to find some type of employment singer took a job in a fredericksburg plant that manufactured wooden printers type he quickly recognized the need for an improved typecarving machine after inventing and patenting one he found no financial support in fredericksburg and decided to take the machine to new york city here the firm of a b taylor and co agreed to furnish the money and give singer room in its hague street factory to build machines a boiler explosion destroyed the first machine and taylor refused to advance more money while singer was with taylor george b zieber a bookseller who had seen the typecarving machine considered its value to publishers zieber offered to help singer and raised 1700 to build another model in june 1850 the machine was completed singer and zieber took the machine to boston where they rented display space in the steampowered workshop of orson c phelps at 19 harvard place only a few publishers came to look at the machine and none wanted to buy it singer contemplating his future became interested in phelps work manufacturing sewing machines for j a lerow and s c blodgett phelps welcomed singers interest as the design of the mechanism was faulty and purchasers kept returning the machines for repairs singer examined the sewing machine with the eyes of a practical machinist he criticized the action of the shuttle which passed around a circle and the needle bar which pushed a curved needle horizontally singer suggested that the shuttle move to and fro in a straight path and that a straight needle be used vertically phelps encouraged singer to abandon the typecarving machine and turn his energies toward the improvement of the sewing machine convinced that he could make his ideas work singer sketched a rough draft of his proposed machine and with the support of zieber and phelps the work began singer continued to be active in the sewingmachine business until 1863 he made his home in paris for a short time and then moved to england while living at torquay he conceived the idea of a fabulous grecoroman mansion which he planned to have built at paignton singer called it the wigwam
