that the subscriber may see when the period for which he has prepaid is about to expire dates and the date palm even those whose knowledge of the customs of the orient extends no further than a recollection of the contents of that timehonored story book the arabian nights are doubtless aware that since time immemorial the date has been the chief food staple of the desertdwellers of the east the handful of dates and gourd of water form the typical meal and daily sustenance of millions of human beings both in arabia and in north africa and to this meager diet ethnologists have ascribed many of the peculiar characteristics of the people who live upon it buckle who finds in the constant consumption of rice among the hindoos a reason for the inclination to the prodigious and grotesque the depression of spirits and the weariness of life manifest in that nation likewise considers that the morbid temperament of the arab is a sequence of vegetarianism he points out that rice contains an unusual amount of starch namely between 83 and 85 per cent and that dates possess precisely the same nutritious substances as rice does with the single difference that the starch is already converted into sugar to live therefore on such food is not to satisfy hunger and hunger like all other cravings even if partially satisfied exercises control over the imagination this biological fact says peschel was and still is the origin of the rigid fastings prescribed by religions so widely different which are made use of by shamans in every quarter of the world when they wish to enter into communication with invisible powers peschel and buckle however are at variance as to the influence of the date diet as affecting a race and the former remarks that while no one will deny that the nature of the food reacts upon the mental powers of man the temperament evoked by different sorts is different yet we are still far from having ascertained anything in regard to the permanent effects of daily food especially as the human stomach has to a great degree the power of accommodating itself to various food substances so that with use even narcotics lose much of their effect the same author also adds that the date trains up independent and warlike desert tribes which have not the most remote mental relationship to the riceeating hindoos it remains for the reader to reconcile this disagreement of learned doctors according to his own judgment the evidence of those who subsist on the date is certainly overwhelming in its favor the assyrians tradition says asserted that it was such a great gift to them that its worth could not be too extravagantly told for they had found for the leaves the fruit the juices and the wood of the tree three hundred and sixty different uses the mohammedans adopt the date palm into their religion as an emblem of uprightness and say that it miraculously sprang into existence fully grown at the command of the prophet palm branches still enter as symbols of rejoicing into christian religious ceremonies and throughout palestine constant reference is found to the date and the palm in the naming of towns bethany means a house of dates ancient palmyra was a city of palms and the hebrew female name tamar is derived from the word in that language signifying palm in africa there is an immense tract of land between barbary and the great desert named bilidulgerid the land of dates from the profusion of the trees there growing illustration gathering dates in ceylon in this country the date as an article of food is classed with the prune the fig and the tamarind to be used merely as a luxury we find it coming to the markets at just about this time of year in the greatest quantities packed in baskets roughly made from dried palm leaves the dates gathered while ripe and soft are forced into these receptacles until almost a pasty mass often not over clean is formed their natural sugar tends to preserve them but after long keeping they become dry and hard this renders them unfit for use but they still find a sale to the itinerant vendors who after steaming them to render them soft of course at the expense of the flavor hawk them about the streets dates in the pasty condition are not relished by those who live on them nor on the other hand would we probably fancy the dried almost tasteless fruit which strung on long straws is carried in bunches by the arabs in their pouches the date palm phoenix dactylifera is the most important species of the dozen which make up its genus though slow in growth it shoots up a magnificent stem to the height sometimes of eighty feet the summit of which is covered with a graceful crown of pinnated leaves the trunk is exceedingly rough and spiny the flower spathes which appear in the axils of the leaves are woody and contain branched spadices with many flowers more than 11000 have been counted on a single male spadix as the flowers are dioecious it is necessary to impregnate the female blossoms artificially in order to insure a good crop and to this end the male spadices are cut off when the pollen is ripe and carefully shaken over the female ones at from six to ten years of age the tree bears and then remains fruitful for upward of 200 years an excellent idea of the palm in full bearing may be obtained from our illustration which represents the mode of gathering the dates of which a single tree will often yield from one to four hundredweight in a season the fruit varies much in size and quality and in the oases of the sahara fortysix varieties have been named the utilizations of the date palm and its products are very numerous the stem yields starch and timber for houses boats fences fuel etc as well as an inferior kind of sago the leaves serve as parasols and umbrellas and for material for roof covering baskets brushes mats and innumerable utensils at their base is a fiber which is spun into excellent rope when the heart of the leaf is cut a thick honeylike juice exudes which by fermentation becomes wine the toddy of india or vinegar and is also boiled down into sugar the young shoots when cooked resemble asparagus and the dates themselves are dried and ground into meal from which bread is prepared panthers as seed distributors it is well known that bees carry pollen from flower to flower and that eggs of marine animals are often carried long distances in the stomachs of aquatic birds a very curious instance of this kind showing how vegetable species may be diffused by means which no botanist however acute would be likely to think of is mentioned by mr alfred smee who states that attached to the skin of a panther recently shot in india were found numerous seeds each of which had two perfect hooks manifestly designed to attach themselves to foreign bodies as the panther moved about it collected the seeds on the skin and carried them about wherever it went but when it rubbed against the shrubs it of necessity brushed some off and thus distributed them one of the seeds produced a handsome plant and beautiful clusters of tubular flowers it was immediately recognized to be the martynia diandraa plant which although introduced into england as far back as 1731 has scarcely ever been cultivated although it has been commented on by botanists and other writers for posteritya suggestion the irish gentleman who declined to aid an enterprise for the benefit of posterity remarking that posterity had never done anything for him was after all the sport made of him no unfair representative of the bulk of mankind there is talk enough about doing great things for the advantage of future ages but the real motive is apt to be something very different to perpetuate their own name or fame men or nations often set up lasting monuments and sometimes unintentionally convey thereby to after times a few more or less instructive indications of the artistic or industrial skill of their day and generation to further their own immediate ends or to secure some benefit to their immediate descendants men frequently undertake great material enterprises and sometimes the work so done remains for ages the source of perennial good but very rarely if ever can it be said that any work of man was undertaken solely or even chiefly for the benefit of posteritymore rarely still for remote posterity hence it happens that we owe far more to accident to fire rapine volcanic outbursts and the protecting care of desolation for the knowledge we have of times long past than to any intentional legacies of art or learning left us by the men of those times the lost and abandoned tools weapons and ornaments of the stone age are all that we have to tell us of the childhood of humanity had no fiery disasters ever overtaken the piledwellers of the swiss lakes we should probably have never heard of such a people to the mud and ashes of vesuvius rather than to the historians of the roman empire we owe the best of our knowledge of how roman cities looked and roman citizens lived eighteen hundred years ago in the fragments of a terra cotta library buried in the ruins of a royal palace we find almost our only records of the arts and sciences of ancient assyria under the ash heaps of a forgotten age in cyprus cesnola finds the only known vestiges of a primitive civilization reaching far back into the domain of mythology thanks to the destroyers of troy and mycen and the protective care of temporary oblivion schliemann is now able to verify tradition and lay before an astonished and delighted world numerous precious relics of heroic ages hitherto remembered only in song who can estimate the value of these and similar findings to usthe value of the revelations they bring of mans condition in those remote ages who can say how many or how few the ages will be ere the time comes when the antiquaries of the future will be rejoicing over equally fragmentary vestiges of the doings and possessions of our day on the other hand who can estimate the value of the knowledge lost beyond hope of recovery or the checks to human progress experienced in the repeated wiping out so to speak of the higher races and the civilizations they embodied and who can say that similar disasters may not come again and again to humanity suppose a pestilence peculiarly fatal to the white race should fall upon the world today crippling perhaps exterminating the now dominant civilized nations how long would the material elements of our science and art or general culture remain with power to enlighten the barbarous tribes that would inherit the earth human progress has more than once been set back for centuries by such natural or unnatural causes leaving the sites of once splendid civilizations to be overrun with barbaric hordes knowing nothing of the better times that went before suppose again that by one of those geologic changes so numerous in the history of our unstable globe the existing continents should sink a thousand feet every center of modern civilization would be submerged the great social and political organizations of humanity would be broken up and in the wreck of nations that would ensue very little of the glory and culture of the race could survive the earth is dotted with vestiges of lost and forgotten empires can we reasonably assume in the face of such facts that the nations of today are immortal the question is shall we continue to trust to chance as all other civilizations have for the preservation of the conquests we have made among the forces and secrets of nature or shall we do something positive for posterity and leave the ages to come some certain and abiding legacy of our treasures of art and learning it may be that human progress will go on and on to the end of time without a break that in the course of centuries mankind will surpass us in civilization knowledge and power as much as we surpass the earliest and rudest men we have yet found traces of maybe infinitely more in such a case what would not the scholars of say the year 5000 ad or any other future age be willing to give for a comprehensive picture of humanity as it exists todayfor a reasonably complete library of our literature science and art we may safely assume that nothing of the sort will be possible if matters are left to take their natural course by that time every structure every machine every book every work of art now in use or stored away in our libraries and galleries of art will have disappeared a prey to time the elements or the more destructive violence of man on the other hand it may be that through repeated disasters of one sort or another mankind three thousand years hence will have lost all the knowledge men ever possessed and be slowly struggling upward for the hundredth time from inherited barbarism in such a case what enormous benefits might not accrue to man from a fortunate opening up of the wealth of knowledge we possess in any supposable case between these extremes of progress or degradation a legacy of art and learning such as we might easily set apart for remote posterity would certainly be acceptable perhaps extremely useful besides it might be possible for us to set such a worthy example to those who shall come after us that come what might humanity would never be left absolutely void of the means of instruction nor any worthy human achievement be absolutely lost or forgotten the experience of these later years has demonstrated the value of such legacies even when unintentional unselected and wretchedly fragmentary it has made clear also how a legacy deliberately made may be indefinitely preserved roughly outlined the carrying out of such a truly philanthropic enterprise would involve nothing more difficult than first the construction of a practically indestructible treasure chamber in some secure place and second the preparation of a library well calculated to withstand the corroding tooth of time two kinds of structures would meet the first demandmassive pyramids of covered earth or of solid masonry or chambers hewn from the heart of some granitic hill in low latitudes where glacial action is not to be feared the pyramidal form might be preferable in more northern regions the rockcut chamber would probably be at once cheaper and more durable in either case an elevated site should be chosen as a safeguard against submergence to secure the permanence of the records would be more difficult ordinary books and papers would clearly be unsuitable for long keeping though for comparatively limited periods they might answer if securely packed in airtight waterproof cases nothing liable to spontaneous decay should be admitted stereotype plates of metal would be even more open to objection than printed sheets the noble metals would be too costly the baser would corrode and with either the value of the plates as metal would be a standing danger to the deposit the material basis of the library must be as nearly as possible worthless for other uses to insure them against the natural greed of man yet such as will hold the records sharply and faithfully under all circumstances the terra cotta tablets of ancient assyria are instructive in this connection possibly plates of artificial stone or sheets of a papiermachlike preparation of asbestos might be less bulky and equally durable having determined this point and dug from the solid rock a chamber for the reception of our legacy the next step would be the selection of its contents obviously the books to be preserved should embrace first of all lexicons and grammars of every known form of speech since it is impossible to tell which of the dialects of today will be the parents of the dominant tongue of any distant future time while we may be practically certain that some one or more of the languages of today will furnish a key to any language that men will ever use next in order would come encyclopdias the most comprehensive and complete that there might be room for the sacred books of all nations might come next then the works of the great poets historians and novelists after them the best obtainable records of art science the various industries and so on with specimens of the best and most typical of our works of art manufacture and the like the spaces between the various articles should be filled in with some insoluble and neutral substance to prevent corrosion or the infiltration of water and consequent damage to the plates then the entrance to the chamber being securely sealed permanent records should be made in many places and in various ways setting forth the purpose of the deposit its exact location and the nature of its contents among such records not the least valuable would be deeply cut polyglot inscriptions on natural cliffs in different parts of the world observation having shown that such records may remain to challenge human curiosity for ages after all other records of their time have disappeared even a single deposit of this sort might prove of enormous value to the race at some critical period of its history but the probability is that the good work would not end with one deposit from age to age this and other nations might repeat the experiment commemorating in this way important epochs in their history the fashion once set might easily become a permanent feature of all great national celebrations the cost would be comparatively small a penny contribution from each of the visitors to the philadelphia exhibition for example would have been quite sufficient to provide for a memorial of our first centennial year that would have carried an imperishable picture of the civilization of the day to the end ofour first millennium at least and we may safely infer that whatever may be the condition of the world at that not very remote epoch a memorial of that sort would be something worth having as we have intimated the custom might easily become general so that in the course of ages the earth would become dotted with such repositories of art and learning then come what might to humanitywhatever might be the ups and downs of nationswhatever moral social or intellectual advances mankind might makewhatever lapses or disasters might befall themit could hardly happen that a knowledge of any considerable period of human history or the advantage of any worthy human achievement could ever be permanently blotted out and lost it is true that posterity has never done anything of the sort for us it is true that posterity may have no valid claim on us for such a legacy but we might venture to make posterity a present it would not cost us much and it might turn out to be immensely valuable and useful to some far future age the lost arts in new york while the objects of ancient art contained in the castellani collection recently placed on exhibition in the metropolitan museum of art in this city are individually of great rarity and archological value they derive additional importance from the fact that viewed conjunctively as a collection they represent connected histories of two great industrial arts extending over many centuries both in the work of the goldsmith and of the potter we are enabled to trace progress from the earliest stages up to a period when the greatest skill was attained and even subsequently into the era of decadence in both industries we find that ancient and medival workmen possessed knowledge which we do not possess and among signor castellanis treasures may be seen handiwork which is the embodiment of two lost arts the secrets of which the modern world with all its infinitely superior wisdom has not yet rediscovered the productions in the castellani collection of precious metal workers dating from prehistoric epochs the exact dates of which are wholly unknown and covering the long period ending in the thirteenth century are represented by the contents of some twenty cases the first three of these receptacles bear no dates the ornaments which they contain are of bronze amber silver and glass the latter having become converted into opalescent silicic acid and were found in prneste modern palestrina italy and in the territory which was ancient etruria case no 4 bears date 700 bc and here is a rich treasure of primitive etruscan and phoenician ornaments of gold adorned with granulated work signor castellani considers that the workmanship of these objects is so perfect that it is impossible at the present time to explain the process of execution and very difficult to imitate it the ornaments are of two kindsthose for ordinary use and those for funereal purposes the first are massive and might be worn for years without injury the others are extremely delicate all are made of the purest gold and their decoration evinces the most consummate skill and taste on the part of the artist there is for example a small flask shaped something like an antique wine jar and about five inches in height it is of beaten gold and is covered with a pattern intended to imitate the similarly shaped designs of variegated glass of the grcophoenician period this pattern is entirely produced by minute globules of metal soldered to the surface in tiers of zigzag or vandyke patterns another specimen is a strip of gold covered with granulated lines and bearing a row of birds in relief on other ornaments are exquisitely carved heads and flowers produced apparently by hammering on the reverse of the object but with a delicacy and precision of touch which is simply marvelous the closest students of this ancient handiwork are entirely at a loss to understand how the processes of melting soldering and wire drawing which were employed in the art were performed modern workmen have failed in their attempts exactly to imitate the old ornaments and it is certain that the secret of the mechanical agents whereby it was possible to separate and join pieces of gold hardly perceptible to the naked eye is lost signor castellani has taken great pains to solve the problem reading all the treatises of medival goldsmiths inquiring of all classes of italian jewelers and experimenting with all kinds of chemicals in the hope of finding the solder wherewith the minute grains were attached to the surface of the metal at last he found some of the old processes still employed in a remote district hidden in the recesses of the apennines far from the great towns bringing away a few workmen he gave them much more instruction and at last succeeded not perhaps in equalling but certainly in rivalling the ancient productions we question whether the etruscans used fire at all in their soldering as it would be almost an impossibility to keep the excessively fine tools necessary for the work at a proper heat mr joshua rose offers the plausible suggestion that a cold flux was employed with which the workman followed the lines or dots of his pattern then the gold granules were possibly sprinkled over the surface and adhered only to the solder the superfluous grains being brushed off after the solder had set there is also a fragment of a finely woven fabric made of threads of pure gold found on the body of a woman in a tomb at metapontum this is without doubt the material to which the psalmist refers in speaking of the kings daughter having clothing of wrought gold and in the pentateuch there is reference to gold threads being used upon looms as we follow the various objects in the twenty cases above mentioned the decline of the goldworkers art when the use of enamels came into vogue is evidenced continuing on to later periods the decadence is more marked under the successors of alexander in rome under the emperors we find gold used as a mere setting for precious stones and finally the collection terminates with examples of workmanship of the time of charlemagne when the workmen had lost their cunning and the noble metal had been altogether debased to secondary uses the second instance where a lost art is exemplified in signor castellanis collection is in the glazing of the gubbio majolica we have not space here to review the magnificent series of ancient specimens of pottery in detail and thus it will suffice to say that beginning with some of the earliest pieces made by the arabs when they occupied sicily from the twelfth to the sixteenth century the collection presents examples of all the finest types of later medival art gubbio where the peculiar kind of majolica above noted was made is a small town once in the territory of the dukes of urbino and in the sixteenth century it became famous for its pottery this was attributable to the talent of one man giorgio andreoli who is reputed to have invented the wonderful luster characteristic of the gubbio ware the body of majolica is mere common clay and after the piece is finished on the wheel it is dried and burnt in a furnace after the biscuit thus prepared has been dipped in the glaze the colors are applied on the soft surface of the latter and the vitrifying process fuses all into a glossy enamel of the color of the pigment this is still the common practice and we mention it merely to show that to his pigment and glaze andreoli must have added some third substance which rendered the enamel capable of reflecting white light as blue red green or yellow lightin other words of giving the object a luster of a color wholly different from the tints of the pigment he evidently could produce any desired color at will and the effects gained are indescribably beautiful the castellani collection contains 130 superb specimens which glow like jewels in one the scene of the nativity of christ is provided with the figures in low relief and the exquisite cerulean lustre is imparted to give the effect of moonlight the rarest pieces are those of which the luster is a delicate green some blaze with yellow as if of gold others exhibit the brilliancy of the ruby while others resemble the interior of the pearl oyster shell whether this sheen is produced by polarization of the light in some manner or whether it is at all analogous to fluorescence is yet to be decided the impression of the surface with fine microscopic lines might produce an iridescence but not separate and clearly defined hues the ware was intended for ornamental purposes not for household use and it was suspended against the rich dark tapestries of the period with which walls were covered thus aiding as it were in illuminating the apartment with its exquisite radiance the blue glass deception on september 26 1871 general aj pleasonton of philadelphia pa obtained a patent for utilizing the natural light of the sun transmitted through clear glass and the blue or electric solar rays transmitted through blue purple or violet colored glass or its equivalent in the propagation and growth of plants and animals in his specification of which the above constitutes one claim he states that he has discovered special and specific efficacy in the use of this combination of the caloric rays of the sun and the electric blue light in stimulating the glands of the body the nervous system generally and the secretive organs of man and animals he also states that he finds that vegetation is vastly improved by the transmitted blue light these alleged rediscoveriesfor the general only claims to have devised the method of utilizing themwere extensively promulgated through the press early in 1871 subsequently in 1876 general pleasonton published a book on the subject the volume being appropriately bound in blue and printed in blue ink recently public attention has again been called to the subject by a new york daily journal the peculiar kind of glass in question is known as pot metal blue that is it is stained a bluish violet throughout and is not clear glass covered with flashings of blue glass it is used in greenhouses etc in connection with clear glass and in general pleasontons grapery it appears that only every eighth row of panes was blue some of the results alleged to have been obtained by exposing animals and plants are as follows twenty grape vines in their second year after being set out under the blue glass bore 1200 lbs of splendid fruit a very weak alderney bull calf was in four months developed into a strong and vigorous bull heifers when kept under blue glass may safely bear young when 18 months old a weak child weighing but 3 lbs at birth weighed at the end of four months 22 lbsthe light in this instance having come through blue curtains two majorgenerals with rheumatism were cured in three days a young lady whose hair had come out regained her tresses and to these must be added various other cures of severe ailments which we have not space here to recapitulate the above are the alleged facts and we propose to consider the supposed discovery in the light of previous investigations with reference to the theories of electricity etc advanced by general pleasonton to account for his phenomena their absurdity is so complete that we shall waste no time over them the important question in the matter and the only one in which the public is interested is whether or not blue glass is capable of producing all or any of the results imputed to its use in order to clear the way for the examination of the investigations the records of which we have carefully collected let us consider first those which general pleasonton quotes in support of his views these are 1 seunebiers researches which go to show that the blue and violet rays are the most active in determining the decomposition of carbonic acid in plants and 2 experiments of dr morichini repeated by carpa and ridolfi proving that violet rays magnetized a small needle the first statement has been totally disproved dr von bezold in his recent work on color states that the chemical processes in plants as far as they are dependent upon light are principally caused by the rays of medium and of lower refrangibility the development of the green color of the chlorophyll the decomposition of carbonic acid as well as the formation of starch etc in the grains of the chlorophyll are induced by the red green and orange rays the blue violet and ultra violet rays the same authority goes onto explain influence the rapidity of growth compel the socalled zospores to move in certain directions and alter the positions of leaves etc in confirmation of this we have sachs experiments in 1872 which show that light transmitted through the yellow solution of potassium chromate enables green leaves to decompose over 88 per cent of carbonic acid while that passed through blue ammonia copper oxide decomposes less than 8 per cent this proves the superiority of the yellow ray to decompose carbonic acid and this fact professor jw draper discovered a long time ago by the direct use of the spectrum in still further confirmation we may cite the investigations of vogel pfeiffer selim and placentim the last three have conducted researches in full knowledge of those of general pleasonton and their experiments show that yellow rays are more promotive of the evolution of carbon in animals and its absorption in plants than any others in the spectrum the violet rays having least power in these respects with the exception of the red rays in the case of animals the absorption of carbonic acid by plants and its evolution by animals we hardly need add are prime essentials to the growth and health of each the notion that light possesses a magnetizing power on steel was upset by niepce de st victor in 1861 after removing every source of error he found it impossible to make one sewing needle solarized for a very long time under the rays of light concentrated by a strong lens attract another suspended by a hair whether the light was white or colored by being made to pass through a violetcolored glass we can proceed further and even show that violet light is in some respects hurtful to plants cailletet for example says in 1868 that light which was passed through a solution of iodine in carbonic disulphide prevents decomposition altogether baudrimont says that no colored light permits vegetables to go through all the phases of their evolutions violetcolored light is positively injurious to plants they absolutely require white light this scientist instituted the most elaborate experiments on the subject ranging over 11 years from 1850 to 1861 and the result of all his labor may be summed up in the simple statement that no illumination which human ingenuity can devise is so well adapted for promoting natural processes as the pure white light provided by the creator so much by way of general denial of the claims of superior efficacy residing in blue light of any kind now we have yet to examine the peculiar variety of blue light here used sunlight can by means of the prism be split into colored rays any one of which we may isolate and so obtain a certain colored light similarly we may obtain light of a desired color by the use of a colored glass which will stop out the rays not of the hue required so that we may obtain violet light from the spectrum or by filtering sunlight through violet glass when however dr von bezold as above asserts that the violet rays have such and such an effect he means the violet of the spectrum which has its specific duty to perform in the compound light of which it is a necessary portion but the violet light of the spectrum and filtered violet sunlight are altogether different things the first as our valued contributor dr van der weyde has very clearly pointed out is a homogeneous color containing besides the luminous the invisible chemical rays without any caloric rays while the light colored by passing through violet glass is a mixture of blue rays with the red rays at the other end of the spectrum and it contains a quantity of the chemical rays belonging to the blue and the caloric rays belonging to the red in fact violet glass passes a light identical with sunlight only much reduced in power containing but a portion of its caloric chemical and luminous agency being simply deprived of its strongest rays and this the spectroscope has clearly demonstrated reduced to its simplest terms then the necessary conclusion is that the violet glass acts purely as a shade for decreasing the intensity of the solar light and in the simple fact that it does so serve as a shade lies the sole virtue if any there be of the glass in 1856 dr daubeny made experiments on the germination of seeds and in his report is this suggestive sentence in a south aspect indeed light which had passed through the ammonia sulphate of copper blue solution and even darkness itself seemed more favorable than the whole of the spectrum but this law did not seem to extend to the case of seeds placed in a northern aspect where the total amount of light was less considerable in our next issue we shall review the effects of light and darkness upon the animal organization and endeavor to account for the curing of diseases and the production of other phenomena which have been erroneously ascribed to the influence of the blue filtered sunlight the wetli mountain railroad and its disastrous trial trip among the various means proposed of late years for building lines of railroad on the steep slopes of mountains that of m wetli of zurich switzerland has attracted considerable attention from european engineers we have already laid before our readers the system of central toothed rails used on the righi and other mountain roads in europe in the wetli system instead of this rail and the pinion on the vehicle engaging it there is a drum having a helicoidal thread which engages with triangular rails this drum is attached to the locomotive the construction will be readily understood from the illustrations given herewith which we take from la nature the thread on the drum is precisely that which would be formed could a rail similar to one of the central angular rails be wrapped around it so that it always is in contact with the mid rails and necessarily prevents any bodily sliding or rolling of the vehicles over the regular track when the drum is held motionless the vshaped mid rails are securely fastened to horizontal iron ties which rest on wooden traverses the angle of the v is 50 the distance between any two traverses is 28 feet illustration fig 1the wetli mountain railroad the locomotive has three coupled axles on the mid one of which the drum is attached so as to be raised or lowered to engage the rails at the will of the engineer it being possible to cause it to act on the rails with a pressure of 37 tons the diameter of the drum is 214 feet its spiral thread is of steel very solidly attached and so made as to grip the rails to a distance of 06 inch below the level of the track in order to insure this contact on the drum axle are two pulleys which run on the exterior road and of which the diameter determines the depth of the hold of the threads these pulleys are 347 inches in diameter while the driving wheels are very slightly in excess to provide for the use of tyres m wetlis invention as we have described it was placed between woedensweil and einsiedlen switzerland the difference in altitude between these points is 1513 feet the distance 96 miles the grade is from 4 to 5 per cent over the first six miles of the way and subsequently decreases to 1 per cent the wetli railroad was established last october only on the heavy grade that is the first six miles illustration fig 2 early in november trial trips were made which did not prove satisfactory sometimes the drum thread gripped the triangular rails properly and acted well again it would wedge itself upon them and often would simply roll over their tops without engaging at all after the first trials during which very many of the rails were broken m welti readjusted the drum thread finally he concluded that he had overcome all difficulties in his apparatus and accordingly a formal trial was arranged on november 30 for about four and a half miles of the ascent the drum worked well and the hoarfrost with which the rails were thickly covered showed good contact afterward it worked irregularly but the station of schindelleghi a distance of five miles was reached without accident the locomotive dragging a car loaded with 20 tons of rails it was then attempted to make the descent by the aid of the helicoidal drum but this jumped the rails and broke them almost immediately by the aid of back pressure of steam and brakes the locomotive was stopped then unfortunately the engine was started again but hardly had the descent been resumed when it was evident that the drum was not holding and that the speed was accelerating rapidly brakes and steam were both found useless and the engine went tearing over the rails at the rate of a mile a minute of the fourteen persons in the vehicles three were thrown out and killed and the rest were more or less seriously injured the heavily loaded car left the track and tore up both central and side rails until its coupling broke the engineer with great intrepidity clung to his engine coolly giving signals to open switches so that the locomotive might run upon the level track and so expend its momentum but the engine left the rails at a sharp curve destroyed the track for about a hundred feet and finally stopped a mass of ruins with its brave engineer mortally wounded whether the wetli system can be made to work as intended by the inventor is regarded as doubtful by the engineers who have examined into the causes of the disaster leghorn hens if a man keeps leghorns he must have no garden or he must cover the top of his hen yards that leghorns are great layers and active hens there can be no denying but they are great flyers we have built our yard a lath and a half high says the poultry review but what do these saucy things care for that although they have the whole outside world to range in yet the garden seems to have a greater attraction than all the rest the other day we found it necessary to feed a weak chicken in the garden by itself so that it might be sure of its share a few minutes afterwards on looking out of the window we discovered the weak chicken in the henyard and two leghorn hens finishing up its food we went out but the two robbers had fled going around the corner we found them rolling in a flower bed a leghorn will do as much mischief in a garden in five minutes as anything we know of sawdust in rough casting siehr recommends very highly the use of sawdust in mortar as superior even to hair for the prevention of cracking and subsequent peeling off of rough casting under the action of storms and frost his own house exposed to prolonged storms on the seacoast had patches of mortar to be renewed each spring and after trying without effect a number of substances to prevent it he found sawdust perfectly satisfactory it was first thoroughly dried and sifted through an ordinary grain sieve to remove the larger particles the mortar was made by mixing 1 part cement 2 lime 2 sawdust and 5 sharp sand the sawdust being first well mixed dry with the cement and sand suint for waterproofing fabricsa german chemist has patented the waterproofing of finely woven fabrics linen cotton etc by means of suint composition he adapts his method to securing the suint to woolwashing establishments at a small cost absence of white color in animals some very curious physiological facts bearing upon the presence or absence of white colors in the higher animals have lately been adduced by dr ogle it has been found that a colored or dark pigment in the olfactory region of the nostrils is essential to perfect smell and this pigment is rarely deficient except when the whole animal is pure white in these cases the creature is almost without smell or taste this dr ogle believes explains the curious case of the pigs in virginia adduced by mr darwin white pigs being poisoned by a poisonous root which does not affect black pigs mr darwin imputed this to a constitutional difference accompanying the dark color which rendered what was poisonous to the white colored animals quite innocuous to the black dr ogle however observes that there is no proof that the black pigs eat the root and he believes the more probable explanation to be that it is distasteful to them while the white pigs being deficient in smell and taste eat it and are killed analogous facts occur in several distinct families white sheep are killed in the tarentino by eating hypericum criscum while black sheep escape white rhinoceros are said to perish from eating euphorbia candelabrum and white horses are said to suffer from poisonous food where colored ones escape now it is very improbable that a constitutional immunity from poisoning by so many distinct plants should in the case of such widely different animals be always correlated with the same difference of color but the facts are readily understood if the senses of smell and taste are dependent on the presence of a pigment which is deficient in wholly white animals the explanation has however been carried a step further by experiments showing that the absorption of odors by dead matter such as clothing is greatly affected by color black being the most powerful absorbent then blue red yellow and lastly white we have here a physical cause for the senseinferiority of totally white animals which may account for their rarity in nature for few if any wild animals are wholly white the head the face or at least the muzzle or the nose are generally black the ears and eyes are also often black and there is reason to believe that dark pigment is essential to good hearing as it certainly is to perfect vision we can therefore understand why white cats with blue eyes are so often deafa peculiarity we notice more readily than their deficiency of smell or tastedr wallace british association 1876 improved trolling hook mr henry c brush of brushs mills ny has patented through the scientific american patent agency an improved troller the novel feature in which consists in attaching a float to the shank of the implement under the revolving blade the object being to keep the troller near the surface of the water where the fish may see it more readily and whereby the liability of catching in weeds and logs is obviated illustration a is a float attached to the shank a of the troller b is the spoon which is swiveled in the usual manner the device is very simple and is claimed to prevent all the annoyance arising from the hook catching in sunken obstructions purification of wool and woolen stuff the process patented some time ago for the removal of straw burrs etc from wool by treatment with sulphuric acid has been modified by lisc as follows the stuff is worked for one to two hours in a bath consisting of about 26 gallons sulphuric acid of 3 to 6 1 lb alum lb salt and 750 grains borax it is then treated in a centrifugal machine and afterward subjected to a temperature of 212 to 248 for removal of the acid it is first washed with pure water for 1 hours then treated for two hours with fullers earth soda and lime and finally washed for two hours with fresh water as sulphuric acid can only be employed with uncolored cloths or such as have been dyed with indigo chloride of zinc and chloride of manganese diluted to 6 are substituted with fabrics otherwise dyed caffeone caffeone the aromatic principle of coffee may be isolated by distilling 5 or 6 lbs roasted coffee with water agitating the aqueous distillate with ether and afterwards evaporating the ether it is a brown oil heavier than water in which it is only very slightly soluble an almost imponderable quantity of this essential oil will suffice to aromatize a gallon of water the hemiplunger the novel form of vessel to which the above odd name has been given by its inventor m donato tommasi of paris france is a combination of a boat wholly submerged with a raft a connecting link to borrow the naturalists expression between the submerged torpedo boat and the monitor the advantages which are expected to be realized from this hybrid craft the inventor describes as follows it is evident that a vessel plunged several yards below the surface of the sea is no longer influenced by wind or wave let the sea be agitated let there be the most violent tempest yet the boat which navigates under water will never be wrecked for the same reason that a fish cannot be drowned what a beautiful vision that of traversing the ocean as a balloon floats through the air with the same tranquillity without shocks without the insupportable rolling and pitching etc the construction of the invention introduced in this glowing manner will be understood from figs 1 and 2 a is the plunger cylinder shown with its side broken away in fig 2 in fig 1 g is the rudder h the propeller and i the tube through which sea water passes to the pump in fig 2 c is the smokestack m m are compartments in which water may be admitted to increase the weight and hence the depth of flotation of the plunger the same being filled or emptied by the pump p n is the hold for merchandise partitioned off from the boiler room as shown illustration fig 1tommasis hemiplunger illustration fig 2the hemiplunger the submerged portion from the plunger a rise two hollow columns e to which metallic plates f are attached to diminish friction through the water these support the upper division or platform b the second shaft not lettered which rises above the platform in fig 1 serves to ventilate the plunger the columns e serve as shoots down which merchandise is lowered to the compartments n and their upper ends are received in two immense inverted cups attached to the bottom of the part b through these cups pass large screws which confine the columns so that by removing the connection the whole submarine apparatus may in case of necessity be freed from the upper works on each side of the platform b which is of elliptical figure is a large float seen in fig 3 which by means of racks and gearing may be raised or lowered at will usually these floats are carried at a height of a yard above the water in calm weather this distance is increased and in storms it is diminished the object of the floats being to keep the whole vessel on an even plane and to prevent too violent oscillations in order to facilitate navigation in shallow water the columns e may be made telescopic and operated by hydraulic apparatus so that they may be shortened at will any form of engine or propeller may be used illustration fig 3the hemiplunger on a voyage besides the advantage of the vessel being unaffected by waves since its submerged portion travels far below them the inventor claims that it will meet less resistance from the water than would a vessel of corresponding volume sailing on the surface it will make faster progress because it has no waves to mount and descend and hence it always travels in a nearly right line the screw being submerged at a great depth will not tend to turn the vessel from her straight path the platform being easily detachable may serve as a raft in case of injury to the submarine boat for fast travel on lakes rivers and shallow water generally m tommasi proposes to support his platform on two floats which rest on the surface of the water no weight therefore is thrown on the submarine vessel which need be constructed with only just enough buoyancy to sustain itself and its engine in this way the upper craft has no engine or other load than its cargo and as it merely rests upon the surface the inventor thinks that it will skim over the same like an ice boat on ice for war purposes the hemiplunger is especially adapted because the vulnerable portions engines boiler rudder etc are wholly out of the reach of shot guns are mounted on the platform which thus becomes a circular or elliptical turret just above the water when the vessel is in fighting trim instead of steel armor m tommasi has a new invention which he calls hydrometallic plating he reserves the details of this for future publication but generally the armor consists of tubes in which liquid is forced under a pressure equivalent to the resistance say of forged steel he thinks this will oppose shot as effectually as the solid metal and will have the additional advantage of superior lightness insoles saturated with salicylic acid have been introduced as a remedy for perspiration of the feet supreme court patent decision a united states patent was granted may 23 1854 to john myers and robert g eunson for a woodsawing machine for cutting boards into thin stuff for making picture frame and mirror backs one of the principal claims was for the employment of two deflecting plates one on each side of the circular saw by which both sides of the sawed stuff as fast as it was cut was slightly deflected so as not to bind upon the saw suit was brought by the patentee against dunbar and hopper for infringement and judgment was given in favor of the patentees in the united states circuit court this city the damages awarded being 9121 the defendants thereupon took an appeal to the supreme court of the united states which tribunal has reversed the finding of the circuit court and dismissed the complaint it was held by the supreme court that inasmuch as the use of a single deflecting plate was old well known and in common use it was simply an exercise of ordinary mechanical skill and not a patentable invention to employ a second deflecting plate although the superiority of the double deflectors for certain kinds of work appears to be conceded planing mill machinery the planing machine next to the saw is perhaps the most important agent for the conversion and manipulation of wood in use and before proceeding to consider it in its present form says the author of this article mr fh morse in the northwestern lumberman it may not be out of place to notice briefly its origin and history the first man to employ power in the operation of smoothing the surface of wood was sir samuel bentham of london england and to him belongs the honor of having discovered the principle upon which all planing machines operate a brief personal notice of this remarkable inventor will serve to show under what circumstances the planing machine originated his education was secured at the westminster school of london and as far as can be ascertained from the meager records of his life that have come down to us was of the most thorough kind both classical and scientific that could be obtained at that time 1770 when his education was finished he was bound to the master shipwright of the woolwich dockyard to whom he served an apprenticeship of seven years acquiring in that time a practical knowledge of the methods of working in both wood and iron then in vogue and receiving the best scientific instruction that the development of that period afforded after his term of apprenticeship had expired he spent about two years in looking up the local peculiarities of other shipyards whose methods of working differed in some respects from those of the woolwich mechanics in 1779 he was ordered by the government to examine into the progress of shipbuilding in northern europe and in carrying out this commission he repaired to russia where he invented the first machine for planing wood its mode of operation whether reciprocating or rotating it is impossible to ascertain positively but the conclusion arrived at after referring to the specifications of his first patent which was issued in 1791 is that it worked upon the former principle by means closely analogous to the operation of planing by hand he seems to have made no use of his venture in russia though he resided there several years and filled several important positions under the russian government he returned to his native country in 1791 and joined his brother jeremy bentham who had at that time just received an appointment from the government to introduce industrial prisons in england to utilize the unskilled labor of the convicts the talents of sir samuel were called into use and he devised a number of new machines the greater part of which were for working wood for want of a more suitable place these machines were constructed at the residence of jeremy bentham which was thus converted into the first manufactory for woodworking machines this factory was established in 1794 but was soon found to be too small for the purpose and another building was occupied in a lecture before the society of arts in 1853 professor willis referring to the shops of the benthams stated that there were constructed machines for all general operations in woodwork including planing molding rebating grooving mortising and sawing both in coarse and fine work in curved winding and transverse directions and shaping wood in complicated forms and further as an example that all parts of a highly finished window sash are prepared also all parts of an ornamented carriage wheel were made so that nothing remained to be done by hand but to put the component parts together in 1797 the admiralty consented to the introduction of such of these machines as could be used to advantage in the different dockyards and they were manufactured under the direction of jeremy bentham and forwarded from time to time to portsmouth and plymouth where they were used with good results performing all that was claimed for them bentham was joined in 1810 by another genius formerly in the employ of the brothers by the name of brunel who had invented several valuable machines among which was one for shaping block shells which seems to have had benthams indorsement as inspector general in 1803 sir samuel advised the admiralty to introduce many of his new machines and also to permit the use of steam engines accordingly the dockyards were fitted with engines for sawing planing boring tenoning mortising etc the labor saved by their use can be inferred from the fact that brunel who had assisted in their construction received as a premium for his inventions the amount saved in the yards by their use in one year which reached the respectable sum of 80000 in the same year the government settled with jeremy bentham after arbitration and allowed him for machines furnished the yards and prisons 100000 we learn from testimony given before the arbitrators that sir samuel bentham prepared a system of machinery for the employment of men without skill and particularly with a view to utilizing convict labor in 1793 patents were taken out on these inventions to secure their exclusive use for the prisons the testimony states that no skill was required in the use of these machines they were introduced into the dockyards and worked by common laborers it was claimed that nine tenths of the labor was saved by the use of benthams machines which proves that they were at least effective which cannot be said in all cases of those of modern manufacture the patent of bentham issued in 1793 is doubtless one of the most remarkable ones ever issued both for the importance of the inventions it protected and the clearness with which they and the principles on which they operated are described richards in referring to that section of this patent which relates to rotary tools for woodcutting quotes the inventor as saying the idea of adapting the rotative motion of a tool with more or less advantage to give all sorts of substances any shape that may be required is my own and as i believe entirely new for those not skilled in nor acquainted with the nature and extent of the various operations in wood conversion which come under the head of shaping with rotary cutters it will be difficult to convey an idea of the invention here set forth it includes indeed nearly all operations in woodworking and as an original invention may be said to consist in the discovery of the fact that flat surfaces or surfaces of any contour can be properly prepared by the action of rotating tools it is not to be wondered at that such an operation should not have been sooner discovered for even at the present time there are few processes in treating material which seem so anomalous as that of planing a flat surface with cutters revolving in a circle of a few inches in diameter in reference to planing mouldings it is said if the circumference of a circular cutter be formed in the shape of any moulding and projecting above the bench no more than necessary the piece being shoved over the cutter will thus be cut to a moulding corresponding to the cutterthat is the reverse of it just as a plane iron cuts the reverse if a plane cutter such as that above spoken of for cutting a groove in the breadth of a piece be made so thick or as we might be apt to say now so broad or so long as to cover the whole breadth of the piece it will present the idea of a roller this i call a cutting roller it maybe employed in many cases with great advantage to perform the office of a plane the cutting roller of bentham is the present cutter block of england or the cutting cylinder of america and after what has been quoted it may be seen that the idea of rotary planing and moulding machines had been fully grasped by bentham he goes on as usual to the various conditions which attach to the process of planing and says further if a cutting roller of this sort be placed with its axis horizontal and the bench beneath it may be made to rise and lower the bench machine may be very readily adjusted so as to determine the thickness to which a piece will be reduced by being passed under the roller to gain time cutters may be applied to different sides of a piece at once and such of them as make parallel cuts may be mounted on the same spindle these extracts would not be out of place in an explanatory lecture or essay on woodcutting at the present day and cannot help awakening surprise that they should have been written eightythree years ago when there had so far as we know been no precedents nor even suggestions from previous practice the foregoing shows that nearly all the fundamental principles upon which woodcutting by machinery in its present development depends were familiar to sir samuel bentham and though his name has been almost forgotten it may be safely asserted that he gave to the world more useful inventions than any other man of his age his work shows throughout a constant method and system of reasoning which point rather to a life of persistent labor than to one of what would ordinarily be called genius that latter quality he must certainly have possessed in the highest degree for without it even his knowledge and experience could not have been equal to the work he accomplished directed to different ends his talent and genius would doubtless have secured for him a fame that would live for years though it does not seem possible that he could have conferred upon the world a greater benefit suicide statistics a curious and suggestive table of statistics has recently appeared in france which will doubtless prove of much value in the hands of students of psychology and nervous mental ailments it relates to suicides and the conditions etc of the people who made away with themselves in 1874 in france are taken as the basis of the figures in that year 5617 suicides occurred the largest number ever known in any one year in the country of these 4435 or 79 per cent were committed by men 1182 or 21 per cent by women in spite of the careful investigations of the police the ages of 105 people could be determined the 5512 others are divided as follows 16 years 29 between 16 and 21 years 193 between 21 and 40 years 1477 between 40 and 60 years 2214 exceeding the last mentioned age 1599 about 36 per cent of these unfortunates were unmarried 48 per cent married and 16 per cent widowers of those which constituted the last two classes nearly two thirds had children more than seven tenths of the suicides were effected by strangulation or drowning the crime was most frequently committed during spring when 31 per cent of the whole number destroyed themselves during other seasons the percentages were in summer 27 in winter 23 in autumn 19 included in the tables are the results of the judicial inquests showing the professions and callings of the deceased about 33 per cent were farmers 30 per cent mechanics 4 per cent merchants or business men 16 per cent members of the liberal professions 4 per cent servants and 13 percent were destitute of any calling the table even analyzes in all but 481 people the motives which caused the fatal act thus we are told that 652 killed themselves because of reverses in fortune 701 through family troubles 572 through drunkenness 243 through love debauchery etc 798 died to avoid physical suffering 59 to avoid the penalties of capital crimes 489 for unclassified troubles and 1622 were clearly shown to have been afflicted with some mental disease communications the frost plant of russia to the editor of the scientific american mr charles williams of winoa ohio has written a letter to that veteran botanist humphrey marshall of chester county pa on the subject of the abovenamed plant and my opinion concerning it has been asked for seeds of this plant were obtained by citizens of boston who had snow brought from the white mountains and from the coast of labrador and who stated that they have now the most unbounded satisfaction and pleasure of announcing that all signs are favorable to the realization of their fondest hopes this wonderful plant it seems was found amid the perpetual snows of the northern boundaries of siberia in 1863 by count swinoskoff the eminent russian botanist and it was by him cultivated at st petersburgh the account sent me is very vague and is evidently not from the pen of a botanist it is stated that it comes forth on the first day of the year grows to the height of three feet and flowers on the third day it continues in bloom for twentyfour hours then dissolves itself being of the finest snow it has a stalk one inch in diameter and leaves three in number 1 inches wide covered with infinitesimal frost or snow cones the flower is of the shape of a star with petals 3 inches long and inch wide at the broadest part forming a basketwork of frost the seeds are like a pins head this is about all that can be gleaned from the description and is by no means satisfactory allow me to present my humble views of an analogous discovery of frostwork on december 6 1856 in a sandy loam in chester county pa near the paoli monument in the horticultural journal of philadelphia then edited by j jay smith new series volume vii page 73 1857 an account was published of my observations then these i have since more fully confirmed the common dittany cunila mariana is frequently met with in december with the base of the stem surrounded with shellwork of ice of a pearly whiteness dr darlington in his flora cestrica published in 1853 page 199 under the article cunila observes in the beginning of winter after a rain very curious ribbons of ice may be observed attached to the base of the stems produced i presume by the moisture of the earth rising in the dead stems by capillary attraction and then being gradually forced out horizontally through a slit by the process of freezing the same phenomenon has been observed in other plants see observations on helianthemum page 27 had the doctor given a more extended investigation i fancy he would have agreed with me as to the cause i found hundreds of diversified specimens i am not aware that it was after a rain but i took up a number of the plants and always found a vigorous scaly root bud undergoing development at this early season under ground to produce a new stem the following spring i came to the conclusion that as the temperature was below freezing and snow was on the ground the expanding bud in close proximity to the surface gave out sufficient caloric or warmth to generate vapor from the moist soil this vapor rising around the stem of the plant and attracted by it becomes congealed into what we term hoarfrost in numerous forms some like shellwork others like tulips with radiated petals variously contorted and often as symmetrical as snowflake crystals illustration rootbud and frostflower of the cunila mariana maryland dittany a the developing or budding root b the old stem of the previous year c the congealed vapor or hoarfrost forming the first flower of various shapes that plants in germinating have the power of generating heat was proved by mr hunter and by lamarck experiments of hales and du hamel show that vegetation is not wholly suspended however cold it may be and that there is a regular and gradual progress till the returning warmth of spring gives a greater degree of velocity to the juices rendering their development more vigorous and apparent if the crystallization takes place when the air is calm the crystals will be regularly formed otherwise when windy i have seen them like a shell within a shell very thin of a pearly whiteness professor tyndall has shown in a very beautiful manner that ice is but an agglomeration of snow crystals the transparency of the former being due to the expulsion of the air entrapped in and causing the whiteness and opacity of the latter there is a formation called the snow plant of california which arises to some height and has been compared to various things a fountain convoluted and enlarged above a crystallized small bushy shrub etc but on closer inquiry i have failed as yet to get any definite ideas to its true character some bulbs in the soil might cause such formations by the congelation of vapor deposited successively upon itself or the stems of the previous years growth yet remaining and thus give them a sheathing of frosting the shape of a star is common in snow crystals which we all know assume the most beautiful forms and which are illustrated in various publications the eminent botanist count swinoskoff should give us some clue as to the genus or character of the plant the flower of which we are told melted away on being touched and as to the stamens the diamond seeds like a pins head etc the whole needs further explanation i trust those bostonians who are in such hope will edify the public as to the final result of their experiment what has that veteran in botany dr asa gray to say about it let some one well qualified tell us more about this frost flower of russia j stauffer lancaster pa patent matters in washington dc to the editor of the scientific american from the report of the commissioner of patents just issued it appears that its surplus revenue for the past year amounts to over one hundred and five thousand dollars and that there is nearly a million dollars in the united states treasury to the credit of the patent office and yet notwithstanding that this enormous amount is lying idle our pseudoeconomists at the capitol refuse to grant the office sufficient of its own funds to carry on its business promptly so much is the work behindhand in some of the departments that as the commissioner states in his report some of the attorneys who require certified copies of papers have been obliged to employ their own clerks to do office copying and then had to pay the full legal rate of ten cents per hundred words the same as though the office had done the work this style of economizing by making inventors pay two prices for their work may be reform in the eyes of the average democratic congressman but speaking for myself as one of those who have had to pay twice i would prefer to dispense with this style of retrenchment and reform and therefore ask you messrs editors in behalf of the inventors of the united states to so stir up our legislators that they will allow the office sufficient of its own funds to do its work properly and not delay the work of the inventorwork that he has to pay for in advanceand so prevent the discouragement and trouble which these delays always cause as the patent office has been doing a good business lately there appears to be some attempt at rivalry at the capitol as the following list of applications for

many of the applicants have apparently given up their cases for this session but they may be only lying back to its close in hopes that in the final rush their little bills may slip through easily several bills tinkering at the patent laws are before congress and one of these house bill no 3370 passed the house on the 30th ult it has one section that may be made to work great harm to inventors as it prevents infringers being sued for more than one years damages previous to notice of infringement being given by this bill if it is allowed to become a law a person will be able to build and use patented machines or processes for years in some out of the way place where the inventor cannot easily find him and should he be discovered he can only be sued for one years damages there are other

district of columbia instead of to the commissioner as heretofore and that the fees shall be the same as now paid to the latter official mr sampson has introduced into the house a bill changing section 4886 so that it shall read as follows sec 4886 any person who has discovered any new or useful art machine manufacture or composition of matter or any new or useful improvement thereof not known or used by others in this country and not patented or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country before his invention or discovery thereof and not in public use or on sale for more than two years prior to his application unless the same is proved to have been abandoned may upon payment of the fees required by law and other due proceedings had obtain a patent therefor provided that the manufacture or composition of drugs as a medicine shall not be patentable the change is the addition of the words in italics the smithsonian institute has sent to congress a memorial setting forth that the present institute building is already too small for the vast amount of articles already placed there on exhibition that at the late centennial exposition the commissioners of various countries presented their entire collection of exhibits to the united states which had delegated their care to the smithsonian institute and they had no place for them that the armory building was being fitted up for the reception of the united states centennial collection and they therefore asked that a building be erected for the foreign collection which could be used as a national museum or otherwise we should have to offend the donors by keeping their valuable gifts stowed away in cellars and other rubbish receptacles mr eads who is now here on the lookout for his pay for his work on the south pass of the mississippis mouth has received intelligence from the resident engineer at the jetties that the channel through the shoal at the head of the south pass is now twentytwo feet deep and that the least width at which twenty feet depth is found is one hundred and ten feet the principal works to improve this shoal were constructed during the last six months the low stage and feeble current of the river has delayed their effect until the recent flood from the ohio reached them and the problem of deepening the shoal has been fully solved by the rapid scouring away of the obstruction it is stated that the channel is quite straight and is deepening rapidly the channel through the jetties at the mouth of the pass is twentyone feet deep the entrance from the sea through the jetties is one thousand feet wide and through the works at the head of the pass eight hundred feet a recent telegram from nevada states that the sutro tunnel of which i gave you some particulars in one of my letters has now progressed a total distance of 15565 feet and has fairly entered the mineral belt and will soon help to increase the already vast products of the comstock lode while on the subject of mining i will state that the amount of quicksilver produced in california has increased so immensely during the last two years that it has attracted the attention of all interested in the article throughout the world the receipts for the year have been 63928 and the exports 48010 flasks in addition to the receipts there probably about six thousand flasks were shipped direct from the mines to nevada thus bringing up the total production to over 70000 flasks a gain in round numbers of from twelve thousand to fifteen thousand flasks over 1875 the exports in that year were 34844 flasks or 13666 less than in 1876 occasional tyrian purple ink for marking linenvon bele gives the following method for preparing an ink for marking linen and cotton neutralize 75

upon it when it is perfectly dry with the ink new york academy of sciences on monday evening january 29 1877 a meeting of this academy was held at the school of mines columbia college dr js newberry president in the chair mr aa julian am read a paper on the preparation of rock and mineral sections for microscopic study the speaker described in detail the various operations exhibited the different kinds of apparatus employed showed the operations and exhibited the finished sections in some rocks a thin chip can be broken off others require to be sawn and for the latter purpose the diamond saw is best having obtained the chip it is first polished on one side then cemented to a little square of glass and the other side polished in the same way the sections must not be too thick nor too thin they are usually made from a hundredth to a thousandth of an inch thick lathes employed in polishing minerals require to be provided with conical spindles so that the wear due to grit and emery dust getting on them may be readily taken up the grinding wheel may be either horizontal or vertical the former has the advantage that the mineral can be held in either hand with the latter only the right hand can be employed and that in an awkward and tiresome position mr julian then referred briefly to the kinds of emery its preparation by elutriation etc and cautioned operators against using rouge or tin putty powder in polishing rock sections although they may be employed in polishing certain minerals and gems the object of making the rock sections being to study their constituents and determine what minerals enter into their composition it is important that no foreign substance liable to adhere to the specimen and to be mistaken for one of its ingredients be placed on the section while grinding lastly the minerals are mounted on glass with or without covers by means of canada balsam square glasses are to be preferred to the long and narrow strips usually employed as less liable to break in the center and more easily revolved on the stage of a microscope mr lh landy then exhibited by means of the gas microscope several beautiful rock sections both american and german the same gentleman also showed the effect of passing polarized light through certain crystal sections the black cross and rainbowhued rings revolving like so many wheels as the polarizer was turned at the conclusion of this brilliant exhibition dr pt austen made some remarks on laboratory manipulations the points referred to were the apparently unimportant details which often contribute so much to the ease and pleasure of working first the use of square pieces of felt such as are used under beer glasses in saloons for setting hot beakers and flasks on to prevent chilling and consequent cracking second in crystallizing substances for examination under the microscope one watch glass is placed upon another with the substance between them and the upper glass filled with ether the cold produced by its evaporation hastening the crystallization third removing precipitates and solid matter from flasks by heating to boiling and inverting in a vessel of water fourth crystallization by gradual dilution fifth filter paper without ash in german laboratories it is customary to dissolve out the mineral matter from white filtering paper by washing in dilute hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids sixth the use of infusorial silica for drying purposes being very porous it will absorb five times its own volume of water if a filter paper holding a wet precipitate be placed upon a layer of this earth it will become quite dry in a very short space of time mr austen also remarked that substances retain their heat for several days when placed in cork boxes to keep a substance airtight it may be placed in a flask the neck painted with a solution of india rubber in chloroform and a plate of glass laid upon it the solvent quickly evaporates leaving a delicate film of rubber which holds the glass tightly in place the next meeting of the chemical section will be held february 12 of the mineralogical section february 19 annual report of the patent office the annual report to congress of the commissioner of patents for the year 1876 has made its appearance the amount received on applications for patents reissues designs extensions caveats disclaimers appeals trade marks labels copies etc was 75798765 the amount paid for salaries was 425930 other expenses 226612 total payments 652542 number of applications for patents during the year 1876 21425 number of patents issued including reissues and designs 15595 number of applications for extension of patents 2 number of patents extended 3 number of caveats filed during the year 2697 number of patents expired during the year 814 number of patents allowed but not issued for want of final fee 3353 number of applications for registering of trade marks 1081 number of trade marks registered 959 number of applications for registering of labels 650 number of labels registered 402 of the patents granted there were to citizens of the united states 16239 subjects of great britain 511 subjects of france 104 subjects of other foreign governments 172 total 17026 the number of applications for patents was a little less than during the previous year the commissioner suggests that congress should appropriate 50000 to promote the printing of the old patents that additional examiners be employed and more clerks for the purpose of expediting the business of the office that the price of the official gazette be reduced also the fee for trade mark registration that the library fund be increased that more space be provided for models and for the transaction of business in respect to the centennial the value of new improvements and the service of the patent office in stimulating discovery the acting commissioner speaks as follows the display made at the exposition by the patent office was creditable in every respect and excited general attention about 5000 models of inventions representing the leading branches of the arts and manufactures were exhibited in suitable cases and properly labeled the various publications of the office were displayed its practice fully explained to all inquirers and copies of the patent laws and the office regulations and forms freely distributed the knowledge of our patent system thus imparted to foreigners and all others unable to visit washington has more than repaid the small cost attendant upon the representation the exhibits were sent from and returned to the office with scarcely any damage being suffered but the array of models etc made by the patent office at the exposition was not needed to illustrate the value of our patent practice the wisdom of that system was demonstrated in the most practical and triumphant manner in nearly every branch of that munificent enterprise not only in the grand display of laborsaving machinery but in the vast collection of manufactured articles and even in the department of fine arts were seen the fruits of that provision in our constitution giving to congress the power to promote the progress of science and the useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries whatever persons may do in a perfect condition of society in sharing without price the fruits of their labors with others it must be apparent to the dullest observer that the wonderful growth of the useful arts in this country is due thus far to the protection given by our government to property in inventionsa property as sacred as any other class of property and whose value is determined by the same general law of supply and demand it may be safely said that two thirds of the manufacturing interests of the country are based upon patents and the welfare of all such interests are intimately connected with the welfare of the patent system during the past seven years a larger number of applications for patents were filed and patents granted than during the entire seventyeight preceding years reaching back to the enactment of the first patent law the needs of the office have advanced in proportion to this sudden and vast increase of work but have been but partly supplied nay in fact its already scanty force and accommodations have been actually reduced at a time when most required if these vast interests and the future promotion of science and the useful arts are to be encouraged a liberal recognition must be made of the wants of this office the examining corps the duties in which are most arduous and exacting comprises gentlemen of legal as well as scientific attainments it should be reinforced by more of the same character they should be relieved by legislation of continual embarrassment by reason of meager salaries and fears of removal incident to merely political changes the office would then be spared the continual loss of its most experienced and efficient men the iron trade in england the british mercantile gazette of january 15 states that the situation and prospects of the iron trade have not materially improved in the month of december but some week or two must elapse yet before trade returns to its regular channels in the north of england the tone of the market is tolerably cheerful and prospects though still vague are considered encouraging makers of pig iron go into the next quarter with a good supply of orders on their books and merchants and consumers are desirous of buying over the first half of the year notwithstanding the great depression which has ruled throughout 1876 there is likely to be a greater production of pig iron by several thousand tons than ever there was before and the total make must considerably exceed two million tons which is twice the quantity turned out in scotland though in the latter district a greater number of furnaces have been kept in blast prices are nominally the same as were quoted last week but show an upward tendency the bulk of the mills and forges foundries etc have resumed work and the finished iron trade is again in full swing the plate department is well provided with orders but the rail manufacturers though rather better off than they were are still in a poor position the miscellaneous branches of the iron trade such as the foundries and tube wire and cutnail manufactories are generally well off for orders and engineers find plenty to do the wages agreement in the finished iron trade ends this week but it is thought that no alteration will be made in the south staffordshire iron trade work has been only partially resumed as yet and many of the mills and forges will not be started until the quarterly meetings next week orders have rarely been so scarce as they are at this moment arrears having been pretty generally cleared off before the holidays and no new ones coming in nevertheless the feeling of the trade is more hopeful than it was a month ago the number of furnaces in blast in this district is now only 58 out of 153 but should the expected improvement in trade arrive with the quarterly meeting this number will soon be increased in the finished iron branch in which quotations for marked iron contain the basis of 45 for bars makers of leading brands of sheets and bars are better off than the manufacturers of cheap iron who suffer much from competition in the north some considerable contracts for girders bridges gasometers etc are under execution at the works devoted to constructive ironwork but the merchant iron trade as a whole is very dull unmarked iron is weak and variable and to this circumstance may be attributed the reduction announced this week in various descriptions of common iron hardware improved lathe chuck the annexed engravings represent a new lathe chuck which may be constructed of any size which holds tools with great firmness and which is provided with an improved device for taking up wear and for the separate adjustment of the jaws the implement is made of the best steel by special machinery so that its parts are interchangeable illustration vintons lathe chuck figs 1 and 2 represent the chuck taken apart so as to exhibit the interior figs 3 and 4 are sectional views a is a collar which encircles the spindle and has formed on its outer face a bevel gear wheel b c fig 3 is the rear portion of the shell of the chuck inclosing the forward part of the collar a also on said collar a is a washer d which rests against the shell c and a nut e which travels on a thread formed on the collar as it is necessary as will be explained further on to turn the entire shell in order to move the jaws the use of the nut just described is to jam the part c and the enlarged portion of the collar a tightly together and so rigidly hold the jaws in any position in which they may be adjusted fig 1 represents the outer face of the chuck with the jaws and their working mechanism within the chuck each jaw has attached to it a screw e this enters a bevel wheel f as the jaws are incapable of any but radial motion it follows that when the chuck is rotated bodily and the bevel wheels engage on the motionless gear wheel b the effect of the rotation of said bevel wheels is to cause the jaws to travel toward or from the center of the chuck face and it will be further clear that this motion must be simultaneous in all the jaws as the outer portion of the chuck is rigidly secured to the shell c by screws of course when that shell is jammed as already stated by the nut e it becomes impossible to turn the chuck bodily and hence the bevel wheels cannot be rotated around the main gear wheel and consequently the position of the jaws cannot be altered the above comprises the mechanism proper of the device that is to say all that is necessary for moving or clamping the jaws there is however another feature of considerable importance yet to be described and that is the device for taking up any play of the jaws due to wear and which enables each to be adjusted so that the motion of all may be uniform by referring to fig 4 it will be seen that above the bevel wheel there is a projection into the threaded interior of which as already explained the jaw screw enters surrounding this projection is a sleeve g the outer surface of which is threaded to fit a similarly threaded aperture cut partly in the shell and partly in the face plate the upper portion of the sleeve is notched to receive a wrench or driver and beneath the sleeve an armed washer h is slipped over the projection the arms of this washer enter recesses in the face plate it will be evident that by turning the sleeve f so that the screw works inward the jaw and all its appendages will be moved bodily in corresponding direction but its movement is limited by the arms of the washer g which through the narrowness of the recesses are allowed only just enough play to compensate for slight changes in the jaw as the above device is applied to every jaw it follows that any one of them may be nicely adjusted from the outside so that all are caused to grasp the tool accurately the spindle instead of being solid as represented may be made hollow patented to jh vinton august 18 1874 for further information address the manufacturer mr f armstrong bridgeport conn screwcutting lathes illustration screwcutting lathes an english lathe now in use at the rogers locomotive works paterson nj contains several novel features the ways are flat on the faces instead of having raised vs and this is a feature of all english lathes and of those known in this country as the freeland lathes a great deal of discussion has at various times taken place as to the relative qualification or merits of these two forms of lathe bed the advocates of the flat way with vs at the edges of the way claim superiority on the score of steadiness increased wearing surface and strength while on behalf of the raised vs it is urged that the vs being true the saddle is bound to travel true because there can be no lost motion on the slides whereas any lost motion from want of adjustment of the slides in flat ways is liable to be reproduced twofold in the work for the reason that 1100 of an inch lateral movement of the slide carriage becomes 150 of an inch in the diameter of the work then again the most of the wear upon a lathe bed takes place at the part at and near the running center of the lathe because the saddle is on account of short jobs more used in that part than on any other as a result when wear has taken place the saddle if adjusted to suit the worn part becomes too tight to travel over the unworn part of the bed and hence after the wear has taken place a proper adjustment of the lathe saddle becomes impossible if the job is a long one in the case of raised vs however the wear simply causes the saddle to fall vertically so that an amount of wear equal to 1100 of an inch would have the same effect as lowering the tool 1100 inch its effect upon the work being almost imperceptible by ordinary measurement on the other hand however v lathes are usually made with either a weight or a spring to keep the saddle down and as a result when the cutting tool stands far out from the tool post the saddle is apt to tip especially in the case of boring with a lathe tool in some cases the raised vs are accompanied with gibs to secure the saddle but in many instances the gibs are given too little wearing surface in the lathe above referred to there are three ways in one casting with the slide angles on the outer edges there are also three separate and independent tail stocks fitting into the two openings between the ways the running head has one cone pulley connected by suitable gearing to three face plates the three centers at the running head are stationary the slide rest saddle spans the three ways having a v slide which contains three separate slide rests all connected by a nut to the feed screw so that all three are operated by the one screw in addition to this the two back slide rests have the nuts so attached that they can be moved by means of a separate screw the object being to facilitate setting the cuts since it would be a tedious matter to set all three tools to an equal cut or to their desired respective cuts without means of operating two of them independently to set the cut during screwcutting operations the ingenious device shown in our engraving is provided a represents the crossfeed or slide rest screw which operates the three slide rests it is fast to the notched wheel b and is operated by it in the usual way c is a short screw which provides journal bearing for the screw a by a plain hole it is screwed on the outside and the plate in which it fits acts as its nut it is fast to the handle d and is in fact operated by it the handle or lever is provided with a catch e pivoted in the enclosed box f which also contains a means of detaining the catch in the notches of the wheel or of holding it free from the same when it is placed clear if then the lever d be moved back and forth the feed screw a and hence the three slide rests will be operated while if the catch be placed in one of the notches on the wheel b both the screws a and c will act to operate the rests when therefore the operator is cutting screws he sets the catch e into one of the notches so soon as the tools are properly adjusted to the work and then lifting the catch e he turns the wheel b so that the catch falls into the next notch and this puts the cut on when the tool has taken that cut and while the latter saddle is traveling back the catch is placed in the next notch and so on the cut for the forward travel always being put on as above while the saddle is traveling back thus is insured an exactly equable amount of cut on the whole three rests when the lever d is not in use the catch is removed from the wheel b and is allowed to rest against the pins g or a provided for that purpose for piston rods or for work such as cutting jack screws this lathe is very useful it is obviously however a

at the foot of almost any tree or shrub in the winter time mosses and lichens are found in fruit and are beautiful objects a pocket microscope lens is essential for their proper observation and though the delicate carmine cups of the species known as the cup moss and the familiar gray and yellow mosaic appearance we see on twigs and branches on our way are easily recognized the study of this form of winter vegetation is an inexhaustible one and is an occupation for a lifetime if earnestly pursued we do not however suggest that every one who endeavors to recognize the different species of moss lichens or fungi should necessarily do so through the medium of the microscope but it will greatly add to the pleasure of making a collection out of doors if there be a good microscope at home so that when the contents of the basket be turned out after the winters walk there should be interest even in the fragments left after a little pile of varied bits has been constructed rivalling the choicest summer bouquet in beauty of form and color we have seen such a collection formed into a beautiful object by raising a little mound of rough bits of bark in a plate or saucer and placing on it

c schallhorn fiddletown amador county cal proposed cremation temple cremation in this country at least is not popular for a time it occupied here some public attention but only in a sensational way and the sober discussion of the subject which followed after its novelty had worn off led to the general opinion that while every one might be quite willing to see his dead neighbors cremated no one would acquiesce in the disposal of his friends and relatives in so abnormal a manner hence with the single exception of the late revolting exhibition in pennsylvania which we alluded to at the time the dead in this country have continued to be deposited in their hallowed resting places and have not been packed away in an incinerated state in labeled urns in europe however cremation still finds many warm adherents and during last summer a congress of the friends of cremation a society which we are informed by engineering whence we take the annexed engravings has branches in various parts of the world was held in dresden before this meeting a large number of designs for cremation and mortuary buildings were brought in competition and finally the prize was awarded to mr g lilienthal a berlin architect for the imposing structure illustrated herewith this will be the grand temple of cremation when it is erecteda proceeding to take place in the dim future when or where not stated on each side of a central chapel there is a circular memorial hall and extending so as to inclose the garden of the establishment on the sides of the halls are wings containing a large number of niches for the reception of funeral urns the cremation ceremony is proposed to be as follows the body having been brought into the hall is subjected to the usual medical examination or when an inquest is necessary it is removed to offices in another part of the building where the required investigation can be held when all is ready the body placed on the platform b fig 2 is raised by a lift into the hall a where visitors are gathered and here the result of the medical examination is declared and whatever preliminary religious ceremonies that are desired are performed the body is then transported to the chapel e in front of the pulpit f where the burial service is performed the bier is afterward lowered mechanically and brought to the furnaces which are arranged in a semicircle and partitioned for the reception of several biers the ashes are subsequently placed in an urn on which the name etc of the deceased are recorded and which is set up in a suitable niche illustration fig 1design for a cremation temple the building which we illustrate both in elevation fig 1 and in plan fig 2 is designed to contain 100000 urns and is adapted for a town of 200000 inhabitants the architect has

those odd geniuses who spend their lives and means in collecting curious and rare articles lately died his name was sylvester bonaffon a retired merchant of philadelphia his elaborate collections were sold at auction and their oddity has attracted general attention his chief mania was for clocks which literally covered every portion of available space in his apartments whether they were placed on chairs tables shelves or hung against the wall some of these timepieces were of unique construction one clock was made to run for 400 days after one winding another was set in the dashboard of his carriage and he used mr bonaffon also had an especial fondness for electrical apparatus his windows were provided with ingenious burglar alarms his rooms with fire alarms and he ignited his gas always by electricity his place of business his stable the continental hotel where he dined were all connected with instruments in his room and he even had perfected arrangements so that he could set at home and send his own messages to california besides the clocks and electric apparatus there was an immense collection of bricabrac of every conceivable variety which was sold at the auctionas is usually the caseat prices much below those paid by its late owner fertilizing influence of snow snow is often called the poor mans manure and if it is true that it has any manurial value the farmers prospects for the next season are certainly flattering the body of snow upon the ground in all the northern and middle states is very great and millions of acres of land are covered by it as with a blanket of the whitest wool it is probable that seldom perhaps never has so wide an area of our country been covered as during this month of january 1877 the question whether snow is capable of affording to lands any of the elements of fertility is one often asked and in reply the boston journal of chemistry says that it probably is the atmosphere holds ammonia and some other nitrogenous products which are without doubt brought to the soil by snowflakes as well as by rain drops experiments both here and abroad would seem to prove the truth of this conclusion rains are not only valuable for the moisture which they supply but for what they bring to us from the atmosphere during a thunderstorm nitric acid is produced in considerable quantities and dissolved in the rain drops to a high degree of attenuation its effects upon soils are highly salutary as the nitrogen permeates the entire soil action of sea water on lead the journal of the chemical society says that freshly cut strips of lead were kept in a bottle of sea water for four days the bottle being frequently shaken no trace of lead could be detected in the water but the bright surface of the strips was coated with an insoluble lead compound hence lead pipes may be used in marine aquaria without any fear of injury to their inhabitants papins steam engine by professor charles a joy it is a matter of history that as early as 1688 denis papin professor of physics and mathematics at the university of marburg proposed to substitute steam for powder in the engine invented by huyghens and that in 1695 he published a description of several new inventions in which steam played an important part the elector carl of hessecassel was anxious to be free from the annoyances and impositions practised upon his boatmen by the authorities at mnden and he proposed to avoid that city by constructing a canal connecting the weser with the river that flowed through cassel much of the work was accomplished and the half finished line of the canal can be traced even at the present day papin was authorized to build a powerful steam pump by which the supply of water was to be regulated a working model of this pump was completed and the elector was on the point of visiting the laboratory to witness its operation when a fearful explosion frightened the workmen and afforded an opportunity for enemies to intrigue for the expulsion of papin from the country the model was preserved for a long time in cassel but at the time of the french invasion it disappeared and no trace of it has since been found in writing about his inventions papin says in 1695 it would occupy too much space for me to describe in what manner this principle could be applied to removing water from mines throwing bombs sailing against the wind and for many other similar purposes everyone according to his wants can imagine the constructions that could be made i cannot however refrain from remarking how much preferable this power would be to oars for those whose business calls them to the sea and further on he says the steam cylinders could be employed for a great variety of purposes one of the cylinders which was to form a part of the pump was cast at the foundry in cassel and after various vicissitudes has finally become the property of the historical museum in that city where it will be preserved with jealous care from any further injury during the recent exhibition of philosophical instruments in london this remnant of papins invention played an important part it having been generously loaned by the authorities for that occasion after the flight of papin from germany the cylinder was used as a receptacle for iron turnings and borings in the royal works and after the destruction of those works by fire it came into the possession of henschel the founder of one of the most extensive locomotive works in germany this man fully appreciated the value of the historical relic and when i visited him at the works twentyfive years ago he pointed out with pride to me the inscription on its side papins cylinder and said that he intended to have it placed upon a solid pedestal near the gate his grandson has since presented it to the city and its preservation from destruction or sale is now secured a copy of the drawing made by papin of the pump of which this cylinder was to form a part and which was published in 1695 has recently appeared in dinglers journal and i send it to you hoping that you will have it engraved and perpetuated in your valuable paper it is a peculiar combination of saverys invention and papins piston engine suggested for another purpose and is a decided improvement on huyghens powder engine illustration papins steam engine a is the boiler for the generation of the steam provided with a safety valve an invention of papin on opening the stopcock c the steam passes through b into the cylinder d and by its expansion drives the plunger e against the water contained in the cylinder d which is thus forced into the chamber f compressing strongly the air which in turn expels the water through the pipe g to the height desired k is a funnel for the fresh supply of water and at i and h are valves opening upwards and downwards after the condensation of the steam in d a renewed supply of water through k forces the plunger e to the top of the cylinder ready for the next action of steam the strokes of such a pump could not be frequent and it would not compare very favorably with the wonderful machinery exhibited in philadelphia last summer but it contains the germ of the idea and is worthy of all honor having often seen it stated that papin had invented a steamboat i resolved during a recent visit to germany to investigate the matter and especially to search for the correspondence between papin and leibnitz in the library at hanover it will be borne in mind that two hundred years ago on december 4 1676 leibnitz was appointed to take charge of the library in hanover and that he remained in this position until his death in 1716 he bequeathed his manuscripts to the library and as he had the habit of writing upon all manner of loose scraps of paper it has cost much labor to assort and classify them on making my application to the librarian to be permitted to see the correspondence between papin and leibnitz my request was at once granted and a table having been assigned me i was able to examine these precious relics at my leisure i was also shown a copy of an original treatise on the steam engine by papin which contained numerous marginal notes by leibnitz in one place leibnitz criticized papins method for condensing steam and makes a drawing on the margin showing a piston and valve which he thought would be more practical it is somewhat remarkable that the germans have not caused a facsimile of this little volume to be published after considerable search i found a copy of the original letter addressed by papin to leibnitz in 1707 asking leibnitz to assist him in obtaining the consent of the hanoverian government to navigate the river weser with a sidewheel steamboat the letter was dated july 7 1707 and contained among other interesting passages the following sentence the new invention will enable one or two men to accomplish more effect than several hundred oarsmen it is evident that leibnitz was deeply impressed by papins letter and he supported the simple and reasonable request contained in it by the following petition addressed to the councillors of state this communication from leibnitz bears two indorsements one by the clerk of the council pro memoria respectfully in reference to the passage of a ship from the river fulda into the weser the other is in the handwriting of leibnitz papins sidewheel ship this last indorsement is of great value as indicating the fact that papin proposed to apply side wheels for the propulsion of his new invention the following is a translation of leibnitz letter the original of which i saw in the library dionysius papin councillor and physician to his royal highness the elector of cassel also professor of mathematics at marburg is about to dispatch a vessel of singular construction down the river weser to bremen as he learns that all ships coming from cassel or any point on the fulda are not permitted to enter the weser but are required to unload at mnden and as he anticipates some difficulty although those vessels have a different object his own not being intended for freight he begs most humbly that a gracious order be granted that his ship may be allowed to pass unmolested through the electoral domain which petition i most humbly support gw leibnitz hanover july 13 1707 this letter was returned to leibnitz with the following indorsement the electoral councillors have found serious obstacles in the way of granting the above petition and without giving their reasons have directed me to inform you of their decision and that in consequence the request is not granted by his electoral highness h reiche hanover july 25 1707 this failure of papins petition was the deathblow to his effort to establish steam navigation a mob of boatmen who thought they saw in the embryo ship the ruin of their business attacked the vessel at night and utterly destroyed it papin narrowly escaped with his life and fled to england where he endured great hardships and poverty and all traces of him were soon lost so that it is uncertain in what country he finally died or where he was buried this remarkable man was driven out of france on account of his protestant faith and found a refuge in germany here he was again persecuted on account of the injury that ignorant and jealous people believed his inventions would inflict upon the industries of the country and when the climax of steam engines for pumping water and propelling ships was reached the enlightened government of the period found serious obstacles in the way of granting him protection and without condescending to state what those objections were secretly instigated the mob to make an end of the trouble it is another instance unfortunately too often repeated in history of the mischief men dressed up in a little brief authority can work upon their generation if papin had been permitted to navigate the weser with his ship and to carry it to london as was his intention it is possible that we should have had steamboats one hundred years earlier than they were given to us by fulton the plan proposed by papin was highly impracticable but a knowledge of what savery had done in the way of steam machinery aided by the shrewd suggestions of leibnitz combined with the practical assistance of englishmen would no doubt have enabled him to improve upon his invention until it had obtained sufficient credit to be secure against the misfortune of being totally forgotten after the lapse of 100 years from the date of papins invention when the first steamboat was put upon the river rhine the vessel was fired into by concealed marksmen on shore and navigation was more dangerous than it is now on the upper waters of the missouri in times of indian hostility it was only after stationing troops along the banks of the river to protect the boatmen that the government fortunately more enlightened than in the days of leibnitz was able to establish steam navigation on a secure footing i have thought it worth while to make this contribution to the history of steam navigation particularly as i have been able to authenticate a portion of it by reference to original documents columbia college new york city january 1877 the speaking telegraph we have heretofore given accounts of the wonderful success of professor bell in transmitting the vibrations of the human voice by electrical means over a telegraph wire he has lately made improvements in his method of transmission by which he dispenses with the use of the battery and substitutes the magnetoelectric plan of producing the current the boston transcript describes a recent experiment with the new apparatus by which conversation and singing was successfully carried on between boston and malden a distance of six miles the telephone in its present form consists of a powerful compound permanent magnet to the poles of which are attached ordinary telegraph coils of insulated wire in front of the poles surrounded by these coils of wire is placed a diaphragm of iron a mouthpiece to converge the sound upon this diaphragm substantially completes the arrangement as is well known the motion of steel or iron in front of the poles of a magnet creates a current of electricity in coils surrounding the poles of the magnet and the duration of this current of electricity coincides with the duration of the motion of the steel or iron moved or vibrated in the proximity of the magnet when the human voice causes the diaphragm to vibrate electrical undulations are induced in the coils environing the magnets precisely analogous to the undulations of the air produced by that voice these coils are connected with the line wire which may be of any length provided the insulation be good the undulations which are induced in these coils travel through the line wire and passing through the coils of an instrument of precisely similar construction at the distant station are again resolved into air undulations by the diaphragm of this instrument the experiments were as follows telephones having been connected with the private telegraphic line of the boston rubber shoe company conversation was at once commenced stationed at the boston end of the wire professor bell requested mr watson who was at the malden end to speak in loud tones with a view of enabling the entire company at once to distinguish the sounds this was so successful that a smile of mingled pleasure and surprise played on the features of those present that it however might not be supposed that loud speaking was essential to intelligibility mr bell explained that soft tones could be heard across the wires even more distinctly than loud utterances even a whisper being audible in confirmation of this statement mr watson commenced speaking in turn with each member of the company and after the efficiency of this method had been proved to the satisfaction of all he took up a newspaper and informed the assemblage that gold had closed the previous evening at new york at 10558 as there were quite a number of business men present the effect that this practical demonstration of the value of the telephone produced can scarcely be exaggerated other passages from the daily journals were then given and by this time the desire for conversation having become general mr watson was plied with questions such as is it thawing or freezing at malden who will be the next president etc it was remarkable that mr watson was able to distinguish between the voices at the boston end he calling at least one gentleman by name as soon as the latter commenced speaking this went on for some time until a lady at the malden end sent the company an invitation to lunch per telephone and an appropriate response was made by the same medium at length the boston company were requested to remain quiet while a lady at the other end conveyed to them the sweet strains of music the assemblage thereupon listened with rapt attention while a young lady commenced singing the last rose of summer the effect was simply charming the sound of the voice penetrated into the boston end of the telephone with a distinctness equal to that attainable in the more distant parts of a large concert room and a unanimous vote of thanks was sent by the handy little instrument which had procured for the assemblage so agreeable an hour the superb steam engine built by ch brown co of fitchburg mass which was illustrated and described on page 1 of our current volume has been purchased by messrs phineas jones co and is being erected in their extensive carriage wheel works at newark nj crossing a river on a wire a reporter of the new york sun wanted to realize the sensation of being suspended on a wire 275 feet from the surface of the earth he applied to the engineer of the brooklyn bridge for permission to cross the east river on a wire three quarters of an inch in diameter which hangs between the two towers he was refused permission but he finally saw the president of the company who granted his request arriving at the appointed time the engineer mr farrington said well sir whenever youre ready i am all ready said i as bold as brass outside and as nervous as the endorian witch on the inside he walked on and i followed when horror of horrorscapital hsto both horrorsinstead of leading me to the cradle which i called a raft he took me to a little square board held up by two crossed iron arms called a buggy it was about three feet square and depended from the traveler a three quarter inch wire which crosses the river and is run from tower to tower over apparatus by means of a stationary engine it was too late to back out but i didnt feel exactly prepared to plunge in he did he jumped in and the little buggy swung from side to side precisely as a swing does when you jump on the board and try to steady it by the ropes i looked at him at the scalethats it its exactly like a pair of scales with one scaleat the deep depths below us and at myself i imagined the ticklish thrill which would permeate my body when we started i fancied the glories of the prospective perspective before me come hurry up please interrupted farrington and with resignation i hurried down he stood up i crouched down perhaps you think youd have stood up as he did youre mistaken i crouched down and held on tight make no mistake i held on tight and waited for my thrill it didnt come then i stood up and farrington gave the word go wouldnt you better take a rope along said one of the men yes i think i would what did he want of a rope he feared i would be nervous he meant to grapple me in the middle of the river and tie me in i knew it i felt it but i didnt say a word with a gentle jerk we startedslow slow very slow farrington stood in front and watched the wire i stood behind and watched myself i felt nothing i wasnt exhilarated i wasnt scared i wasnt even timid i cant look from the top of a house without desiring to jump off but i looked down from the buggy and hadnt the least desire to jump farrington says its because its so high up well we went on without any special sensation till the buggy struck against a stay rope which reaches from one of the cables to the tower in the effort to free the buggy mr farrington gave a push which swung us out some little distance and back again at which a little piece of indigestion seemed to be monarch of my interior and for a moment i was on the verge of a sensation having passed the middle the ascent was more labored i waved my handkerchief to the people on the ferryboats i looked out toward the sea i looked up at the heavens i even looked toward harlem but like the buyer in the bible i said it is naught it is naught in about eight minutes we touched the new york sideall but ten feet the red flag waved for the engine to stop there we hung in midair 275 feet above the level swinging to and fro like a drunken buggy at an angle of forty degrees and quite uneasy the rope which was to haul us on was fastened to the ironblest be the tie that bindsand with a few hearty pulls we were brought so near the new york tower that without difficulty we clambered up i had made the trip but i had not felt a feel from the top of the new york tower i saw much but the chief point of interest was the innumerable jets of steam which flourish in the air and fantastically curl off into space again the steeples the tower and the long narrow dirty river filled the prospect and the bright sun of a charming day lightened up the western sky that was all except to say thanks and goodbye and descend the stairs there were 417 of them stairs and before i reached the bottom i was dizzy faint seasick and filled with a decoction of tickle so that i had to shut my eyes and rest from my labors thus ends the trip which filled my anticipatory imagination as the waters fill the sea but which resolved itself in realization to a simple childlike faith in the fixtures on the wire and in the skill and competence of the man who guided them monsieur x blue glass science there is nothing more reassuring in these days when new isms of the scientists are slowly sapping the foundations of cherished beliefs than to remember that after all the much vaunted dicta of nature are yet opposable by the sound operations of honest common sense see for example how one of our evening dailies tossing the dogmas of socalled science contemptuously aside evolves such profoundly original thoughts as these to explain the lucid blue glass theory of general pleasonton the blue glass presents an obstruction to the suns rays which can only be penetrated by one of the seven primary raysthe blue ray the remaining six rays travelling with the velocity of 186000 miles a second falling upon the blue glass are suddenly arrested the impact evolves upon the surface of the glass friction heat electricity and magnetism the heat expands the molecules of the glass and a current of electricity and magnetism passes through it into the room this current falling upon animal or vegetable life within stimulates it to unusual vigor certainly the results achieved and abundantly certified to are marvellous and sufficient to provoke further experiments and inquiry prior to these splendid original discoveries of our contemporary we ignorantly believed that blue glass only partially sifted out the orange and yellow rays from the spectrum and that with this exception it acted merely as a screen to diminish the intensity of all the rays we also supposed that there was a sharp distinction to be drawn between sunlight after passing through blue glass and the blue spectral ray that in one case all the colored rays were more or less present and that in the other but one was but think of the utter dismay of such pretenders as helmholtz tyndall and henry when they learn that the undulatory theory of light with which they have so long taxed our credulity is overthrownthat of the seven primary rays six bounce off from blue glass and distribute themselves over the adjoining neighborhood that the glass is heated by the impact and as the sun persistently emits more rays there are more impacts and more heat the glass gets hotter and hotter butmark the scientific acumen herejust as we are wondering whether it will reach the melting point the pores open it is the turkish bath of nature electricity and magnetism no longer shut out rush in between the separate molecules hand in hand these great curative powers seek a proper subject they meet we learn from a report also in our contemporary of pleasontons latest triumph a pig or a young lady whose hair has come outa heifer a rooster or a rheumatic child forthwith the pig fattens hair equal to that produced by the finest tricopherus pervades the female scalp and unusual vigor and general happiness prevail such is the boon which pleasonton bestows on humanity as elucidated by the original genius of our contemporary infectious disease propagation in view of the alarming prevalence of scarlet fever in many parts of the country the following hints by the british medical journal are wholesome warnings there are three common ways by means of which infectious diseases may be very widely spread it is a very usual practice for parents to take children suffering from scarlet fever measles etc to a public dispensary in order to obtain advice and medicines it is little less than crime to expose in the streets of a town and in the crowded waiting room of a dispensary children afflicted with such complaints again persons who are recovering from infectious disorders borrow books out of the lending departments of public libraries these books on their reissue to fresh borrowers are sources of very great danger in all libraries notices should be posted up informing borrowers that no books will be lent out to persons who are suffering from diseases of an infectious character and that any person so suffering will be prosecuted if he borrow during the time of his illness lastly disease is spread by tract distributors it is the habit for such well meaning people to call at a house where a person is ill and to leave him a tract in a week or so the tract is called for again another left in its place and the old one is left with another person it needs not much imagination to know with what result to health such a practice will lead if the first person be in scarlet fever or smallpox dr hutton offers a warning on the reckless manner in which parents allow their healthy children to run into the houses of acquaintances who have members of their families suffering from scarlatina etc and states that he has seen the infection thus carried from the patient and several families attacked toughened glass making in brooklyn a world reporter has lately visited the works in brooklyn where the manufacture of the la bastie toughened glass is now in active progress the manufacturer states that in june last his factory was destroyed by fire and the introduction of the glass into our markets has for that reason been delayed only one kind of goods lamp chimneys are now made and the process is as follows a workman having in his hand a pole about eight feet long with a knob on the end of the size of a lamp burner fits a chimney on the knob and plunges it into the flame of a furnace he withdraws it twice or thrice that it may not heat too quickly turning the pole rapidly the while and when the glass reaches a red heat quickly shoots it into one of a dozen small baths fixed on a revolving table and seizes another chimney a boy keeps the revolving table always in position and as the chimneys come around to him having been the proper time in the bath he takes them out to be dried sorted cleaned and packed the bath has to be of just the right temperature as if it be too hot or too cold the chimneys are liable to explode in either case the process of annealing is imperfect by working the tables at a certain rate the baths are kept at the right temperature by the immersion of the red hot glass oil or tallow is used in the bath any greasy substance will do though tallow has proved most satisfactory m de la chapelle the manufacturer states that he has already sold 150000 worth of the chimneys the toughened chimneys are about 60 per cent dearer than those of ordinary glass the factory is in delavan street brooklyn ny alexander bain electrician this ingenious man whose inventions in connection with the electric telegraph entitle his name to be held in grateful remembrance died in january last at the new home for incurables at broomhill kirkintilloch near glasgow scotland and on saturday his remains were interred in the burying ground in the neighborhood of that town known as the old aisle cemetery mr bain who was about sixtysix years of age was a native of thurso he was the inventor of the electrochemical printing telegraph the electromagnetic clock and of perforated paper for automatic transmission of messages and was author of a number of books and pamphlets relating to these subjects sir william thomson in his address to the mathematical section of the british association at its meeting in glasgow last year said in the united states telegraphic department of the great exhibition at philadelphia i saw edisons automatic telegraph delivering 1015 words in 57 seconds this was done by the long neglected electrochemical method of bain long ago condemned in england to the helot work of recording from a relay and turned adrift as needlessly delicate for that mr bain was stricken by paralysis and suffered from complete loss of power in the lower limbs for some time he had received a pension from the government obtained for him we believe through the instrumentality of sir william thomson mr bain was a widower and has left a son and daughter the former of whom is in america and the latter at present on the continent photographs of him by mayall were recently presented to the society of telegraph engineers and the american society of telegraphers at philadelphia the engineer selfreliance necessary to success selfreliance conjoined with promptitude in the execution of our undertakings is indispensable to success and yet multitudes live a life of vacillation and consequent failure because they remain undetermined what to do or having decided that have no confidence in themselves such persons need to be assured but this assurance can be obtained in no other way than by their own successes in whatever they may attempt for themselves if they lean upon others they not only become dissatisfied with what they achieve but the success of one achievement in which they are entitled to but partial credit is no guaranty to them that unaided they will not fail in their very next experiment for want of selfreliance and decision of character thousands are submerged in their first essays to make the voyage of life disappointed and chagrined at this they underestimate their own capacities and thenceforward relying on others they take and keep a subordinate position from which they rise when they rise at all with the utmost difficulty when a young man attains his majority it is better for him as a general rule to take some independent position of his own even though the present remuneration be less than he would obtain in the service of others when at work for himself in a business which requires and demands foresight economy and industry he will naturally develop the strong points of his character and become selfreliant a glance at the business men of any community will show who have and who have not improved the opportunities of their earlier years the former transact their business with ease promptitude and profit they rely upon themselves and execute what they have to do with energy and dispatch but those who shirked everything in their youth are compelled to rely on their clerks and salesmen for advice and are never ready to act when occasions of profit arise many parents commit a lamentable error in this respect they lead their children to believe that they can do nothing without the constant assistance of their superiors and after awhile the child becomes impressed with that idea fortunate will it be for him when he emerges from the parental roof if he can at once acquire the selfreliance which has been kept down at homeotherwise he must necessarily fail in whatever independent enterprise he undertakes and in such a case while the misfortune is his own the fault lies at the door of misjudging parents rather than at his own something to do it is an old trick of despots and a good one to employ their subjects why to keep them out of mischief employed men are most contented there is no conspiracy men do not sit down and coolly proceed to concoct iniquity so long as there is plenty of pleasant and profitable employment for body and mind work drives off discontent provided there is compensation in proportion to the amount of labor performed there must be a stimulant god never intended a man should sweat without eating of the fruits of his

despairing goodnatured and hopefulstops the cry of the hungry and promotes all virtue the best men are the most industrious the most wealthy work the hardest they always find something to do do you ever wonder that men of wealth do not retire and enjoy their substance we know some young men look forward with anticipation to the time of retiring it is doubtful if a man should ever retire from business as long as he lives we think we know men who were they to abandon business would be ruined not pecuniarily but mentallytheir lives would be shortened god never intended mans mind should become dormant it is governed by fixed laws those laws are imperative in their exactions something to do oh if i had something to do there are young men who sigh for it yet one thing they can dothat is seek for a job once found provided it is an honest one do not hesitate to perform it even if it does not pay as well as you expected moneyed men the cleveland herald said twenty years ago during a stringency of the times that moneyed men are the veriest cravens on earth so timid that on the least alarm they pull their heads turtlelike within their shells and snugly housed hug their glittering treasure until all fear is removed the consequence is that a few days disturbance of the monetary atmosphere brings on a perfect dearth of not only the precious metals but even of paper money their representative moneyed men never adopt the tactics of mutual support hence as soon as a shot is fired into the flock they scatter each looking out for himself each distrustful of the other and each

practical use and popular instruction in political science graphical analysis of roof trusses for the use of engineers architects and builders by charles e greene am professor of civil engineering in the university of michigan chicago ill george h frost the author of this work truly says that any designer who fairly tries the graphical method will be pleased with the simplicity and directness of the analysis even for apparently complex forms the hindrance to the general use of the method is the want of knowledge of the higher mathematics which are largely used in most treatises on the subject professor greene has avoided this stumbling block and given us a treatise which may be understood and appreciated by any one of common school education we therefore give his work a hearty commendation

assignats and mandats the money and the finances of the french revolution of 1789 by stephen d dillaye price free by mail 30 cents philadelphia pa henry carey baird co 810 walnut street mr dillaye differs with the hon ad white president of cornell university as to the relative merits of money and promises to pay money and he begins with the assertion that the presidents object is to depreciate american credit stability and honor further perusal to ascertain the meaning of this attack on a patriotic and useful member of society shows us what mr dillaye thinks he means he talks of credit being the vital element of national power and from this he argues that the more credit a nation hasthat is the deeper it is in debtthe more powerful it becomes in short he confuses credit as opposed to discredit with credit as opposed to casha grievous blunder surely a nations credit is like a merchants it becomes greater only as his debts become smaller and people trust a government for the same reason as they trust an individual mainly because every previous obligation has been honorably observed it is gratifying to know that persons of mr dillayes way of thinking are few and unimportant and

the plows for opening furrows to receive the seed as it passes from the conductor spouts the lower ends of the spouts or tubes pass in through the sides of the plows so as to conduct the seed into the bottom of the furrows before they have been partially filled by the falling in of the soil the dropping plate is concaved around its dropping holes and is provided with a plate that may be adjusted to cover one set of dropping holes to drop the hills twice as far apart as when both sets of holes operate improved animal trap thomas n hughes muddy creek tennthis trap is for animals of all kinds as rats mice and larger animals as foxes minks coons etc that are allured by bait and is automatically set again by the animal caught to be ready for the next animal attracted by the bait it is divided by a longitudinal partition into two main sections in which the working parts are disposed the entrance at the end of one section has a drop door which is arranged back of the same resting when closed on side strips in inclined position and being supported on an upright arm of a centrally pivoted treadle door at the bottom of the trap when the trap is set the treadle door is only required to swing sufficiently on its pivots to release the drop door from the arm suitable seats at the under side of the trap at both sides of the treadle door preventing the door from swinging farther than necessary the bait is placed in a grated receptacle near the treadle door and entices the animal to pass in so as to close the drop door when it arrives at the part of the treadle door near the bait the back end of this section is perforated or grated to admit light which attracts the frightened animal and induces him to pass toward the light the top part of the trap may be grated to admit air and the glass door at the end made to slide to admit the taking out of the animals for killing them new miscellaneous inventions apparatus for the hydration of chlorine gas william maynard new york citythis invention relates to an improved construction of apparatus for the hydration of gases and more particularly chlorine gas for the manufacture of chlorine water for use in the industrial arts of bleaching etc it consists mainly in a case having an inlet for the water above an inlet for the gas below and provided with an intermediate water percolating medium combined with a reservoir located below the level of the case and having a watersealed communication therewith which reservoir receives the hydrated gases and which water seal prevents the heavy gas in the case from passing out through the bottom inlet the case for the percolation of water and the absorption of the gas is made of conical shape with the largest diameter at the bottom to produce the greatest absorption of the heavy gas when first admitted while horizontal partitions or shelves in said case are provided with upwardly projecting tubes which hold a permanent surface of water on the said partition or shelves the tubes permit by their peculiar shape the water to pass down on one side and the gas up on the opposite side of said tube while their alternating arrangement in the alternating shelves gives a zigzag and long continued passage to the gas and water in moving in opposite directions through the case improved process of preparing gas fuel martin n diall terre haute indthis inventor saturates wood by immersing it in any hydrocarbon oil for from six to twelve hours as required by the nature of the wood so that it may take up the necessary quantity of oil for the required strength of gas the wood is then immersed in a bath of water for taking up a quantity of water outside the oil and is then charged in the retorts the same as coal and distilled in the same way by this process the inventor claims that he produces fixed gas equal to coal gas much faster and with less expense the wood and water furnishing the hydrogen and the oil furnishing the carbon improved fishing line leader

escape john f werner new york citythe terrible disaster in the brooklyn theater is serving as a stimulus to induce the invention of devices looking to the prevention of a like occurrence the present inventor has devised a new fire escape for theaters concert halls and other public places of amusement by which the space at the upper parts of the entrances halls or vestibules of the buildings is utilized for the purpose of forming additional passage ways for the persons in the buildings to be used in case of fire for the more convenient and less dangerous exit of the same the invention consists mainly of a movable floor suspended by chains pulleys and weights near the ceiling of the entrances and lowered in case of fire it is supported on projecting rests of the side walls at suitable height above the floor sliding extensions and swinging stairs and rear sections connect with the ground outside of the door and with the staircases of the gallery so as to form separate exits above the regular entrances improved electromagnetic dental plugger james e dexter new york citythis invention consists first in a magnet having a centrally bored iron core surrounded by a magnetic coil which is enveloped by an iron shell that is concentric with the central core and is attached to a flange formed on the lower end of the said central core one side of both shell and core are split

also an arrangement of the ribs between the saws for facilitating the separating of the seed from the cotton without breaking and injuring the fiber there are also ingenious devices for preventing the seed from gathering and clogging at the ends of the saw drum improved safety check for elevators nathan h fogg boston masswhen the car is suspended normally from the rope the rubber balls arranged in sockets near the lower part of the car are supported on their seats in a state of rest but the instant that the rope breaks or gets detached from the bolt the action of a spiral spring throws an actuating plate downward and levers and ballcarrying rods upward the balls are thus thrown off their seats and wedged between the inclined sides of the pockets and the guide posts of the elevator so as to stop thereby the car improved combination lock achille parise naples italythis is a new combination lock for doors trunks safes etc that admits of a large number of combinations and may be

and others who ask us to recommend books on industrial and scientific subjects should address the booksellers who advertise in our columns all of whom are trustworthy firms for catalogues 1 rhc says we have a slate roof which leaks very much i have not discovered any defect in the way in which it was put on it appears to be perfect the pitch may be too low and the rain may be driven through by the wind on this account is there any wash paint or cement that might be used for the purpose of remedying this defect a there is an india rubber paint which is used to make leaky roofs tight but we have not learned of its being applied to slate roofs 2 ccb says i am making a small steam engine the cylinder has inside diameter about 1 inch with 2 inches stroke what would be the most suitable material and dimensions for the boiler a make one 10 or 12 inches in diameter and 18 inches high of 18 inch iron you can carry 60 lbs steam pressure 3 mc says i have had charge of some greenhouses that were erected about four years ago they are thoroughly heated and all the pipes have a thick coat of black paint the houses never gave any satisfaction no matter how healthy the plants were in the fall soon after the fires were lighted both leaves and flowers began to drop and some plants died my predecessors attributed it to gas getting into the houses upon inquiry i found no gas was there except when the pipes were hot and that the hotter they were the worse it was in my opinion the cause of the trouble was a strong smell of paint from the pipes since then i only keep heat enough to save the plants from freezing a from your statement there is no doubt that the paint used on the pipes was an imperfectly purified coal tar such tar contains a great number of hydrocarbonsnaphtha naphthalen anthracen phenol several organic alkaloids hydrosulphuric and hydrocyanic acids etc all of which are more or less volatile at the temperature to which they must have been subjected these exhalations have proved fatal to plant life when in sufficient quantity we do not know of a better remedy than that of removing the cause painting the pipes with a strong solution of washing soda and lime would in a measure prevent the escape of the most objectionable constituents into the air by forming with them compounds nonvolatile at any temperature to which they are likely to be subjected in contact with the pipes but the former would be the surest plan 4 cdw asks the roof of the new illinois state house as well as the stylobate cornices and upper portion of the dome are covered with zinc it has been on about three years and i am told is materially affected by oxidation the theory is that zinc though subject to oxidization has the peculiarity that the oxide does not scale off as from iron but forms a permanent coating impervious to the action of the atmosphere some mechanics however assert that neither zinc copper nor lead will withstand the action of our atmosphere as bituminous coal strongly impregnated with sulphur is almost the only fuel used it is claimed by some that the sulphurous acid in the atmosphere tends to corrode zinc so as to make it worthless for roofs or gutter linings a are you sure that the roof and gutters in question are not of galvanized iron iron coated with zinc this is the material most commonly used for that purpose at the present time zinc has been found to be too brittle for the strain to which it is subjected in such cases by the expansion and contraction induced by changes of temperature a slight oxidation will adhere to the surface but an acid deposit from the atmosphere will penetrate the coating in points and deteriorate the metal 5 njs says i have a floor of ash and black walnut which has been oiled with raw linseed oil once how can i finish it so as to get a hard smooth finish that will not be scratched by boot heels nor be sticky or retain the dirt as a waxed floor does a oil raises the fiber of black walnut and gives it a rougher surface than when free from it to polish any wood it is only necessary to fill the pores well and then rub it down to a smooth surface thus painters prefer to put on a coat of shellac varnish first before oiling walnut and other hard woods for fine floors a thin coat of liquid wax is applied as a finish 6 ajs asks what is the best plan for putting up a cheap dry house of lumber for drying by steam white oak hickory and other lumber used in wagon and buggy making a make as tight a house as possible with tongued and grooved sidingboards floors roof etc and provide a stack of steam pipe containing 1 foot of heating surface to every 50 cubic feet of air contained in the building set the steam pipe in compact shape and enclose it with a casing of galvanized sheet iron open at the top supply cold air from outside of the building by a boxed conduit to the bottom of this stack the air when heated will rise and diffuse itself into the room and as it cools will fall to the floor provide registers in the floor through which it may escape into other boxed tubes under the floor leading to an upright chimney discharging above the roof let a smoke pipe from the boiler enter the chimney and extend up inside the flue far enough to heat the same the change of air is necessary to dry the lumber the size of the house of course will depend upon the quantity of material required to be stacked up into it at any one time 7 g asks 1 how do you calculate the amount of pipe of a given size to warm a room of a given size a one square foot of plate or pipe surface is generally taken as sufficient to heat about 70 cubic feet of air in dwellings 2 what allowance should be made for doors and windows a the said foot of surface will heat in accordance with varying conditions from 40 to 100 cubic feet of air and allowance should be made for extra exposures to correspond with that scale a steam pressure of 5 lbs is sufficient for heating purposes 3 what is meant by the terms direct and indirect radiation in giving capacity of steam generators for heating houses a direct radiation is used when the pipes are located in the room and indirect when they are located in a chamber in the cellar to warm air which is conducted to the room by air pipes 8 dm says after reading lsws reply to jbc p 75 6 vol 36 i think the following demonstration will be more acceptable to jbc imagine three spheres of which the given circles are great circles and a plane tangent to the three spheres any two of the spheres may be conceived to have been generated by the revolution of two of the circles about the line joining their centers during such revolution the lines tangent to the two circles describe a conical surface we have therefore three spheres and three conical surfaces now the plane which is tangent to the three spheres is also evidently tangent to the three conical surfaces and therefore the vertices of those conical surfaces are all in the tangent plane now those vertices are the points 1 2 3 but the same points are also in the plane passing through the centers of the three spheres which is the same with the plane of the paper on which the figure is drawn those points being in two planes at the same time must therefore be in the intersection of those planes that is to say in a straight line 9 cwh asks can dyeing or coloring be done in cold water a many of the coal tar colors may be used in this way for animal fiberswool silk etcthe affinity of these colors is so great that in most instances no mordants are necessary the baths are usually made slightly acid with vegetable fibers however a fast dye is not assured without mordanting some of the finer goods are prepared by treating with steam coagulated albumen animalizing gelatin various tannates tin salt alum and other metallic salts the following is the usual method of treatment except with goods intended for very light shades pass the goods through a strong decoction of sumac or other tannin solution for an hour and afterwards for an hour or two through a weak solution of stannate of soda wring out dip into a dilute solution of sulphuric acid and rinse well in water the goods are then ready to be passed through the color bath slightly acidulated for different tints these baths are worked at different temperatures 10 fw says i wish to lay the face tier of a brick wall in black mortar how can i make the coloring material and mix it a some prefer to use red mortar and afterwards pencil the joints with black color the ordinary white mortar with spanish brown for red mortar and with ivory black for black by mixing in enough of the color in a powdered state to give a good deep tone 11 has asks 1 how many prisms are required in a spectroscope to detect mineral elements in presence of all the ash ingredients of organic bodies a if we understand you one 60 prism will answer 2 what is the best and cheapest form of apparatus to heat such compounds for examination a mix the substance with a little pure hydrochloric acid and glycerin and introduce into the flame on a coil of platinum wire 1 has soup prepared by dissolving meat bones in a papins digester ever been known to produce ossification of any of the soft tissues a we have never heard of such a result 2 has it ever been known to produce a new crop of teeth in toothless persons a we have no data as to such a fact i have seen a statement that may 19 1780 was so dark a day that candles were necessary everywhere and i have heard that another occurred about the year 1820 has any scientific explanation ever been given of this phenomenon a the darkness on the days you mention were the result of solar eclipses they occurred on days of unusual cloudiness perhaps the darkest day in modern history was that caused by the total solar eclipse in the year 1806 12 ab says 1 i have built a boat 15 feet long and 4 feet 6 inches wide how large a boiler and engine do i require to work her to best advantage she is 22 inches deep from top of rail to top of keel a cylinder 2 x 3 inches boiler 20 inches in diameter and 3 feet high propeller 18 to 20 inches in diameter and of 3 feet pitch 2 how fast ought she to run a probable speed 5 miles an hour in smooth water 13 ll asks 1 does it make any difference in what position a watch is in when running a for watches adjusted to temperature and position it does not make much difference 2 when not being carried what position should it be left in a in the case of ordinary watches we imagine that the wear will be rather more uniform when they are in a vertical position 3 if a person sleeps in a cola room would a watch be better under his pillow than on a table or hung up in the same room a it is best not to subject them to great changes of temperature 14 wg says in reply to cww who has an engine of 258 inches bore and 4 inches stroke which runs slower with increase of pressure having had much experience with small engines and boilers i will state that i have had the same difficulty when using an upright tubular boiler and discovered the following to be the cause the upper portions of the tube superheat the steam to such a degree as to prevent lubrication on the valve and piston surface by condensation and thereby reduce the speed of engine even with increased pressure this effect will be more appreciable when the area and travel of slide valve are in excess 15 jmt asks is there friction between two bodies while at rest or only when one or both are in motion a both when at rest and in motion why does a balloon rise in the air a see p 64 vol 32 16 sjs asks 1 how are augers twisted a by special machinery 2 how are twist drills made and are they single or double grooved a they are double grooved or double twisted and are cut out in a milling machine can weights springs or water from a tank be used to any advantage to run a lathe a no how much do iron and brass in rods or bands expand in length when heated to red heat a iron about 18 inch per foot brass 110 inch is the pressure of the air to be added to the weight of water in the bottom of a vessel in estimating the pressure on the bottom a no does a watch or clock run faster when just wound up a no is it not moisture in the air that makes it heavier and so affects the barometer a yes is the pressure in a siphon equal throughout or is it greater in the upper end a equal throughout will it take more power to run two millstones in opposite directions than it will to run one at the same speed the other being stationary a yes it will take double the power 1 how are common screws made a in lathes with tools and dies 2 how can i make wooden screws perfectly smooth a by using keen tools what is the simplest way of cutting a square hole in a bar of iron a drill a round hole and square it out 17 gec asks could i have a brick range 23 feet built on a platform about 1 foot from floor with two compartments to be heated with petroleum the lower one to be used as an oven the upper one to have a stove top to set cooking utensils on and have a ventilating pipe run from each compartment of the oil receptacles into the place in the chimney where the stove pipe usually goes to carry away any gas or smoke i want the oil receptacles to be arranged to be drawn out to be filled and trimmed and i would like four burners to heat an oven 22 inches square as hot as the same oven could be heated with wood a we doubt the propriety or the economy of substituting oil for wood but something may be done to make the atmosphere of kitchens more endurable in summer and permanently so in warm climates a double faced range could be made and set in the center of the thickness of the chimney with the space above the top of it open to the exterior of the house a very slight structure simply having a good floor and roof and open around the sides and built against the chimney as an extension to the house would answer for a summer kitchen while the ordinary kitchen inside the house could be used in winter the transposition could be made by a pair of iron sliding doors shutting off the kitchen not in use and these doors could be transferred from one side of the chimney to the other when the change of season required it 18 axa says in your issue of december 2 is a recipe in which insoluble acid chromate of lime and gelatin are to be used and in a succeeding number of your paper the modes of preparing the insoluble acid are given i have made the acid according to your directions but the result of my manipulation of the recipe is a failure you say take of insoluble acid chromate of lime one part and of gelatin five parts but you do not say what further is to be done will the acid dissolve the gelatin or must warm water be added in my experiment the acid would not dissolve the gelatin and i had to add considerable warm water before it would do so a dissolve the bichromate of lime in the smallest possible quantity of warm water and filter then add the gelatin previously softened by immersion in cold water heat the mixture over a water bath until the gelatin is completely dissolved stir well and use while hot the recipe should have stated that this cement was best suited for glassware the bichromate of potash or of ammonia will answer nearly as well as the lime salt 19 ecn asks how must a stove be constructed to burn pea coal for heating outbuildings is there any way of constructing a draught below the grate of any common heating stove sufficiently strong to do without an extra long chimney a use a broad grate to spread the coal out well so as to avoid the necessity of heaping it up much make the opening for the draft some distance below the grate and regulate by the usual slide dampers in the lower and upper doors minerals etcspecimens have been received from the following correspondents and examined with the result stated frrsthe substance you send is carbonate of iron it is held in solution in the water by the large excess of carbonic acid which the water contains on boiling the water the carbonic acid gas is expelled and the iron salt is precipitated from solution the removal of this and some other objectionable salts which the water very probably contains may be removed by the addition of the proper quantity of clear lime water to itthe lime in this instance will combine with the excess of carbonic acid and fall to the bottom together with the carbonate of iron to determine the precise quantity of lime water requisite add the reagent saturated solution to a small portion of known volume of the freshly drawn water in small quantities at a time and with constant stirring until no further precipitate forms then by a simple operation in proportion the quantity of the reagent necessary for the purification of a given quantity of the well water may be easily determined an excess of the reagent must be avoided this impurity would probably prevent the successful working of an injector wsw asks how is the best rosin
