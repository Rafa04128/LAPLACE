crustacea index translators preface my principal reason for undertaking the translation of dr fritz mllers admirable work on the crustacea entitled fr darwin was that it was still although published as long ago as 1864 and highly esteemed by the authors scientific countrymen absolutely unknown to a great number of english naturalists including some who have occupied themselves more or less specially with the subjects of which it treats it possesses a value quite independent of its reference to darwinism due to the number of highly interesting and important facts in the natural history and particularly the developmental history of the crustacea which its distinguished author himself an unwearied and original investigator of these matters has brought together in it to a considerable section of english naturalists the tone adopted by the author in speaking of one of the greatest of their number will be a source of much gratification in granting his permission for the translation of his little book dr fritz mller kindly offered to send some emendations and additions to certain parts of it his notes included many corrections of printers errors some of which would have proved unintelligible without his aid some small additions and notes which have been inserted in their proper places and two longer pieces one forming a footnote near the close of chapter 11 the other at the end of chapter 12 describing the probable mode of evolution of the rhizocephala from the cirripedia of the execution of the translation i will say but little my chief object in this as in other cases has been to furnish as nearly as possible a literal version of the original regarding mere elegance of expression as of secondary importance in a scientific work as much of dr mllers german does not submit itself to such treatment very readily i must beg his and the readers indulgence for any imperfections arising from this cause wsd london 15th february 1869 authors preface it is not the purpose of the following pages to discuss once more the arguments deduced for and against darwins theory of the origin of species or to weigh them one against the other their object is simply to indicate a few facts favourable to this theory collected upon the same south american ground on which as darwin tells us the idea first occurred to him of devoting his attention to the origin of speciesthat mystery of mysteries it is only by the accumulation of new and valuable material that the controversy will gradually be brought into a state fit for final decision and this appears to be for the present of more importance than a repeated analysis of what is already before us moreover it is but fair to leave it to darwin himself at first to beat off the attacks of his opponents from the splendid structure which he has raised with such a masterhand fm desterro 7th september 1863 history of crustacea chapter i introductory when i had read charles darwins book on the origin of species it seemed to me that there was one mode and that perhaps the most certain of testing the correctness of the views developed in it namely to attempt to apply them as specially as possible to some particular group of animals such an attempt to establish a genealogical tree whether for the families of a class the genera of a large family or for the species of an extensive genus and to produce pictures as complete and intelligible as possible of the common ancestors of the various smaller and larger circles might furnish a result in three different ways 1 in the first place darwins suppositions when thus applied might lead to irreconcilable and contradictory conclusions from which the erroneousness of the suppositions might be inferred if darwins opinions are false it was to be expected that contradictions would accompany their detailed application at every step and that these by their cumulative force would entirely destroy the suppositions from which they proceeded even though the deductions derived from each particular case might possess little of the unconditional nature of mathematical proof 2 secondly the attempt might be successful to a greater or less extent if it was possible upon the foundation and with the aid of the darwinian theory to show in what sequence the various smaller and larger circles had separated from the common fundamental form and from each other in what sequence they had acquired the peculiarities which now characterise them and what transformations they had undergone in the lapse of agesif the establishment of such a genealogical tree of a primitive history of the group under consideration free from internal contradictions was possiblethen this conception the more completely it took up all the species within itself and the more deeply it enabled us to descend into the details of their structure must in the same proportion bear in itself the warrant of its truth and the more convincingly prove that the foundation upon which it is built is no loose sand and that it is more than merely an intellectual dream 3 in the third place however it was possible and this could not but appear prim facie the most probable case that the attempt might be frustrated by the difficulties standing in its way without settling the question either way in a perfectly satisfactory manner but if it were only possible in this way to arrive for oneself at a moderately certain independent judgment upon a matter affecting the highest questions so deeply even this alone could not but be esteemed a great gain having determined to make the attempt i had in the first place to decide upon some particular class the choice was necessarily limited to those the chief forms of which were easily to be obtained alive in some abundance the crabs and macrurous crustacea the stomapoda the diastylid the amphipoda and isopoda the ostracoda and daphnid the copepoda and parasita the cirripedes and rhizocephala of our coast representing the class of crustacea with the deficiency only of the phyllopoda and xiphosura furnished a long and varied and at the same time intimately connected series such as was at my command in no other class but even independently of this circumstance the selection of the crustacea could hardly have been doubtful nowhere else as has already been indicated by various writers is the temptation stronger to give to the expressions relationship production from a common fundamental form and the like more than a mere figurative signification than in the case of the lower crustacea among the parasitic crustacea especially everybody has long been accustomed to speak in a manner scarcely admitting of a figurative meaning of their arrest of development by parasitism as if the transformation of species were a matter of course it would certainly never appear to any one to be a pastime worthy of the deity to amuse himself with the contrivance of these marvellous cripplings and so they were supposed to have fallen by their own fault like adam from their previous state of perfection that a great part of the larger and smaller groups into which this class is divided might be regarded as satisfactorily established was a further advantage not to be undervalued whilst in two other classes with which i was familiar namely the annelida and acaleph all the attempted arrangements could only be considered preliminary revisions these undisplaceable groups like the sharply marked forms of the hard manyjointed dermal framework were not only important as safe starting points and supports but were also of the highest value as inflexible barriers in a problem in which from its very nature fancy must freely unfold her wings when i thus began to study our crustacea more closely from this new standpoint of the darwinian theorywhen i attempted to bring their arrangements into the form of a geological tree and to form some idea of the probable structure of their ancestorsi speedily saw as indeed i expected that it would require years of preliminary work before the essential problem could be seriously handled the extant systematic works generally laid more weight upon the characters separating the genera families and orders than upon those which unite the members of each group and consequently often furnished but little employable material but above all things a thorough knowledge of development was indispensable and every one knows how imperfect is our present knowledge of this subject the existing deficiencies were the more difficult to supply because as van beneden remarks with regard to the decapoda from the often incredible difference in the development of the most nearly allied forms these must be separately studiedusually family by family and frequently genus by genusnay sometimes as in the case of penus even species by species and because these investigations in themselves troublesome and tedious often depend for their success upon a lucky chance but although the satisfactory completion of the genealogical tree of the crustacea appeared to be an undertaking for which the strength and life of an individual would hardly suffice even under more favourable circumstances than could be presented by a distant island far removed from the great market of scientific life far from libraries and museumsnevertheless its practicability became daily less doubtful in my eyes and fresh observations daily made me more favourably inclined towards the darwinian theory in determining to state the arguments which i derived from the consideration of our crustacea in favour of darwins views and which together with more general considerations and observations in other departments essentially aided in making the correctness of those views seem more and more palpable to me i am chiefly influenced by an expression of darwins whoever says he origin of species page 482 is led to believe that species are mutable will do a good service by conscientiously expressing his conviction to the desire expressed in these words i respond for my own part with the more pleasure as this furnishes me with an opportunity of publicly giving expression in words to the thanks which i feel most deeply to be due from me to darwin for the instructions and suggestions for which i am so deeply indebted to his book accordingly i throw this sandgrain with confidence into the scale against the load of prejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed without troubling myself as to whether the priests of orthodox science will reckon me amongst dreamers and children in knowledge of the laws of nature chapter ii the species of melita a false supposition when the consequences proceeding from it are followed further and further will sooner or later lead to absurdities and palpable contradictions during the period of tormenting doubtand this was by no means a short onewhen the pointer of the scales oscillated before me in perfect uncertainty between the pro and the con and when any fact leading to a quick decision would have been most welcome to me i took no small pains to detect some such contradictions among the inferences as to the class of crustacea furnished by the darwinian theory but i found none either then or subsequently those which i thought i had found were dispelled on closer consideration or actually became converted into supports for darwins theory nor so far as i am aware have any of the necessary consequences of darwins hypotheses been proved by any one else to stand in clear and irreconcilable contradiction and yet as the most profound students of the animal kingdom are amongst darwins opponents it would seem that it ought to have been an easy matter for them to crush him long since beneath a mass of absurd and contradictory inferences if any such were to be drawn from his theory to this want of demonstrated contradictions i think we may ascribe just the same importance in darwins favour that his opponents have attributed to the absence of demonstrated intermediate forms between the species of the various strata of the earth independently of the reasons which darwin gives for the preservation of such intermediate forms being only exceptional this last mentioned circumstance will not be regarded as of very great significance by any one who has traced the development of an animal upon larvae fished from the sea and had to seek in vain for months and even years for those transitional forms which he nevertheless knew to be swarming around him in thousands a few examples may show how contradictions might come forth as necessary results of the darwinian hypotheses it seems to be a necessity for all crabs which remain for a long time out of the water but why is of no consequence to us here that air shall penetrate from behind into the branchial cavity now these crabs which have become more or less estranged from the water belong to the most different familiesthe raninid ranina eriphin eriphia gonagra grapsoid aratus sesarma etc ocypodid gelasimus ocypoda etc and the separation of these families must doubtless be referred to a much earlier period than the habit of leaving the water displayed by some of their members the arrangements connected with aerial respiration therefore could not be inherited from a common ancestor and could scarcely be accordant in their construction if there were any such accordance not referable to accidental resemblance among them it would have to be laid in the scale as evidence against the correctness of darwins views i shall show hereafter how in this case the result far from presenting such contradictions was rather in the most complete harmony with what might be predicted from darwins theory fig 1 melita exilii n sp male enlarged the large branchial lamell are seen projecting between the legs fig 1 melita exilii n sp male enlarged the large branchial lamell are seen projecting between the legs a second examplewe are already acquainted with four species of melita m valida setipes anisochir and fresnelii and i can add a fifth fig 1 in which the second pair of feet bears upon one side a small hand of the usual structure and on the other an enormous claspforceps this want of symmetry is something so unusual among the amphipoda and the structure of the claspforceps differs so much from what is seen elsewhere in this order and agrees so closely in the five species that one must unhesitatingly regard them as having sprung from common ancestors belonging to them alone among known species but one of these species m fresnelii discovered by savigny in egypt is said to want the secondary flagellum of the anterior antennae which occurs in the others from the trustworthiness of all savignys works there can scarcely be a doubt as to the correctness of this statement now if the presence or absence of the secondary flagellum possessed the significance of a distinctive generic character which is usually ascribed to it or if there were other important differences between melita fresnelii and the other species abovementioned which would make it seem natural to separate m fresnelii as a distinct genus and to leave the others united with the rest of the species of melitathat is to say in the sense of the darwinian theory if we assume that all the other melit possessed common ancestors which were not at the same time the ancestors of m fresneliithis would stand in contradiction to the conclusion derived from the structure of the claspforceps that m fresnelii and the four other species abovementioned possessed common ancestors which were not also the ancestors of the remaining species of melita it would follow from the structure of the claspforceps from the presence or absence of the secondary flagellum m palmata etc m exilii etc m fresnelli m palmata etc m exilii etc m fresnelii as in the first case among the crabs a typical agreement of arrangements produced independently of each other would have been a very suspicious circumstance for darwins theory so also in the second would any difference more profound than that of very nearly allied species now it seems to me that the secondary flagellum can by no means furnish a reason for doubting the close relationship of m fresnelii to m exilii etc which is indicated by the peculiar structure of the unpaired claspforceps in the first place we must consider the possibility that the secondary flagellum which is not always easy to detect may only have been overlooked by savigny as indeed spence bate supposes to have been the case if it is really deficient it must be remarked that i have found it in species of the genera leucotho cyrtophium and amphilochus in which genera it was missed by savigny dana and spence batethat a species proved by the form of the epimera cox sp b of the caudal feet uropoda westw etc to be a true amphitho1 possesses itthat in many species of cerapus it is reduced to a scarcely perceptible rudimentnay that it is sometimes present in youth and disappears although perhaps not without leaving some trace at maturity as was found by spence bate to be the case in acanthonotus owenii and atylus carinatus and i can affirm with regard to an atylus of these seas remarkable for its plumose branchiand that from all this at the present day when the increasing number of known amphipoda and the splitting of them into numerous genera thereby induced compels us to descend to very minute distinctive characters we must nevertheless hesitate before employing the secondary flagellum as a generic character the case of melita fresnelii therefore cannot excite any doubts as to darwins theory 1 i accept this and all the other genera of amphipoda here mentioned with the limits given to them by spence bate catalogue of amphipodous crustacea chapter iii morphology of crustaceanaupliuslarv if the absence of contradictions among the inferences deduced from them for a narrow and consequently easily surveyed department must prepossess us in favour of darwins views it must be welcomed as a positive triumph of his theory if farreaching conclusions founded upon it should subsequently be confirmed by facts the existence of which science in its previous state by no means allowed us to suspect from many results of this kind upon which i could report i select as examples two which were of particular importance to me and relate to discoveries the great significance of which in the morphology and classification of the crustacea will not be denied even by the opponents of darwin considerations upon the developmental history of the crustacea had led me to the conclusion that if the higher and lower crustacea were at all derivable from common progenitors the former also must once have passed through naupliuslike conditions soon afterwards i discovered naupliiform larv of shrimps archiv fr naturgeschichte 1860 i p 8 and i must admit that this discovery gave me the first decided turn in darwins favour the similar number of segments1 occurring in the crabs and macrura amphipoda and isopoda in which the last seven segments are always different from the preceding ones in the appendages with which they are furnished could only be regarded as an inheritance from the same ancestors and if at the present day the majority of the crabs and macrura and indeed the stalkeyed crustacea in general pass through zoalike developmental states and the same mode of transformation was to be ascribed to their ancestors the same thing must also apply if not to the immediate ancestors of the amphipoda and isopoda at least to the common progenitors of these and the stalkeyed crustacea any such assumption as this was however very hazardous so long as not a single fact properly relating to the edriophthalma could be adduced in its support as the structure of this very coherent group seemed to be almost irreconcilable with many peculiarities of the zoa thus in my eyes this point long constituted one of the chief difficulties in the application of the darwinian views to the crustacea and i could scarcely venture to hope that i might yet find traces of this passage through the zoaform among the amphipoda or isopoda and thus obtain a positive proof of the correctness of this conclusion at this point van benedens statement that a cheliferous isopod tanais dulongii belonging according to milneedwards to the same family as the common asellus aquaticus possesses a carapace like the decapoda directed my attention to these animals and a careful examination proved that these isopods have preserved more truly than any other adult crustacea many of the most essential peculiarities of the zoae especially their mode of respiration whilst in all other oniscoida the abdominal feet serve for respiration these in our cheliferous isopod fig 2 are solely motory organs into which no bloodcorpuscle ever enters and the chief seat of respiration is as in the zoae in the lateral parts of the carapace which are abundantly traversed by currents of blood and beneath which a constant stream of water passes maintained as in zoae and the adult decapoda by an appendage of the second pair of maxill which is wanting in all other edriophthalma tanais dubius fig 2 tanais dubius kr hermaphrodite magnified showing the orifice of entrance x into the cavity overarched by the carapace in which an appendage of the second pair of maxill f plays on four feet i k l m are the rudiments of the lamell which subsequently form the broodcavity for both these discoveries it may be remarked in passing science is indebted less to a happy chance than immediately to darwins theory species of penus live in the european seas as well as here and their naupliusbrood has no doubt repeatedly passed unnoticed through the hands of the numerous naturalists who have investigated those seas as well as through my own2 for it has nothing which could attract particular attention amongst the multifarious and often wonderful naupliusforms when i fancying from the similarity of its movements that it was a young penuszoa had for the first time captured such a larva and on bringing it under the microscope found a nauplius differing toto clo from this zoa i might have thrown it aside as being completely foreign to the developmental series which i was tracing if the idea of early naupliiform stages of the higher crustacea which indeed i did not believe to be still extant had not at the moment vividly occupied my attention and if i had not long been seeking among the edriophthalma for traces of the supposititious zoastate and seized with avidity upon everything that promised to made this refractory order serviceable to me van benedens short statement could hardly have affected me so much in the manner of an electric shock and impelled me to a renewed study of the tanaides especially as i had once before plagued myself with them in the baltic without getting any further than my predecessors and i have not much taste for going twice over the same ground 1 like claus i do not regard the eyes of the crustacea as limbs and therefore admit no ocular segment on the other hand i count in the median piece of the tail to which the character of a segment is often denied in opposition to its interpretation as a segment of the body only the want of limbs can be cited in its favour we have the relation of the intestine which usually opens in this piece and sometimes even traverses its whole length as in microdeutopus and some other amphipoda in microdeutopus as spence bate has already pointed out one is even led to regard small processes of this tubular caudal piece as rudimentary members bell also british stalkeyed crustacea p xx states that he observed limbs of the last segment in palmon serratus in the form of small moveable points the attempt has often been made to divide the body of the higher crustacea into small sections composed of equal numbers of segments these sections consisting of 3 5 or 7 segments none of these attempts has ever met with general acceptance my own investigations lead me to a conception which nearly approaches van benedens i assume four sections of 5 segments eachthe primitive body the forebody the hindbody and the middlebody the primitive body includes the segments which the naupliiform larva brings with it out of the egg it is afterwards divided by the younger sections which become developed in its middle into the head and tail to this primitive body belong the two pairs of antenn the mandibles and the caudal feet posterior pair of pleopoda sp b even in the mature animal the fact that these terminal sections belong to one another is sometimes betrayed by the resemblance of their appendages especially that of the outer branch of the caudal feet with the outer branch the socalled scale of the second pair of antenn like the antenn the caudal feet may also become the bearers of high sensorial apparatus as is shown by the ear of mysis the sequence of the sections of the body in order of time seems originally to have been that first the forebody then the hindbody and finally the middlebody was formed the forebody appears in the adult animal to be entirely or partially amalgamated with the head its appendages siagonopoda westw are all or in part serviceable for the reception of food and generally sharply distinguished from those of the following group the segments of the middlebody seem always to put forth limbs immediately after their own appearance whilst the segments of the hindbody often remain destitute of feet through long portions of the larval life or even throughout life as in many female diastylid a reason among many others for not as is usual regarding the middlebody of the crustacea as equivalent to the constantly footless abdomen of insects the appendages of the middlebody pereiopoda seem never even in their youngest form to possess two equal branches a peculiarity which usually characterises the appendages of the hindbody this is a circumstance which renders very doubtful the equivalence of the middlebody of the malacostraca with the section of the body which in the copepoda bears the swimming feet and in the cirripedia the cirri the comprehension of the feet of the hindbody and tail in a single group as fausses pattes abdominales or as pleopoda seems not to be justifiable when there is a metamorphosis they are probably always produced at different periods and they are almost always quite different in structure and function even in the amphipoda in which the caudal feet usually resemble in appearance the last two pairs of abdominal feet they are in general distinguished by some sort of peculiarity and whilst the abdominal feet are reproduced in wearisome uniformity throughout the entire order the caudal feet are as is wellknown amongst the most variable parts of the amphipoda 2 mecznikow has recently found naupliiform shrimplarv in the sea near naples chapter iv sexual peculiarities and dimorphism our tanais which in nearly all the particulars of its structure is an extremely remarkable animal furnished me with a second fact worthy of notice in connection with the theory of the origin of species by natural selection when handlike or cheliform structures occur in the crustacea these are usually more strongly developed in the males than in the females often becoming enlarged in the former to quite a disproportionate size as we have already seen to be the case in melita a better known example of such gigantic chel is presented by the males of the calling crabs gelasimus which are said in running to carry these claws elevated as if beckoning with thema statement which however is not true of all the species as a small and particularly largeclawed one which i have seen running about by thousands in the cassavafields at the mouth of the cambri always holds them closely pressed against its body a second peculiarity of the male crustacea consists not unfrequently in a more abundant development on the flagellum of the anterior antenn of delicate filaments which spence bate calls auditory cilia and which i have considered to be olfactory organs as did leydig before me although i was not aware of it thus they form long dense tufts in the males of many diastylid as van beneden also states with regard to bodotria whilst the females only possess them more sparingly in the copepoda claus called attention to the difference of the sexes in this respect it seems to me as i may remark in passing that this stronger development in the males is greatly in favour of the opinion maintained by leydig and myself as in other cases male animals are not unfrequently guided by the scent in their pursuit of the ardent females now in our tanais the young males up to the last change of skin preceding sexual maturity resemble the females but then they undergo an important metamorphosis amongst other things they lose the moveable appendages of the mouth even to those which serve for the maintenance of the respiratory current their intestine is always found empty and they appear only to live for love but what is most remarkable is that they now appear under two different forms some fig 3 acquire powerful longfingered and very mobile chel and instead of the single olfactory filament of the female have from 12 to 17 of these organs which stand two or three together on each joint of the flagellum the others fig 5 retain the short thick form of the chel of the females but on the other hand their antenn fig 6 are equipped with a far greater number of olfactory filaments which stand in groups of from five to seven together fig 3 head of the ordinary form of the male of tanais dubius kr magnified the terminal set of the second pair of antenn project between the cheliferous feet fig 4 buccal region of the same from below lambda labrum fig 5 head of the rarer form of the male magnified fig 6 flagellum of the same with olfactory filaments magnified in the first place and before inquiring into its significance i will say a word upon this fact itself it was natural to consider whether two different species with very similar females and very different males might not perhaps live together or whether the males instead of occurring in two sharply defined forms might not be only variable within very wide limits i can admit neither of these suppositions our tanais lives among densely interwoven conferv which form a coat of about an inch in thickness upon stones in the neighbourhood of the shore if a handful of this green felt is put into a large glass with clear seawater the walls of the glass are soon seen covered with hundreds nay with thousands of these little plump whitish isopods in this way i have examined thousands of them with the simple lens and i have also examined many hundreds with the microscope without finding any differences among the females or any intermediate forms between the two kinds of males to the old school this occurrence of two kinds of males will appear to be merely a matter of curiosity to those who regard the plan of creation as the free conception of an almighty intellect matured in the thoughts of the latter before it is manifested in palpable external forms it will appear to be a mere caprice of the creator as it is inexplicable either from the point of view of practical adaptation or from the typical plan of structure from the side of darwins theory on the contrary this fact acquires meaning and significance and it appears in return to be fitted to throw light upon a question in which bronn saw the first and most material objection against the new theory namely how it is possible that from the accumulation in various directions of the smallest variations running out of one another varieties and species are produced which stand out from the primary form clearly and sharply like the petiolated leaf of a dicotyledon and are not amalgamated with the primary form and with each other like the irregular curled lobes of a foliaceous lichen let us suppose that the males of our tanais hitherto identical in structure begin to vary in all directions as bronn thinks for aught i care if the species was adapted to its conditions of existence if the best in this respect had been attained and secured by natural selection fresh variations affecting the species as a species would be retrogressions and thus could have no prospect of prevailing they must rather have disappeared again as they arose and the lists would remain open to the males under variation only in respect of their sexual relations in these they might acquire advantages over their rivals by their being enabled either to seek or to seize the females better the best smellers would overcome all that were inferior to them in this respect unless the latter had other advantages such as more powerful chel to oppose to them the best claspers would overcome all less strongly armed champions unless these opposed to them some other advantage such as sharper senses it will be easily understood how in this manner all the intermediate steps less favoured in the development of the olfactory filaments or of the chel would disappear from the lists and two sharply defined forms the best smellers and the best claspers would remain as the sole adversaries at the present day the contest seems to have been decided in favour of the latter as they occur in greatly preponderating numbers perhaps a hundred of them to one smeller to return to bronns objection when he says that for the support of the darwinian theory and in order to explain why many species do not coalesce by means of intermediate forms he would gladly discover some external or internal principle which should compel the variations of each species to advance in one direction instead of merely permitting them in all directions we may in this as in many other cases find such a principle in the fact that actually only a few directions stand open in which the variations are at the same time improvements and in which therefore they can accumulate and become fixed whilst in all others being either indifferent or injurious they will go as lightly as they come fig 7 orchestia darwinii n sp male fig 7 orchestia darwinii n sp male the occurrence of two kinds of males in the same species may perhaps not be a very rare phenomenon in animals in which the males differ widely from the females in structure but only in those which can be procured in sufficient abundance will it be possible to arrive at a conviction that we have not before us either two different species or animals of different ages from my own observation although not very extensive i can give a second example it relates to a shorehopper orchestia the animal fig 7 lives in marshy places in the vicinity of the sea under decaying leaves in the loose earth which the marsh crabs gelasimus sesarma cyclograpsus etc throw up around the entrance to their borrows and even under dry cowdung and horsedung if this species removes to a greater distance from the shore than the majority of its congeners although some of them advance very far into the land and even upon mountains of a thousand feet in height such as o tahitensis telluris and sylvicola its male differs still more from all known species by the powerful chel of the second pair of feet orchestia gryphus from the sandy coast of monchgut alone presents a somewhat similar structure but in a far less degree elsewhere the form of the hand usual in the amphipoda occurs now there is a considerable difference between the males of this species especially in the structure of these chela different so great that we can scarcely find a parallel to it elsewhere between two species of the genusand yet as in tanais we do not meet with a long series of structures running into one another but only two forms united by no intermediate terms figs 8 and 9 the males would be unhesitatingly regarded as belonging to two wellmarked species if they did not live on the same spot with undistinguishable females that the two forms of the chel of the males occur in this species is so far worthy of notice because the formation of the chel which differs widely from the ordinary structure in the other species indicates that it has quite recently undergone considerable changes and therefore such a phenomenon was to be expected in it rather than in other species figs 8 and 9 the two forms of the chel of the male of orchestia darwinii magnified figs 8 and 9 the two forms of the chel of the male of orchestia darwinii magnified i cannot refrain from taking this opportunity of remarking that so far as appears from spence bates catalogue for two different kinds of males orchestia telluris and sylvicola which live together in the forests of new zealand only one form of female is known and hazarding the supposition that we have here a similar case it does not seem to me to be probable that two nearly allied species of these social amphipoda should occur mixed together under the same conditions of life fig 10 coxal lamella of the penultimate pair of feet of the male a and coxal lamella

the same pair of feet of the female of m insatiabilis as the males of several species of melita are distinguished by the powerful unpaired claspforceps the females of some other species of the same genus are equally distinguished from all other amphipoda by the circumstance that in them a peculiar apparatus is developed which facilitates their being held by the male the coxal lamell of the penultimate pair of feet are produced into hooklike processes of which the male lays hold with the hands of the first pair of feet the two species in which i am acquainted with this structure are amongst the most salacious animals of their order even females which are laden with eggs in all stages of development not unfrequently have their males upon their backs the two species are nearly allied to melita palmata leach gammarus dugesii edw which is widely distributed on the european coasts and has been frequently investigated unfortunately however i can find no information as to whether the females of this or any other european species possess a similar contrivance in m exilii all the coxal lamell are of the ordinary formation nevertheless be this as it will whether they exist in two or in twenty species the occurrence of these peculiar hooklike processes is certainly very limited now our two species live sheltered beneath slightly tilted stones in the neighbourhood of the shore one of them melita messalina so high that it is but rarely covered by the water the other melita insatiabilis a little lower both species live together in numerous swarms we cannot therefore suppose that the loving couples are threatened with disturbance more frequently than those of other species nor would it be more difficult for the male than for those of other species in case of his losing his female to find a new one nor is it any more easy to see how the contrivance on the body of the female for insuring the act of copulation could be injurious to other species but so long as it is not demonstrated that our species are particularly in want of this contrivance or that the latter would rather be injurious than beneficial to other species its presence only in these few amphipoda will have to be regarded not as the work of farseeing wisdom but as that of a favourable chance made use of by natural selection under the latter supposition its isolated occurrence is intelligible whilst we cannot perceive why the creator blessed just these few species with an apparatus which he found to be quite compatible with the general plan of structure of the amphipoda and yet denied it to others which live under the same external conditions and equal them even in their extraordinary salacity associated with or in the immediate vicinity of the two species of melita live two species of allorchestes the pairs of which are met with almost more numerously than the single animals and yet their females show no trace of the abovementioned processes of the coxal lamell these cases i think must be brought to bear against the conception supported with so much genius and knowledge by agassiz that species are embodied thoughts of the creator and with these all similar instances in which arrangements which would be equally beneficial to all the species of a group are wanting in the majority and only conferred upon a few special favourites which do not seem to want them any more than the rest chapter v respiration in land crabs among the numerous facts in the natural history of the crustacea upon which a new and clear light is thrown by darwins theory besides the two forms of the males in our tanais and in orchestia darwinii there is one which appears to me of particular importance namely the character of the branchial cavity in the airbreathing crabs of which unfortunately i have been unable to investigate some of the most remarkable gecarcinus ranina as this character namely the existence of an entrance behind the branchi has hitherto been noticed even as a fact only in ranina i will go into it in some detail i have already mentioned that as indeed is required by darwins theory this entrant orifice is produced in different manners in the different families in the frogcrab ranina of the indian ocean which according to rumphius loves to climb up on the roofs of the houses the ordinary anterior entrant orifice is entirely wanting according to milneedwards and the entrance of a canal opening into the hindmost parts of the branchial cavity is situated beneath the commencement of the abdomen the case is most simple in some of the grapsoid as in aratus pisonii a charming lively crab which ascends the mangrove bushes rhizophora and gnaws their leaves by means of its short but remarkably acute claws which prick like pins when it runs over the hand this crab climbs with the greatest agility upon the thinnest twigs once when i had one of these animals sitting upon my hand i noticed that it elevated the hinder part of its carapace and that by this means a wide fissure was opened upon each side above the last pair of feet through which i could look far into the branchial cavity i have since been unable to procure this remarkable animal again but on the other hand i have frequently repeated the same observation upon another animal of the same family apparently a true grapsus which lives abundantly upon the rocks of our coast whilst the hinder part of the carapace rises and the abovementioned fissure is formed the anterior part seems to sink and to narrow or entirely close the anterior entrant orifice under water the elevation of the carapace never takes place the animal therefore opens its branchial cavity in front or behind according as it has to breathe water or air how the elevation of the carapace is effected i do not know but i believe that a membranous sac which extends from the body cavity far into the branchial cavity beneath the hinder part of the carapace is inflated by the impulsion of the fluids of the body and the carapace is thereby raised i have also observed the same elevation of the carapace in some species of the allied genera sesarma and cyclograpsus which dig deep holes in marshy ground and often run about upon the wet mud or sit as if keeping watch before their burrows one must however wait for a long time with these animals when taken out of the water before they open their branchial cavity to the air for they possess a wonderful arrangement by means of which they can continue to breathe water for some time when out of the water the orifices for the egress of the water which has served for respiration are situated in these as in most crabs in the anterior angles of the buccal frame cadre buccal medw whilst the entrant fissures of the branchial cavity extend from its hinder angles above the first pair of feet now that portion of the carapace which extends at the sides of the mouth between the two orifices rgions ptrygostomiennes appears in our animals to be divided into small square compartments milneedwards has already pointed this out as a particularly remarkable peculiarity this appearance is caused partly by small wartlike elevations and partly and especially by curious geniculated hairs which to a certain extent constitute a fine net or hairsieve extended immediately over the surface of the carapace thus when a wave of water escapes from the branchial cavity it immediately becomes diffused in this network of hairs and then again conveyed back to the branchial cavity by vigorous movements of the appendage of the outer maxilliped which works in the entrant fissure whilst the water glides in this way over the carapace in the form of a thin film it will again saturate itself with oxygen and may then serve afresh for the purposes of respiration in order to complete this arrangement the outer maxillipeds as indeed has long been known bear a projecting ridge furnished with a dense fringe of hairs which commences in front near their median line and passes backwards and outwards to the hinder angle of the buccal frame thus the two ridges of the right and left sides form together a triangle with the apex turned forwardsa breakwater by which the water flowing from the branchial cavity is kept away from the mouth and reconducted to the branchial cavity in very moist air the store of water contained in the branchial cavity may hold out for hours and it is only when this is used up that the animal elevates its carapace in order to allow the air to have access to its branchi from behind in eriphia gonagra the entrant orifices of the respiratory cavity serving for aerial respiration are situated not as in the grapsoid above but behind the last pair of feet at the sides of the abdomen fig 12 posterior entrance to the branchial cavity of ocypoda rhombea fab the carapace and the fourth foot of the right side are removed fig 13 points of some of the hairs of the basal joints of the foot magnified fig 12 posterior entrance to the branchial cavity of ocypoda rhombea fab the carapace and the fourth foot of the right side are removed fig 13 points of some of the hairs of the basal joints of the foot magnified the swiftfooted sandcrabs ocypoda are exclusively terrestrial animals and can scarcely live for a single day in water in a much shorter period a state of complete relaxation occurs and all voluntary movements cease1 in these a peculiar arrangement on the feet of the third and fourth pairs fig 12 has long been known although its connexion with the branchial cavity has not been suspected these two pairs of feet are more closely approximated than the rest the opposed surfaces of their basal joints therefore the hinder surface on the third and the anterior surface on the fourth feet are smooth and polished and their margins bear a dense border of long silky and peculiarly formed hairs fig 13 milneedwards who rightly compares these surfaces as to their appearance with articular surfaces thinks that they serve to diminish the friction between the two feet in considering this interpretation the question could not but arise why such an arrangement for the diminution of friction should be necessary in these particular crabs and between these two feet leaving out of consideration the fact that the remarkable brushes of hair which on the other hand must increase friction also remain unexplained but as i was bending the feet of a large sandcrab to and fro in various directions in order to see in what movements of the animal friction occurred at the place indicated and whether these might perhaps be movements of particular importance to it and such as would frequently recur i noticed when i had stretched the feet widely apart in the hollow between them a round orifice of considerable size through which air could easily be blown into the branchial cavity and a fine rod might even be introduced into it the orifice opens into the branchial cavity behind a conical lobe which stands above the third foot in place of a branchia which is wanting in ocypoda it is bounded laterally by ridges which rise above the articulation of the foot and to which the lower margin of the carapace is applied exteriorly also it is overarched by these ridges with the exception of a narrow fissure this fissure is overlaid by the carapace which exactly at this part projects further downwards than elsewhere and in this way a complete tube is formed whilst in grapsus the water is allowed to reach the branchi only from the front i saw it in ocypoda flow in also through the orifice just described in the position of posterior entrant orifice and the accompanying peculiarities of the third and fourth pairs of feet two other nonaquatic species of the same family which i have had the opportunity of examining agree with ocypoda one of these perhaps gelasimus vocans which lives in the mangrove swamps and likes to furnish the mouth of its burrow with a thick cylindrical chimney of several inches in height has the brushes on the basal joints of the feet in question composed of ordinary hairs the other a smaller gelasimus not described in milneedwards natural history of crustacea which prefers drier places and is not afraid to run about on the burning sand under the vertical rays of the noonday sun in december but can also endure being in water at least for several weeks resembles ocypoda in having these brushes composed of nonsetiform delicate hairs indeed even more delicate and more regularly constructed than in ocypoda2 what may be the significance of these peculiar hairswhether they only keep foreign bodies from the branchial cavitywhether they furnish moisture to the air flowing past themor whether as their aspect especially in the small gelasimus reminds one of the olfactory filaments of the crabs they may also perform similar functionsare questions the due discussion of which would lead us too far from our subject nevertheless it may be remarked that in both species especially in ocypoda the olfactory filaments in their ordinary situation are very much reduced and when they are in the water their flagella never perform the peculiar beating movements which may be observed in other crabs and even in the larger gelasimus moreover the organ of smell must probably be sought in these airbreathing crabs as in the airbreathing vertebrata at the entrance to the respiratory cavity so much for the facts with regard to the aerial respiration of the crabs it has already been indicated why darwins theory requires that when any peculiar arrangements exist for aerial respiration these will be differently constructed in different families that experience is in perfect accordance with this requirement is the more in favour of darwin because the schoolmen far from being able to foresee or explain such profound differences must rather regard them as extremely surprising if in the nearly allied families of the ocypodid and grapsoid the closest agreement prevails in all the essential conditions of their structure if the same plan of structure is slavishly followed in everything else in the organs of sense in the articulation of the limbs in every trabecula and tuft of hairs in the complicated framework of the stomach and in all the arrangements subserving aquatic respiration even to the hairs of the flagella employed in cleaning the branchiwhy have we suddenly this exception this complete difference in connection with aerial respiration the schoolmen will scarcely have an answer for this question except by placing themselves on the theologicoteleological standpoint which has justly fallen into disfavour amongst us and from which the mode of production of an arrangement is supposed to be explained if its adaptation to the animal can be demonstrated from this point of view we might certainly say that a widely gaping fissure which had nothing prejudicial in it to aratus pisonii among the foliage of the mangrove bushes was not suitable to the ocypoda living in sand that in the latter in order to prevent the penetration of the sand the orifice of the branchial cavity must be placed at its lowest part directed downwards and concealed between broad surfaces fringed with protective brushes of hair it is far from the intention of these pages to enter upon a general refutation of this theory of adaptation indeed there is scarcely anything essential to be added to the many admirable remarks that have been made upon this subject since the time of spinoza but this may be remarked that i regard it as one of the most important services of the darwinian theory that it has deprived those considerations of usefulness which are still undeniable in the domain of life of their mystical supremacy in the case before us it is sufficient to refer to the gelasimus of the mangrove swamps which shares the same conditions of life with various grapsoid and yet does not agree with them but with the arenicolous ocypoda 1 as this was not observed in the sea but in glass vessels containing seawater it might be supposed that the animals become exhausted and die not because they are under water but because they have consumed all the oxygen which it contained i therefore put into the same water from which i had just taken an unconscious ocypoda with its legs hanging loosely down a specimen of lupea diacantha which had been reduced to the same state by being kept in the air and this recovered in the water just as the ocypoda did in the air 2 this smaller gelasimus is also remarkable because the chameleonlike change of colour exhibited by many crabs occurs very strikingly in it the carapace of a male which i have now before me shone with a dazzling white in its hinder parts five minutes since when i captured it at present it shows a dull gray tint at the same place chapter vi structure of the heart in the edriophthalma scarcely less striking than the example of the airbreathing crabs is the behaviour of the heart in the great section edriophthalma which may advantageously be divided after the example of dana and spence bate only into two orders the amphipoda and the isopoda in the amphipoda to which the abovementioned naturalists correctly refer the caprellid and cyamid latreilles lmodipoda the heart has always the same position it extends in the form of a long tube through the six segments following the head and has three pairs of fissures furnished with valves for the entrance of the blood situated in the second third and fourth of these segments it was found to be of this structure by la valette in niphargus gammarus puteanus and by claus in phronima and i have found it to be the same in a considerable number of species belonging to the most different families1 the sole unimportant exception which i have hitherto met with is presented by the genus brachyscelus2 in which the heart possesses only two pairs of fissures as it extends forward only into the second bodysegment and is destitute of the pair of fissures situated in this segment in other forms3 considering this uniformity presented by the heart in the entire order of the amphipoda it cannot but seem very remarkable that in the very next order of the isopoda we find it to be one of the most changeable organs in the cheliferous isopods tanais the heart resembles that of the amphipoda in its elongated tubular form as well as in the number and position of the fissures but with this difference that the two fissures of each pair do not lie directly opposite each other fig 14 heart of a young cassidina fig 15 heart of a young anilocra fig 16 abdomen of the male of entoniscus cancrorum h heart l liver fig 14 heart of a young cassidina fig 15 heart of a young anilocra fig 16 abdomen of the male of entoniscus cancrorum h heart l liver in all other isopoda the heart is removed towards the abdomen in the wonderfully deformed parasitic isopods of the porcellan entoniscus porcellan the spherical heart of the female is confined to a short space of the elongated first abdominal segment and seems to possess only a single pair of fissures in the male of entoniscus cancrorum n sp the heart fig 16 is situated in the third abdominal segment in the cassidin the heart fig 14 is likewise short and furnished with two pairs of fissures situated in the last segment of the thorax and the first segment of the abdomen lastly in a young anilocra i find the heart fig 15 extending through the whole length of the abdomen and furnished with four or five fissures which are not placed in pairs but alternately to the right and left in successive segments in other animals of this order which i have as yet only cursorily examined further differences will no doubt occur but why in two orders so nearly allied to each other should we find in the one such a constancy in the other such a variability of the same highly important organ from the schoolmen we need expect no explanation they will either decline the discussion of the wherefore as foreign to their province as lying beyond the boundaries of natural history or seek to put down the importunate question by means of a sounding paraphrase of the facts abundantly sprinkled with greek words as i have unfortunately forgotten my greek the second way out of the difficulty is closed to me but as i luckily reckon myself not amongst the incorporated masters but to use baron von liebigs expression amongst the promenaders on the outskirts of natural history this affected hesitation of the schoolmen cannot dissuade me from seeking an answer which indeed presents itself most naturally from darwins point of view as not only the tanaides which reasons elsewhere stated vide supr justify us in regarding as particularly nearly related to the primitive isopod and the amphipoda but also the decapod crustacea possess a heart with three pairs of fissures essentially in the same position and as the same position of the heart recurs vide infr even in the embryos of the mantisshrimps squilla in which the heart of the adult animal and even as i have elsewhere shown that of the larv when still far from maturity extends in the form of a long tube with numerous openings far into the abdomen we must unhesitatingly regard the heart of the amphipoda as the primitive form of that organ in the edriophthalma as moreover in these animals the blood flows from the respiratory organs to the heart without vessels it is very easy to see how advantageous it must be to them to have these organs as much approximated as possible we have reason to regard as the primitive mode of respiration that occurring in tanais vide supr now where as in the majority of the isopoda branchi were developed upon the abdomen the position and structure of the heart underwent a change as it approached them more nearly but without the reproduction of a common plan for these earlier modes of structure either because this transformation of the heart took place only after the division of the primary form into subordinate groups or because at least at the time of this division the varying heart had not yet become fixed in any new form where on the contrary respiration remained with the anterior part of the bodywhether in the primitive fashion of zoa as in the tanaides or by the development of branchi on the thorax as in the amphipodathe primitive form of the heart was inherited unchanged because any variations which might make their appearance were rather injurious than advantageous and disappeared again immediately i close this series of isolated examples with an observation which indeed only half belongs to the province of the crustacea to which these pages ought to be confined and which also has no further connexion with the preceding circumstances than that of being an intelligible and intelligencebringing fact only from the point of view of darwins theory today as i was opening a specimen of lepas anatifera in order to compare the animal with the description in darwins monograph on the subclass cirripedia i found in the shell of this cirripede a bloodred annelide with a short flat body about half an inch long and two lines in breadth with twentyfive bodysegments and without projecting setigerous tubercles or jointed cirri the small cephalic lobe bore four eyes and five tentacles each bodysegment had on each side at the margin a tuft of simple set directed obliquely upwards and at some distance from this upon the ventral surface a group of thicker set with a strongly uncinate bidentate apex there was above each of the lateral tufts of bristles a branchia simple on a few of the foremost segments and then strongly arborescent to the end of the body the animal a female filled with ova evidently from these characters belongs to the family of the amphinomid the only family the members of which being excellent swimmers live in the open sea that this animal had not strayed accidentally into the lepas but appertained to it as a regular and permanent guest is evidenced by its considerable size in proportion to the narrow entrance of the test of the lepas by the complete absence of the iridescence which usually distinguishes the skin of free annelides and especially of the amphinomid by the formation and position of the inferior set etc but that a worm belonging to this particular family amphinomid living in the high sea occurs as a guest in the lepas which also floats in the sea attached to wood etc is at once intelligible from the standpoint of the darwinian theory whilst the relationship of this parasite to the freeliving worms of the open sea remains perfectly unintelligible under the supposition that it was independently created for dwelling in the lepas but however favourable the examples hitherto referred to may be for darwin the objection may be raised against them and that with perfect justice that they are only isolated facts which when the considerations founded upon them are carried far beyond what is immediately given may only too easily lead us from the right path with the deceptive glimmer of an ignis fatuus the higher the structure to be raised the wider must be the assuring base of wellsifted facts let us turn then to a wider field that of the developmental history of the crustacea upon which science has already brought together a varied abundance of remarkable facts which however have remained a barren accumulation of unmanageable rawmaterial and let us see how under darwins hand these scattered stones unite to form a welljointed structure in which everything bearing and being borne finds its significant place under darwins hand for i shall have nothing to do except just to place the building stones in the position which his theory indicates for them when kings build the carters have to work 1 the young animals in the egg a little before their exclusion are usually particularly convenient for the observation of the fissures in the heart they are generally sufficiently transparent the movements of the heart are less violent than at a later period and they lie still even without the pressure of a glass cover considering the common opinion as to the distribution of the amphipoda namely that they increase in multiplicity towards the poles and diminish towards the equator it may seem strange that i speak of a considerable number of species on a subtropical coast i therefore remark that in a few months and without examining any depths inaccessible from the shore i obtained 38 different species of which 34 are new which with the previously known species principally described by dana gives 60 brazilian amphipoda whilst kryer in his grnlands amfipoder was acquainted with only 28 species including 2 lmodipoda from the arctic seas although these had been investigated by a far greater number of naturalists 2 according to milneedwards arrangement the females of this genus would belong to the hyprines ordinaires and the previously unknown males to the hyprines anormales the distinguishing character of which namely the curiously zigzagged inferior antenn is only a sexual peculiarity of the male animals in systematising from single dead specimens as to the sex age etc of which nothing is known similar errors are unavoidable thus in order to give another example of very recent date a celebrated ichthyologist bleeker has lately distinguished two groups of the cyprinodontes as follows some the cyprinodontini have a pinna analis non elongata and the others the aplocheilini a pinna analis elongata according to this the female of a little fish which is very abundant here would belong to the first and the male to the second group such mistakes as already stated are unavoidable by the dryskin philosopher and therefore excusable but they nevertheless prove in how random a fashion the present systematic zoology frequently goes on without principles or sure foundations and how much it is in want of the infallible touchstone for the value of the different characters which darwins theory promises to furnish 3 i find in milneedwards leons sur la physiol et lanat comp 3 page 197 the statement that according to frey and leuckart the heart of caprella linearis possesses five pairs of fissures i have examined perfectly transparent young caprell probably the young of caprella attenuata dana with which they occurred but can only find the usual three pairs chapter vii structure of the heart in the edriophthalma let us first glance over the extant facts among the stalkeyed crustacea podophthalma we know only a very few species which quit the egg in the form of their parents with the full number of welljointed appendages to the body this is the case according to rathke1 in the european freshwater crayfish and according to westwood in a west indian land crab gecarcinus both exceptions therefore belong to the small number of stalkeyed crustacea which live in fresh water or on the land as indeed in many other cases freshwater and terrestrial animals undergo no transformations whilst their allies in the sea have a metamorphosis to undergo i may refer to the earthworms and leeches among the annelida which chiefly belong to the land and to fresh waterto the planari of the fresh waters and the tetrastemma of the sparingly saline baltic among the turbellariato the pulmonate gasteropoda and to the branchiferous gasteropoda of the fresh waters the young of which according to troschels handb der zoologie have no ciliated buccal lobes although such organs are possessed by the very similar periwinkles littorina all the marine forms of this section appear to be subject to a more or less considerable metamorphosis this appears to be only inconsiderable in the common lobster the young of which according to van beneden are distinguished from the adult animal by having their feet furnished like those of mysis with a swimming branch projecting freely outwards from a figure given by couch the appendages of the abdomen and tail also appear to be wanting far more profound is the difference of the youngest brood from the sexually mature animal in by far the greater majority of the podophthalma which quit the egg in the form of zoa this young form occurs so far as our present observations go in all the crabs with the sole exception of the single species investigated by westwood i say species and not genus for in the same genus gecarcinus vaughan thompson found zoabrood2 which is also met with in other terrestrial crabs ocypoda gelasimus etc all the anomura seem likewise to commence their lives as zo witness the porcellan the tatuira hippa emerita and the hermit crabs among the macrura we are acquainted with the same earliest form principally in several shrimps and prawns such as crangon du cane caridina joly hippolyte palmon alpheus etc lastly it is not improbable that the youngest brood of the mantisshrimps squilla is also in the same case the most important peculiarities which distinguish this zoabrood from the adult animal are as follows the middlebody with its appendages those five pairs of feet to which these animals owe their name of decapoda is either entirely wanting or scarcely indicated the abdomen and tail are destitute of appendages and the latter consists of a single piece the mandibles as in the insecta have no palpi the maxillipedes of which the third pair is often still wanting are not yet brought into the service of the mouth but appear in the form of biramose natatory feet branchi are wanting or where their first rudiments may be detected as small verruciform prominences these are dense cellmasses through which the blood does not yet flow and which therefore have nothing to do with respiration an interchange of the gases of the water and blood may occur all over the thinskinned surface of the body but the lateral parts of the carapace may unhesitatingly be indicated as the chief seat of respiration they consist exactly as described by leydig in the daphni of an outer and inner lamina the space between which is traversed by numerous transverse partitions dilated at their ends the spaces between these partitions are penetrated by a more abundant flow of blood than occurs anywhere else in the body of the zoa to this may be added that a constant current of fresh water passes beneath the carapace in a direction from behind forwards maintained as in the adult animal by a foliaceous or linguiform appendage of the second pair of maxill fig 18 the addition of fine coloured particles to the water allows this current of water to be easily detected even in small zo fig 17 zoa of a marsh crab cyclograpsus magnified fig 18 maxilla of the second pair in the same species magnified fig 17 zoa of a marsh crab cyclograpsus magnified fig 18 maxilla of the second pair in the same species magnified the zo of the crabs fig 17 are usually distinguished by long spiniform processes of the carapace one of these projects upwards from the middle of the back a second downwards from the forehead and frequently there is a shorter one on each side near the posterior inferior angles of the carapace all these processes are however wanting in maia according to couch and in eurynome according to kinahan and in a third species of the same group of the oxyrhynchi belonging or nearly allied to the genus achus i also find only an inconsiderable dorsal spine whilst the forehead and sides are unarmed this is another example warning us to be cautious in deductions from analogy nothing seemed more probable than to refer back the beaklike formation of the forehead in the oxyrhynchi to the frontal process of the zoa and now it appears that the young of the oxyrhynchi are really quite destitute of any such process the following are more important peculiarities of the zo of the crabs although less striking than these processes of the carapace which in combination with the large eyes often give them so singular an appearancethe anterior inner antenn are simple not jointed and furnished at the extremity with from two to three olfactory filaments the posterior outer antenn frequently run out into a remarkably long spinelike process styliform process spence bate and bear on the outside an appendage which is sometimes very minute squamiform process of spence bate corresponding with the antennal scale of the prawns3 and the first rudiment of the future flagellum is often already recognisable of natatory feet afterwards maxillipeds only two pairs are present the third not as spence bate thinks the first is entirely wanting or like the five following pairs of feet present only as a minute bud the tail of very variable form always bears three pairs of set at its hinder margin the zo of the crabs usually maintain themselves in the water in such a manner that the dorsal spine stands upwards the abdomen is bent forwards the inner branch of the natatory feet is directed forwards and the outer one outwards and upwards figs 19 to 23 tails of the zo of various crabs fig 19 pinnotheres fig 20 sesarma fig 21 xantho fig 22 and 23 of unknown origin figs 19 to 23 tails of the zo of various crabs fig 19 pinnotheres fig 20 sesarma fig 21 xantho figs 22 and 23 of unknown origin it is further to be remarked that the zo of the crabs as also of the porcellan of the tatuira and of the shrimps and prawns are enveloped on escaping from the egg by a membrane veiling the spinous processes of the carapace the set of the feet and the antenn and that they cast this in a few hours in achus i have observed that the tail of this earliest larval skin resembles that of the larv of shrimps and prawns and the same appears to be the case in maia see bell brit stalkeyed crust p 44 widely as they seem to differ from them at the first glance the zo of the porcellan fig 24 approach those of the true crabs very closely the antenn organs of the mouth and natatory feet exhibit the same structure but the tail bears five pairs of set and the dorsal spine is wanting whilst on the contrary the frontal process and the lateral spines are of extraordinary length and directed straight forward and backward fig 24 zoa of porcellana stellicola f mll magnified fig 25 zoa of the tatuira hippa emerita magnified fig 26 zoa of a small hermit crab magnified fig 24 zoa of porcellana stellicola f mll magnified fig 25 zoa of the tatuira hippa emerita magnified fig 26 zoa of a small hermit crab magnified the zoa of the tatuira fig 25 also appears to differ but little from those of the true crabs which it likewise resembles in its mode of locomotion the carapace possesses only a short broad frontal process the posterior margin of the tail is edged with numerous short set the zoa of the hermit crabs fig 26 possesses the simple inner antenn of the zoa of the true crabs the outer antenn bear upon the outside on a short stalk a lamella of considerable size analogous to the scale of the antenn of the prawns on the inside a short spinelike process and between the two the flagellum still short but already furnished with two apical set as in the crabs there are only two pairs of welldeveloped natatory feet maxillipedes but the third pair is also present in the form of a twojointed stump of considerable size although still destitute of set the tail bears five pairs of set the little animal usually holds itself extended straight in the water with the head directed downwards this is also the position in which we usually see the zo of the shrimps and prawns fig 27 which agree in their general appearance with those of the hermit crabs between the large compound eyes there is in them a small median eye the inner antenn bear at the end of a basal joint sometimes of considerable length on the inside a plumose seta which also occurs in the hermit crabs and on the outside a short terminal joint with one or more olfactory filaments the outer antenn exhibit a welldeveloped and sometimes distinctly articulated scale and within this usually a spiniform process the flagellum appears generally to be still wanting the third pair of maxillipedes seems to be always present at least in the form of considerable rudiments the spatuliform caudal lamina bears from five to six pairs of set on its hinder margin fig 27 zoa of a palmon residing upon rhizostoma cruciatum less magnified fig 27 zoa of a palmon residing upon rhizostoma cruciatum less magnified the development of the zoabrood to the sexually mature animal was traced by spence bate in carcinus mnas he proved that the metamorphosis is a perfectly gradual one and that no sharply separated stages of development like the caterpillar and pupa of the lepidoptera could be defined in it unfortunately we possess only this single complete series of observations and its results cannot be regarded at once as universally applicable thus the young hermit crabs retain the general aspect and mode of locomotion of zo whilst the rudiments of the thoracic and abdominal feet are growing and then when these come into action appear at once in a perfectly new form which differs from that of the adult animal chiefly by the complete symmetry of the body and by the presence of four pairs of welldeveloped natatory feet on the abdomen4 the development of the palinuridi seems to be very peculiar claus found in the ova of the spiny lobster palinurus embryos with a completely segmented body but wanting the appendages of the tail abdomen and last two segments of the middlebody they possess a single median and considerably compound eye the anterior antenn are simple the posterior furnished with a small secondary branch the mandibles have no palpi the maxillipedes of the third pair like the two following pairs of feet are divided into two branches of nearly equal length whilst the last of the existing pairs of feet and the second pair of maxillipedes bear only an inconsiderable secondary branch coste as is well known asserts that he has bred young phyllosomata from the ova of this lobstera statement that requires further proof especially as the more recent investigations of claus upon phyllosoma by no means appear to be in its favour the large compound eyes which usually soon become moveable and sometimes stand upon long stalks even in the earliest period as well as the carapace which covers the entire forebody indicate at once that the position of the larv hitherto considered notwithstanding all their differences is under the podophthalma but not a single characteristic of this section is retained by the brood of some prawns belonging to the genus penus or in its vicinity these quit the egg with an unsegmented ovate body a median frontal eye and three pairs of natatory feet of which the anterior are simple and the other two biramosein fact in the larval form so common among the lower crustacea to which o f mller gave the name of nauplius no trace of a carapace no trace of the paired eyes no trace of masticating organs near the mouth which is overarched by a helmetlike hood in the case of one of these species the intermediate forms which lead from the nauplius to the prawn have been discovered in a nearly continuous series the youngest nauplius fig 28 is immediately followed by forms in which a fold of skin runs across the back behind the third pair of feet and four pairs of stout processes rudiments of new limbs sprout forth on the ventral surface within the third pair of feet powerful mandibles are developed fig 28 nauplius of a prawn magnified fig 29

maxillipedes come into action and in this way the nauplius becomes a zoa fig 29 agreeing perfectly with the zoa of the crabs in the number of the appendages of the body although very different in form and mode of locomotion and even in many particulars of internal structure the chief organs of motion are still the two anterior pairs of feet which are slender and furnished with long set the third pair of feet loses its branches and becomes converted into mandibles destitute of palpi the labrum acquires a spine directed forward and of considerable size which occurs in all the zo of allied species the biramose maxillipedes appear to assist but slightly in locomotion the forked tail reminds us rather of the forms occurring in the lower crustacea especially the copepoda than of the spatuliform caudal plate which characterises the zo of alpheus palmon hippolyte and other prawns of the hermit crabs the tatuira and the porcellan the heart possesses only one pair of fissures and has no muscles traversing its interior like trabecul whilst in other zo two pairs of fissures and an interior apparatus of trabecul are always distinctly recognisable fig 30 older zoa of the same prawn

the middlebody and abdomen the posterior maxillipedes the lateral caudal appendages and the stumplike rudiments of the feet of the middlebody are formed fig 30 the caudal appendages sprout forth like other limbs freely on the ventral surface whilst in other prawns the porcellan etc they are produced in the interior of the spatuliform caudal plate as the feet of the middlebody come into action simultaneously with other profound changes the zoa passes into the mysis or schizopodform fig 31 the antenn cease to serve for locomotion their place is taken by the thoracic feet furnished with long set and by the long abdomen which just before was laboriously dragged along as a useless burden but now with its powerful muscles jerks the animal through the water in a series of lively jumps the anterior antenn have lost their long set and by the side of the last fourth joint endowed with olfactory filaments there appears a second branch which is at first of a single joint the previously multiarticulate outer branch of the posterior antenn has become a simple lamella the antennal scale of the prawn beside this appears the stumplike rudiment of the flagellum probably as a new formation the inner branch disappearing entirely the five new pairs of feet are biramose the inner branch short and simple the outer one longer annulated at the end furnished with long set and kept as in mysis in constant whirling motion the heart acquires new fissures and interior muscular trabecul during the mysisperiod the auditory organs in the basal joint of the anterior antenn are formed the inner branches of the first three pairs of feet are developed into chel and the two hinder pairs into ambulatory feet palpi sprout from the mandibles branchi on the thorax and natatory feet on the abdomen the spine on the labrum becomes reduced in size in this way the animal gradually approaches the prawnform in which the median eye has become indistinct the spine of the labrum and the outer branches of the cheliferous and ambulatory feet have been lost the mandibular palpi and the abdominal feet have acquired distinct joints and set and the branchi come into action in another prawn the various larval states of which may be easily recognised as belonging to the same series by the presence of a darkyellow sharplydefined spot surrounding the median eye the youngest zoa fig 32 probably produced from the nauplius agrees in all essential particulars with the species just described its further development is however very different especially in that neither the feet of the middle nor those of the hindbody are formed simultaneously and that a stage of development comparable to mysis in the number and structure of the limbs does not occur fig 32 youngest observed zoa of another prawn the minute buds of the third pair of maxillipedes are visible the formation of the abdominal segments has commenced paired eyes still wanting magnified fig 33 older larva produced from the zoa represented

of feet of the middlebody are wanting magnified traces of the outer maxillipedes make their appearance betimes then feet appear upon four segments of the middlebody and these are biramose on the three anterior segments and simple the inner branch being deficient on the fourth segment on the inner branches the chel are developed the outer branches are lost before an inner branch has made its appearance on the fourth segment fig 32 the latter again becomes destitute of appendages so that in this case at an early period four and at a later only three segments of the middlebody bear limbs the fifth segment is still entirely wanting whilst all the abdominal segments have also acquired limbs and this one after the other from before backwards the adult animal as shown by the three pairs of chel will certainly be very nearly allied to the preceding species5 the youngest larva of the schizopod genus euphausia observed by claus stands very near the youngest zoa of our prawns but whilst its anterior antenn are already biramose and it therefore appears to be more advanced it still wants the middle maxillipedes in it also claus found the heart furnished with only a single pair of fissures do not naupliuslike states in this case also precede the zoa the developmental history of mysis the near relationship of which with the shrimps and prawns has recently again been generally recognised has been described in detail by van beneden so far as i have tested them i can only confirm his statements the development of the embryo commences with the formation of the tail this makes its appearance as a simple lobe the dorsal surface of which is turned towards and closely applied to that of the embryo the young of other stalkeyed crustacea are as is well known bent in the egg in such a manner that the ventral surfaces of the anterior and posterior halves of the body are turned towards each otherin these therefore the dorsal and in mysis the ventral surface appears convex the tail soon acquires the furcate form with which we made acquaintance in the last prawnzoa described then two pairs of thick ensiform appendages make their appearance at the opposite end of the body and behind these a pair of tubercles which are easily overlooked these are the antenn and mandibles the eggmembrane now bursts before any internal organ or even any tissue except the cells of the cutaneous layer is formed the young animal might be called a nauplius but essentially there is nothing but a rough copy of a naupliusskin almost like a new eggmembrane within which the mysis is developed the ten pairs of appendages of the fore maxill maxillipedes and middlebody make their appearance simultaneously as do the five pairs of abdominal feet at a later period soon after the young mysis casts the naupliusenvelope it quits the broodpouch of the mother6 for some time owing to an undue importance being ascribed to the want of a particular branchial cavity mysis leucifer and phyllosoma were referred to the stomapoda which are now again limited as originally by latreille to the mantisshrimps squilla the glassshrimps erichthus and their nearest allies of the developmental history of these we have hitherto been acquainted with only isolated fragments the tracing of the development in the egg is rendered difficult by the circumstance that the mantisshrimps do not like the decapoda carry their spawn about with them but deposit it in the subterranean passages inhabited by them in the form of thin round yellow plates the spawn is consequently exceedingly difficult to procure and unfortunately it becomes spoilt in a day when it is removed from its natural hatching place whilst on the contrary the progress of development may be followed for weeks together in the eggs of a single crab kept in confinement the eggs of squilla like those removed from the body of the crab die because they are deprived of the rapid stream of fresh water which the mother drives through her hole for the purpose of her own respiration the accompanying representation of the embryo of squilla shows that it possesses a long segmented abdomen without appendages a bilobate tail six pairs of limbs and a short heart the latter only pulsates weakly and slowly if it acquires more limbs before exclusion the youngest larva must stand on the same level as the youngest larva of euphausia observed by claus fig 34 embryo of a squilla magnified a heart fig 35 older larva zoa of a stomapod magnified fig 34 embryo of a squilla magnified a heart fig 35 older larva zoa of a stomapod magnified of the two larval forms at present known which are with certainty to be ascribed if not to squilla at least to a stomapod i pass over the younger one7 as its limbs cannot be positively interpreted and will only mention that in it the last three abdominal segments are still destitute of appendages the older larva fig 35 which resembles the mature squilla especially in the structure of the great raptorial feet and of the preceding pair still wants the six pairs of feet following the raptorial feet the corresponding bodysegments are already well developed an unpaired eye is still present the anterior antenn are already biramose whilst the flagellum is wanting in the posterior and the mandibles are destitute of palpi the four anterior abdominal segments bear biramose natatory feet without branchi the fifth abdominal segment has no appendages and this is also the case with the tail which still appears as a simple lamina fringed on the hinder margin with numerous short teeth it is evident that the larva stands essentially in the grade of zoa 1 authorities are cited only for facts which i have had no opportunity of confirming 2 bell brit stalkeyed crust p xlv considers himself justified in eliminating thompsons observation at once because he could only have examined ovigerous females preserved in alcohol but any one who had paid so much attention as thompson to the development of these animals must have been well able to decide with certainty upon eggs if not too far from maturity or badly preserved whether a zoa would be produced from them moreover the mode of life of the landcrabs is in favour of thompson once in the year says troschels handbuch der zoologie they migrate in great crowds to the sea in order to deposit their eggs and afterwards return much exhausted towards their dwelling places which are reached only by a few for what purpose would be these destructive migrations in species whose young quit the egg and the mother

parat avoir une autre valeur morphologique 7 archiv fr naturgeschichte 1863 taf 1 chapter viii developmental history of edriophthalma less varied than that of the stalkeyed crustacea is the mode of development of the isopoda and amphipoda which leach united in the section edriophthalma or crustacea with sessile eyes the rockslaters ligia may serve as an example of the development of the isopoda in these as in mysis the caudal portion of the embryo is bent not downwards but upwards as in mysis also a larval membrane is first of all formed within which the slater is developed in mysis this first larval skin may be compared to a nauplius in ligia it appears like a maggot quite destitute of appendages but produced into a long simple tail fig 37 the eggmembrane is retained longer than in mysis it bursts only when the limbs of the young slater are already partially developed in their full number the dorsal surface of the slater is united to the larval skin a little behind the head at this point when the union has been dissolved a little before the change of skin there is a foliaceous appendage which exists only for a short time and disappears before the young slater quits the broodpouch of the mother fig 36 embryo of ligia in the egg magnified d yelk l liver fig 37 maggotlike larva of ligia magnified r remains of the eggmembrane we see on the lower surface from before

backwardsthe anterior and posterior antenn the mandibles the anterior and posterior maxill maxillipedes six ambulatory feet the last segment of the middlebody destitute of appendages five abdominal feet and the caudal feet the young animal when it begins to take care of itself resembles the old ones in almost all parts except one important difference it possesses only six instead of seven pairs of ambulatory feet and the last segment of the middlebody is but slightly developed and destitute of appendages it need hardly be mentioned that the sexual peculiarities are not yet developed and that in the males the handlike enlargements of the anterior ambulatory feet and the copulatory appendages are still deficient to the question how far the development of ligia is repeated in the other isopoda i can only give an unsatisfactory answer the curvature of the embryo upwards instead of downwards was met with by me as well as by rathke in idothea and likewise in cassidina philoscia tanais and the bopyridindeed i failed to find it in none of the isopoda examined for this purpose in cassidina also the first larval skin without appendages is easily detected it is destitute of the long tail but is strongly bent in the egg as in ligia and consequently cannot be mistaken for an inner eggmembrane this however might happen in philoscia in which the larval skin is closely applied to the eggmembrane fig 38 and is only to be explained as the larval skin by a reference to ligia and cassidina the foliaceous appendage on the back has long been known in the young of the common water slater asellus1 that the last pair of feet of the thorax is wanting in the young of the woodlice porcellionides medw and fishlice cymothoadiens medw has already been noticed by milneedwards this applies also to the boxslaters idothea to the viviparous globeslaters sphroma and shieldslaters cassidina to the bopyrid bopyrus entoniscus cryptoniscus ng and to the cheliferous slaters tanais and therefore probably to the great majority of the isopoda all the other limbs are usually well developed in the young isopoda in tanais alone all the abdominal feet are wanting but not those of the tail they are developed simultaneously with the last pair of feet of the thorax fig 38 embryo of a philoscia in the egg magnified fig 39 embryo of cryptoniscus planarioides magnified fig 40 last foot of the

the larva of entoniscus porcellan magnified the last pair of feet on the middlebody of the larva consequently the penultimate pair in the adult animal is almost always similar in structure to the preceding pair a remarkable exception is however presented in this respect by cryptoniscus and entoniscusremarkable as a confirmation of darwins proposition that parts developed in an unusual manner are very variable for in the peculiarlyformed pair of feet there exists the greatest possible difference between the three species hitherto observed in cryptoniscus fig 39 this last foot is thin and rodlike in entoniscus cancrorum remarkably long and furnished with a strongly thickened hand and a peculiarly constructed chela in entoniscus porcellan very short imperfectly jointed and with a large ovate terminal joint fig 40 some isopods undergo a considerable change immediately before the attainment of sexual maturity this is the case with the males of tanais which have already been noticed and according to hesse with the praniz in which both sexes are said to pass into the form known as anceus but spence bate a careful observer states that he has seen females of the form of praniza laden with eggs far advanced in their development fig 41 entoniscus cancrorum female magnified fig 42 cryptoniscus planarioides female magnified fig 43 embryo of a corophium magnified fig 41 entoniscus cancrorum female magnified fig 42 cryptoniscus planarioides female magnified fig 43 embryo of a corophium magnified in this order we meet for the first time with an extensive retrograde metamorphosis as a consequence of a parasitic mode of life even in some fishlice cymothoa the young are lively swimmers and the adults stiff stupid heavy fellows whose short clinging feet are capable of but little movement in the bopyrid bopyrus phryxus kepone etc which might have been conveniently left in a single genus which are parasitic on crabs lobsters etc taking up their abode chiefly in the branchial cavity the adult females are usually quite destitute of eyes the antenn are rudimentary the broad body is frequently unsymmetrically developed in consequence of the confined space its segments are more or less amalgamated with each other the feet are stunted and the appendages of the abdomen transformed from natatory feet with long set into foliaceous or tongueshaped and sometimes ramified branchi in the dwarfish males the eyes antenn and feet are usually better preserved than in the females but on the other hand all the appendages of the abdomen have not unfrequently disappeared and sometimes every trace of segmentation in the females of entoniscus which are found in the bodycavity of crabs and porcellan the eyes antenn and buccal organs the segmentation of the vermiform body and in one species fig 41 the whole of the limbs disappear almost without leaving a trace and cryptoniscus planarioides would almost be regarded as a flatworm rather than an isopod if its eggs and young did not betray its crustacean nature among the males of these various bopyrid that of entoniscus porcellan occupies the lowest place it is confined all its life to six pairs of feet which are reduced to shapeless rounded lumps the amphipoda are distinguishable from the isopoda at an early period in the egg by the different position of the embryo the hinder extremity of which is bent downwards in all the animals of this order which have been examined for it2 a peculiar structure makes its appearance very early on the anterior part of the back by which the embryo is attached to the inner eggmembrane and which has been called the micropylar apparatus but improperly as it seems to me3 it will remind us of the union of the young isopoda with the larval membrane and of the unpaired adherent organ on the nape of the cladocera which is remarkably developed in evadne and persists throughout life but in daphnia pulex according to leydig although present in the young animals disappears without leaving a trace in the adults the young animal whilst still in the egg acquires the full number of its segments and limbs in cases where segments are amalgamated together such as the last two segments of the thorax in dulichia the last abdominal segments and the tail in gammarus ambulans and corophium dentatum n sp and the last abdominal segments and the tail in brachyscelus4 or where one or more segments are deficient as in dulichia and the caprell we find the same fusion and the same deficiencies in young animals taken out of the broodpouch of their mother even peculiarities in the structure of the limbs so far as they are common to both sexes are usually wellmarked in the newly hatched young so that the latter generally differ from their parents only by their stouter form the smaller number of the antennal joints and olfactory filaments and also of the set and teeth with which the body or feet are armed and perhaps by the comparatively larger size of the secondary flagellum an exception to this rule is presented by the hyperin which usually live upon acaleph in these the young and adults often have a remarkably different appearance but even in these there is no new formation of bodysegments and limbs but only a gradual transformation of these parts5 figs 44 to 46 feet of a halfgrown hyperia martinezii n sp named after my valued friend the amiable spanish zoologist m francisco de paula martinez y saes at present on a voyage round the world figs 47 to 49 feet of a nearly adult male of the same species 44 and 47 from the first pair of

anterior feet gnathopoda 44 and 48 from the first and 46 and 49 from the last pair of thoracic feet magnified thus in order to give a few examples the powerful chel of the antepenultimate pair of feet of phromina sedentaria are produced according to pagenstecher from simple feet of ordinary structure and vice vers the chel on the penultimate pair of feet of the young brachyscelus become converted into simple feet in the young of the lastmentioned genus the long head is drawn out into a conical point and bears remarkably small eyes in course of growth the latter as in most of the hyperin attain an enormous size and almost entirely occupy the head which then appears spherical etc the difference of the sexes which in the gammarin is usually expressed chiefly in the structure of the anterior feet gnathopoda sp bate and in the hyperin in the structure of the antenn is often so great that males and females have been described as distinct species and even repeatedly placed in different genera orchestia and talitrus cerapus and dercotho lestrigonus and hyperia or even families hyprines anormales and hyprines ordinaires nevertheless it is only developed when the animals are nearly fullgrown up to this period the young resemble the females in a general way even in some cases in which these differ more widely than the males from the type of the order thus in the male shorehoppers orchestia the second pair of the anterior feet is provided with a powerful hand as in the majority of the amphipoda but very differently constructed in the females the young nevertheless resemble the female thus alsoand this is an extremely rare case6the females of brachyscelus are destitute of the posterior or inferior antenn the male possesses them like other amphipod in the young i like spence bate can find no trace of them it is however to be particularly remarked that the development of the sexual peculiarities does not stand still on the attainment of sexual maturity for example the younger sexually mature males of orchestia tucurauna n sp have slender inferior antenn with the joints of the flagellum not fused together the clasping margin palm sp bate of the hand in the second pair of feet is uniformly convex the last pair of feet is slender and similar to the preceding subsequently the antenn become thickened two three or four of the first joints of the flagellum are fused together the palm of the hand acquires a deep emargination near its inferior angle and the intermediate joints of the last pair of feet become swelled into a considerable incrassation no museumzoologist would hesitate about fabricating two distinct species if the oldest and youngest sexually mature males were sent to him without the uniting intermediate forms in the younger males of orchestia tucuratinga although the microscopic examination of their testes showed that they were already sexually mature the emargination of the clasping margin of the hand represented in fig 50 and the corresponding process of the finger are still entirely wanting the same may be observed in cerapus and caprella and probably in all cases where hereditary sexual differences occur fig 50 foot of

sessileeyed crustacea but more nearly allied to the former than to the latter comes the remarkable family of the diastylid or cumacea the young which kryer took out of the broodpouch of the female and which attained onefourth of the length of their mother resembled the adult animals almost in all parts whether as in mysis and ligia a transformation occurs within the broodpouch which is constructed in the same way as in mysis is not known7 the caudal portion of the embryo in the diastylid as i have recently observed is curved upwards as in the isopoda and the last pair of feet of the thorax is wanting equally scanty is our knowledge of the developmental history of the ostracoda we know scarcely anything except that their anterior limbs are developed before the posterior one zenker the development of cypris has recently been observed by clausthe youngest stages are shellbearing naupliusforms 1 leydig has compared this foliaceous appendage of the water slaters with the green gland or shellgland of other crustacea assuming that the green gland has no efferent duct and appealing to the fact that the two organs occur in the same place this interpretation is by no means a happy one in the first place we may easily ascertain in leucifer as was also found to be the case by claus that the green gland really opens at the end of the process described by milneedwards as a tubercule auditif and by spence bate as an olfactory denticle and secondly the position is about as different as it can well be in the one case a paired gland opening at the base of the posterior antenn and therefore on the lower surface of the second segment in the other an unpaired structure rising in the median line of the back behind the seventh segment behind the boundary line of the first thoracic

cyrtophium corophium dulichia protella and caprellaote 3 little as a name may actually affect the facts we ought certainly to confine the name micropyle to canals of the eggmembrane which serve for the entrance of the semen but the outer eggmembrane passes over the micropylar apparatus of the amphipoda without any perforation according to meissners and la valettes own statements it appears never to be present before fecundation attains its greatest development at a subsequent period of the ovular life and the delicate canals which penetrate it do not even seem to be always present indeed it seems to belong to the embryo rather than to the eggmembrane i have never been able to convince myself that the socalled inner eggmembrane is really of this nature and not perhaps the earliest larva skin not formed until after impregnation as might be supposed with reference to ligia cassidina and philoscia 4 according to spence bate in brachyscelus crusculum the fifth abdominal segment is not amalgamated with the sixth the tail but with the fourth which i should be inclined to doubt considering the close agreement which this species otherwise shows with the two species that i have investigated 5 in the young of hyperia galba spence bate did not find any of the abdominal feet or the last two pairs of thoracic feet but this very remarkable statement required confirmation the more because he examined these minute animals only in the dried state subsequently i had the wishedfor opportunity of tracing the development of a hyperia which is not uncommon upon ctenophora especially bero gilva eschsch the youngest larva from the broodpouch of the mother already possess the whole of the thoracic feet on the other hand like spence bate i cannot find those of the abdomen at first simple enough all these feet soon become converted like the anterior feet into richly denticulated prehensile feet and indeed of three different forms the anterior feet fig 44 the two following pairs fig 45 and finally the three last pairs fig 46 being similarly constructed and different from the rest in this form the feet remain for a very long time whilst the abdominal appendages grow into powerful natatory organs and the eyes which at first seemed to me to be wanting into large hemispheres in the transition to the form of the adult animal the last three pairs of feet fig 49 especially undergo a considerable change the difference between the two sexes is considerable the females are distinguished by a very broad thorax and the males lestrigonus by very long antenn of which the anterior bear an unusual abundance of olfactory filaments their youngest larv of course cannot swim they are helpless little animals which firmly cling especially to the swimming lamin of their host the adult hyperi which are not unfrequently met with free in the sea are as is well known the most admirable swimmers in their order il nage avec une rapidit extrme says van beneden of h latreillii medw the transformation of the hyperi is evidently to be regarded as acquired and not inherited that is to say the late appearance of the abdominal appendages and the peculiar structure of the feet in the young are not to be brought into unison with the historical development of the amphipoda but to be placed to the account of the parasitic mode of life of the young as in brachyscelus free locomotion has been continued to the adult and not to the young contrary to the usual method among parasites still more remarkable is a similar circumstance in caligus among the parasitic copepoda the young animal described by burmeister as a peculiar genus chalimus lies at anchor upon a fish by means of a cable springing from its forehead and having its extremity firmly seated in the skin of the fish when sexual maturity is attained the cable is cut and the adult caligi which are admirable swimmers are not unfrequently captured swimming freely in the sea see archiv fr naturgeschichte 1852 i p

goodsir described the broodpouch and eggs of cuma as early as 1843 kryer whose painstaking care and conscientiousness is recognised with wonder by every one who has met him on a common field of work confirmed goodsirs statements in 1846 and as above mentioned took out of the broodpouch embryos advanced in development and resembling their parents by this the question whether the diastylid are

to nearly all crustacea how well warranted are we therefore in identifying the latter with the former however it is sufficient for any one to glance at the larva of palmon fig 27 and the cumacean fig 52 in order to be convinced of their extraordinary similarity chapter ix developmental history of entomostraca cirripedes and rhizocephala the section of the branchiopoda includes two groups differing even in their developmentthe phyllopoda and the cladocera the latter minute animals provided with six pairs of foliaceous feet which chiefly belong to the fresh waters and are diffused under similar forms over the whole world quit the egg with their full number of limbs the phyllopoda on the contrary in which the number of feet varies between 10 and 60 pairs and some of which certainly live in the saturated lie of salterns and natronlakes but of which only one rather divergent genus nebalia is found in the sea1 have to undergo a metamorphosis mecznikow has recently observed the development of nebalia and concludes from his observations that nebalia during its embryonal life passes through the nauplius and zoastages which in the decapoda occur partly in penus in the free state therefore says he i regard nebalia as a phyllopodiform decapod the youngest larv of the phyllopoda are nauplii which we have already met with exceptionally in some prawns and which we shall now find reproduced almost without exception the bodysegments and feet which are sometimes so numerous are formed gradually from before backwards without the indication of any sharplydiscriminated regions of the body either by the time of their appearance or by their form all the feet are essentially constructed in the same manner and resemble the maxill of the higher crustacea2 we might regard the phyllopoda as zo which have not arrived at the formation of a peculiarly endowed abdomen or thorax and instead of these have repeatedly reproduced the appendages which first follow the naupliuslimbs of the copepodasome of which living in a free state people the fresh waters and in far more multifarious forms the sea whilst others as parasites infest animals of the most various classes and often become wonderfully deformedthe developmental history like their entire natural history was until lately in a very unsatisfactory state it is true that we long ago knew that the cyclopes of our fresh waters were excluded in the naupliusform and that we were acquainted with some others of their young states we had learnt through nordmann that the same earliest form belonged to several parasitic crustacea which had previously passed almost universally as worms but the connecting intermediate forms which would have permitted us to refer the regions of the body and the limbs of the larv to those of the adult animal were wanting the comprehensive and careful investigations of claus have filled up this deficiency in our knowledge and rendered the section of the copepoda one of the best known in the whole class the following statements are derived from the works of this able naturalist from the abundance of valuable materials which they contain i select only those which are indispensable for the comprehension of the development of the crustacea in general because in what relates to the copepoda in particular the facts have already been placed in the proper light by the representation of their most recent investigator and must appear to any one whose eyes are open as important evidence in favour of the darwinian theory3 all the larv of the free copepoda investigated by claus have at the earliest period three pairs of limbs the future antenn and mandibles the anterior with a single and the two following ones with a double series of joints or branchi the unpaired eye labrum and mouth already occupy their permanent positions the posterior portion which is usually short and destitute of limbs bears two terminal set between which the anus is situated the form in this naupliusbrood is extremely variousit is sometimes compressed laterally sometimes flatsometimes elongated sometimes oval sometimes round or even broader than long and so forth the changes which the first larval stages undergo during the progress of growth consist essentially in an extension of the body and the sprouting forth of new limbs the following stage already displays a fourth pair of extremities the future maxill then follow at once three new pairs of limbs the maxillipedes and the two anterior pairs of natatory feet the larva still continues like a nauplius as the three anterior pairs of limbs represent rowing feet at the next moult it is converted into the youngest cyclopslike state when it resembles the adult animal in the structure of the antenn and buccal organs although the number of limbs and body segments is still much less for only the rudiments of the third and fourth pairs of natatory feet have made their appearance in the form of cushions fringed with set and the body consists of the oval cephalothorax the second third and fourth thoracic segments and an elongated terminal joint in the cyclopid the posterior antenn have lost their secondary branch and the mandibles have completely thrown off the previously existing natatory feet whilst in the other families these appendages persist more or less altered beyond this stage of free development many forms of the parasitic copepoda such as lernanthropus and chondracanthus do not pass as they do not acquire the third and fourth pairs of limbs nor does a separation of the fifth thoracic segment from the abdomen take place others achtheres even fall to a lower grade by the subsequent loss of the two pairs of natatory feet but all free copepoda and most of the parasitic crustacea pass through a longer or shorter series of stages of development in which the limbs acquire a higher degree of division into joints in continuous sequence the posterior pairs of feet are developed and the last thoracic segment and the different abdominal segments are successively separated from the common terminal portion figs 53 and 54 nauplii of copepoda the former magnified the latter magnified 2x fig 55 nauplius

it the olfactory filaments issue behind it are some delicate muscles passing to the buccal hood there is only one thing more to be indicated in the developmental history of the parasitic crustacea namely that some of them such as achtheres percarum certainly quit the egg like the rest in a naupliuslike form inasmuch as the plump oval astomatous body bears two pairs of simple rowing feet and behind these as traces of the third pair two inflations furnished each with a long seta but that beneath this naupliusskin a very different larva lies ready prepared which in a few hours bursts its clumsy envelope and then makes its appearance in a form which agrees in the segmentation of the body and in the development of the extremities with the first cyclopsstage claus the entire series of naupliusstages which are passed through by the free copepoda are in this case completely overleapt a final and very peculiar section of the crustacea is formed by the two orders of the cirripedia and rhizocephala4 in these also the brood bursts out in the naupliusform and speedily strips off its earliest larvaskin which is distinguished by no peculiarities worth noticing here also we find again the same pyriform shape of the unsegmented body the same number and structure of the feet the same position of the median eye which however is wanting in sacculina purpurea and according to darwin in some species of lepas and the same position of the buccal hood as in the nauplii of the prawns and copepoda from the latter the nauplii of the cirripedia and rhizocephala are distinguished by the possession of a dorsal shield or carapace which sometimes sacculina purpurea projects far beyond the body all round and they are distinguished not only from other nauplii but as far as i know from all other crustacea by the circumstance that structures which are elsewhere combined with the two anterior limbs antenn here occur separated from them the anterior antenn of the copepoda cladocera phyllopoda leydig claus ostracoda at least the cypridin diastylid edriophthalma and podophthalma with few exceptions relating to terrestrial animals or parasites bear peculiar filaments which i have already repeatedly mentioned as olfactory filaments a pair of similar filaments spring in the larv of the cirripedia and rhizocephala directly from the brain fig 56 nauplius of sacculina purpurea

sacculina purpurea magnified the filaments on the adherent feet may be the commencements of the future roots at the base of the inferior antenn in the decapoda the socalled greengland has its opening in the macrura at the end of a conical process a similar conical process with an efferent duct traversing it is very striking in most of the amphipoda in the ostracoda zenker describes a gland situated in the base of the inferior antenn and opening at the extremity of an extraordinarily long spine in the nauplii of cyclops and cyclopsine claus finds pale shellglands which commence in the intermediate pair of limbs the posterior antenn on the other hand in the nauplii of the cirripedia and rhizocephala the shellglands open at the ends of conical processes sometimes of most remarkable length which spring from the angles of the broad frontal margin and have been interpreted sometimes as antenn burmeister darwin and sometimes as mere horns of the carapace krohn the connexion of the shellglands with the frontal horns has been recognised unmistakably in the larv of lepas and indeed the resemblance of the frontal horns with the conical processes on the inferior antenn of the amphipoda is complete throughout5 notwithstanding their agreement in this important peculiarity the nauplii of these two orders present material differences in many other particulars the abdomen of the young cirripede is produced beneath the anus into a long taillike appendage which is furcate at the extremity and over the anus there is a second long spinelike process the abdomen in the rhizocephala terminates in two short pointsin a moveable caudal fork as in the rotatoria o schmidt the young cirripedes have a mouth stomach intestine and anus and their two posterior pairs of limbs are beset with multifarious teeth set and hooks which certainly assist in the inception of nourishment all this is wanting in the young rhizocephala the nauplii of the cirripedia have to undergo several moults whilst in that form the nauplii of the rhizocephala being astomatous cannot of course live long as nauplii and in the course of only a few days they become transformed into equally astomatous pup as darwin calls them the carapace folds itself together so that the little animal acquires the aspect of a bivalve shell the foremost limbs become transformed into very peculiar adherent feet prehensile antenn darwin and the two following pairs are cast off like the frontal horns on the abdomen six pairs of powerful biramose natatory feet with long set have been formed beneath the naupliusskin and behind these are two short setigerous caudal appendages fig 58 the pup of the cirripedia fig 57 which are likewise astomatous agree completely in all these parts with those of the rhizocephala even to the minutest details of the segmentation and bristling of the natatory feet6 they are especially distinguished from them by the possession of a pair of composite eyes sometimes also traces of the frontal horns seem to persist7 as the cirripedia and rhizocephala now in general resemble each other far more than in their naupliusstate this is also the case with the individual members of each of the two orders the pup in both orders attach themselves by means of the adherent feet those of the cirripedes to rocks shells turtles driftwood ships etcthose of the rhizocephala to the abdomen of crabs porcellan and hermit crabs the carapace of the cirripedes becomes converted as is wellknown into a peculiar test on account of which they were formerly placed among the mollusca and the natatory feet grow into long cirri which whirl nourishment towards the mouth which is now open the rhizocephala remain astomatous they lose all their limbs completely and appear as sausagelike sackshaped or discoidal excrescences of their host filled with ova figs 59 60 from the point of attachment closed tubes ramified like roots sink into the interior of the host twisting round its intestine or becoming diffused among the saclike tubes of its liver the only manifestations of life which persist in these non plus ultras in the series of retrogressively metamorphosed crustacea are powerful contractions of the roots and an alternate expansion and contraction of the body in consequence of which water flows into the broodcavity and is again expelled through a wide orifice8 fig 59 young of peltogaster socialis on the abdomen of a small hermit crab in one of them the fasciculately ramified roots in the liver of the crab are shown animal and roots

mentioned here darwin found it in great quantities together in the shell of concholepas peruviana on the chonos islands the egg which is at first elliptical soon according to darwin becomes broader at the anterior extremity and acquires three clubshaped horns one at each anterior angle and one behind no internal parts can as yet be detected subsequently the posterior horn disappears and the adherent feet may be recognised within the anterior ones from this egglike larvadarwin says of it i hardly know what to call itthe pupa is directly produced its carapace is but slightly compressed laterally and hairy as in sacculina purpurea the adherent feet are of considerable size and the natatory feet are wanting as in the adult animal are the corresponding cirri as i learn from mr spence bate the naupliusstage appears to be overleaped and the larv to leave the egg in the pupaform in the case of a rhizocephalon peltogaster found by dr powell in the mauritius i will conclude this general view with a few words upon the earliest processes in the development of the crustacea until recently it was regarded as a general rule that by the partial segmentation of the vitellus a germinal disc was formed and in this corresponding to the ventral surface of the embryo a primitive band we now know that in the copepoda claus in the rhizocephala fig 64 and as i can add in the cirripedia figs 6163 the segmentation is complete and the embryos are sketched out in their complete form without any preceding primitive band probably the latter will always be the case where the young are hatched as true nauplii and not merely with a naupliusskin as in achtheres the two modes of development may occur in very closely allied animals as is proved by achtheres among the copepoda9 1 if the phyllopoda may be regarded as the nearest allies of the trilobites they would furnish with lepidosteus and polypterus lepidosiren and protopterus a further example of the preservation in fresh waters of forms long since extinguished in the sea the occurrence of the artemi in supersaline water would at the same time show that they do not escape destruction by means of the fresh water but in consequence of the less amount of competition in it 2 the maxilla of the decapodlarva krebslarve is a sort of phyllopodal foot claus 3 i am still unacquainted with claus latest and larger work but no doubt the same may be said of it 4 the most various opinions prevail as to the position of the cirripedia some ascribe to them a very subordinate position among the copepoda as milneedwards 1852 in direct opposition to this notion of his fathers alph milneedwards places them as basinotes opposite to all the other crustacea eleuthronotes darwin regards them as forming a peculiar subclass equivalent to the podophthalma edriophthalma etc this appears to me to be most convenient i would not combine the rhizocephala with the cirripedia as liljeborg has done but place them in opposition as equivalent like the amphipoda and isopoda the near relationship of the cirripedia to the ostracoda is also spoken of but the similarity of the socalled cyprislike larv or cirripedpup as darwin calls them to cypris is so purely external even as regards the shell that the relationship appears to me to be scarcely greater than that of peltogaster socialis fig 59 with the family of the sausages 5 in connexion with this it may be mentioned that in the females of brachyscelus in which the posterior antenn are deficient the conical processes with the canal permeating them are nevertheless retained 6 compare the figure given by darwin balanid pl xxx fig 5 of the first natatory foot of the pupa of lepas australis with that of lernodiscus porcellan published in the archiv fr naturgeschichte 1863 taf iii fig 5 the sole distinction that in the latter there are only 3 set at the end of the outer branch whilst in the cirripedia there are 4 on the first and 5 on the following natatory feet may be due to an error on my part 7 darwin describes as acoustic orifices small apertures in the shell of the pup of the cirripedia which frequently surrounded by a border are situated in lepas pectinata upon short hornlike processes i feel scarcely any hesitation in regarding the apertures as those of the shellglands and the hornlike processes as remains of the frontal horns 8 the roots of sacculina purpurea fig 60 which is parasitic upon a small hermit crab are made use of by two parasitic isopods namely a bopyrus and the before mentioned cryptoniscus planarioides fig 42 these take up their abode beneath the sacculina and cause it to die away by intercepting the nourishment conveyed by the roots the roots however continue to grow even without the sacculina and frequently attain an extraordinary extension especially when a bopyrus obtains its nourishment from them 9 i have not mentioned the pycnogonid because i do not regard them as crustacea nor the xiphosura and trilobites because having never investigated them myself i knew too little about them and especially because i am unacquainted with the details of the explanations given by barrande of the development of the latter according to mr spence bate the young of trilobites are of the naupliusform chapter x on the principles of classification perhaps some one else more fortunate than myself may be able even without darwin to find the guiding clue through the confusion of developmental forms now so totally different in the nearest allies now so surprisingly similar in members of the most distant groups which we have just cursorily reviewed perhaps a sharper eye may be able with agassiz to make out the plan established from the beginning by the creator1 who may have written here as a portuguese proverb says straight in crooked lines2 i cannot but think that we can scarcely speak of a general plan or typical mode of development of the crustacea differentiated according to the separate sections orders and families when for example among the macrura the river crayfish leaves the egg in its permanent form the lobster with schizopodal feet palmon like the crabs as a zoa and penus like the cirripedes as a naupliusand when still within this same suborder macrura palinurus mysis and euphausia again present different young formswhen new limbs sometimes sprout forth as free rudiments on the ventral surface and are sometimes formed beneath the skin which passes smoothly over them and both modes of development are found in different limbs of the same animal and in the same pair of limbs in different animalswhen in the podophthalma the limbs of the thorax and abdomen make their appearance sometimes simultaneously or sometimes the former and sometimes the latter first and when further in each of the two groups the pairs sometimes all appear together and sometimes one after the otherwhen among the hyperina a simple foot becomes a chela in phronima and a chela a simple foot in brachyscelus etc and yet according to the teaching of the school it is precisely in youth precisely in the course of development that the type is mostly openly displayed but let us hear what the old school has to tell us as to the significance of developmental history and its relation to comparative anatomy and systematic zoology let two of its most approved masters speak whilst comparative anatomy said johannes mller in 1844 in his lectures upon this science and the opinions of my memorable teacher were for many years my own whilst comparative anatomy shows us the infinitely multifarious formation of the same organ in the animal kingdom it furnishes us at the same time with the means by the comparison of these various forms of recognising the truly essential the type of these organs and separating therefrom everything unessential in this developmental history serves it as a check or test thus as the idea of development is not that of mere increase of size but that of progress from what is not yet distinguished but which potentially contains the distinction in itself to the actually distinctit is clear that the less an organ is developed so much the more does it approach the type and that during its development it more and more acquires peculiarities the types discovered by comparative anatomy and developmental history must therefore agree then after johannes mller has combated the idea of a graduated scale of animals and of the passage through several animal grades during development he continueswhat is true in this idea is that every embryo at first bears only the type of its section from which the type of the class order etc is only afterwards developed in 1856 in an elementary work3 in which it is usual to admit only what are regarded as the assured acquisitions of science agassiz expresses himself as follows the ovarian eggs of all animals are perfectly identical small cells with a vitellus germinal vesicle and germinal spot 278 the organs of the body are formed in the sequence of their organic importance the most essential always appear first thus the organs of vegetative life the intestine etc appear later than those of animal life the nervous system skeleton etc and these in turn are preceded by the more general phenomena belonging to the animal as such 318 thus in fishes the first changes consist in the segmentation of the vitellus and the formation of a germ processes which are common to all classes of animals then the dorsal furrow characteristic of the vertebrate appearsthe brain the organs of the senses at a later period are formed the intestine the limbs and the permanent form of the respiratory organs from which the class is recognised with certainty it is only after exclusion that the peculiarities of the structure of the teeth and fins indicate the genus and species 319 hence the embryos of different animals resemble each other the more the younger they are 320 consequently the high importance of developmental history is indubitable for if the formation of the organs takes place in the order corresponding to their importance this sequence must of itself be a criterion of their comparative value in classification the peculiarities which appear earlier should be considered of higher value than those which appear subsequently 321 a system in order to be true and natural must agree with the sequence of the organs in the development of the embryo 322 i do not know whether any one at the present day will be inclined to subscribe to this proposition in its whole extent4 it is certain however that views essentially similar are still to be met with everywhere in discussions on classification and that even within the last few years the very sparingly successful attempts to employ developmental history as the foundation of classification have been repeated but how do these propositions agree with our observations on the developmental history of the crustacea that these observations relate for the most part to their free metamorphosis after their quitting the egg cannot prejudice their application to the propositions enunciated especially with regard to embryonal development in the egg for agassiz himself points out 391 that both kinds of change are of the same nature and of equal importance and that no radical distinction is produced by the circumstance that the former take place before and the latter after birth the ovarian eggs of all animals are identical small cells with vitellus germinal vesicle and germinal spot yes somewhat as all insects are identical small animals with head thorax and abdomen that is to say if only noticing what is common to them we leave out of consideration the difference of their development the presence or absence and the multifarious structure of the vitelline membrane the varying composition of the vitellus the different number and formation of the germinal spots etc numerous examples which might easily be augmented of such profound differences are furnished by leydigs lehrbuch der histologie in the crustacea the ovarian eggs actually sometimes furnish excellent characters for the discrimination of species of the same genus thus for example in one porcellana of this country they are blackishgreen in a second deep bloodred and in a third dark yellow and within the limits of the same order they present considerable differences in size which as van beneden and claus have already pointed out stands in intimate connexion with the subsequent mode of development the organs of the body are formed in the sequence of their organic importance the most essential always appear first this proposition might be characterised priori as undemonstrable since it is impossible either in general or for any particular animal to establish a sequence of importance amongst equally indispensable parts which is the more important the lung or the heartthe liver or the kidneythe artery or the vein instead of giving the preference with agassiz to the organs of animal life we might with equal justice give it to those of vegetative life as the latter are conceivable without the former but not the former without the latter we might urge that according to this proposition provisional organs as the first produced must exceed the laterformed permanent organs in importance but let us stick to the crustacea in polyphemus leydig finds the first traces of the intestinal tube even during segmentation in mysis a provisional tail is first formed and in ligia a maggotlike larvaskin the simple median eye appears earlier and would therefore be more important than the compound paired eyes the scale of the antenn in the prawns would be more important than the flagellum the maxillipedes of the decapoda would be more important than the chel and ambulatory feet and the anterior six pairs of feet in the isopoda than the precisely similarly formed seventh pair in the amphipoda the most important of all organs would be the micropylar apparatus which disappears without leaving a trace soon after hatching in cyclops the set of the tail would be more important than all the natatory feet in the cirripedia the posterior antenn as to which we do not know what becomes of them would be more important than the cirri and so forth the most unimportant of all organs would be the sexual organs and the most essential peculiarity would consist in colour which is to be referred back to the ovarian egg the embryos or young states of different animals resemble each other the more the younger they are or as johannes mller expresses it they approach the more closely to the common type different as may be the ideas connected with the word type no one will dispute that the typical form of the penultimate pair of feet in the amphipoda is that of a simple ambulatory foot and not that of a chela for the latter occurs in no single adult amphipod we know it only in the young of the genus brachyscelus which therefore in this respect undoubtedly depart more widely than the adults from the type of their order this applies also to the young males of the shorehoppers orchestia with regard to the second pair of anterior feet gnathopoda in like manner no one will hesitate to accept the possession of seven pairs of feet as a typical peculiarity of the edriophthalma which agassiz on this account names tetradecapoda the young isopoda which are dodecapoda are also in this respect further from the type than the adults it is certainly a rule and this darwins theory would lead us to expect that in the progress of development those forms which are at first similar gradually depart further from each other but here as in other classes the exceptions for which the old school has no explanation are numerous not unfrequently we might indeed directly reverse the proposition and assert that the difference becomes the greater the further we go back in the development and this not only in those cases in which one of two nearly allied species is directly developed and the other passes through several larval stages such as the common crayfish and the prawns which are produced from naupliusbrood the same may be said for example of the isopoda and amphipoda in the adult animals the number of limbs is the same at the first sight of a cyrtophium or a dulichia and even after the careful examination of a tanais we may be in doubt whether we have an isopod or an amphipod before us in the newlyhatched young the number of limbs is different and if we go back to their existence in the egg the most passing glance to see whether the curvature is upwards or downwards suffices to distinguish even the youngest embryos of the two orders in other instances the courses which lead from a similar startingpoint to a similar goal separate widely in the middle of the development as in the prawns with naupliusbrood already described finally so that even the last possibility may be exhausted it sometimes happens that the greatest similarity occurs in the middle of the development the most striking example of this is furnished by the cirripedia and rhizocephala whether we compare the two orders or the members of each with one another from a segmentation quite different in its course see figs 6164 proceed different forms of nauplius these become converted into exceedingly similar pup and from the pup again proceed sexually mature animals differing from each other toto clo if the formation of the organs occurs in the order corresponding to their importance this sequence must of itself be a criterion of their comparative value in classification that is to say supposing the physiological and classificational value of an organ to coincide just as in christian countries there is a catechismal morality which every one has upon his lips but no one considers himself bound to follow or expects to see followed by anybody else so also has zoology its dogmas which are as universally acknowledged as they are disregarded in practice such a dogma as this is the supposition tacitly made by agassiz of a hundred who feel themselves compelled to give their systematic confession of faith as the introduction to a manual or monographic memoir ninetynine will commence by saying that a natural system cannot be founded upon a single character but that it has to take into account all characters and the general structure of the animal but that we must not simply sum up these characters like equivalent magnitudes that we must not count but weigh them and determine the importance to be ascribed to each of them according to its physiological significance this is probably followed by a little jingle of words in general terms on the comparative importance of animal and vegetative organs circulation respiration and the like but when we come to the work itself to the discrimination and arrangement of the species genera families etc in all probability not one of the ninetynine will pay the least attention to these fine rules or undertake the hopeless attempt to carry them out in detail agassiz for example like cuvier and in opposition to the majority of the german and english zoologists regards the radiata as one of the great primary divisions of the animal kingdom although no one knows anything about the significance of the radiate arrangement in the life of these animals and notwithstanding that the radiate echinodermata are produced from bilateral larv the true fishes are divided by him into ctenoids and cycloids according as the posterior margin of their scales is denticulated or smooth a circumstance the importance of which to the animal must be infinitely small in comparison to the peculiarities of the dentition formation of the fins number of vertebr etc and to return to our class of the crustacea has any particular attention been paid in their classification to the distinctions prevailing in the most essential organs for instance to the nervous system in the corycid claus found all the ventral ganglia fused together into a single broad mass and in the calanid a long ventral chain of gangliathe former therefore in this respect resembling the spider crabs and the latter the lobster but no one would dream on this account of supposing that there was a relationship between the corycid and the crabs or the calanid and the lobstersor to the organs of circulation we have among the copepoda the cyclopid and corycid without a heart side by side with the calanid and pontellid with a heart and in the same way among the ostracoda the cypridin which i find possess a heart place themselves side by side with cypris and cythere which have no such organor to the respiratory apparatus milneedwards did this when he separated mysis and leucifer from the decapoda but he himself afterwards saw that this was an error in one cypridina i find branchi of considerable size which are entirely wanting in another species but this does not appear to me to be a reason for separating these species even generically on the other hand what do we know of the physiological significance of the number of segments and all the other matters which we are accustomed to regard as typical peculiarities of the different organs and to which we usually ascribe the highest systematic value those peculiarities which first appear should be more highly estimated than those which appear subsequently a system in order to be true and natural must agree with the sequence of the organs in the development of the embryo if the earlier manifested peculiarities are to be estimated more highly than those which afterwards make their appearance then in those cases in which the structure of the adult animal requires one position in the system and that of the larva another the latter and not the former must decide the point as the lern and cirripedes on account of their naupliusbrood were separated from their previous connexions and referred to the crustacea we shall for the same reason have to separate penus from the prawns and unite it with the copepoda and cirripedia but the most zealous embryomaniac would probably shrink from this course a true and natural system of the crustacea to be in accordance with the sequence of the phenomena would have to take into account in the first place the various modes of segmentation then the position of the embryo next the number of limbs produced within the egg and so forth and might be represented somewhat as follows classis

be imagined does the naturalness of such an arrangement as this force itself upon us all things considered we may apply the judgment which agassiz pronounced upon darwins theory with far greater justice to the propositions just examinedno theory says he however plausible it may be can be admitted in science unless it is supported by facts 1 a plan fully matured in the beginning and undeviatingly pursued or in the beginning his plan was formed and from it he has never swerved in any particular agassiz and gould principles of zoology 2 deos escrive direito em linhas tortas to read this remarkable writing we need the spectacles of faith which seldom suit eyes accustomed to the microscope 3 principles of zoology part i comparative physiology by louis agassiz and aa gould revised edition boston 1856 4 agassiz own views have lately become essentially different so far as can be made out from rud wagners notice of his essay on classification agassiz himself does not attempt any criticism of the above cited older views which however are still widely diffused with his recent conception i am unfortunately acquainted only from r wagners somewhat confused report and have therefore thought it better not to attempt any critical remarks upon it chapter xi on the progress of evolution from this scarcely unavoidable but unsatisfactory sideglance upon the old school which looks down with so great an air of superiority upon darwins intellectual dream and the giddy enthusiasm of its friends i turn to the more congenial task of considering the developmental history of the crustacea from the point of view of the darwinian theory darwin himself in the thirteenth chapter of his book has already discussed the conclusions derived from his hypotheses in the domain of developmental history for a more detailed application of them however it is necessary in the first place to trace these general conclusions a little further than he has there done the changes by which young animals depart from their parents and the gradual accumulation of which causes the production of new species genera and families may occur at an earlier or later period of lifein the young state or at the period of sexual maturity for the latter is by no means always as in the insecta a period of repose most other animals even then continue to grow and to undergo changes see above the remarks on the males of the amphipoda some variations indeed from their very nature can only occur when the young animal has attained the adult stage of development thus the sea caterpillars polyno at first possess only a few bodysegments which during development gradually increase to a number which is different in different species but constant in the same species now before a young animal could exceed the number of segments of its parents it must of course have attained that number we may assume a similar supplementary progress wherever the deviation of the descendants consists in an addition of new segments and limbs descendants therefore reach a new goal either by deviating sooner or later whilst still on the way towards the form of their parents or by passing along this course without deviation but then instead of standing still advance still farther the former mode will have had a predominant action where the posterity of common ancestors constitutes a group of forms standing upon the same level in essential features as the whole of the amphipoda crabs or birds on the other hand we are led to the assumption of the second mode of progress when we seek to deduce from a common original form animals some of which agree with young states of others in the former case the developmental history of the descendants can only agree with that of their ancestors up to a certain point at which their courses separateas to their structure in the adult state it will teach us nothing in the second case the entire development of the progenitors is also passed through by the descendants and therefore so far as the production of a species depends upon this second mode of progress the historical development of the species will be mirrored in its developmental history in the short period of a few weeks or months the changing forms of the embryo and larv will pass before us a more or less complete and more or less true picture of the transformations through which the species in the course of untold thousands of years has struggled up to its present state figs 65 to 67 young tubicolar worms magnified with the simple lens 65 without operculum protulastage 66 with a barbate opercular peduncle filogranastage with a naked opercular peduncle serpulastage figs 6567 young tubicolar worms magnified with the simple lens 651 without operculum protulastage 66 with a barbate opercular peduncle filogranastage 67 with a naked opercular peduncle serpulastage one of the simplest examples is furnished by the development of the tubicolar annelids but from its very simplicity it appears well adapted to open the eyes of many who perhaps would rather not see and it may therefore find a place here three years ago i found on the walls of one of my glasses some small wormtubes fig 65 the inhabitants of which bore three pairs of barbate branchial filaments and had no operculum according to this we should have been obliged to refer them to the genus protula a few days afterwards one of the branchial filaments had become thickened at the extremity into a clavate operculum fig 66 when the animals reminded me by the barbate opercular peduncle of the genus filograna only that the latter possesses two opercula in three days more during which a new pair of branchial filaments had sprouted forth the opercular peduncle had lost its lateral filaments fig 67 and the worms had become serpul here the supposition at once presents itself that the primitive tubicolar worm was a protulathat some of its descendants which had already become developed into perfect protul subsequently improved themselves by the formation of an operculum which might protect their tubes from inimical intrudersand that subsequent descendants of these latter finally lost the lateral filaments of the opercular peduncle which they like their ancestors had developed what say the schools to this case whence and for what purpose if the serpul were produced or created as readyformed species these lateral filaments of the opercular peduncle to allow them to sprout forth merely for the sake of an invariable plan of structure even when they must be immediately retracted again as superfluous would certainly be an evidence rather of childish trifling or dictatorial pedantry than of infinite wisdom but no i am mistaken from the beginning of all things the creator knew that one day the inquisitive children of men would grope about after analogies and homologies and that christian naturalists would busy themselves with thinking out his creative ideas at any rate in order to facilitate the discernment by the former that the opercular peduncle of the serpul is homologous with a branchial filament he allowed it to make a detour in its development and pass through the form of a barbate branchial filament the historical record preserved in developmental history is gradually effaced as the development strikes into a constantly straighter course from the egg to the perfect animal and it is frequently sophisticated by the struggle for existence which the freeliving larv have to undergo thus as the law of inheritance is by no means strict as it gives room for individual variations with regard to the form of the parents this is also the case with the succession in time of the developmental processes every father of a family who has taken notice of such matters is well aware that even in children of the same parents the teeth for example are not cut or changed either at the same age or in the same order now in general it will be useful to an animal to obtain as early as possible those advantages by which it sustains itself in the struggle for existence a precocious appearance of peculiarities originally acquired at a later period will generally be advantageous and their retarded appearance disadvantageous the former when it appears accidentally will be preserved by natural selection it is the same with every change which gives to the larval stages rendered multifarious by crossed and oblique characters a more straightforward direction simplifies and abridges the process of development and forces it back to an earlier period of life and finally into the life of the egg as this conversion of a development passing through different young states into a more direct one is not the consequence of a mysterious inherent impulse but dependent upon advances accidentally presenting themselves it may take place in the most nearly allied animals in the most various ways and require very different periods of time for its completion there is one thing however that must not be overlooked here the historical development of a species can hardly ever have taken place in a continuously uniform flow periods of rest will have alternated with periods of rapid progress but forms which in periods of rapid progress were severed from others after a short duration must have impressed themselves less deeply upon the developmental history of their descendants than those which repeated themselves unchanged through a long series of successive generations in periods of rest these more fixed forms less inclined to variation will present a more tenacious resistance in the transition to direct development and will maintain themselves in a more uniform manner and to the last however different may be the course of this process in other respects in general as already stated it will be advantageous to the young to commence the struggle for existence in the form of their parents and furnished with all their advantagesin general but not without exceptions it is perfectly clear that a brood capable of locomotion is almost indispensable to attached animals and that the larv of sluggish mollusca or of worms burrowing in the ground etc by swarming briskly through the sea perform essential services by dispersing the species over wider spaces in other cases a metamorphosis is rendered indispensable by the circumstance that a division of labour has been set up between the various periods of life for example that the larv have exclusively taken upon themselves the business of nourishment a further circumstance to be taken into consideration is the size of the eggsa simpler structure may be produced with less material than a more compound onethe more imperfect the larva the smaller may the egg be and the larger is the number of these that the mother can furnish with the same expenditure of material as a rule i believe indeed this advantage of a more numerous brood will not by any means outweigh that of a more perfect brood but it will do so in those cases in which the chief difficulty of the young animals consists in finding a suitable place for their development and in which therefore it is of importance to disperse the greatest possible number of germs as in many parasites as the conversion of the original development with metamorphosis into direct development is here under discussion this may be the proper place to say a word as to the already indicated absence of metamorphosis in freshwater and terrestrial animals the marine allies of which still undergo a transformation this circumstance seems to be explicable in two ways either species without a metamorphosis migrated especially into the fresh waters or the metamorphosis was more rapidly got rid of in the emigrants than in their fellows remaining in the sea animals without a metamorphosis would naturally transfer themselves more easily to a new residence as they had only themselves and not at the same time multifarious young forms to adapt to the new conditions but in the case of animals with a metamorphosis the mortality among the larv always considerable must have become still greater under new than under accustomed conditions every step towards the simplification of the process of development must therefore have given them a still greater preponderance over their fellows and the effacing of the metamorphosis must have gone on more rapidly what has taken place in each individual case whether the species has immigrated after it had lost the metamorphosis or lost the metamorphosis after its immigration will not always be easy to decide when there are marine allies without or with only a slight metamorphosis like the lobster as the cousin of the crayfish we may take up the former supposition when allies with a metamorphosis still live upon the land or in fresh water as in the case of gecarcinus we may adopt the latter that besides this gradual extinction of the primitive history a falsification of the record preserved in the developmental history takes place by means of the struggle for existence which the freeliving young states have to undergo requires no further exposition for it is perfectly evident that the struggle for existence and natural selection combined with this must act in the same way in change and development upon larv which have to provide for themselves as upon adult animals the changes of the larv independent of the progress of the adult animal will become the more considerable the longer the duration of the life of the larva in comparison to that of the adult animal the greater the difference in their mode of life and the more sharply marked the division of labour between the different stages of development these processes have to a certain extent an action opposed to the gradual extinction of the primitive history they increase the differences between the individual stages of development and it will be easily seen how even a straightforward course of development may be again converted by them into a development with metamorphosis by this means many and it seems to me valid reasons may be brought up in favour of the opinion that the most ancient insects approached more nearly to the existing orthoptera and perhaps to the wingless blattid than to any other order and that the complete metamorphosis of the beetles lepidoptera etc is of later origin there were i believe perfect insects before larv and pup but on the contrary nauplii and zo far earlier than perfect prawns in contradistinction to the inherited metamorphosis of the prawns we may call that of the coleoptera lepidoptera etc an acquired metamorphosis2 which of the different modes of development at present occurring in a class of animals may claim to be that approaching most nearly to the original one is easy to judge from the above statements the primitive history of a species will be preserved in its developmental history the more perfectly the longer the series of young states through which it passes by uniform steps and the more truly the less the mode of life of the young departs from that of the adults and the less the peculiarities of the individual young states can be conceived as transferred back from later ones in previous periods of life or as independently acquired let us apply this to the crustacea 1 fig 65 is drawn from memory as the little animals which i at first took for young protulae only attracted my attention when i remarked the appearance of the operculum which induced me to draw them 2 i will here briefly give my reasons for the opinion that the socalled complete metamorphosis of insects in which these animals quit the egg as grubs or caterpillars and afterwards become quiescent pup incapable of feeding was not inherited from the primitive ancestor of all insects but acquired at a later period the order orthoptera including the pseudoneuroptera ephemera libellula etc appears to approach nearest to the primitive form of insects in favour of this view we have 1 the structure of their buccal organs especially the formation of the labium which retains either perfectly or approximately the original form of a second pair of maxill gerstcker 2 the segmentation of the abdomen like the labium the abdomen also very generally retains its original segmentation which is shown in the development of eleven segments gerstcker the orthoptera with eleven segments in the abdomen agree perfectly in the number of their bodysegments with the prawnlarva represented in fig 33 or indeed with the higher crustacea podophthalma and edriophthalma in general in which the historically youngest last thoracic segment see chapter 12 which is sometimes latedeveloped or destitute of appendages or even deficient is still wanting 3 that as in the crustacea the sexual orifice and anus are placed upon different segments whilst the former is situated in the ninth segment the latter occurs in the eleventh gerstcker 4 their palontological occurrence in a fossil state the orthoptera make their appearance the earliest of all insects namely as early as the carboniferous formation in which they exceed all others in number gerstcker 5 the absence of uniformity of habit at the present day in an order so small when compared with the coleoptera hymenoptera etc for this also is usually a phenomenon characteristic of very ancient groups of forms which have already overstepped the climax of their development and is explicable by extinction in mass a beetle or a butterfly is to be recognised as such at the first glance but only a thorough investigation can demonstrate the mutual relationships of termes blatta mantis forficula ephemera libellula etc i may refer to a corresponding remarkable example from the vegetable world amongst ferns the genera aneimia schiza and lygodium belonging to the group schizace which is very poor in species differ much more from each other than any two forms of the group polypodiace which numbers its thousands of species if from all this it seems right to regard the orthoptera as the order of insects approaching most nearly to the common primitive form we must also expect that their mode of development will agree better with that of the primitive form than for example that of the lepidoptera in the same way that some of the prawns penus approaching most closely the primitive form of the decapoda have most truly preserved their original mode of development now the majority of the orthoptera quit the egg in a form which is distinguished from that of the adult insect almost solely by the want of wings these larv then soon acquire rudiments of wings which appear more strongly developed after every moult even this perfectly gradual transition from the youngest larva to the sexually mature insect preserves in a far higher degree the picture of an original mode of development than does the socalled complete metamorphosis of the coleoptera lepidoptera or diptera with its abruptly separated larva pupa and imagostates the most ancient insects would probably have most resembled these wingless larv of the existing orthoptera the circumstance that there are still numerous wingless species among the orthoptera and that some of these blattid are so like certain crustacea isopods in habit that both are indicated by the same name baratta by the people in this country can scarcely be regarded as of any importance the contrary supposition that the oldest insects possessed a complete metamorphosis and that the incomplete metamorphosis of the orthoptera and hemiptera is only of later origin is met by serious difficulties if all the classes of arthropoda crustacea insecta myriopoda and arachnida are indeed all branches of a common stem and of this there can scarcely be a doubt it is evident that the waterinhabiting and waterbreathing crustacea must be regarded as the original stem from which the other terrestrial classes with their tracheal respiration have branched off but nowhere among the crustacea is there a mode of development comparable to the complete metamorphosis of the insecta nowhere among the young or adult crustacea are there forms which might resemble the maggots of the diptera or hymenoptera the larv of the coleoptera or the caterpillars of the lepidoptera still less any bearing even a distant resemblance to the quiescent pup of these animals the pup indeed cannot at all be regarded as members of an original developmental series the individual stages of which represent permanent ancestral states for an animal like the mouthless and footless pupa of the silkworm enclosed by a thick cocoon can never have formed the final sexually mature state of an arthropod in the development of the insecta we never see new segments added to those already present in the youngest larv but we do see segments which were distinct in the larva afterwards become fused together or disappear considering the parallelism which prevails throughout organic nature between palontological and embryonic development it is therefore improbable that the oldest insects should have possessed fewer segments than some of their descendants but the larva of the coleoptera lepidoptera etc never have more than nine abdominal segments it is therefore not probable that they represent the original young form of the oldest insects and that the orthoptera with an abdomen of eleven segments should have been subsequently developed from them taking into consideration on the one hand these difficulties and on the other the arguments which indicate the orthoptera as the order most nearly approaching the primitive form it is my opinion that the incomplete metamorphosis of the orthoptera is the primitive one inherited from the original parents of all insects and the complete metamorphosis of the coleoptera diptera etc a subsequently acquired one chapter xii progress of evolution in crustacea according to all the characters established in the last paragraph the prawn that we traced from the nauplius through states analogous to zoa and mysis to the form of a macrurous crustacean appears at present to be the animal which in the section of the higher crustacea malacostraca furnishes the truest and most complete indications of its primitive history that it is the most complete is at once evident that it is the truest must be assumed in the first place because the mode of life of the various ages is less different than in the majority of the other podophthalma for from the nauplius to the young prawn they were found swimming freely in the sea whilst crabs porcellan the tatuira squilla and many macrura when adult usually reside under stones in the clefts of rocks holes in the earth subterranean galleries sand etc not to mention other deviations in habits such as are presented by the hermit crabs pinnotheres etcand secondly and especially because the peculiarities which distinguish the zoa of this species particularly from other zo the employment of the anterior limbs for swimming the furcate tail the simple heart the deficiency of the paired eyes and abdomen at first etc are neither to be deduced from a retrotransfer of lateacquired advantages to this early period of life nor to be regarded at all as advantages over other zo which the larva might have acquired in the struggle for existence a similar development must have been once passed through by the primitive ancestor of all malacostraca probably differing from that of our prawn especially in the circumstance that it would go on more uniformly without the sudden change of form and mode of locomotion produced in the latter by the simultaneous sprouting forth and entering into action in the nauplius of four and in the zoa of five pairs of limbs it is to be supposed that not only originally but even still in the larv of the first malacostraca the new bodysegments and pairs of limbs are formed singlyfirst of all the segments of the forebody then those of the abdomen and finally those of the middlebodyand moreover that in each region of the body the anterior segments were formed earlier than the posterior ones and therefore last of all the hindermost segment of the middlebody of this original mode more or less distinct traces still remain even in species in which in other respects the course of development of their ancestors is already nearly effaced thus the abdominal feet of the prawnlarva represented in fig 33 are formed singly from before backwards and after these the last feet of the middlebody thus in palinurus the last two pairs of feet of the middlebody are formed later than the rest thus in the young larv of the stomapoda the last three abdominal segments are destitute of limbs which are still wanting on the last of them in older larv and thus in the isopoda the historically newest pair of feet is produced later than all the rest in the copepoda this formation of new segments and limbs gradually advancing from before backwards is more perfectly preserved than in any of the higher crustacea1 the original development of the malacostraca starting from the nauplius or the lowest freeliving grade with which we are acquainted in the class of crustacea is nowadays nearly effaced in the majority of them that this extinction has actually taken place in the way already deduced as a direct consequence from darwins theory will be the more easily demonstrated the more this process is still included in the course of life and the less completely it is already worn out we may hope to obtain the most striking examples in the still unknown developmental history of the various schizopoda pened and indeed of the macrura in general at present the multifarious zoaforms appear to be particularly instructive almost all the peculiarities by which they depart from the primitive form of the zoa of penus figs 29 30 32 may in fact be conceived as transferred back from a later period into this early period of life this is the case with the large compound eyeswith the structure of the heartwith the raptorial feet in squillaand with the powerful muscular straightlyextended abdomen in palmon alpheus hippolyte and the hermit crabs in the latter indeed the abdomen of the adult animal is a shapeless sac filled with the liver and generative organs but it is still tolerably powerful in the glaucothostage and was certainly still more powerful when this stage was still the permanent form of the animal it is also the case with the abdomen of the zo of the crabs the porcellan and the tatuira which is still powerful although usually bent under the breast the two last swim tolerably by means of the abdomen even when adult as do the true crabs in the young state known as megalops it is the case lastly with the conversion of the two anterior pairs of limbs into antenn the second pair of antenn which in the various zo always remains a step behind that of the adult animal is particularly remarkable in the crabs the scale is entirely wanting their zo have it indicated in the form of a moveable appendage which is often exceedingly minute in the hermit crabs a similar usually moveable spiniform process occurs as the remains of the scale their zo have a welldeveloped but inarticulate scale a precisely similar scale is possessed by the adult prawns in the zo of which it exists still in a jointed form like the outer branch of the second pair of feet of the nauplius or penuszoa the long spiniform processes on the carapace of the zo of the crabs and porcellan are not to be explained in this way but their advantage to the larv is evident thus for example if the body of the zoa of porcellana stellicola fig 24 without the processes of the carapace and without the abdomen which however is not rigidly extensible is scarcely half a line in length whilst with the processes it is four lines long a mouth of eight times the width is necessary in order to swallow the little animal when thus armed2 consequently these processes of the carapace may be regarded as acquired by the zoa itself in the struggle for existence the formation of new limbs beneath the skin of the larv is also to be referred to an earlier occurrence of processes which originally took place at a later period the original course must have been that they sprouted forth in a free form upon the ventral surface of the larva in the next stage after the change of skin whilst now they are developed before the change of skin and thus only come into action a stage earlier in larv which for other reasons must be regarded as more nearly approaching the primitive form the original mode usually prevails in this particular also thus the caudal feet the lateral caudal lamell are formed freely on the ventral surface in euphausia and the prawns with naupliusbrood and within the caudal lamell in the prawns with zoabrood in pagurus and porcellana a compression of several stages into one and thereby an abridgement and simplification of the course of development is expressed in the simultaneous appearance of several new pairs of limbs how earlier young states may gradually be completely lost is shown by mysis and the isopoda in mysis there is still a trace of the naupliusstage being transferred back to a period when it had not to provide for itself the nauplius has become degraded into a mere skin in ligia figs 36 37 this larvaskin has lost the last traces of limbs and in philoscia fig 38 it is scarcely demonstrable like the spinous processes of the zo the chel on the penultimate pair of feet of the young brachyscelus are to be regarded as acquired by the larva itself the adult animals swim admirably and are not confined to their host as soon as the specimens of chrysaora blossevillei less or rhizostoma cruciatum less on which they are seated become the sport of the waves in the neighbourhood of the shore they escape from them and are only to be obtained from lively acalephs the young are helpless creatures and bad swimmers a special apparatus for adhesion must be of great service to them to review the developmental history of the different malacostraca in detail would furnish no results at all correspondent to the time occupied by itif our knowledge was more complete it would be more profitable i therefore abandon it but will not omit to mention that in it many difficulties which cannot at present be satisfactorily solved would present themselves to these isolated difficulties i ascribe the less importance however because even a little while ago before the discovery of the prawnnauplius this entire domain of the development of the malacostraca was almost inaccessible to darwins theory nor will i dwell upon the contradictions which appear to result from the application of the darwinian theory to this department i leave it to our opponents to find them out most of them may easily be proved to be only apparent there are two of these objections however which lie so much on the surface that they can hardly escape being brought forward and these i think i must get rid of the peculiarities in which the zo of the crabs the porcellan the tatuira the hermit crabs and the prawns with zoabrood agree and by which they are in common distinguished from the larv of penus produced from nauplii forces us it might be said to the supposition that the common ancestor of these various decapods quitted the egg in a similar zoaform but then neither penus with its naupliusbrood nor even apparently the palinuri could be referred back to this ancestor the mode of development of penus and palinurus as also several peculiar larv of unknown origin but which are in all probability to be attributed to macrurous crustacea necessitate on the contrary the opposite supposition namely that the different groups of the macrura have passed from their original to their present mode of development independently of each other and also independently of the crabs to this we may answer that the occurrence of the zoaform in all the abovementioned decapoda its existence in penus during the whole of that period of life which is richest in progress and in which the wide gap between the nauplius and the decapod is filled up its recurrence even in the development of the stomapoda the occurrence of a larval form closely approaching the youngest zoa of penus in the schizopod genus euphausia and the reminiscence of the structure of zoa which even the adult tanais has preserved in its mode of respirationall indicate zoa as one of those steps in development which persisted as a permanent form throughout a long period of repose perhaps through a whole series of geological formations and thus has also made a deeper impression upon the development of its descendants and formed a firmer nucleus in the midst of other and more readily effaced young states it cannot therefore surprise us that in transitions from the original mode of metamorphosis to direct development even when produced independently the larval life commences in the same way with this zoaform in different families in which the earlier stages of development are effaced but except what is common to all zo and what may easily be explained as being transferred back from a later into this stage the zo of the crabs for example agree with those of pagurus and palmon in no single peculiarity of structure which leads us to suppose a common inheritance consequently we may apparently assume without hesitation that when the brachyura and macrura separated the primitive ancestors of each of these groups passed through a more complete metamorphosis and that the transition to the present mode of development belongs to a later period with regard to the brachyura it may be added that in them this transition occurred only a little later and indeed before the existing families separated the arrangement of the processes of the carapace and still more the similar number of the caudal set in the most different zo of crabs figs 1923 prove this such an accordance in the number of organs apparently so unimportant is only explicable by common inheritance we may predict with certainty that amongst the brachyura no species will occur which like penus still produces naupliusbrood3 as we have already seen mysis and the isopoda depart from all other crustacea very remarkably by the fact that their embryos are curved upwards instead of as elsewhere downwards does not so isolated a phenomenon as this it might be asked in the sense of darwins theory indicate a common inheritance does it not necessitate that we should unite as the descendants of the same primitive ancestors mysis with the isopoda on the one hand and on the other the rest of the podophthalma with the amphipoda i think not such a necessity exists only for those who estimate a peculiarity at a higher value because it makes its appearance at an earlier period of the egglife whoever regards species as not created independently and unchangeably but as having gradually become what they are will say to himself that when the ancestors of our mysides came probably much later than those of the amphipoda and isopoda to develop numerous bodysegments and limbs whilst still embryos as they could no longer find room in the egg when extended straight out and were therefore compelled to bend themselves this could only take place either upwards or downwards and whatever conditions may have decided the direction actually adopted any near relationship to either of the two orders of edriophthalma could hardly have taken part in it it may however be remarked that the different curvature of the embryo in the amphipoda and isopoda is so far instructive as it proves that their present mode of development was adopted only after the separation of these orders and that in the primitive stock of the edriophthalma the embryos were if not nauplii at least short enough in the body to find room in the egg in an extended position like the larv of achtheres enclosed by the naupliusskin on the other hand the uniformity of development that prevails in each of the two orderswhich is expressed in the amphipoda for example in the formation of the micropylar apparatus in the isopoda in the want of the last pair of ambulatory feettestifies that the present mode of development has come down from a very early period and extends back beyond the separation of the present families in these two orders also as well as in the crabs we can hardly hope to find traces of earlier young states unless it be in the family of the tanaid4 if any one will furnish me with an amphipod or an isopod with naupliusbrood the existence of which would not be more remarkable in independently produced species than that of a prawn with naupliusbrood i will abandon the whole darwinian theory with regard to the crabs and also to the isopoda and amphipoda we were led to the assumption that about the period when these groups started from the common stem a simplification of their process of development took place this also seems to be intelligible from darwins theory when any circumstances favourable to a group of animals caused its wider diffusion and divergence into forms adapting themselves to new and various conditions of existence this greater variability which betrays itself in the production of new forms will also favour the simplification of the development which is almost always advantageous and moreover exactly at this period during adaptation to new circumstances as has already been indicated with regard to freshwater animals this simplification will be doubly beneficial and therefore in connexion with this a doubly strict selection will take place so much for the development of the higher crustacea a closer examination of the developmental history of the lower crustacea is unnecessary after what has been said in general upon the historical significance of the young states and the application of this which has just been made to the malacostraca we may see without further discussion how the representation given by claus of the development of the copepoda may pass almost word for word as the primitive history of those animals we may find in the naupliusskin of the larv of achtheres and in the egglike larva of cryptophialus precisely similar traces of a transition towards direct development as were presented by the naupliusenvelope of the embryos of mysis and the maggotlike larva of ligia etc it will be sufficient to indicate an essential difference in the process of development in the higher and lower crustacea in the latter all new bodysegments and limbs which insert themselves between the two terminal regions of the nauplius are formed in uninterrupted sequence from before backwards in the former there is further a new formation in the middle of the body the middlebody which pushes itself in between the forebody and the abdomen in the same way as these have done on their part between the head and tail of the nauplius thus that which appears probable even from the comparison of the limbs of the adult animal finds fresh support in the developmental history namely that the lower crustacea like the insects are entirely destitute of the region of the body corresponding to the middlebody of the malacostraca it seems probable that the swimming feet of the copepoda as also of the pup of cirripedia and rhizocephala represent the abdominal feet of the malacostraca that is to say are derived by inheritance from the same source with them it would be easy to weave together the separate threads furnished by the young forms of the various crustacea into a general picture of the primitive history of this class such a picture drawn with a little skill and finished in lively colours would certainly be more attractive than the dry discussions which i have tacked on to the developmental history of these animals but the mode of weaving in the loose threads would still in many cases be arbitrary and to be effected with equal justice in various ways and many gaps would still have to be filled up by means of more or less bold assumptions those who have not wandered much in this region of research would then readily believe that they were standing upon firm ground where mere fancy had thrown an airy bridge those acquainted with the subject on the other hand would soon find out these weak points in the structure but would then be easily led to regard even what was founded upon well considered facts as merely floating in the air to obviate these misconceptions of its true contents from either side it would be necessary to accompany such a picture throughout with lengthy dry explanations this has deterred me from further filling in the outline which i had already sketched i will only give as an example the probable history of the production of a single group of crustacea and indeed of the most abnormal of all the rhizocephala which in the sexually mature state differ so enormously even from their nearest allies the cirripedia and from their peculiar mode of nourishment stand quite alone in the entire animal kingdom i must preface this with a few words upon the homology of the roots of the rhizocephala ie the tubules which penetrate from its point of adhesion into the body of the host ramify amongst the viscera of the latter and terminate in ccal branchlets in the pup of the rhizocephala fig 58 the foremost limbs prehensile antenn bear on each of the two terminal joints a tonguelike thinskinned appendage in which we may generally observe a few small strongly refractive granules like those seen in the roots of the adult animal i have therefore supposed these appendages to be the rudiments of the future roots a perfectly similar appendage a most delicate tube or ribbon was found by darwin in freeswimming pup of lepas australis on the last joints of the prehensile antenn from the perfect accordance in their entire structure shown by the pup of the rhizocephala and cirripedia there can be no doubt that the appendages of sacculina and lepas which are so like each other and spring from the same spot are homologous structures now in three species of lepas in dichelaspis warwickii and in scalpellum peronii darwin saw on tearing recentlyaffixed animals from their point or support that a long narrow band issued from the same point of the antenn its end was torn away and in dichelaspis judging from its ragged appearance it had attached itself firmly to the support from this it follows that this appendage in lepas australis can hardly be anything but a young cementduct if therefore the supposition that the appendages on the antenn of the pup of rhizocephala are young roots be correct the roots of the rhizocephala are homologous with the cementducts of the cirripedia and this strange as it may appear at the first glance seems to me scarcely doubtful it is true that the act of adhesion of the rhizocephala has never yet been observed but it is more than probable that they attach themselves just like the cirripedia by means of the antenn and that therefore the points of attachment in the two groups indicate homologous parts of the body from the point of attachment in the rhizocephala the roots penetrate into the body of the host whilst in the cirripedia the cementducts issue from the same point the roots are blind tubes ramified in different ways in different species the cementducts in the basis of the balanid likewise constitute a generally remarkably complicated system of ramified tubes with regard to the mode of termination of which nothing certain has yet been made out individual ccal branches are not unfrequently seen even in the vicinity of the carina and at least in some species in which the cementducts divide into extremely numerous and fine branchlets forming a network which gradually becomes denser towards the circumference of the basis these seem nowhere to possess an orifice now as to the question how were cirripedia converted by natural selection into rhizocephala a considerable number of existing cirripedia settle exclusively or chiefly upon living animalson sponges corals mollusks cetaceans turtles seasnakes sharks crustaceans sea urchins and even on acalephs dichelaspis darwinii was found by filippi in the branchial cavity of palinurus vulgaris and i have met with another species of the same genus in the branchial cavity of lupea diacantha the same thing may have taken place in primitive times the supposition that certain cirripedes might once upon a time have selected the soft ventral surface of a crab porcellana or pagurus for its dwellingplace has certainly nothing improbable about it if then the cementducts of such a cirripede instead of merely spreading on the surface pierced or pushed before them the soft ventral skin and penetrated into the interior of the host this must have been beneficial to the animal because it would be thereby more securely attached and protected from being thrown off during the moulting of its host variations in this direction were preserved as advantageous but as soon as the cementducts penetrated into the bodycavity of the host and were bathed by its fluids an endosmotic interchange must necessarily have been set up between the materials dissolved in these fluids and in the contents of the cementducts and this interchange could not be without influence upon the nourishment of the parasite the new source of nourishment opened up in this manner was as constantly flowing more certain than that offered by the nourishment accidentally whirled into the mouth of the sedentary animal the individuals favoured in the development of the cementducts now converted into nutriferous roots had more than others the prospect of abundant food of vigorous growth and of producing a numerous progeny with the further development assisted by natural selection of the roots embracing the intestine of the host and spreading amongst its hepatic tubes the introduction of nourishment through the mouth and all the parts implicated in it such as the whirling cirri the buccal organs and the intestine gradually lost their importance became aborted by disuse and finally disappeared without leaving a trace of their existence protected by the abdomen of the crab or by the shell inhabited by the pagurus the parasite also no longer required the calcareous test in which no doubt the first cirripedes settling upon these decapods rejoiced this protective covering having become superfluous also disappeared and there remained at last only a soft sack filled with eggs without limbs without mouth or alimentary canal and nourished like a plant by means of roots which it pushed into the body of its host the cirripede had become a rhizocephalon if it be desired to form a notion of what our parasite may have looked like when half way in its progress from the one form to the other we may consult the figures given by darwin lepadid pl iv figs 17 of anelasma squalicola this lepadide which lives upon sharks in the north sea seems in fact to be in the best way to lose its cirri and buccal organs in the same manner the widelycleft shellless test is supported upon a thick peduncle which is immersed in the skin of the shark the surface of the peduncle is beset with muchramified hollow filaments which penetrate the sharks flesh like roots darwin darwin looked in vain for cementglands and cement it seems to me hardly doubtful that the ramified hollow filaments are themselves nothing but the cementducts converted into nutritive roots and that it is just in consequence of the development of this new source of nourishment that the cirri and buccal organs are in the highest degree aborted all the parts of the mouth are extremely minute the palpi and exterior maxill have almost disappeared the cirri are thick inarticulate and destitute of bristles and the muscles both of the mouth and cirri are without transverse striation darwin found the stomach perfectly empty in the animal examined by him having reached the nauplius the extreme outpost of the class retiring furthest into the gray mist of primitive time we naturally look round us to see whether ways may not be descried thence towards other bordering regions by the structure of the abdomen in nauplius we might be reminded like oscar schmidt of the moveable caudal fork of the rotatoria which many regard as near allies of the crustacea or at any rate of the arthropoda in the six feet surrounding the mouth we might imagine an originally radiate structure and so forth but i can see nothing certain even towards the nearer provinces of the myriopoda and arachnida i can find no bridge for the insecta alone the development of the malacostraca may perhaps present a point of union like many zo the insecta possess three pairs of limbs serving for the reception of nourishment and three pairs serving for locomotion like the zo they have an abdomen without appendages as in all zo the mandibles in insects are destitute of palpi certainly but little in common compared with the much which distinguishes these two animalforms nevertheless the supposition that the insecta had for their common ancestor a zoa which raised itself into a life on land may be recommended for further examination much in what has been adduced above may be erroneous many an interpretation may have failed and many a fact may not have been placed in its proper light but in one thing i hope i have succeededin convincing unprejudiced readers that darwins theory furnishes the key of intelligibility for the developmental history of the crustacea as for so many other facts inexplicable without it the deficiencies of this attempt therefore must not be laid to the charge of the plan drawn out by the sure hand of the master but solely to the clumsiness of the workman who did not know how to find the proper place for every portion of his material 1 it is well known that in many cases even in adult animals the last segment of the middlebody or some of its last segments either want their limbs or are themselves deficient entoniscus porcellan male leucifer etc this might be due to the animals having separated from the common stem before these limbs were formed at all but in those cases with which i am best acquainted it seems to me more probable that the limbs have been subsequently lost again that these particular limbs and segments are more easily lost than others is explained by the circumstance that as the youngest they have been less firmly fixed by longcontinued inheritance mr dana believes that in ordinary crustaceans the abortion of the segments with their appendages almost always takes place at the posterior end of the cephalothoraxdarwin balanid page 111 2 persephone a rare crab belonging to the family leucosiid is served in the same manner by its long chelate feet if we seize the animal it extends them most obstinately straight downwards so that in all probability we should more easily break than bend them 3 i must not omit remarking that what has been said as to the development of the crabs applies essentially only to the groups cyclometopa catometopa and oxyrhyncha placed together by alph milneedwards as eustoms among the oxystomata as also among the anomura apterura edw which approach so nearly to the crabs i am unacquainted with the earliest young states of any of the species 4 whether the want of the abdominal feet in the young of tanais be an inheritance from the time of the primitive isopoda or a subsequently acquired peculiarity which appears to me the more admissible view at present may perhaps be decided with some certainty when we become acquainted with the development and mode of life of its family allies apseudes and rha the latter as is well known is the only isopod which possesses a secondary flagellum on the anterior antenn i have recently obtained a new and unexpected proof that the tanaid asellotes htropodes medw of all known crustacea approach most closely to the primitive form of the edriophthalma mr c spence bate writes to me apseudes as far as i know is the only isopod in which the antennal scale so common in the macrura is present on the lower antenna

anyone for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support project gutenberg ebooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the us unless a copyright notice is included thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition most people start at our website which has the main pg search facility wwwgutenbergorg this website includes information about project gutenberg including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation how to help produce our new ebooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks
