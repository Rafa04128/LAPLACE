madras shanghai humphrey milford publisher to the university preface the mass of existing material on this subject is so great that i have not attempted to make a survey of the whole of european witchcraft but have confined myself to an intensive study of the cult in great britain in order however to obtain a clearer understanding of the ritual and beliefs i have had recourse to french and flemish sources as the cult appears to have been the same throughout western europe the new england records are unfortunately not published in extenso this is the more unfortunate as the extracts already given to the public occasionally throw light on some of the english practices it is more difficult to trace the english practices than the scotch or french for in england the cult was already in a decadent condition when the records were made therefore records in a purely english colony would probably contain much of interest the sources from which the information is taken are the judicial records and contemporary chroniclers in the case of the chroniclers i have studied their facts and not their opinions i have also had access to some unpublished trials among the edinburgh justiciary records and also in the guernsey greffe the following articles have already appeared in various journals to whose editors i am indebted for kind permission to republish organization of witch societies

by prof a j clark 279 bibliography 281 general index 286 introduction the subject of witches and witchcraft has always suffered from the biassed opinions of the commentators both contemporary and of later date on the one hand are the writers who having heard the evidence at first hand believe implicitly in the facts and place upon them the unwarranted construction that those facts were due to supernatural power on the other hand are the writers who taking the evidence on hearsay and disbelieving the conclusions drawn by their opponents deny the facts in toto both parties believed with equal firmness in a personal devil and both supported their arguments with quotations from the bible but as the believers were able to bring forward more texts than the unbelievers and had in their hands an unanswerable argument in the witch of endor the unbelievers who dared not contradict the word of god were forced to fall back on the theory that the witches suffered from hallucination hysteria and to use the modern word autosuggestion these two classes still persist the sceptic predominating between the believer who believed everything and the unbeliever who disbelieved everything there has been no critical examination of the evidence which presents a new and untouched field of research to the student of comparative religion among the believers in witchcraft everything which could not be explained by the knowledge at their disposal was laid to the credit of supernatural powers and as everything incomprehensible is usually supposed to emanate from evil the witches were believed to be possessed of devilish arts as also every nonchristian god was in the eyes of the christian the opponent of the christian god the witches were considered to worship the enemy of salvation in other words the devil the greater number of these writers however obtained the evidence at first hand and it must therefore be accepted although the statements do not bear the construction put upon them it is only by a careful comparison with the evidence of anthropology that the facts fall into their proper places and an organized religion stands revealed the common beliefs as to the powers of the witches are largely due to the credulous contemporary commentators who misunderstood the evidence and then exaggerated some of the facts to suit their preconceived ideas of the supernatural powers of the witches thereby laying themselves open to the ridicule of all their opponents past and present yet the ridicule is not fully deserved for the facts are there though the explanation is wrong for even the two points which are usually considered the ultimate proof of the absurdity and incredibility of the whole systemthe flying on a broomstick through the window or up the chimney and the transformation into animalsare capable of explanation the first can be accounted for when the form of early mounddwellings is taken into consideration and when it is remembered that among savage tribes there are often taboos connected with the door the twofaced god being essentially a deity of the door besides this the fertility rites connected with the broom should be taken into account the second should be compared with similar accounts of transformation into animals among the cults of other nations mr a b cooks comment on the greek ritual applies quite as well to western as to eastern europe we may venture on the general statement that within the bounds of hellenic mythology animalmetamorphosis commonly points to a preceding animal cult1 it is interesting to note the class of mind among those contemporary writers who believed in the reality of the facts confessed at the trials as compared with those who disbelieved it will be seen that the most brilliant minds the keenest intellects the greatest investigators were among the believers bodin lord bacon raleigh boyle cudworth selden henry more sir thomas browne matthew hale sir george mackenzie and many others most of whom had heard the evidence at first hand the sceptics were weyer pupil of the occultist cornelius agrippa reginald scot a kentish country squire filmer whose name was a byword for political bigotry wagstaffe who went mad from drink and webster a fanatical preacher2 the sceptics with the exception of weyer appear to have had little or no firsthand evidence their only weapon was an appeal to common sense and sentiment combined their only method was a flat denial of every statement which appeared to point to supernatural powers they could not disprove the statements they could not explain them without opposing the accepted religious beliefs of their time and so weakening their cause by exposing themselves to the serious charge of atheism therefore they denied evidence which in the case of any other accusation would have been accepted as proof the evidence which i now bring forward is taken entirely from contemporary sources ie the legal records of the trials pamphlets giving accounts of individual witches and the works of inquisitors and other writers i have omitted the opinions of the authors and have examined only the recorded facts without however including the stories of ghosts and other occult phenomena with which all the commentators confuse the subject i have also for the reason given below omitted all reference to charms and spells when performed by one witch alone and have confined myself to those statements only which show the beliefs organization and ritual of a hitherto unrecognized cult in order to clear the ground i make a sharp distinction between operative witchcraft and ritual witchcraft under operative witchcraft i class all charms and spells whether used by a professed witch or by a professed christian whether intended for good or for evil for killing or for curing such charms and spells are common to every nation and country and are practised by the priests and people of every religion they are part of the common heritage of the human race and are therefore of no practical value in the study of any one particular cult ritual witchcraftor as i propose to call it the dianic cultembraces the religious beliefs and ritual of the people known in late mediaeval times as witches the evidence proves that underlying the christian religion was a cult practised by many classes of the community chiefly however by the more ignorant or those in the less thickly inhabited parts of the country it can be traced back to prechristian times and appears to be the ancient religion of western europe the god anthropomorphic or theriomorphic was worshipped in welldefined rites the organization was highly developed and the ritual is analogous to many other ancient rituals the dates of the chief festivals suggest that the religion belonged to a race which had not reached the agricultural stage and the evidence shows that various modifications were introduced probably by invading peoples who brought in their own beliefs i have not attempted to disentangle the various cults i am content merely to point out that it was a definite religion with beliefs ritual and organization as highly developed as that of any other cult in the world the deity of this cult was incarnate in a man a woman or an animal the animal form being apparently earlier than the human for the god was often spoken of as wearing the skin or attributes of an animal at the same time however there was another form of the god in the shape of a man with two faces such a god is found in italy where he was called janus or dianus in southern france see pp 62 129 and in the english midlands the feminine form of the name diana is found throughout western europe as the name of the female deity or leader of the socalled witches and it is for this reason that i have called this ancient religion the dianic cult the geographical distribution of the twofaced god suggests that the race or races who carried the cult either did not remain in every country which they entered or that in many places they and their religion were overwhelmed by subsequent invaders the dates of the two chief festivals may eve and november eve indicate the use of a calendar which is generally acknowledged to be preagricultural and earlier than the solstitial division of the year the fertility rites of the cult bear out this indication as they were for promoting the increase of animals and only rarely for the benefit of the crops the crossquarterdays february 2 and august 1 which were also kept as festivals were probably of later date as though classed among the great festivals they were not of so high an importance as the may and november eves to february 2 candlemas day probably belongs the suncharm of the burning wheel formed by the whirling dancers each carrying a blazing torch but no special ceremony seems to be assigned to august 1 lammas day a fact suggestive of a later introduction of this festival the organization of the hierarchy was the same throughout western europe with the slight local differences which always occur in any organization the same organization when carried to america caused cotton mather to say the witches are organized like congregational churches this gives the clue at once in each congregational church there is a body of elders who manage the affairs of the church and the minister who conducts the religious services and is the chief person in religious matters and there may also be a specially appointed person to conduct the services in the ministers absence each church is an independent entity and not necessarily connected with any other in the same way there was among the witches a body of eldersthe covenwhich managed the local affairs of the cult and a man who like the minister held the chief place though as god that place was infinitely higher in the eyes of the congregation than any held by a mere human being in some of the larger congregations there was a person inferior to the chief who took charge in the chiefs absence in southern france however there seems to have been a grand master who was supreme over several districts the position of the chief woman in the cult is still somewhat obscure professor pearson sees in her the mothergoddess worshipped chiefly by women this is very probable but at the time when the cult is recorded the worship of the male deity appears to have superseded that of the female and it is only on rare occasions that the god appears in female form to receive the homage of the worshippers as a general rule the womans position when divine is that of the familiar or substitute for the male god there remains however the curious fact that the chief woman was often identified with the queen of faerie or the elfin queen as she is sometimes called this connexion of the witches and fairies opens up a very wide field at present it is little more than speculation that the two are identical but there is promise that the theory may be proved at some later date when the subject is more fully worked out it is now a commonplace of anthropology that the tales of fairies and elves preserve the tradition of a dwarf race which once inhabited northern and western europe successive invasions drove them to the less fertile parts of each country which they inhabited some betook themselves to the inhospitable north or the equally inhospitable mountains some however remained in the open heaths and moors living as mounddwellers venturing out chiefly at night and coming in contact with the ruling races only on rare occasions as the conqueror always regards the religion of the conquered as superior to his own in the arts of evil magic the dwarf race obtained the reputation of wizards and magicians and their god was identified by the conquerors with the principle of evil the identification of the witches with the dwarf or fairy race would give us a clear insight into much of the civilization of the early european peoples especially as regards their religious ideas the religious rites varied according to circumstances and the requirements of the people the greater number of the ceremonies appear to have been practised for the purpose of securing fertility of these the sexual ritual has been given an overwhelming and quite unwarranted importance in the trials for it became an obsession with the christian judges and recorders to investigate the smallest and most minute details of the rite though in late examples the ceremony had possibly degenerated into a bacchanalian orgy there is evidence to prove that like the same rite in other countries it was originally a ceremonial magic to ensure fertility there is at present nothing to show how much of the witches mass in which the bread the wine and the candles were black derived from the christian ritual and how much belonged to the dianic cult it is however possible that the witches service was the earlier form and influenced the christian the admission ceremonies were often elaborate and it is here that the changes in the religion are most clearly marked certain ceremonies must have been introduced when another cult was superimposed and became paramount such as the specific renunciation of a previous religion which was obligatory on all new candidates and the payment to the member who brought a new recruit into the fold the other ritesthe feasts and dancesshow that it was a joyous religion and as such it must have been quite incomprehensible to the gloomy inquisitors and reformers who suppressed it much stress has always been laid by the sceptical writers on the undoubted fact that in many cases the witch confused dreams with reality and believed that she had visited the sabbath when credible witnesses could prove that she had slept in her bed all the time yet such visions are known in other religions christians have met their lord in dreams of the night and have been accounted saints for that very reason mahomed though not released from the body had interviews with allah moses talked with god the egyptian pharaohs record similar experiences to the devotee of a certain temperament such visions occur and it is only to be expected that in every case the vision should take the form required by the religion of the worshipper hence the christian sees christ and enters heaven mahomed was caught up to the paradise of the true believers the anthropomorphic jehovah permitted only a back view to his votary the egyptian pharaohs beheld their gods alive and moving on the earth the witch also met her god at the actual sabbath and again in her dreams for that earthly sabbath was to her the true paradise where there was more pleasure than she could express and she believed also that the joy which she took in it was but the prelude to a much greater glory for her god so held her heart that no other desire could enter in thus the witches often went to the gibbet and the stake glorifying their god and committing their souls into his keeping with a firm belief that death was but the entrance to an eternal life in which they would never be parted from him fanatics and visionaries as many of them were they resemble those christian martyrs whom the witchpersecutors often held in the highest honour another objection is that as the evidence of the witches at the trials is more or less uniform in character it must be attributed to the publication by the inquisitors of a questionary for the use of all judges concerned in such trials in short that the evidence is valueless as it was given in answer to leading questions no explanation is offered by the objectors as to how the inquisitors arrived at the form of questionary nor is any regard given to the injunction to all inquisitors to acquaint themselves with all the details of any heresy which they were commissioned to root out they were to obtain the information from those who would recant and use it against the accused and to instruct other judges in the belief and ritual of the heresy so that they also might recognize it and act accordingly the objectors also overlook the fact that the believers in any given religion when tried for their faith exhibit a sameness in their accounts of the cult usually with slight local differences had the testimony of the witches as to their beliefs varied widely it would be prima facie evidence that there was no welldefined religion underlying their ritual but the very uniformity of their confessions points to the reality of the occurrence still another objection is that the evidence was always given under torture and that the wretched victims consequently made reckless assertions and accusations in most of the english and many of the scotch trials legal torture was not applied and it was only in the seventeenth century that pricking for the mark starvation and prevention of sleep were used even then there were many voluntary confessions given by those who like the early christian martyrs rushed headlong on their fate determined to die for their faith and their god yet even if some of the evidence were given under torture and in answer to leading questions there still remains a mass of details which cannot be explained away among others there are the close connexions of the witches with the fairies the persistence of the number thirteen in the covens the narrow geographical range of the domestic familiar the avoidance of certain forms in the animal transformations the limited number of personal names among the womenwitches and the survival of the names of some of the early gods in england the legal method of executing a witch was by hanging after death the body was burnt and the ashes scattered in scotland as a rule the witch was strangled at the stake and the body burned but there are several records of the culprit being sentenced to burning alive in france burning alive was the invariable punishment in cases where popular fury unrestrained by the law worked its own vengeance on individuals horrible scenes occurred but these were the exception and examining only the legal aspect of the subject it will be found that witches had a fair trial according to the methods of the period and that their punishment was according to the law there was however one popular method of dealing with a person accused of witchcraft which is interesting as showing the survival of a legal process obsolete as regards the law itself but remaining in full force among the people this is the ordeal by water in the laws of athelstan the full detail of this ordeal is given after the person who was to undergo the ordeal had been prepared by prayer and fasting he was tied the right thumb to the right big toe the left thumb to the left big toe and was then cast into the water with suitable prayers to the almighty to declare the right if he sank he was considered innocent if he floated he was guilty the witch was tried in the same way except that she was tied crossways ie the right thumb to the left big toe and the left thumb to the right big toe so great was the belief in this test that many women accused of witchcraft insisted on undergoing this ordeal which was often conducted with solemnity and decency under the auspices of the minister of the parish and other grave persons unless there was strong feeling against the woman for other reasons the mere fact of her floating did not rouse the populace against her and she merely returned home widow coman for instance was ducked on three separate occasions at her own request the theologians of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were greatly exercised by the conclusive evidence which proved that people known to be devout and professing christians had been present at the sabbath joined in the ceremonies and worshipped the witches god the inquisitors recognized the fact and devote many pages of their books to the discussion of the course to be followed in the case of christian priests coming finally to the conclusion that if a priest merely went to the sabbath but was not in any way in an official position there his sacred character preserved him from evil the theologians of the reformed churches who could not accept the sanctity of the priesthood with the same ease and were also desirous of finding some means of accounting for the presence of the devout laity boldly evolved the theory that the devil could for his own purposes assume the shape of good christians in order to mislead the witches by this plea the accused often succeeded in escaping when the examiners were religious ministers but it was of no value to them when the trial was in a court of law and the fact of their presence at an illegal assembly was proved lord cokes definition of a witch summed up the law on the subject a witch is a person who hath conference with the devil to consult with him or to do some act and any person proved to have had such conference was thus convicted of a capital offence and sentenced accordingly this accounts for the fact commented on by all students of witchtrials that a witch was often condemned even though she had invariably used her skill for good and not for evil for healing the sick not for casting sickness if it were proved that she had obtained her knowledge from the devil she had broken the law and must die footnotes footnote 1 journal of hellenic studies 1894 p 160 the italics are in the original footnote 2 see james crossleys introduction to pottss discoverie of witchcraft chetham society pp vxii i continuity of the religion of the ancient religion of prechristian britain there are few written records but it is contrary to all experience that a cult should die out and leave no trace immediately on the introduction of a new religion the socalled conversion of britain meant the conversion of the rulers only the mass of the people continued to follow their ancient customs and beliefs with a veneer of christian rites the centuries brought a deepening of christianity which introduced from above gradually penetrated downwards through one class after another during this process the laws against the practice of certain heathen rites became more strict as christianity grew in power the church tried her strength against witches in high places and was victorious and in the fifteenth century open war was declared against the last remains of heathenism in the famous bull of innocent viii this heathenism was practised only in certain places and among certain classes of the community in other places the ancient ritual was either adopted into or tolerated by the church and the maypole dances and other rustic festivities remained as survivals of the rites of the early cult whether the religion which survived as the witch cult was the same as the religion of the druids or whether it belonged to a still earlier stratum is not clear though the descriptions of classical authors are rather too vague and scanty to settle such a point sufficient remains to show that a fertility cult did once exist in these islands akin to similar cults in the ancient world such rites would not be suppressed by the tribes who entered great britain after the withdrawal of the romans a continuance of the cult may therefore be expected among the people whom the christian missionaries laboured to convert as the early historical records of these islands were made by christian ecclesiastics allowance must be made for the religious bias of the writers which caused them to make christianity appear as the only religion existing at the time but though the historical records are silent on the subject the laws and enactments of the different communities whether lay or ecclesiastical retain very definite evidence of the continuance of the ancient cults in this connexion the dates of the conversion of england are instructive the following table gives the principal dates 597604 augustines mission london still heathen conversion of thelbert king of kent after thelberts death christianity suffered a reverse 604 conversion of the king of the east saxons whose successor lapsed 627 conversion of the king of northumbria 628 conversion of the king of east anglia 631651 aidans missions 635 conversion of the king of wessex 653 conversion of the king of mercia 654 reconversion of the king of the east saxons 681 conversion of the king of the south saxons an influx of heathenism occurred on two later occasions in the ninth century there was an invasion by the heathen danes under guthrum and in the eleventh century the heathen king cnut led his hordes to victory as in the case of the saxon kings of the seventh century guthrum and cnut were converted and the tribes followed their leaders example professed christianity and were baptized but it cannot be imagined that these wholesale conversions were more than nominal in most cases though the kings religion was outwardly the tribes religion if as happened among the east saxons the king forsook his old gods returned to them again and finally forsook them altogether the tribe followed his lead and in public at least worshipped christ odin or any other deity whom the king favoured for the moment but there can be hardly any doubt that in private the mass of the people adhered to the old religion to which they were accustomed this tribal conversion is clearly marked when a heathen king married a christian queen or vice versa and it must also be noted that a king never changed his religion without careful consultation with his chief men3 an example of the two religions existing side by side is found in the account of redwald king of the east saxons who in the same temple had an altar to sacrifice to christ and another small one to offer victims to devils4 the continuity of the ancient religion is proved by the references to it in the classical authors the ecclesiastical laws and other legal and historical records 1st cent

cent joan of arc burnt as a witch 1431 gilles de rais executed as a witch 1440 bernardo di bosco 1457 sent by pope calixtus iii to suppress the witches in brescia and its neighbourhood bull of pope innocent viii 1484 it has come to our ears that numbers of both sexes do not avoid to have intercourse with demons incubi and succubi and that by their sorceries and by their incantations charms and conjurations they suffocate extinguish and cause to perish the births of women the increase of animals the corn of the ground the grapes of the vineyard and the fruit of the trees as well as men women flocks herds and other various kinds of animals vines and apple trees grass corn and other fruits of the earth making and procuring that men and women flocks and herds and other animals shall suffer and be tormented both from within and without so that men beget not nor women conceive and they impede the conjugal action of men and women it will be seen by the foregoing that so far from the bull of pope innocent viii being the beginning of the outbreak of witchcraft as so many modern writers consider it is only one of many ordinances against the practices of an earlier cult it takes no account of the effect of these practices on the morals of the people who believed in them but lays stress only on their power over fertility the fertility of human beings animals and crops in short it is exactly the pronouncement which one would expect from a christian against a heathen form of religion in which the worship of a god of fertility was the central idea it shows therefore that the witches were considered to deal with fertility only looked upon in the light of a fertility cult the ritual of the witches becomes comprehensible originally for the promotion of fertility it became gradually degraded into a method for blasting fertility and thus the witches who had been once the means of bringing prosperity to the people and the land by driving out all evil influences in process of time were looked upon as being themselves the evil influences and were held in horror accordingly the actual feelings of the witches towards their religion have been recorded in very few cases but they can be inferred from the few records which remain the earliest example is from lorraine in 1408 lequel mfait les susdites dames disoient et confessoient avoir endur leur contentement et

twentytwo years old one day told me no said she i will not be other than i am i find too much content in my condition23 though the english and scotch witches opinions are not reported it is clear from the evidence that they were the same as those of the bassespyrnes for not only did they join of their own free will but in many cases there seems to have been no need of persuasion in a great number of trials when the witches acknowledged that they had been asked to become members of the society there follows an expression of this sort ye freely and willingly accepted and granted thereto and that they held to their god as firmly as those de lancre put to death is equally evident in view of the north berwick witches of rebecca west and rose hallybread who dyed very stuburn and refractory without any remorss or seeming terror of conscience for their abominable witchcraft24 major weir who perished as a witch renouncing all hope of heaven25 and the northampton witches agnes browne and her daughter who were never heard to pray or to call vppon god never asking pardon for their offences either of god or the world in this their dangerous and desperate resolution dyed elinor shaw and mary phillips at their execution being desired to say their prayers they both set up a very loud laughter calling for the devil to come and help them in such a blasphemous manner as is not fit to mention so that the sherif seeing their presumptious impenitence caused them to be executed with all the expedition possible even while they were cursing and raving and as they livd the devils true factors so they resolutely dyed in his service the rest of the coven also died without any confession or contrition26 footnotes footnote 3 hunt vol i footnote 4 bede bk ii ch xv footnote 5 strabo

witches of northamptonshire p 8 ii the god 1 as god it is impossible to understand the witchcult without first understanding the position of the chief personage of that cult he was known to the contemporary christian judges and recorders as the devil and was called by them satan lucifer beelzebub the foul fiend the enemy of salvation and similar names appropriate to the principle of evil the devil of the scriptures with whom they identified him this was far from the view of the witches themselves to them this socalled devil was god manifest and incarnate they adored him on their knees they addressed their prayers to him they offered thanks to him as the giver of food and the necessities of life they dedicated their children to him and there are indications that like many another god he was sacrificed for the good of his people the contemporary writers state in so many words that the witches believed in the divinity of their master danaeus writing in 1575 says the diuell comaundeth them that they shall acknowledge him for their god cal vpo him pray to him and trust in himthen doe they all repeate the othe which they haue geuen vnto him in acknowledging him to be their god27 gaule in 1646 nearly a century later says that the witches vow to take him the devil for their god worship invoke obey him28 the witches are even more explicit and their evidence proves the belief that their master was to them their god the accusation against elisabeth vlamyncx of alost 1595 was that vous navez pas eu honte de vous agenouiller devant votre belzebuth que vous avez ador29 the same accusation was made against marion grant of aberdeen 1596 that the deuill quhome thow callis thy god causit the worship him on thy kneis as thy lord30 de lancre 1609 records as did all the inquisitors the actual words of the witches when they presented a young child they fell on their knees and said grand seigneur lequel iadore and when the child was old enough to join the society she made her vow in these words ie me remets de tout poinct en ton pouuoir entre tes mains ne recognois autre dieu si bien que tu es mon dieu31 silvain nevillon tried at orleans in 1614 said on dit au diable nous vous recognoissons pour nostre maistre nostre dieu nostre createur32 the lancashire witch margaret johnson 1633 said there appeared vnto her a spirit or divell in the similitude and proportion of a man and the said divell or spirit bidd her call him by the name of mamillion and saith that in all her talke and conferense shee calleth her said divell mamillion my god33 according to madame bourignon 1661 persons who were thus engaged to the devil by a precise contract will allow no other god but him34 isobel gowdie confessed that he maid vs beliew that ther wes no god besyd himwe get all this power from the divell and when ve seik it from him ve call him owr lordat each tyme quhan ve wold meitt with him we behoowit to ryse and mak our curtesie and we wold say ye ar welcom owr lord and how doe ye my lord35 the yorkshire witch alice huson 1664 stated that the devil appeared like a black man upon a black horse with cloven feet and then i fell down and did worship him upon my knees36 ann armstrong in northumberland 1673 gave a good deal of information about her fellow witches the said ann baites hath severall times danced with the divell att the places aforesaid calling him sometimes her protector and other sometimes her blessed saviourshe saw forster dryden and thompson and the rest and theire protector which they calld their god sitting at the head of the tablewhen this informer used meanes to avoyd theire company they threatned her if she would not turne to theire god the last shift should be the worst37 at crighton 1678 the devil himself preached to the witches and most blasphemously mocked them if they offered to trust in god who left them miserable in the world and neither he nor his son jesus christ ever appeared to them when they called on them as he had who would not cheat them38 even in america 1692 mary osgood the wife of capt osgood declared that the devil told her he was her god and that she should serve and worship him39 prayers were addressed to the master by his followers and in some instances the prayer was taught by him alice gooderidge of stapenhill in derbyshire 1597 herself a witch and the daughter of a witch was charged by sir humphrey ferrers with witchcraft about one michaels cow which cow when shee brake all thinges that they tied her in ranne to this alice gooderige her house scraping at the walls and windowes to haue come in her olde mother elizabeth wright tooke vpon her to help vpon condition that she might haue a peny to bestow vpon her god and so she came to the mans house kneeled downe before the cow crossed her with a sticke in the forehead and prayed to her god since which time the cow continued wel40 antide colas 1598 confessed that satan luy commda de le prier soir matin auant quelle saddonnat faire autre oeuure41 elizabeth sawyer the witch of edmonton 1621 was taught by the devil he asked of me to whom i prayed and i answered him to iesus christ and he charged me then to pray no more to iesus christ but to him the diuell and he the diuell taught me this prayer sanctibecetur nomen tuum amen42 part of the dittay against jonet rendall an orkney witch 1629 was that the devill appeirit to you quhom ye called wallimanindyttit and accusit for yt of your awne confessioune efter ye met your walliman upoun the hill ye cam to williame rendalls hous quha haid ane seik hors and promeised to

yor walliman43 the witches of east anglia 1645 also prayed ellen the wife of nicholas greenleife of barton in suffolke confessed that when she prayed she prayed to the devill and not to godrebecca west confessed that her mother prayed constantly and as the world thought very seriously but she said it was to the devil using these words oh my god my god meaning him and not the lord44 a good example of the change of the word god when used by the witch into the word devil when recorded by the christian writer is found at bute in 1662 jonet stewart declares that quhen alester mcnivan was lying sick that jonet morisone and ncwilliam being in her house the said jonet desyred ncwilliam to goe see the said allester the said ncwilliam lifting up her curcheffe said devill let him never be seene till i see him and devill let him never ryse ncwilliam was asked if she lifted up her curcheffe quhen jonet morisone desyred her to goe see alester mcnivan saying god let him never ryse till i goe see him45 2 as a human being a man the evidence of the witches makes it abundantly clear that the socalled devil was a human being generally a man occasionally a woman at the great sabbaths where he appeared in his grand array he was disguised out of recognition at the small meetings in visiting his votaries or when inducing a possible convert to join the ranks of the witchsociety he came in his own person usually dressed plainly in the costume of the period when in ordinary clothes he was indistinguishable from any other man of his own rank or age but the evidence suggests that he made himself known by some manual gesture by a password or by some token carried on his person the token seems to have been carried on the foot and was perhaps a specially formed boot or shoe or a footcovering worn under the shoe46 besides the grand master himself there was often a second devil younger than the chief there is no indication whatsoever as to the method of appointing the head of the witchcommunity but it seems probable that on the death of the principal devil the junior succeeded and that the junior was appointed from among the officers see chap vii this suggestion however does not appear to hold good where a woman was the chief for her second in command was always a man and often one well advanced in years the elderly men always seem to have had grey beards danaeus in 1575 summarizes the evidence and says of the devil he appeareth vnto them in likenesse of a man insomuch that it hapneth many tymes that among a great company of men the sorcerer only knoweth satan that is present when other doo not know him although they see another man but who or what he is they know not47 de lancre says on a obseru de tout temps que lors quil veut receuoir quelcun faire pacte auec luy il se presente tousiours en homme48 cooper states that the wizards and witches being met in a place and time appointed the devil appears to them in humane shape49 even a modern writer after studying the evidence acknowledges that the witches seem to have been undoubtedly the victims of unscrupulous and designing knaves who personated satan50 the witches not only described the personal appearance of the devil but often gave careful details as to his clothes such details are naturally fuller when given by the women than by the men englandjohn walsh of dorsetshire 1566 described the devil whom he called his familiar as sometymes like a man in all proportions sauing that he had clouen feete51 the lancashire witch anne chattox 1613 said a thing like a christian man did sundry times come to this examinate and requested this examinate to giue him her soule and in the end this examinate was contented to giue him her sayd soule shee being then in her owne house in the forrest of pendle wherevpon the deuill then in the shape of a man sayd to this examinate thou shalt want nothing elizabeth southerns of the same coven said that there met her this examinate a spirit or deuill in the shape of a boy the one halfe of his coate blacke and the other browne52 to margaret johnson one of the later lancashire witches 1633 there appeared a spirit or divell in the similitude and proportion of a man apparelled in a suite of black tyed about wth silke pointes53 the yarmouth witch 1644 when she was in bed heard one knock at her door and rising to her window she saw it being moonlight a tall black man there54 the essex witches 1645 agreed very fairly in their description of the man who came amongst them according to elizabeth clarke he appeared in the shape of a proper gentleman with a laced band having the whole proportion of a man he had oftentimes knocked at her dore in the night time and shee did arise open the dore and let him in rebecca weste gave evidence that the devil appeared in the likeness of a proper young man and rebecca jones said that the devil as a very handsome young man came to the door who asked how she did on another occasion she met the devil as shee was going to st osyth to sell butter in the form of a man in a ragged sute55 there are two accounts of the evidence given by the huntingdonshire witch joan wallis of keiston 1646 stearne says that she confessed the devill came to her in the likenesse of a man in blackish cloathing but had cloven feet davenports record is slightly different blackman came first to her about a twelvemoneth since like a man something ancient in blackish cloathes but he had ugly feet uncovered56 the evidence of the suffolk witches 16456 is to the same effect thomazine ratcliffe of shellie confessed that there came one in the likeness of a manone richmond a woman which lived at brampford confessed the devill appeared to her in the likenesse of a man called daniel the prophetone bush of barton widdow confessed that the devill appeared to her in the shape of a young black man57 all the covens of somerset 1664 were evidently under one chief he came to elizabeth style as a handsome man to elizabeth style anne bishop alice duke and mary penny as a man in black clothes with a little band to christian green in the shape of a man in blackish clothes and to mary and catherine green as a little man in black clothes with a little band58 to the yorkshire witch alice huson 1664 he appeared like a black man on a horse upon the moor and again like a black man upon a black horse with cloven feet59 abre grinset of dunwich in suffolk 1665 said he did appear in the form of a pretty handsom young man60 in northumberland 1673 ann armstrong said that she see the said ann forster with twelve others and a long black man rideing on a bay galloway as she thought which they calld there protector61 the devonshire witch susanna edwards 1682 enters into some detail she did meet with a gentleman in a field called the parsonage close in the town of biddiford and saith that his apparel was all of black upon which she did hope to have a piece of money of him whereupon the gentleman drawing near unto this examinant she did make a curchy or courtesy unto him as she did use to do to gentlemen being demanded what and who the gentleman she spake of was the said examinant answered and said that it was the devil62 in northamptonshire 1705 he came to mary phillips and elinor shaw as a tall black man63 scotlandthe earliest description is in the trial of bessie dunlop of lyne in ayrshire in 1576 and is one of the most detailed bessie never spoke of the person who appeared to her as the devil she invariably called him thom reid but he stood to her in the same relation that the devil stood to the witches and like the devil he demanded that she should believe on him she described him as ane honest wele elderlie man gray bairdit and had ane gray coitt with lumbart slevis of the auld fassoun ane pair of gray brekis and quhyte schankis gartanit aboue the kne ane blak bonet on his heid cloise behind and plane befoir with silkin laissis drawin throw the lippis thairof and ane quhyte wand in

in the visioune and forme of ane mr william sympsoune hir cousing and moderbrotherissone quha sche affermit wes ane grit scoller and doctor of medicin65 though the devil of north berwick 1590 appeared in disguise it is not only certain that he was a man but his identity can be determined barbara napier deposed that the devil wess with them in likeness of ane black man the devil start up in the pulpit like a mickle blak man with ane black beard sticking out like ane goats beard clad in ane blak tatie tattered gown and ane ewill favoured scull bonnet on his heid hauing ane black book in his hand agnes sampsons description in the official record was very brief he had on him ane gown and ane hat which were both black66 but melville who probably heard her evidence puts it more dramatically

handis and feit lyk the griffon67 john fian merely mentions that the first time the devil came he was clothed in white raiment68 the evidence from aberdeen 15967 points to there being two chiefs one

1630 alexander hamilton met the devil in the likeness of a black man72 at eymouth 1634 bessie bathgate was seen by two young men at 12 hours of even when all people are in their beds standing barelegged and in her sark valicot at the back of hir yard conferring with the devil who was in green cloaths73 manie haliburton of dirlton 1649 confessed that when her daughter was ill came the devill in licknes of a man to hir hous calling himselff a phisition74 he came also as a mediciner to sandie hunter in east lothian in 164975 in the same year he appeared as a black man to robert grieve an eminent warlock at lauder76 in the same year also janet brown was charged with having held a meeting with the devil appearing as a man at the back of broomhills77 among the alloa witches tried in 1658 margret duchall did freelie confes hir paction with the diwell how he appeared first to hir in the liknes of a man in broun cloathis and ane blak hat while kathren renny said that he first appeared to hir in the bodis medow in the liknes of a man with gray cloathis and ane blew cap78 the years 1661 and 1662 are notable in the annals of scotch witchcraft for the number of trials and the consequent mass of evidence including many descriptions of the grandmaster at forfar in 1661 helen guthrie said that at several meetings the devil was present in the shape of a black ironhued man katherine porter saw the divill and he had ane blacke plaid about him when issobell smyth was alone gathering heather hee appeared to hir alone lik ane braw gentleman and on another occasion like a light gentleman79 jonet watson of dalkeith also in 1661 said that the deivill apeired vnto her in the liknes of ane prettie boy in grein clothes shoe was at a meitting in newtoundein with the deavill who had grein clothes vpone him and ane blak hatt vpone his head80 in the same year an edinburgh coven was tried jonet ker was accused that as you wer comeing from edr to the park you mett

reported as regards matters which interested the recorder unfortunately the appearance of the devil was not one of these therefore isobel gowdies description is abbreviated to the following he was a meikle black roch man sometimes he had boots and sometimes shoes on his foot but still always his foot are forked and cloven82 at crook of devon in kinrossshire in the same year nine of the witches describe the men they saw for evidently there were two devils in this district isobel rutherford said that sathan was in the likness of a man with gray cloathes and ane blue bannet having ane beard

grieve sathan did first appear to yow like ane little man with ane blue bonnet on his head with rough gray cloaths on him83 marie lamont of innerkip also in 1662 said that the devil was in the likeness of a meikle black man and sung to them and they dancit he appeared again in the likeness of a black man with cloven featt84 at paisley in 1678 the girlwitch annabil stuart said that the devil in the shape of a black man came to her mothers house her brother john was more detailed in his description he observed one of the black mans feet to be cloven and that the black mans apparel was black and that he had a bluish band and handcuffs and that he had hogers85 on his legs without shoes margaret jackson of the same coven confirmed the description the black mans clothes were black and he had white handcuffs86 the clearest evidence is from an unpublished trial of 1678 among the records in the justiciary court in edinburgh margaret lowis declaires that about elevin years ago a man whom she thought to be ane englishman that cured diseases in the countrey called blank webb appeared to her in her own house and gave her a drink and told her that she would have children after the taking of that drink and declares that that man made her renunce her baptisme and declares that she thought that the man who made her doe these things wes the divill and that she has hade severall meitings with that man after she knew him to be the divill margaret smaill prisoner being examined anent the cryme of witchcraft depones that having come into the house of jannet borthvick in crightoun she saw a gentleman sitting with her and they desyred her to sitt down and having sitten down the gentleman drank to her and she drank to him and therefter the said jannet borthvick told her that that gentleman was the divill and declares that at her desyre she renunced her baptisme and gave herself to the divill at borrowstowness in 1679 annaple thomson had a metting with the devill in your cwming betwixt linlithgow and borrowstownes where the devil in the lyknes of ane black man told yow that yow wis ane poore puddled bodie and yow the said annaple had ane other metting and he inveitted yow to go alongst and drink with him the same devil met margaret hamilton and conversed with yow at the townwell of borrowstownes and several tymes in yowr awin howss and drank severall choppens of ale with you87 the renfrewshire trials of 1696 show that all mrs fultons grandchildren saw the same personage elizabeth anderson at the age of seven saw a black grim man go in to her grandmothers house james lindsay aged fourteen met his grandmother with a black grim man and little thomas lindsay was awaked by his grandmother one night out of his bed and caused him take a black grimm gentleman as she called him by the hand88 at pittenweem in 1704 this young woman isobel adams acknowledged her compact with the devil which she says was made up after this manner viz that being in the house of the said beatie laing and a man at the end of the table beatie proposes to isobel that since she would not fee and hire with her that she would do it with the man at the end of the table and accordingly isobel agreed to it and spoke with the man at that time in general terms eight days after the same person in appearance comes to her and owns that he was the devil89 the latest instance is at thurso in 1719 where the devil met margaret ningilbert in the way in the likeness of a man and engaged her to take on with him which she consented to and she said she knew him to be the devil or he parted with her90 in ireland one of the earliest known trials for ritual witchcraft occurred in 1324 the accused being the lady alice kyteler she was said to have met the devil who was called robin son of artis in specie cuiusdam aethiopis cum duobus sociis ipso maioribus et longioribus91 in france also there is a considerable amount of evidence the earliest example is in 1430 when pierronne a follower of joan of arc was put to death by fire as a witch she persisted to the end in her statement which she made on oath that god appeared to her in human form and spoke to her as friend to friend and that the last time she had seen him he was clothed in a scarlet cap and a long white robe92 estebene de cambrue of the parish of amou in 1567 said that the witches danced round a great stone sur laquelle est assis un grand homme noir quelles appellent monsieur93 jeanne hervillier of verberie near compigne in 1578 daughter of a witch who had been condemned and burnt confessa qu

habitation sous la figure dun grand seigneur vtu en noir et portant des plumes sur son chapeau99 in the copper mines of sweden 1670 the devil appeared as a minister100 in the province of elfdale in the same year his dress was not the usual black of that period he used to appear but in different habits but for the most part we saw him in a gray coat and red and blue stockings he had a red beard a highcrownd hat with linnen of divers colours wrapt about it and long garters upon his stockings101 this is not unlike the costume of thom reid as described more than a century before by bessie dunlop in america the same evidence is found at hartford 1662 robert sterne testifieth as followeth i saw this woman goodwife seager in ye woods with three more women and with them i saw two black creatures

in a highcrowned hat104 the evidence suggests that an important part of the devils costume was the headcovering which he appears to have worn both in and out of doors though the fact is not of special interest in itself it may throw light on one of the possible origins of the cult in 1576 bessie dunlop met thom reid who was clearly the devil he was ane honest wele elderlie man gray bairdit and had ane gray coitt with lumbart slevis of the auld fassoun ane pair of gray brekis and quhyte schankis gartanit aboue the kne ane blak bonet on his heid cloise behind and plane befoir with silkin laissis

shows that the devil start up in the pulpit like a mickle black man clad in a black tatie gown and an evilfavoured scullbonnet on his head107 at aberdeen in 1597 ellen gray described the devil as ane agit man beirdit with a quhyt gown and a thrummit hat108 in 1609 in the bassespyrnes when the devil appeared as a goat on luy voit aussi quelque espece de bonet ou chapeau au dessus de ses cornes109 the alloa coven in 1658 spoke of a man in broun clathis and ane blak hat and on two occasions of a young man with gray cloathis and ane blew cap110 in 1661 janet watson of dalkeith was at a meitting in newtoundein with the deavill who had grein cloathes vpone him and ane blak hatt vpone his head111 five members of the coven at crook of devon in 1662 spoke of the devils headgear sathan was in the likeness of a man with gray cloathes and ane blue bannet having ane beard ane bonnie young lad with ane blue bonnet ane uncouth man with black clothes with ane hood on his head sathan had all the said times black coloured cloathes and ane blue bonnet being an unkie like man ane little man with ane blue bonnet on his head with rough gray cloathes on him112 in 1662 in connecticut robert sterne saw two black creatures like two indians but taller113 as he was at a little distance it is probable that he took a plumed or horned headdress to be the same as the indian headgear in belgium in 1664 josine labyns saw the devil wearing a plumed hat114 in somerset in 1665 mary green said that when he met the witches the little man put his hand to his hat saying how do ye speaking low but big115 at torryburn lilias adie said that the light was sufficient to shew the devil who wore a cap covering his ears and neck116 in sweden in 1670 the devil came in a gray coat and red and blue stockings he had a red beard a highcrownd hat with linnen of divers colours wrapt about and long garters upon his stockings117 at pittenweem in 1670 the young lass isobel adams saw the devil as a man in black cloaths with a hat on his head sitting at the table in beatty laings house118 b woman the queen of elphin or elfhame is sometimes called the devil and it is often impossible to distinguish between her and the devil when the latter appears as a woman whether she was the same as the french reine du sabbat is equally difficult to determine the greater part of the evidence regarding the womandevil is from scotland in 1576 bessie dunlops evidence shows that thom reid who was to her what the devil was to witches was under the orders of the queen of elfhame interrogat gif sche neuir askit the

offrent du pain des oeufs de largent la royne du sabbat les reoit laquelle est assise son cost gauche en sa main gauche elle tient vne paix ou platine dans laquelle est graue leffigie de lucifer laquelle on ne baise quaprs lauoir premirement baise elle125 in 1613 the lancashire witch anne chattox made a confused statement as to the sex of the socalled spirits it is however quite possible that the confusion is due to the recorder who was accustomed to consider all demons as male after their eating the deuill called fancie and the other spirit calling himselfe tibbe carried the remnant away and she sayeth that at their said banquet the said spirits gaue them light to see what they did and that they were both shee spirites and diuels126 in 1618 at leicester joan willimott saith that shee hath a spirit which shee calleth pretty which was giuen vnto her by william berry of langholme in rutlandshire whom she serued three yeares and that her master when he gaue it vnto her willed her to open her mouth and hee would blow into her a fairy which should doe her good and that shee opened her mouth and he did blow into her mouth and that presently after his blowing there came out of her mouth a spirit which stood vpon the ground in the shape and forme of a woman which spirit did aske of her her soule which she then promised vnto it being willed thereunto by her master127 william barton was tried in edinburgh about 1655 one day says he going from my own house in kirkliston to the queens ferry i overtook in dalmeny muire a young gentlewoman as to appearance beautiful and comely i drew near to her but she shunned my company and when i insisted she became angry and very nyce said i we are both going one way be pleased to accept of a convoy at last after much entreaty she grew better natured and at length came to that familiarity that she suffered me to embrace her and to do that which christian ears ought not to hear of at this time i parted with her very joyful the next night she appeared to him in that same very place and after that which should not be named he became sensible that it was the devil here he renounced his baptism and gave up himself to her service and she called him her beloved and gave him this new name of iohn baptist and received the mark128 at forfar in 1662 marjorie ritchie willingly and friely declared that the divill appeired to her thrie severall tymes in the similitud of a womane the first tyme in on jonet barries house the second tyme whyle she was putting vp lint in the companie of the said jonet and that the divill did take her by the hand at that tyme and promised that she should never want money and therafter that the divill appeired to her in the moiss of neutoune of airly wher and when she did renunce her baptism129 in 1670 jean weir sister of the notorious major weir gave an account of how she entered the service of the devil the ceremony began as follows when she keeped a school at dalkeith and teached childering ane tall woman came to the declarants hous when the childering were there and that she had as appeared to her ane chyld upon her back and on or two at her foot and that the said woman desyred that the declarant should imploy her to spick for her to the queen of farie and strik and battle in her behalf with the said queen which was her own words130 among the salem witches in 1692 this rampant hag martha carrier was the person of whom the confessions of the witches and of her own children among the rest agreed that the devil had promised her she should be queen of hell131 3 identification as it is certain that the socalled devil was a human being sometimes disguised and sometimes not the instances in which these persons can be identified are worth investigating in most cases these are usually men and the names are often given but it is only in the case of the devil of north berwick that the man in question is of any historic importance the others are simply private individuals of little or no note elizabeth stile of windsor in 1579 gives a description of father rosimonds changes of form which points to his being the chief of the windsor witches she confesseth her self often tymes to haue gon to father rosimond house where she founde hym sittyng in a wood not farre from thence vnder the bodie of a tree sometymes in the shape of an ape and otherwhiles like an horse132 in the reign of elizabeth 1584 there is a list of eightyseven suspected persons among whom occur the names of ould birtles the great devil roger birtles and his wife and anne birtles darnally the sorcerer the oulde witche of ramsbury maud twogood enchantress mother gillian witch and several other oulde witches133 the account by john stearne the pricker in 1645 indicates that one of the magistrates of fenny drayton was the local devil some will say it is strange they should know when they should be searched if it be kept private i answer let it be kept never so private it hath been common and as common as any other thing as they themselves have confessed for so did they of fennydrayton in cambridgeshire who made very large confessions as that the devil told them of our coming to town134 one of the clearest cases however is that of marsh of dunstable in 1649 whom palmer confessed to be head of the whole colledge of witches that hee knows in the world this palmer hath been a witch these sixty years by his own confession long enough to know and give in the totall summe of all the conjuring conclave and the society of witches in england135 in scotland a certain number of identifications are also possible alison peirson tried in 1588 learnt all her charms and obtained all her knowledge from the devil who came to her in the form of mr william sympson her mothers brothers son who was a great scholar and doctor of medicine in edinburgh136 jonet stewart in 1597 learnt her charms from umquhill michaell clark smyth in laswaid and fra ane italean strangear callit mr john damiet ane notorious knawin enchanter and sorcerer137 in the trial of marion pardon of hillswick in 1644 it was given in evidence that a man spoke of the devil as marion pardons pobe ie nurses husband or foster father138 in a case tried at lauder in 1649 there is an indication that one of the magistrates was the chief of the witches robert grieve accused a certain woman at a secret session of the court but the devil came that same night unto her and told her that hob grieve had fyled her for a witch139 isobel ramsay in 1661 was accused that you had ane uther meiting wt the devill in yor awne hous in the liknes of yor awne husband as you wes lying in yor bed at qch tyme you engadged to be his servant and receaved a dollar from him140 when a man had special knowledge as to which women were witches it is suggestive that he might be himself the devil as in the case of the rev allan logan who was particularly knowing in the detection of witches at the administration of the communion he would cast his eye along and say you witch wife get up from the table of the lord when some poor creature would rise and depart141 it seems probable that the infamous abb guibourg was the head of the paris witches for it was he who celebrated the black mass and performed the sacrifice of a child both of which were the duties of the devil142 at salem also the account given by the witches of the rev george burroughs points to his filling the office of devil for he was head actor at some of their hellish randezvouses and one who had the promise of being a king in satans kingdomhe was the person who had seducd and compelld them into the snares of witchcraft143 that burroughs was a religious person is no argument against his being also the devil of salem apart from the wellknown psychological fact that a certain form of religious feeling can exist at the same time as the propensity to and practice of sexual indulgence there is proof that many of the witches were outwardly religious according to the tenets of christianity so many christian priests were also followers of the witchreligion that the inquisitors of the sixteenth century were greatly exercised in their minds as to how to deal with the offenders antide colas confessed that she attended the midnight mass on christmas eve then went to a witch meeting and returned to the church in time for the mass at dawn on christmas morning144 at ipswich in 1645 mother lakeland hath been a professour of religion a constant hearer of the word for these many years and yet a witch as she confessed for the space of near twenty years145 the bestknown case of the kind is that of major weir in edinburgh in 1670 whose outward appearance tallies with the usual descriptions of the devil and whose conduct is only explainable on the supposition that he actually was the chief of the witches his garb was still a cloak and somewhat dark and he never went without his staff he was a tall black man and ordinarily looked down to the ground a grim countenance and a big nose146 his reputation for piety was so great that a woman who had actually seen him commit an offence against the criminal law was flogged for mentioning the fact and thus defaming a man of such extreme and wellestablished piety he was tried as a witch on his own unsolicited confession and was burnt together with his staff dying impenitent and renouncing all hope of a christian heaven the most interesting case historically however is that of the devil of the north berwick witches 1590 the number of people involved was thirtynine ie three covens but though the names of all were known only four were tried the records are given in considerable detail and the identification of the chief is therefore possible the character of the accused in this case is of great importance when considering the evidence nothing more unlike the conventional idea of witches can well be imagined than the man and women who were arraigned on that occasion agnes sampson the wise wife of keith was a woman not of the base and ignorant sort of witches but matronlike grave and settled in her answers which were all to some purpose john fian or cunynghame was a schoolmaster therefore a man of education effie mccalyan the daughter of lord cliftonhall was a woman of family and position barbara napier was also of good family these were clearly the moving spirits of the band and they were all persons capable of understanding the meaning and result of their actions147 the accusation against the witches was that they had met together to plot the murder of the king and queen by witchcraft the trial therefore was on a double charge witchcraft and high treason and both charges had to be substantiated keeping in mind lord cokes definition of a witch as a person who has conference with the devil to take counsel or to do some act it is clear that the fact of the devils bodily presence at the meetings had to be proved first then the fact of the conference and finally the attempts at murder the reports of the trial do not however differentiate these points in any way and the religious prepossession of the recorders colours every account it is therefore necessary to take the facts without the construction put upon them by the natural bias of the christian judges and writers the records give in some detail the account of several meetings where the deaths of the king and queen were discussed and instructions given and carried out to effect that purpose at each meeting certain ceremonies proper to the presence of the grand master were performed but the real object of the meeting was never forgotten or even obscured the actual evidence of the affair was given by agnes sampson also called anny simpson or tompson john fian euphemia or effie mccalyan and barbara napier as it was a case of high treason the two leaders sampson and fian were tortured to force them to divulge the name of the prime mover both these two and effie mccalyan were condemned and executed barbara napier equally guilty according to the evidence but more fortunate in her jurors was released for which action the jurors themselves were subsequently tried though the means used by the witches may seem ridiculous the murderous intention is very clear first they performed incantations to raise a storm to wreck the queens ship on her way to scotland and the storm which actually arose very nearly effected their purpose as it failed however they betook themselves to the accredited method of melting a waxen image but they were also ready to use poisons which were to their minds the most virulent that could be prepared i have arranged the evidence so as to make as far as possible a consecutive narrative of the occurrences john fian tried december 26 1590 the first items relate to his consulting with the devil and working witchcraft 7 item fylit for the rasing of wyndis att the kingis passing to denmark and for the sending of ane letter to marioun linkup in leyth to that effect bidding hir to meit him and the rest on the see within fyve dayes quhair satan delyuerit ane catt out of his hand to robert griersoune gevand the word

exhortations wherein he did greatly inveigh against the king of scotland he received their oathes for their good and true service towards him and departed which done they returned to sea and so home

and that rycht sone and this mater of his hienes pictour was the caus of that assemblie this ends the evidence of the witches the point to be proved now is the identity of the man whom they believed in and obeyed as god incarnate in all cases of murder or attempted murder it is necessary to find the person who would benefit for murder is differentiated from manslaughter by the fact that it is deliberately planned and that it is done for a motive in the case of the witches of north berwick the man who instigated the meetings and to whom consequently suspicion points was francis stewart earl of bothwell his position as regards both the king and the witches must therefore be investigated francis afterwards earl of bothwell was the eldest son of john stewart and jane hepburn sister of that earl of bothwell whom mary queen of scots married francis succeeded his maternal uncle in title and estates his father lord john stewart was an illegitimate son of james v the pope however legitimized all the natural children of james v and mary after her accession granted letters of legitimation150 to her two halfbrothers john stewart and james afterwards the regent moray john was slightly the elder of the two and had he been legitimate would have been the heir to the exclusion of mary the regent moray left only daughters whereas john stewart had several sons of whom francis was the eldest francis might therefore claim to be the next heir male to the throne of scotland and possibly of england had james vi died without children jamess own opinion of the matter is shown in his speech to his parliament in 1592 when he denounced bothwell as an aspirant to the throne although he was but a bastard and could claim no title to the crown bothwell however was himself no bastard though his father was but the significance of the witches attempt as well as the identity of the chief personage at their meeting is given in barbara napiers evidence as to the reason for the attempted murder of the king that another might have ruled in his majestys place and the government might have gone to the devil by changing the title the devil by which he was known to the witches to the title earl of bothwell by which he was known outside the community the man and the motive are manifest this hypothesis is borne out by the contemporary accounts the trial of the witches created a great stir and bothwells name was freely coupled with the witches he denied all complicity this was only natural as confession would have meant an acknowledgement of high treason but his followers might have betrayed him the two leaders agnes sampson and john fian were tortured sampson admitted that the wax image was made at the instance of francis earl of bothwell an admission sufficiently damning but beyond that she would say nothing the real danger to bothwell lay in fian under torture he made admissions and signed a confession in the presence of the king he was then by the maister of the prison committed to ward and appointed to a chamber by himselfe where foresaking his wicked wayes acknowledging his most ungodly lyfe shewing that he had too much folowed the allurements and enticements of sathan and fondly practised his conclusions by conjuring witchcraft inchantment sorcerie and such like hee renounced the devill and all his wicked workes vowed to lead the lyfe of a christian and seemed newly converted to god the morrow after upon conference had with him he granted that the devill had appeared unto him in the night before appareled all in blacke with a white wande in his hande and that the devill demaunded of him if hee woulde continue his faithfull service according to his first oath and promise made to that effect whome as hee then saide he utterly renounced to his face and said unto him in this manner avoide sathan avoide for i have listned too much unto thee and by the same thou hast undone me in respect whereof i utterly forsake thee to whome the devill answered that once ere thou die thou shalt bee mine and with that as he sayd the devill brake the white wand and immediately vanished foorth of his sight thus all the daie this doctor fian continued verie solitarie and seemed to have a care of his owne soule and would call uppon god showing himselfe penitent for his wicked life neverthelesse the same night hee found such meanes that he stole the key of the prison doore and chamber in which he was which in the night hee opened and fled awaie to the saltpans where hee was alwayes resident and first apprehended of whose sodaine departure when the kings majestie had intelligence hee presently commanded diligent inquirie to bee made for his apprehension and for the better effecting thereof hee sent publike proclamations into all partes of his lande to the same effect by means of whose hot and harde pursuite he was agayn taken and brought to prison and then being called before the kings highnes hee was reexamined as well touching his departure as also touching all that had before happened but this doctor notwithstanding that his owne confession appeareth remaining in recorde under his owne hande writting and the same thereunto fixed in the presence of the kings majestie and sundrie of his councell yet did hee utterly denie the same whereupon the kings majestie perceiving his stubborne wilfulnesse conceived and imagined that in the time of his absence hee had entered into newe conference and league with the devill his maister fian was then subjected to the most horrible tortures that could be devised and notwithstanding all these grievous paines and cruel torments hee would not confess anie thinges so deeply had the devill entered into his heart that hee utterly denied all that which he before avouched and would saie nothing thereunto but this that what hee had done and sayde before was onely done and sayde for fear of paynes which he had endured151 he continued steadfast and was executed at the castle hill the character of fian is perfectly consistent under torture he signed a confession which confession might have implicated bothwell that night bothwell himself or one of his emissaries obtained access to the prisoner and arranged for his escape the wretched fian was faced with death either way if he retracted his confession he would die as a criminal by the hands of the law if he held to it he would die as a traitor by the hands of his comrades there was no alternative all that day he continued verie solitarie calling upon god but by night he had made his choice and fled he apparently escaped without difficulty the story of his stealing the keys of his own cell and of the prison door is absurd the escape was obviously effected by connivance just as later on bothwells own escape was effected fian went back to his own home where according to jamess surmise he had an interview with the devil ie bothwell and there he tamely waited till the officers of the law came and recaptured him this tameness is not in keeping with the rest of his character a man with sufficient courage and resource to get out of a strongly guarded prison would have made good his escape an easy enough matter in those turbulent times fian then must have been retaken because he wished to be retaken for fear of torture and in hope of pardon he signed the first confession implicating bothwell152 yet later he endured agonies of torture with the certainty of death rather than acknowledge one word which might lead to the discovery that james was bent upon jamess surmise was perhaps more than a mere guess it was prompted by his knowledge of the facts fian had had an interview with his master whom he believed to be god incarnate and like many a christian martyr he atoned for the first betrayal by steadfast courage through cruel torment even to death reading the accounts in the light of this supposition it is seen that every one including james suspected bothwell even if they did not acknowledge his divinity they feared the magical powers which as chief of the witches he was supposed to wield it is impossible to study the details of this period without realizing the extraordinary fear which james had of his cousin it was fear with an underlying horror totally different from his feeling towards his other turbulent subjects when bothwell seeking pardon was introduced into holyrood palace by lady athol in the early morning of july 24 1593 he entered the kings chamber james always undignified was caught in the middle of his morning toilet he tried to run into the queens room but the way was barred by bothwells friends and the door was locked the king seeing no other refuge asked what they meant came they to seek his life let them take itthey would not get his soul153 this remark made in the urgency and excitement of the moment is highly significant had bothwell been like many of jamess other enemies merely an assassin james would not have spoken of his soul but bothwell as the devil of the witches had the right to demand the yielding of the soul and james was aware of the fact the birth of jamess children removed bothwells hopes of succession the power of the witch organization of which he was the chief was broken by the death of its leaders he had made a strong bid for power he failed fled the country and finally died in poverty at naples there george sandys the traveller heard of him here a certaine calabrian hearing that i was an english man came to me and would needs perswade me that i had insight in magicke for that earle bothel was my countryman who liues at naples and is in those parts famous for suspected negromancie154 the devil being actually a human being the letter of introduction to him given by a manwitch to a wouldbe proselyte becomes quite credible it is worth quoting verbatim monseigneur dautant quil me faut retirer de la religion des chrestiens afin que ie multiplie vostre party duquel estant il est raisonnable que ie vous glorifie et assemble tant de gens que ie pourray ie vous enuoye ce porteur pour estre du nombre cest pourquoy ie vous prie de laider en ses amours satans reply to the novice shows a distinctly human trace of

eternelles et iaccompliray ton desir155 4 as an animal illustration in many religions the disguising of the principal personagewhether god or priestas an animal is well known the custom is very ancientsuch disguised human beings are found even among the palaeolithic drawings in france and on a slate palette belonging to the late predynastic period of egypt there is a representation of a man disguised as a jackal and playing on a pipe156 the ritual disguise as an animal is condemned with great particularity as devilish in the liber poenitentialis of theodore of the seventh century see supra p 21 showing that it continued in force after the conversion of england to an outward appearance of christianity from the analogy of other religions in which the custom occurs it would appear that it is a ritual for the promotion of fertility the animal represented being either the sacred animal of the tribe or the creature most used for food the suggestion that the devil was a man wearing either an animals skin or a mask in the form of an animals head as a ritual disguise accounts as nothing else can for the witches evidence as to his appearance and his changes of form a confusion however exists from the fact that the witches and therefore the recorders usually spoke of the familiars as the devil but in almost every case the disguised man can on examination of the evidence be distinguished from the animal familiar the animal forms in which the devil most commonly appeared were bull cat dog goat horse and sheep a few curious facts come to light on tabulating these forms ie the devil appears as a goat or a sheep in france only he is never found in any country as a hare though this was the traditional form for a witch to assume nor is he found as a toad though this was a common form for the familiar the fox and the ass also are unknown forms and in western europe the pig is an animal almost entirely absent from all the rites and ceremonies as well as from the disguises of the devil the witches never admitted in so many words that the devil was a man disguised but their evidence points strongly to the fact in some cases the whole body was disguised in others a mask was worn usually over the face the wearing of the mask is indicated partly by descriptions of its appearance and partly by the description of the devils voice the lorraine witches in 1589 said that the devils knnen nimmermehr die menschliche stimme so aussdrcklich nachreden dass man nicht leicht daran mercke dass es eine gemachte falsche stimme sey nicolaea ganatia und fast alle andere sagen dass sie eine stimme von sich geben gleich denen so den kopff in ein fass oder zerbrochenen hafen stecken und daraus reden auch geben sie etwann eine kleine leise stimme von sich157 the north berwick devil in 1590 was purposely disguised out of all recognition the devil start up in the pulpit like a mickle black man with a black beard sticking out like a goats beard and a high ribbed nose falling down sharp like the beak of a hawk with a long rumpill tail158 this was barbara napiers account agnes sampson describes the same personage the deuell caused all the company to com and kiss his ers quhilk they said was cauld like yce his body was hard lyk yrn as they thocht that handled him his faice was terrible his noise lyk the bek of an egle gret bournyng eyn his handis and legis wer herry with clawis vpon his handis and feit lyk the griffon and spak with a how voice159 boguet states that on demanda george gandillon si lors quil fut sollicit par sat de se bailler luy satan parloit distinctement il respondit que non qu peine pouuoit il comprendre ce quil disoit160 the evidence of the witches in the bassespyrnes makes it clear that a disguise was worn and that a mask was placed on the back either of the head or of the person this also explains part of agnes sampsons evidence given above the effect of the mask at the back of the head was to make the man appear twofaced comme le dieu janus in the other case le diable estoit en forme de bouc ayant vne queue audessoubs vn visage dhomme noir na parole par ce visage de derrierevne grande quee au derriere vne forme de visage au dessoubs duquel visage il ne profere aucune parole ains luy sert pour donner baiser ceux qui bon luy semblemarie daspilecute dit quelle le baisa ce visage de derriere au dessoubs dvne grande queu quelle ly a bais par trois fois quil auoit ce visage faict comme le museau dvn boucbertrand de handuch aagee de dix ans confessa que le cul du grd maistre auoit vn visage derriere cestoit le visage de derriere quon baisoit non le cul161 the devil of the bassespyrnes evidently wore a mask over the face for he had la voix effroyable sans ton quand il parle on diroit que cest vn mullet qui se met braire il a la voix casse la parole malarticulee peu intelligible parcequil a tousiours la voix triste enroee on occasions also il quitoit la forme de bouc prenoit celle dhomme162 in 1614 at orleans silvain nevillon said quil vit la chemine vn homme noir duquel on ne voyoit pas la teste vit aussi vn grand homme noir lopposite de celuy de la chemine que ledit home noir parloit comme si la voix fut sortie dvn poinson dit que le diable dit le serm au sabbat mais quon nentend ce quil dit parce quil parle come en grdant163 the devil who appeared to joan wallis the huntingdonshire witch in 1649 was in the shape of a man dressed in black but he was not as her husband which speaks to her like a man but he as he had been some distance from her when he was with her164 thomazine ratcliffe a suffolk witch said that the devil spoke with a hollow shrill voyce165 according to mary green 1665 the somerset devil who was a little man put his hand to his hat saying how do ye speaking low but big166 in the same year abre grinset another suffolk witch confessed that she met the devil who was in the form of a pretty handsom young man and spake to her with a hollow solemn voice167 john stuart at paisley 1678 said the devil came to him as a black man and that the black mans apparel was black and that the black mans voice was hough and goustie168 the coldness of the devils entire person which is vouched for by several witches suggests that the ritual disguise was not merely a mask over the face but included a covering possibly of leather or some other hard and cold substance over the whole body and even the hands such a disguise was apparently not always worn for in the great majority of cases there is no record of the devils temperature except in the sexual rites and even then the witch could not always say whether the touch of the devil was warm or not in 1565 the belgian witch digna robert said the devil tait froid dans tous ses membres169 in 1590 at north berwick he caused all the company to com and kiss his ers quhilk they said was cauld lyk yce his body was hard lyk yrn as they thocht that handled him170 in 1598 pierre burgot whose statement is quoted by several authors a confess que le diable luy donna baiser sa main senestre qui estoit noire comme morte toute froide171 in 1609 in the bassespyrnes isaac de queyran aged 25 said that he and others le baiserent vne fesse qui estoit blanche rouge auoit la forme dvne grande cuisse dvn homme estoit velue172 this shows the ritual disguise of the person and suggests the use of an animals hide with the hair still attached in 1645 the essex witch rebecca west said he kissed her but was as cold as clay173 at salisbury in 1653 when the witch anne bodenham persuaded anne styles to join the community then appeared two spirits in the likenesse of great boyes with long shagged black hair and stood by her looking over her shoulder and the witch took the maids forefinger of her right hand and pricked it with a pin and squeezed out the blood and put it into a pen and put the pen in the maids hand and held her hand to write in a great book and one of the spirits laid his hand or claw upon the witches whilest the maid wrote and the spirits hand did feel cold to the maid as it touched her hand when the witches hand and hers were together writing174 at forfar in 1661 three of the witches agreed as to the coldness of the devil elspet alexander confesses that the divill kissed hir selfe that night and that it was ane cold kisse katheren porter confesseth that the divill tooke hir by the hand that his hand was cold isobell smith confessed that he kissed hir and his mouth and breath were cold175 in 1662 the crook of devon witches were also in accord isabel rutherford confesst that ye was at ane meeting at turfhills where sathan took you by the hand and said welcome isabel and said that his hand was coldmargaret litster confessed that sathan took you be the hand and stayed the space of half an hour sathan having grey clothes and his hand coldjanet paton confessed that sathan asked you gif ye would be his servant whilk ye did and sathan took you be the hand and ye said that his hand was cold on the other hand agnes murie knew not whether his body was hot or cold176 according to isobel gowdie at auldearne in 1662 he was a meikle blak roch man werie cold177 at torryburn lilias adie found his skin was cold178 and the crighton witches in 1678 said he was cold and his breath was like a damp air179 in 1697 little thomas lindsay declared that jean fulton his grandmother awaked him one night out of his bed and caused him take a black grimm gentleman as she called him by the hand which he felt to be cold180 the evidence as to the forms assumed by the devil is tabulated here under each animal each section being arranged in chronological order 1 bullin 1593 at angers michel des rousseaux ag de 50 ans dict que ledict homme noir appell iupin se transforma aussitost en bouc et apres leur auoir baill des boetes de poudre il se trsforma en bouuard181 at aberdeen in 1597 marion grant confessed that the devill apperit to the sumtyme in the scheap of a beist and sumtyme in the scheap of a man jonet lucas of the same coven said that the devil was with them beand in likenes of ane beist agnes wobster also of the same coven acknowledged that thaireftir satan apperit to the in the likenes of a calff and spak to the in manner forsaid and baid the be a gude servand to him182 in 1608 gabriel pell confessed that he went with a friend to the sabbath where le diable estoit en vache noire que cette vache noire luy fit renoncer dieu183 de lancre says that at tournelle the devil appeared parfois comme vn grand boeuf dairain couch terre comme vn boeuf naturel qui se repose184 at lille in 1661 the witches adored a beast with which they committed infamous things185 according to isobel gowdie in 1662 the devil of auldearne changed his form or disguise continually somtym he vold be lyk a stirk a bull a deir a rae or a dowg186 in the above i have taken the word beast in its usual meaning as an animal of the cattle tribe but it is quite possible that the lille beast beste in the original may have been a goat and not a bull this seems likely from the fact that the sacrifice was by fire as in the other places where the devil used the goatdisguise 2 catthe earliest example of the catdisguise is in the trial of the guernsey witches in 1563 when martin tulouff confessed q il y a viron ung quartier dan passez q il soy trouva auvecqs la vieillesse aultremet dit collenette gascoing en la rue de la fosse au coully l ou l y avoet chinq ou vi chatz dou il y en avoet ung qui estoet noir qui menoit la dance et danssoient et luy dyst ladte collenette q il besait ledt chat et dt q il estoet sur ses pieds plat et que ladite collenette le besa p de derriere et luy p la crysse et q frcoize lenouff sa mre y estoet et collette salmon fae de collas du port laqlle alloet devt et sagenouillerent tos devt le chat et ladoreret en luy baillt ler foy et luy dist ladite vieillesse q ledit chat estoet le diable187 franoise secretain in 1598 saw the devil tantost en forme de chat rolande de vernois said le diable se presenta pour lors au sabbat en forme dvn groz chat noir188 in 1652 another french witch confessed that il entra dans sa chambre en forme dung chat et se changea en la posture dun home vestu de rouge who took her to the sabbath189 both the devonshire witches mary trembles and susanna edwards in 1682 stated that they saw him as a lion by which they possibly meant a large cat190 in this connexion it is worth noting that in lapland as late as 1767 the devil appeared in the likeness of a cat handling them from their feet to their mouth and counting their teeth191 3 dogat chelmsford in 1556 joan waterhouse dydde as she had seene her mother doe callynge sathan whiche came to her as she sayd in the lykenes of a great dogge192 in 1616 barthlemy minguet of brcy was tried for witchcraft enquis comme il a aduis quand le sabbat se doit tenir respond que cest le diable qui luy vient dire estant en forme de chien noir faict comme vn barbet parle luy en ceste forme enquis en quelle forme se met le diable estant au sabbat respond quil ne la iamais veu autrement quen forme de barbet noir enquis quelles ceremonies ils obseruent estant au sabbat respond que le diable estant en forme de barbet noir comme dessus est dit se met tout droit sur les pattes de derriere les preche193 etc in guernsey in 1617 isabel becquet went to rocquaine castle the usual place where the devil kept his sabbath no sooner had she arrived there than the devil came to her in the form of a dog with two great horns sticking up and with one of his paws which seemed to her like hands took her by the hand and calling her by her name told her that she was welcome then immediately the devil made her kneel down while he himself stood up on his hind legs he then made her express detestation of the eternal in these words i renounce god the father god the son and god the holy ghost and then caused her to worship and invoke himself194 bartons wife about 1655 stated that one night going to a dancing upon pentlandhills he went before us in the likeness of a rough tannydog playing on a pair of pipes and his tail played ey wig wag wig wag195 in 1658 an alloa witch named jonet blak declared that he appeared to her first as a dog with a sowis head196 in 1661 jonet watson of dalkeith said that the deivill apeired vnto her in the liknes of ane prettie boy in grein clothes and went away from her in the liknes of ane blak doug197 according to marie lamont of innerkip in 1662 the devill in the likeness of a brown dog helped to raise a storm198 margaret hamilton widow of james pullwart of borrowstowness in 1679 was accused that she met the devil in the likeness of a man but he removed from you in the likeness of an black dog199 the highland witches in the eighteenth century saw the devil as a dog he was a large black ugly tyke to whom the witches made obeisance the dog acknowledged the homage by bowing grinning and clapping his paws200 in the case of the dogdisguise there is again a similarity with lapp beliefs and customs the appearance of the devil as a dog being not uncommon in lapland201 4 goatan interesting point as regards this form of disguise is that it does not occur in great britain nor have i found it so far in belgium it prevailed chiefly in france from which all my examples are taken at poictiers in 1574 trois sorciers vne sorciere declarent quils estoyent trois fois lan lassemble generale o plusieurs sorciers se trouuoyent prs dvne croix dvn carrefour qui seruoit denseigne et l se trouuoit vn grand bouc noir qui parloit comme vne personne aux assistans dansoyent lentour du bouc202 at avignon in 1581 when hee comes to be adored he appeareth not in a humane forme but as the witches themselues haue deposed as soone as they are agreed of the time that he is to mount vpon the altar which is some rock or great stone in the fields there to bee worshipped by them hee instantly turneth himselfe into the forme of a great black goate although in all other occasions hee vseth to appeare in the shape of a man203 in lorraine in 1589 the devil sich in einen zottelichten bock verwandelt hat und viel strker reucht und beler stinckt als immer ein bock im anfang des frhlings thun mag204 in puy de dme in 1594 jane bosdeaus lover took her to a meeting and there appeared a great black goat with a candle between his horns205 in 1598 satan apres auoir prins la figure dvn bouc se consume en feu206 in the bassespyrnes in 1609 le diable estoit en forme de bouc ayant vne queue audessoubs vn visage dhomme noir na parole par ce visage de derrieremarie daguerre dit quil y a vne grande cruche au milieu du sabbat do sort le diable en forme de boucdautres disent quil est comme vn grand bouc

ladoration communemet il se represente en bouc207 silvain nevillon confessed at orleans in 1614 quil a veu le diable en plusieurs faons tantost comme vn bouc ayant vn visage deuant vn autre derriere208 5 horsei give here only the references to the devil when actually disguised as a horse but there are a very great number of cases where he appeared riding on a horse these cases are so numerous as to suggest that the horse was part of the ritual especially as the riding devil usually occurs in places where an animal disguise was not used eg in 1598 in aberdeen where andro man confessis that crystsunday rydis all the tyme that he is in thair cumpanie209 the actual disguise as a horse is not common elizabeth stile of windsor in 1579 confesseth her self often tymes to haue gon to father rosimond house where she found hym sittyng in a wood not farre from thence vnder the bodie of a tree sometymes in the shape of an ape and otherwhiles like an horse210 helen guthrie in 1661 stated that when the forfar witches were trying to sink a ship the divell wes there present with them all in the shape of ane great horse they returned all in the same liknes as of befor except that the divell wes in the shape of a man211 mary lacey of salem in 1692 said that he appeared in the shape of a horse i was in bed and the devil came to me and bid me obey him212 6 sheepthe sheepdisguise which is perhaps a form of the goat is usually found in france only in 1453 guillaume edeline docteur en thologie prieur de s germain en laye et auparavant augustin et religieux de certaines aultres ordres confessa de sa bonne et franche voulont avoir fait hommage audit ennemy en lespce et semblance dung mouton213 iaquema paget and antoine gandillon in 1598 said that il prenoit la figure dvn mouton noir portant des cornes214 in 1614 at orleans silvain nevillon was induced to reveal all he knew dit quil a veu le diable en plusieurs faons tantost comme vn bouc ores comme vn gros mouton215 the rarer animal disguises are the deer and the bear of these the deer is found at aberdeen in 1597 andro man confessis and affermis thow saw christsonday cum owt of the snaw in liknes of a staig216 at auldearne in 1662 somtym he vold be lyk a stirk a bull a deir a rae or a dowg217 at hartford connecticut 1662 rebecca greensmith said that the devil first appeared to her in the form of a deer or fawn218 the bear is still rarer as i have found it only twiceonce in lorraine and once in lancashire in 1589 es haben die geister auch etwann lust sich in gestalt eines bren zu erzeigen219 in 1613 anne chattox declared that the devil came vpon this examinate in the night time and at diuerse and sundry times in the likenesse of a beare gaping as though he would haue wearied worried this examinate and the last time of all shee this examinate saw him was vpon thursday last yeare but one next before midsummer day in the euening like a beare and this examinate would not then

footnote 219 remigius p 98 footnote 220 potts e 3 iii admission ceremonies 1 general in the ceremonies for admission as in all the other ceremonies of the cult the essentials are the same in every community and country though the details differ the two points which are the essence of the ceremony are invariable the first that the candidates must join of their own free will and without compulsion the second that they devote themselves body and soul to the master and his service the ceremonies of admission differed also according to whether the candidate were a child or an adult the most complete record of the admission of children comes from the bassespyrnes in 1609 les sorcieres luy offret des petits enfans le genoil en terre lui disant auec vne soubmission grand seigneur lequel iadore ie vous ameine ce nouueau seruiteur lequel veut estre perpetuellement vostre esclaue et le diable en signe de remerciement gratification leur respond approchez vous de moy quoy obeissant elles en se trainant genouil le luy presentent luy receuant lenfant entre ses bras le rend la sorciere la remercie puis luy recommande den auoir soing leur disant par ce moyen sa troupe saugmentera que si les enfans ayans attainct laage de neuf ans par malheur se voent au diable sans estre forcez ny violentez daucun sorcier ils se prosternent par terre deuant satan lequel iettant du feu par les yeux leur dit que demandez vous voulez vous estre moy ils respondent quouy il leur dict venez vous de vostre bonne volont ils respondent quouy faictes donc ce que ie veux ce que ie fay et alors la grande maistresse royne du sabbat qui leur sert de pedagogue dict ce nouueau qui se presente quil die haute voix ie renie dieu premierement puis iesus christ son fils le s esprit la vierge les saincts la saincte croix le chresme le baptesme la foy que ie tiens mes parrain marraine me remets de tout poinct en ton pouuoir entre tes mains ne recognois autre dieu si bien que tu es mon dieu ie suis ton esclaue aprs on luy baille vn crapaud habill auec son capot ou manteau puis il commande quon ladore si bien quobeyssans estants mis genouil ils baisent le diable auprs de loeil gauche la poitrine la fesse la cuisse aux parties honteuses puis leuant la queue ils luy baisent le derriere221 the novice was then marked by a scratch from a sharp instrument but was not admitted to the high mysteries till about the age of twenty222 as no further ceremonies are mentioned it may be concluded that the initiation into these mysteries was performed by degrees and without any special rites at lille about the middle of the seventeenth century madame bourignon founded a home for girls of the lowest classes pauvres et malorigines la plus part si ignorantes au fait de leur salut quelles vivoient comme des btes223 after a few years in 1661 she discovered that thirtytwo of these girls were worshippers of the devil and in the habit of going to the witches sabbaths they had all contracted this mischief before they came into the house224 one of these girls named bellot aged fifteen said that her mother had taken her with her when she was very young and had even carried her in her arms to the witches sabbaths225 another girl of twelve had been in the habit of going to the sabbath since she also was very young as the girls seem to have been genuinely fond of madame bourignon she obtained a considerable amount of information from them they told her that all worshippers of the devil are constrained to offer him their children when a child thus offered to the devil by its parents comes to the use of reason the devil then demands its soul and makes it deny god and renounce baptism and all relating to the faith promising homage and fealty to the devil in manner of a marriage and instead of a ring the devil gives them a mark with an iron awl aleine de fer in some part of the body226 it is also clear that marguerite montvoisin227 in paris had been instructed in witchcraft from an early age but as the trial in which she figures was for the attempted poisoning of the king and not for witchcraft no ceremonies of initiation or admission are recorded in great britain the ceremonies for the reception of children are not given in any detail though it was generally acknowledged that the witches dedicated their children to the devil as soon as born and from the evidence it appears that in many cases the witches had belonged to that religion all their lives it was sometimes sufficient evidence against a woman that her mother had been a witch228 as it presupposed that she had been brought up as a worshipper of the devil the anderson children in renfrewshire were all admitted to the society at an early age229 elizabeth anderson was only seven when she was first asked to swear fealty to the black grim man james lindsay was under fourteen and his little brother thomas was still below pupillarity at the time of the trial where he declared that he had been bribed by the promise of a red coat to serve the gentleman whom he knew thereafter to be the devil230 at forfar in 1661 jonet howat was so young that when isabel syrie presented hir to the divell the divell said what shall i do with such a little bairn as she he accepted her however and she was evidently the pet of the community the devil calling her his bonny bird231 at paisley annabil stuart was fourteen when at her mothers persuasion she took the vows of fidelity to the devil232 elizabeth frances at chelmsford tried in 1556 was about twelve years old when her grandmother first taught her the art of witchcraft233 elizabeth demdike the famous lancashire witch brought vp her owne children instructed her graundchildren and tooke great care and paines to bring them to be witches234 one of her granddaughters jennet device was aged nine at the time of the trial in sweden the children were taken regularly to the assemblies235 and in america236 also a childwitch is recorded in the person of sarah carrier aged eight who had made her vows two years before at her mothers instigation the ceremony for the admission of adults who were converts to the witch religion from christianity follow certain main lines these are 1 the free consent of the candidate 2 the explicit denial and rejection of a previous religion 3 the absolute and entire dedication of body and soul to the service and commands of the new master and god the ceremonies being more startling and dramatic for adults than for children they are recorded in great britain with the same careful detail as in france and it is possible to trace the local variations although in england as is usual the ceremonies had lost their significance to a far greater extent than in scotland and are described more shortly probably because they were more curtailed the legal aspect of the admission ceremonies is well expressed by sir george mackenzie writing in 1699 on the scotch laws relating to witchcraft in the seventeenth century as to the relevancy of this crime the first article useth to be paction to serve the devil which is certainly relevant per se without any addition paction with the devil is divided by lawyers in expressum tacitum an express and tacit paction express paction is performed either by a formal promise given to the devil then present or by presenting a supplication to him or by giving the promise to a proxie or commissioner impowered by the devil for that effect which is used by some who dare not see himself the formula set down by delrio is i deny god creator of heaven and earth and i adhere to thee and believe in thee but by the journal books it appears that the ordinary form of express paction confest by our witness is a simple promise to serve him tacit paction is either when a person who hath made no express paction useth the words or signs which sorcerers use knowing them to be such renouncing of baptism is by delrio made an effect of paction yet with us it is relevant per se and the solemnity confest by our witches is the putting one hand to the crown of the head and another to the sole of the foot renouncing their baptism in that posture delrio tells us that the devil useth to baptize them of new and to wipe off their brow the old baptism and our witches confess always the giving them new names the devils mark useth to be a great article with us but it is not per se found relevant except it be confest by them that they got that mark with their own consent quo casu it is equivalent to a paction this mark is given them as is alledgd by a nip in any part of the body and it is blew237 reginald scot238 writing considerably earlier gives a somewhat similar account of the english witches though couched in less legal phraseology the order of their bargaine or profession is double the one solemne and publike the other secret and priuate that which is called solemne or publike is where witches come togither at certeine assemblies at the times prefixed and doo not onelie see the diuell in visible forme but confer and talke familiarlie with him in which conference the diuell exhorteth them to obserue their fidelitie vnto him promising them long life and prosperitie then the witches assembled commend a new disciple whom they call a nouice vnto him and if the diuell find that yoong witch apt and forward in renunciation of christian faith in despising anie of the seuen sacraments in treading upon crosses in spetting at the time of eleuation in breaking their fast on fasting daies and fasting on sundaies then the diuell giueth foorth his hand and the nouice joining hand in hand with him promiseth to obserue and keepe all the diuells commandements this done the diuell beginneth to be more bold with hir telling hir plainlie that all this will not serue his turne and therefore requireth homage at hir hands yea he also telleth hir that she must grant him both hir bodie and soule to be tormented in euerlasting fire which she yeeldeth vnto then he chargeth hir to procure as manie men women and children also as she can to enter into this societie sometimes their homage with their oth and bargaine is receiued for a certeine terme of yeares sometimes for euer sometimes it consisteth in the deniall of the whole faith sometimes in part the first is when the soule is absolutelie yeelded to the diuell and hellfier the other is when they haue but bargained not to obserue certeine ceremonies and statutes of the church as to conceale faults at shrift to fast on sundaies etc and this is doone either by oth protestation of words or by obligation in writing sometimes sealed with wax sometimes signed with bloud forbes says that an express covenant is entred into betwixt a witch and the devil appearing in some visible shape whereby the former renounceth god and his baptism engages to serve the devil and do all the mischief he can as occasion offers and leaves soul and body to his disposal after death the devil on his part articles with such proselytes concerning the shape he is to appear to them in the services they are to expect from him upon the performance of certain charms or ceremonious rites this league is made verbally if the party cannot write and such as can write sign a written covenant with their blood239 the general order of the ceremony of admission can be gathered from the evidence given at the trials though no one trial gives the order in its entirety the ceremony might take place privately at a local meeting or in full sabbath it was the same for either sex except that the men were not usually introduced the women were sometimes introduced sometimes not if there were any sort of introduction it was by some one who was acquainted with the candidate usually the person who had induced her to join she was brought before the devil who asked her if she would be his faithful servant and if she would renounce her previous religion and dedicate herself to his service taking him as her god after the renunciation and vows the devil baptized her in his own great name and among the scotch witches gave her a new name by which she was known afterwards at the sabbaths and other meetings the ceremony concluded by giving the witch a mark or fleshbrand on some part of the body 2 the introduction it is not clear whether the introduction of a candidate by a member of the society was an early or a late detail it is quite possible that it was early the introducer standing in the same relation to the candidate as the christian sponsors stand to a candidate for baptism on the other hand it is quite comprehensible that when the witch religion became an object of persecution no new member could be admitted unless vouched for by some trustworthy person in the cases where the first meetings with the devil are recorded both systems are apparently in vogue occasionally however the accounts show a confusion on the part of the recorder thus anne chattox said that mother demdike introduced her to the devil in mother demdikes own house and that she there yielded her soul to him and in another place she is reported as saying that a thing like a christian man for foure yeares togeather did sundry times come to this examinate and requested this examinate to giue him her soule and in the end this examinate was contented to giue him her sayd soule shee being then in her owne house in the forrest of pendle240 the two statements are not inconsistent if we conclude that in her own house she consented to join the society and in mother demdikes presence she took the vows as a rule the men seem to have joined at the direct invitation of the devil himself especially when they came of witch families 3 the renunciation and vows the renunciation of previous errors of faith and the vows of fidelity to the new belief are part of the ceremony of admission of any convert to a new religion the renunciation by the witches was explicit but the records are apt to pass it over in a few words eg i denied my baptism i forsook god and christ ils renient dieu la vierge et le reste vne renonciation expresse iesuchrist la foy but occasionally the words are given in full mackenzie quoting from del rio gives the formula thus i deny god creator of heaven and earth and i adhere to thee and believe in thee241 the actual formula is still extant in the case of the priest louis gaufredy tried before the parliament of aix in 1611 ie louys gaufredy renonce tous les biens tant spirituels que corporels qui me pourroyent estre conferez de la part de dieu de la vierge marie de tous les saincts de paradis pareillement de mon patron s iean baptiste s pierre s paul s franois de me donner de corps dame lucifer icy present auec tous les biens que ie feray iamais except la valeur du sacrement pour le regard de ceux qui le recevront et ainsi le signe et atteste242 jeannette dabadie aged sixteen said that she was made to renoncer renier son createur la saincte vierge les saincts le baptesme pere mere parens le ciel la terre tout ce qui est au monde243 the irrevocability of this renunciation was impressed upon the swedish witches in a very dramatic manner the devil gave them a purse wherein there were shavings of clocks with a stone tied to it which they threw into the water and then were forced to speak these words as these shavings of the clock do never return to the clock from which they are taken so may my soul never return to heaven244 the vows to the new god were as explicit as the renunciation of the old danaeus says he commaundeth them to forswere god theyr creator and all his power promising perpetually to obey and worship him who there standeth in their presence245 the english witches merely took the vow of fealty and obedience devoting themselves body and soul to him sometimes only the soul however is mentioned but the scotch witches of both sexes laid one hand on the crown of the head the other on the sole of the foot and dedicated all that was between the two hands to the service of the master246 there is a slight variation of this ceremony at dalkeith in 1661 where the devil laid his hand upon jonet watsons head and bad her give all ower to him that was vnder his hand and shoe did so247 in southern france the candidates after renouncing their old faith prennent satan pour leur pere et protecteur la diablesse pour leur mere248 at lille the children called the ceremony the dedication249 showing that the same rite obtained there 4 the covenant the signing of a covenant does not occur in every case and was probably a late introduction forbes as quoted above gives the contract between the devil and his follower with the part which each engages to perform in somerset the witches signed whether they could write or not those who could not write putting a cross or circle as their mark250 the free consent of the candidate is a point always insisted on and by the confessions of the witches themselves the consent was often not merely freely but actually willingly given isobel crawford of the irvine coven in 1618 was accused that the devil come to hir awin dur in similitud of ane blak man and prommeist gif sche wold be his servand sche sould have geir aneuch and sould not want quhairunto sche was ever reddy to accord251 little jonet howat said that the devil bade her renounce her god and she answered marry shall i252 in the dittay against christian grieve it is stated that sathan desired you to be his servant whilk ye willingly granted to be and sicklike the minister posing you upon the foresaid particulars especially anent the renunciation of your baptism ye answered that sathan speired at you if ye would do it and ye answered i warrand did i253 bessie henderson and janet brugh of the same coven acknowledged the same to the former the devil appeared and asked you gif you would be his servant whilk ye freely and instantly accepted and granted thereto254 janet brugh was rather more emphatic sathan desired you to be his servant whilk ye willingly promised to be and likeways desired you to renounce your baptism whilk ye willingly did255 the written contract appealed very strongly to the legal minds of the judges and magistrates and it is therefore often mentioned but in great britain there is no record of the actual wording of any individual covenant the devil seems to have kept the parchment paper or book in his own custody in france however such contracts occasionally fell into the hands of the authorities the earliest case being in 1453 when guillaume edeline prior of st germainenlaye signed a compact with the devil which compact was afterwards found upon his person256 the witch stevenote de audebert who was burnt in january 1619 showed de lancre le pacte conuention quelle auoit faict auec le diable escrite en sang de menstrus si horrible quon auoit horreur de la regarder257 the contract was said to be signed always in the blood of the witch and here we come to a confusion between the mark made on the person and the mark made by the person it seems clear that part of the ceremony of initiation was the cutting of the skin of the candidate to the effusion of blood this is the early rite and it seems probable that when the written contract came into vogue the blood was found to be a convenient writingfluid or was offered to the devil in the form of a signature this signing of a book plays a great part in the new england trials the contract was usually for the term of the witchs life but sometimes it was for a term of years the number of which varies considerably as scot says sometimes their homage with their oth and bargaine is receiued for a certeine terme of yeares sometimes for ever258 popular belief assigns seven years as the length of time at the end of which period the devil was supposed to kill his votary the tradition seems to be founded on fact but there is also a certain amount of evidence that the witch was at liberty to discontinue or renew the contract at the end of the allotted term such a renewal seems also to have been made on the appointment of a new chief in france england and new england the term of years is mentioned in scotland it is mentioned by the legal authorities but from the fact that it occurs seldom if ever in the trials it would seem that the contract of the scotch witches was for life magdalene de la croix abbess of a religious house in cordova in 1545 made a contract for the space of thirty years she being then a girl of twelve259 in paris in 1571 il y eut vn aduocat lequel confessa quil auoit pass lobligation au diable renonceant dieu icelle signee de son propre sang encores sest il verifi par plusieurs procez que lobligation reciproque entre le diable le sorcier contient quelquesfois le terme dvn an deux ans ou autre temps260 at faversham in 1645 joan williford said that the devil promised to be her servant about twenty yeeres and that the time is now almost expired261 in huntingdonshire in 1646 elizabeth weed of great catworth confessed that the devill then offerd her that hee would doe what mischiefe she should require him and said she must covenant with him that he must have her soule at the end of one and twenty years which she granted262 in 1652 giles fenderlin of leaven heath was tried for that when he was a soldier at bell in flanders he made a fiveyears covenant with a jesuit after the said five years was expired in 1643 he renewd the said covenant with the jesuit for 14 years longer whereupon he drew a covenant for him with the devil pricking the two forefingers of his right hand with an needle and drew bloud wherewith he writ his name with his own bloud and then covenanted with the devil that if he should be safely protected during the space of 14 years aforesaid while such time as it expired that then he was to take away both body and soul as his own right and interest263 at lille in 1661 madame bourignons girls indicate the renewal of the contract the devil gives them a mark which marks they renew as often as those persons have any desire to quit him the devil reproves them then more severely and obligeth them to new promises making them also new marks for assurance or pledge that those persons should continue faithful to him264 in somerset in 1664 elizabeth style said that the devil promised her mony and that she should live gallantly and have the pleasure of the world for twelve years if she would with her blood sign his paper which was to give her soul to him265 at groton in new england in 1671 according to elizabeth knap the terme of time agreed upon with him was for 7 yeers one yeere shee was to be faithfull in his service and then ye other six hee would serve her and make her a witch266 at newcastleontyne in 1673 ann armstrong deposeth that ann drydon had a lease for fifty yeares of the divill whereof ten ar expired ann forster had a lease of her life for 47 yeares whereof seaven are yet to come lucy thompson had a lease of two and forty whereof two are yet to come and her lease being near out they would have perswaded this informer to have taken a lease of three score yeares or upwards267 in new england some of the afflicted said of goodwife c that she had covenanted with the devil for ten years six of them were gone and four more to come268 in modern france the belief in the contract for a term of years is recorded but nothing is said of the renewal of the contract or of the fate of the witch who refuses such a contract in the department of entresambreetmeuse the full method of entering on such a contract is known si vous voulez venir au bois avec moi vous verrez un homme venir vous cest le chef il vous demandera si vous voulez vous engager dans la socit si vous acceptez le terme dengagement est de sept ans et vous gagnerez une plaquette par jour269 among the walloons the neophyte takes with him a black hen which the devil buys and then ratifies the contract le pacte est fait pour une dure de sept ans270 5 the baptism records of the baptism of candidates are rare the rite being possibly copied from the christian ceremony and therefore of later date it does not seem to occur in england and hardly at all in scotland the earliest mention is in the bassespyrnes 1609 where jeannette dabadie stated quelle a veu souuent baptiser des enfans au sabbat quelle nous expliqua estre des enfans des sorcieres non autres lesquelles ont accoutume faire plustost baptiser leurs enfans au sabbat quen leglise271 the rite however was practised in bute in 1662 margret nclevine confessed that being in a litle chamber in balichtarach the devill came to her in the lyknes of a man and deseired hir to goe with him and that she refusing he said i will not blank and she gave him blank she never saw afterward and that she knew it was the devill and after he went that he came bak and asked hir to give him hir hand quhich she refusing to doe he took hir by the midle finger of the rycht hand quhich he had almost cutt off hir and therwith left hir her finger was so sorely pained for the space of a moneth ther after that ther was no pain comparable to it as also took her by the right leg quhich was sorly pained likewayes as also be the devill item he came to her againe as she was shaking straw in the barne of ardroscidell in a very ugly shape and that there he desired hir to goe with him and she refusing he said to her i will either have thy self or then thy heart item that he healed her sore foot and finger quhich finger is yet be nummed item that before he haled her that she made a covenant with him and promised to doe him any service that he wold imploy hir in item that he asked quhat was her name she answered him margret the name that god gave me and he said to her i baptise the jonet272 isobell ncnicoll confessed that as she was in her owne house her alone drawing acquavittie the devill came to her in the lyknes of a young man and desyred her to goe with him and confesses that she made a covenant with him quhairin he promised that she should not want meanes enough and she promised to be his servand item that he baptised her and gave her a new name and called her caterine item that about a moneth therafter in the night as she went out of her own back dore she met with the devill and spok with him273jonet mcnicoll confesses with remorse that about hallowday as she was in mary moores house that there appeared to her two men the on a gross copperfaced man and the other a wele favored young man and that the copperfaced man quhom she knew to be ane evil spirit bade her goe with him item confesses that she made a covenant with him and he promised that she wold not want meines eneugh and she promised to serve him and that he gave her a new name saying i baptise the mary274jonet morisoune traysted with the divill at the knockanrioch being the second tyme of her meeting with him that shee made covenant with the devill quairin she promised to be his servant etc that shee asked quhat was his name his answer was my name is klareanough and he asked quhat was her name and she answered jonet morisoun the name that god gave me and he said belive not in christ bot belive in me i baptise the margarat275 the swedish witches 1669 were also baptized they added that he caused them to be baptized too by such priests as he had there and made them confirm their baptism with dreadful oaths and imprecations276 curiously enough the most detailed account comes from new england 1692 mary osgood wife of captain osgood went to five mile pond where she was baptized by the devil who dipped her face in the water and made her renounce her former baptism and told her she must be his soul and body for ever and that she must serve him which she promised to do she says the renouncing her first baptism was after her dipping277 the account of goody laceys experience is given in the form of question and answer q goody lacey how many years since they were baptized a three or four years ago i suppose q who baptized them a the old serpent q how did he do it a he dipped their heads in the water saying that they were his and that he had power over them q where was this a at falls river q how many were baptized that day a some of the chief i think they were six baptized q name them a i think they were of the higher powers278 a near approach to the ceremony of baptism is the bloodrite at auldearne described by isobel gowdie and janet breadheid the devil marked isobel on the shoulder and suked owt my blood at that mark and spowted it in his hand and sprinkling it on my head said i baptise the janet in my awin name the devil marked janet breadheid in the same way on the shoulder and suked out my blood with his mowth at that place he spowted it in his hand and sprinkled it on my head he baptised me thairvith in his awin nam christian279 though baptism is rare the giving of a new name on admission is peculiar to scotland the names seem to have been usually nicknames derived from various sources personal peculiarities such as weill dancing janet or able and stout contractions of the proper name as naip for barbara napier or a title such as rob the rowar for robert grierson who kept the rows or rolls most of the other names appear to have been ordinary christian names arbitrarily bestowed there is nothing to throw any light on the reason for the change in 1590 at north berwick the witchname was considered of the highest importance robert griersoune being namit thay ran all hirdiegirdie and wer angrie for it wes promesit that he sould be callit rot the comptroller alias rob the rowar for expreming of his nameeffie mccalzane robert griersoune and the said barbara hapnit to be nameit thair quhilk offendit all the cumpany and that they sould nocht haif bene nameit with thair awin names robert griersoun to haif bene callit rob the rowar effie to be callit cane and the said barbara to be callit naip280 later the change of name was of so little value that at crook of devon several of the witches could not remember what they had been called bessie henderson appears to have recollected the name after a time for it is inserted towards the end of the confession robert wilson could remember the devils name but not his own agnes brugh and christian grieve could remember neither the devils nor their own281 the socalled christening ie naming of animals comes rather under the head of sacrifice than of baptism for the ceremony appears to have been purificatory 6 the mark the witches mark or devils mark as it is indifferently called is one of the most important points in the identification of a witch as the infliction of it was often the final rite in the admission ceremonies the fact that any person bore such a mark was taken as incontrovertible proof that the bearer was a witch there were two kinds of marks which should be carefully differentiated one of which was clearly natural the other probably artificial both were said to be insensible to pain and not to bleed when pricked or pierced local anaesthesia is vouched for in much of the evidence which suggests that there is a substratum of truth in the statements but i can at present offer no solution of this problem the writers on witchcraft particularly the legal authorities recognize the value of the mark as proof of witchcraft and some differentiate between the two forms the witches themselves made a distinction between the two the natural being considered inferior to the artificial reginald scot in 1584 summarizes the evidence in a few words the diuell giveth to euerie nouice a marke either with his teeth or with his clawes282 the lawes against witches and conivration published by authority in 1645 state that their said familiar hath some big or little teat upon their body wher he sucketh them and besides their sucking the devil leaveth other markes upon their bodies sometimes like a blewspot or redspot like a fleabiting sir george mackenzie the famous scotch lawyer describing in 1699 what did and did not legally constitute a witch says the devils mark useth to be a great article with us but it is not per se found relevant except it be confest by them that they got that mark with their own consent quo casu it is equivalent to a paction this mark is given to them as is alledgd by a nip in any part of the body and it is blew delrio calls it stigma or character and alledges that it is sometimes like the impression of a hares foot or the foot of a rat or spider283 forbes writing in 1730 says on the meaner proselytes the devil fixes in some secret part of their bodies a mark as his seal to know his own by which is like a flea bite or blew spot or sometimes resembles a little teat and the part so stamped doth ever after remain insensible and doth not bleed tho never so much nipped or pricked by thrusting a pin awl or bodkin into it but if the covenanter be of better rank the devil only draws blood of the party or touches him or her in some part of the body without any visible mark remaining284 the mark proper appears to have been the coloured spot or design which followed the infliction of a prick or nip by the claws or teeth of the devil on the person of the neophyte the red mark is described as being like a fleabite ie small and circular the blue mark seems to have been larger and more elaborate apparently in some kind of design from the evidence five facts are clear 1 that the mark was coloured 2 that it was permanent 3 that it was caused by the pricking or tearing of the skin 4 that the operator passed his hand or fingers over the place 5 that the pain could be severe and might last a considerable time put together in this way the facts suggest tattooing among the aberdeen witches in 1597 andro man was accused that christsunday the devil bit a mark in the third finger of thy right hand whilk thou has yet to show and christen mitchell also was accused that the devil gave thee a nip on the back of thy right hand for a mark that thou was one of his number285 according to boguet writing in 1598 the witches of eastern france were usually marked on the left shoulder and the mark was in the shape of the foot or footprint of a hare but he also gives some exceptional cases lepaule gauche est lendroit o plus ordinairement il marque les sorciers la marque des sorciers est tantost come vne piste ou pied de lieure tantost dautre faon on en a veu vne qui auoit vne figure rapportant en grandeur vn petit denier du centre de laquelle sestendoient plusieurs filamens vers la circonference

mesme de la grandeur dvn petit denier tirant sur le brun iean de vaux auoit la siee au doz ressembloit vn petit chien noir286 de lancre in 1609 says that in the bassespyrnes comme le diable faict sa marque on sent vn peu de chaleur qui penetre plus ou moins profondement la chair que plus ou moins il pince le lieu quil touche as regards the position of the mark he says il les egratigne tous auec le bras gauche les ongles de la main senestre et tout aussi tost prenant vne espingle dor faux il les marque le plus souuent dans le blc de loeil gauche leur imprime vne marque qui semble vn petit crapaud elsewhere he says vne patte de crapaud par fois dans lepaule cost gauche ou dans la cuisse leur rompant dechirant la peau la chair iusques effusi de sang si bien que pendant trois mois ils ont de tres grandes douleurs287 isobel crawford of irvine in 1618 had the devills mark quhilk was lyk ane braid dyn spott in the inner syd of hir left thie about ane handbraid under her lisk288 the lancashire witch margaret johnson in 1633 saith that such witches as have sharpe bones given them by the devill to pricke them have no papps nor duggs but their devil receiveth blood from the place pricked with the bone which witches are more grand witches than any that have marks289 the yarmouth witch tried in 1644 saw a tall black man standing in the moonlight at her door he told her he must first see her hand and then taking out something like a penknife he gave it a little scratch so that blood followed and the mark remained to that time290 rebecca jones an essex witch tried in 1645 confessed that there came one morning one to the doore and knocked and that this examinant going to the dore shee saw there a very handsome young man as shee then thought but now shee thinkes it was the devill who asked this examinant how shee did and desired to see her left wrist which shee shewed unto him and he then tooke a pin from this examinants owne sleeve and pricked her wrist twice and there came out a drop of bloud which he took off with the top of his finger and so departed291 the childwitch jonet howat of forfar tried in 1661 said that the devil kist hir and niped hir vpon one of hir shoulders so as shoe hade great paine for some tyme therafter later he came to her and calling hir his bony bird did kisse hir and straiked her shoulder quhich was niped with his hand and that presently after that shoe was eased of hir former paine elspet alexander of the same coven was also marked on the shoulder four weeks later the divill straiked hir shoulder with his fingers and after that shoe hade ease in the place formerly niped by the devill292 the witch girls at lille in 1661 stated that le diable leur fait quelque marque comme avec une aleine de fer en quelque partie du corps293 marie lamont of innerkip in 1662 confessed voluntarily that the devill nipit her upon the right syd qlk was very painful for a tym but yairefter he straikit it with his hand and healed it this she confesses to be his mark294 in bute in 1662 margaret ncwilliam was tryed for the merk there was 3 merks fund one up her left leg next hard be the shine bone another betwixt her shoulders a 3 ane uthyr up her hensh blew kat moore was tried and it was found undernethe her richt shoulder a little whyt unsensible spott295 the somerset witches in 1664 were marked on the fingers it was stated of elizabeth style that the devil prickt the fourth finger of hir right hand between the middle and upper joynt where the sign at the examination remained of alice duke that the devil prickt the fourth finger of her right hand between the middle and upper joynt where the mark is yet to be seen and of christian green that the man in black prickt the fourth finger of her righthand between the middle and upper joints where the sign yet remains296 at paisley in 1678 annabil stuart confessed that the devil took her by the hand and nipped her arm which continued to be sore for half an hour297 at borrowstowness the devil took margaret pringle by the right hand whereby it was for eight days grievowslie pained bot having it twitched of new againe it imediatelie becam haill298 of the renfrewshire coven in 1696 little thomas lindsay received a nip on the neck which continued sore for ten days and john reid had a bite or nipp in his loyn which he found painfull for a fortnight299 at pittenweem in 1704 the young lass isobel adams confessed that the devil put his mark in her flesh which was very painful300 the other form of the devils mark was the little teat it occurred on various parts of the body was said to secrete milk and to give suck to the familiars both human and animal and was sometimes cut off by the witch before being searched the descriptions of the teat point to its being that natural phenomenon the supernumerary nipple cases of polymastia or supernumerary breasts and of polythelia or supernumerary nipples are constantly recorded by modern medical observers these accessory structures are usually situated on the chest wall the upper part of the abdominal wall or in the axillae but they have been met with on the shoulder the buttock the thigh and other extraordinary positions as a rule they are functionless301 polythelia occurs in both sexes according to bruce of 315 individuals taken indiscriminately and in succession 7619 per cent presented supernumerary nipple 911 per cent of 207 men examined in succession presented supernumerary nipple and 4807 per cent of 104 women he concludes that according to present observations at least supernumerary nipples occur much more frequently in the male than in the female302 cameron tabulates the positions of the supernumerary nipple in 105 cases 96 were situated in thorax 5 in axilla 2 in back 1 on shoulder 1 outside of thigh303 all writers on the subject agree that the phenomenon is of more common occurrence than is usually supposed but that many cases pass unnoticed unless well marked when in men or causing discomfort by functioning when in women this view is supported by the fact that during the recent unparalleled opportunity for the physical examination of large numbers of men many cases have been published in the british medical journal for 1917 as occurring among recruits for the army the supernumerary nipple is usually very much smaller than the normal like the normal it is a modification of cutaneous tissue and is not attached to muscular tissue its removal is a simple operation in fact it would be quite possible for an unskilled operator to cut it off with a sharp knife in women the supernumerary nipple is observed to increase at the time of the periods in some cases during lactation so much milk is secreted as to make it a matter of indifference whether the child is suckled at the normal nipples or at the supernumerary one in cases of polymastia the nipple is not always formed the milk when secreted issuing from a small opening though the nipple is congenital the supernumerary breast may develop or at any rate become noticeable later the theory being that the ducts carrying the secretion from the supernumerary to the normal breast become blocked in some way and that the milk is thus exuded through the pore in the supernumerary breast the change in the case quoted by cameron as well as in the case of the witch rose cullender seems to have been caused by a strain making allowance for the unscientific language of the recorders of the witch trials it will be seen that the descriptions of the witchpap or little teat exactly coincide with these anatomical facts i give the evidence below the trials being in chronological order it will be observed that the cases are from england and new england only if the phenomena of polymastia and polythelia occurred in france and scotland there are no records of the fact in the witchtrials of those countries alice gooderidge and her mother elizabeth wright of stapenhill near burtonontrent were tried in 1597 the old woman they stript and found behind her right sholder a thing much like the vdder of an ewe that giueth sucke with two teates like vnto two great wartes the one behinde vnder her armehole the other a hand off towardes the top of her shoulder being demanded how long she had those teates she aunswered she was borne so then did they search alice gooderige and found vpon her belly a hole of the bignesse of two pence fresh and bloudy as though some great wart had beene cut off the place304 the witch of edmonton tried in 1621 the bench commanded three women to search the body of elizabeth sawyer they all three said that they a little aboue the fundiment of elizabeth sawyer found a thing like a teate the bignesse of the little finger and the length of half a finger which was branched at the top like a teate and seemed as though one had suckt it and that the bottome thereof was blew and the top of it was redde305 the greatest number of cases recorded in one place is in essex during the trials before sir matthew hale in 1645 anne leech said that her imps did usually suck those teats which were found about the privie parts of her body two women searched mary greenleife and found that the said mary had bigges or teates in her secret parts not like emerods nor in those places where women use to be troubled with them the examinant being asked how she came by those teats which were discovered in her secret parts she saith she knows not unlesse she was born with them but she never knew she had any such untill this time a woman searched margaret moone she found three long teates or bigges in her secret parts which seemed to have been lately sucked and that they were not like pyles for this informant knows well what they are having been troubled with them herself upon the searching of her daughters this informant found that two of them had biggs in their privy parts as the said margaret their mother had several women were required to search sarah hating the wife of william hating elizabeth harvy widow and marian hocket widow and upon her said search being a midwife found such marks or bigges that she never saw in other women for sarah hating had foure teats or bigges in those parts almost an inch long and as bigge as this informants little finger that the said elizabeth harvy had three such biggs and about the same scantling and that the said marian hocket had no such bigges but was found in the same parts not like other honest women sarah barton the sister of the said marian hocket also suspected of being a witch said the said marian had cut off her bigs whereby she might have been suspected to have been a witch and laid plaisters to those places306 another evidence deposed that she once heard the said margaret landish say that her imps did usually suck two teats near the privy parts307 in huntingdonshire in 1646 john clarke junior a labourer was tried for witchcraft john browne a tailor deposed that he met clarke on the road clarke said he was in haste for his father and mother were accused for witches and that hee himselfe had beene searched and this informant answered and so have i then clarke asked this informant whether any thing were found about him or not he this informant answered that they said there were marks clarke said againe had you no more wit but to have your marks found i cut off mine three dayes before i was searched308 john palmer of st albans 1649 confessed that upon his compact with the divel hee received a flesh brand or mark upon his side which gave suck to two familiars309 there were several cases in yorkshire in 1649 they searched the body of the saide mary sikes and founde upon the side of her seate a redd lumpe about the biggnes of a nutt being wett and that when they wrung it with theire fingers moisture came out of it like lee and they founde upon her left side neare her arme a litle lumpe like a wart and being puld out it stretcht about halfe an inch and they further say that they never sawe the like upon anie other weomen310 in 1650 frances ward saith that she was one of the fower that searched margaret morton and found upon her two black spotts between her thigh and her body they were like a wart but it was none and the other was black on both sides an inch bread and blew in the middest311 at scarborough in 1651 margery ffish widdow beinge commanded to searche the bodye of anne hunnam otherwise marchant who was accused for witchcraft she this informante and elizabeth jackson and eliz dale did accordingly searche the body of the saide anne hunnam otherwise marchant and did finde a little blue spott upon her left side into which spott this informant did thrust a pinne att which the sd ann hunnam never moved or seemed to feel it which spott grows out of her ffleshe or skin at her waste of a great bignesse elizabeth dale informeth upon oath that she did together with margery ffish searche ann hunnam otherwise marchant her bodye and saith that their was found on her left buttock a blue spott growing out of her fleshe or skin like a greate warte312 the kentish witch mary read of lenham in 1652 had a visible teat under her tongue and did show it to many and it was likewise seen by this observator313 in the case of the salisbury witch anne bodenham in 1652 women searched the witch in the gaol and they delivered on their oaths at the assises that they found on her shoulder a certain mark or teat about the length and bignesse of the niple of a womans breast and hollow and soft as a niple with a hole on the top of it and searching further they likewise found in her secret place another teat soft and like the former on her shoulder314 in yorkshire again in 1654 katherine earle was accused and the said katherine hathe beene searched and a marke founde upon her in the likenesse of a papp315 at st albans about 1660 there was a manwitch who had like a breast on his side316 in the same year at kidderminster a widow her two daughters and a man were brought to trial the man had five teats the mother three and the eldest daughter one when they went to search the woman none were visible one advised to lay them on their backs and keep open their mouths and they would appear and so they presently appeared in sight317 alice huson of burton agnes yorks in 1664 stated that i have i confess a witchpap which is sucked by the unclean spirit318 abre grinset of dunwich suffolk in 1665 said the devil did appear in the form of a pretty handsom young man first and since appeareth to her in the form of a blackish gray cat or kitling that it sucketh of a tett which searchers since saw in the place she mentioned319 in the same year also in suffolk rose cullender was tried for witchcraft the searchers six women began at her head and so stript her naked and in the lower part of her belly they found a thing like a teat of an inch long they questioned her about it and she said that she had got a strain by carrying of water which caused that excrescence but upon narrower search they found in her privy parts three more excrescencies or teats but smaller than the former this deponent farther saith that in the long teat at the end thereof there was a little hole and it appeared unto them as if it had been lately sucked and upon the straining of it there issued out white milky matter320 temperance lloyd a devon witch was tried in 1682 upon search of her body this informant did find in her secret parts two teats hanging nigh together like unto a piece of flesh that a child had suckt and each of the said teats was about an inch in length321 bridget bishop one of the new england witches was tried in 1692 a jury of women found a preternatural teat upon her body but upon a second search within 3 or 4 hours there was no such thing to be seen322 elizabeth horner another devon witch tried in 1696 had something like a nipple on her shoulder which the children who gave evidence said was sucked by a toad323 widow coman an essex witch died a natural death in 1699 upon her death i requested becke the midwife to search her body in the presence of some sober women which she did and assured me she never saw the like in her life that her fundament was open like a mousehole and that in it were two long bigges out of which being pressed issued blood that they were neither piles nor emrods for she knew both but excrescencies like to biggs with nipples which seemed as if they had been frequently sucked324 elinor shaw and mary phillips were executed in northampton in 1704 for witchcraft the infernal imps did nightly suck each of them a large teat or pieces of red flesh in their privy parts325 the positions of the marks are worth noting of the coloured mark it will be seen from the evidence given above that there were certain welldefined positions which is in itself a strong suggestion of the artificial character of this mark in france the usual position was the left shoulder in the bassespyrnes the left eye the left side and the thigh were also commonly marked the variations given by boguet are the abdomen the back and the right side of the neck in england it seems that only the hand and wrist were marked in somerset the exact position was between the upper and middle joints of the fourth finger of the right hand probably the ringfinger but whether on the outer or inner surface is not recorded in scotland the position is very varied the right hand the right side the shoulder the back the neck and the loin at aberdeen the position on the right hand is still further defined as being on the back and on the third finger ie the ringfinger reginald scot does not distinguish between the two kinds of marks when he says that if the witch have anie privie marke under hir arme pokes under hir haire under hir lip or in her buttocke or in her privities it is a presumption sufficient for the judge to proceed to give sentence of death upon her326 but from the positions in which supernumerary nipples are known to occur it would seem that he is speaking of the little teat and not of the coloured mark in six out of the thirtytwo cases of supernumerary nipple cited above the number of nipples is not given though from the context it would appear that more than one was often found on each of the accused if therefore we allow two apiece for those cases not definitely specified there were sixtythree such nipples an average roughly of two to each person the number varying however from one to five this last being a man the position of the nipple on the body is given in fortyfive out of the sixtythree cases abdomen 2 axilla 1 buttock 1 fundament 3 groin 2 pudenda 30 shoulder 3 side 3 under tongue 1 in writing of supernumerary nipples and mammae erraticae williams

xxv 225 seq iv the assemblies there were two kinds of assemblies the one known as the sabbath was the general meeting of all the members of the religion the other to which i giveon the authority of estebne de cambruethe name of esbat was only for the special and limited number who carried out the rites and practices of the cult and was not for the general public the derivation of the word sabbath in this connexion is quite unknown it has clearly nothing to do with the number seven and equally clearly it is not connected with the jewish ceremonial it is possibly a derivative of sesbattre to frolic a very suitable description of the joyous gaiety of the meetings 1 sabbath locomotionthe method of going to the meetings varied according to the distance to be traversed in an immense majority of cases the means of locomotion are not even mentioned presumably therefore the witches went on foot as would naturally be the case in going to the local meeting or esbat which was attended only by those who lived near there are however a few instances where it was thought worth while to mention that the worshippers walked to the meeting boguet 1598 who yields to none in his accounts of magical means of going to the sabbath says les sorciers netmoins vont quelquefois de pied au sabbat ce qui leur aduient principalement lors que le lieu o ils font leur assemble nest pas guieres eslongn de leur habitation and cites in confirmation the evidence of george and antoinette gandillon and their father pierre clauda ianprost clauda ianguillaume iaquema paget gros iaques the

locked the door and put the key under the same and that ye and the said margaret young your neighbor came foot for foot to the foresaid meeting and that ye stayed at the foresaid meeting about the space of two hours and came back again on your foot and the foresaid margaret young with you and found the key of the door in that same place where you left it and declared that neither your husband nor any other in the house was waking at your return333 at lille 1661 the girl bellot then aged fifteen said that her mother had taken her with her when she was very young and had even carried her in her arms to the witches sabbaths or assemblies334 at strathdown eighteenth century the witches went along the side of the river avon to craicpolnain fording the river on foot335 in the cases cited above there is nothing in the least bizarre or extraordinary but there are other methods recorded of reaching the distant meetings sometimes the obvious means was by riding on a horse sometimes the witches were accused or claimed the power of flying through the air of riding in the air on a stick of riding on animals or human beings which latter were sometimes in their own natural form and sometimes enchanted into the form of animals the following instances are of those who rode to or from the meetings on horseback agnes sampson of north berwick 1590 said that the devil in mans likeness met her going out in the fields from her own house at keith betwixt five and six at even being her alone and commanded her to be at northberwick kirk the next night and she passed there on horseback conveyed by her goodson called iohn couper336 boguet 1608 mentions in passing the fact that the witches sometimes rode on horses337 the lancashire witches 1613 after the meeting at malking tower went out of the said house in their owne shapes and likenesses and they all by that they were forth of the dores gotten on horseback like vnto foals some of one colour some of another338 this was the usual mode of locomotion among the lancashire witches for margaret johnson 1633 said that at the meeting at hoarstones there was at yt tyme between 30 and 40 witches who did all ride to the said meetinge339 isobell gowdie 1662 said i haid a little horse and wold say horse and hattock in the divellis name340 the most detailed account is from sweden 1669 another boy confessed too that one day he was carried away by his mistriss and to perform the journey he took his own fathers horse out of the meadow where it was and upon his return she let the horse go in her own ground the next morning the boys father sought for his horse and not finding it gave it over for lost but the boy told him the whole story and so his father fetcht the horse back again341 we now come to the marvellous and magical means of locomotion the belief in the power of witches to ride in the air is very ancient and universal in europe they flew either unsupported being carried by the devil or were supported on a stick sometimes however an animal which they rode passed through the air the flying was usually preceded by an anointing of the whole or part of the body with a magical ointment the earliest example of unsupported flying is from paul grilland 1537 who gives an account of an italian witch in 1526 who flew in the air with the help of a magic ointment342 reginald scot 1584 says that the ointment whereby they ride in the aire was made of the flesh of unbaptized children and gives two recipes 1 the fat of yoong children and seeth it with water in a brasen vessell reseruing the thickest of that which remaineth boiled in the bottome which they laie up and keepe untill occasion serueth to use it they put hereunto eleoselinum aconitum frondes populeas and soote 2 sium acarum vulgare pentaphyllon the blood of a flitter mouse solanum somniferum and oleum they stampe all these togither and then they rubbe all parts of their bodys exceedinglie till they looke red and be verie hot so as the pores may be opened and their flesh soluble and loose they ioine herewithall either fat or oil in steed thereof that the force of the ointment maie the rather pearse inwardly and so be more effectuall by this means in a moonlight night they seeme to be carried in the aire343 so far this is only hearsay evidence but there is also a certain amount of firsthand testimony the witches declaring that they actually passed through the air above ground or had seen others do so in 1598 thieuenne paget racontoit que le diable sapparut elle la premiere fois en plein midy en forme dvn grand homme noir que comme elle se fut baille luy il lembrassa lesleva en lair la transporta en la maison du prel de longchamois puis la rapporta au lieu mesme o il lauoit prise antide colas disoit

comme si ceust est vn vent froid lempoignant par la teste344 isaac de queyran 1609 whose evidence has already been quoted said that the witches living at a distance flew home through the air345 in france 1652 lors quelle vouloit aller aux danses elle se oindoit dung onguen qui lui estoit donn par vn sorcier envoy par le diable que lors elle sen alloit comme ung vent aux dictes danses avecque les aultres346 at crook of devon 1661 bessie henderson confessed that ye was taken out of your bed to that meeting in an flight347 the most detail comes from an english source the somerset witches 1664 claimed that they habitually flew through the air by means of a magical oil and magical words elizabeth style said before they are carried to their meetings they anoint their foreheads and handwrists with an oyl the spirit brings them which smells raw and then they are carried in a very short time using these words as they pass thout tout a tout tout throughout and about and when they go off from their meetings they say rentum tormentum all are carried to their several homes in a short space alice duke gave the same testimony noting besides that the oil was greenish in colour anne bishop the officer of the somerset covens confessed that her forehead being first anointed with a feather dipt in oyl she hath been suddenly carried to the place of their meeting after all was ended the man in black vanished the rest were on a sudden conveighed to their homes348 the belief that the witches actually rode in the air seated on some concrete object such as an animal a human being or a stick is both ancient and universal and is reflected in the ecclesiastical and civil laws of which the earliest is the decree of the ninth century attributed to the council of ancyra certeine wicked women following sathans prouocations being seduced by the illusion of diuels beleeve and professe that in the night times they ride abroad with diana the goddesse of the pagans or else with herodias with an innumerable multitude vpon certeine beasts and doo whatsoeuer those fairies or ladies command349 the laws of lorraine 132946 decree that celui qui fera magie sortilge billets de sort pronostic doiseau ou se vanteroit davoir chevauch la nuit avec diane ou telle autre vielle qui se dit magicienne sera banni et payera dix livres tournois350 the witches themselves confirmed the statements about riding on animals to the sabbath rolande du vernier 1598 confessed que lors quelle y fut elle y alla sur vn gros mouton noir qui la portoit si viste en lair quelle ne se pouuoit recognoistre351 de lancre says that the witches se font porter iusquaudit lieu sur vne beste qui semble parfois vn cheual parfoys vn homme352 margaret johnson 1633 saith if they desyre to be in any place upon a sodaine theire devill or spirit will upon a rodde dogge or any thinge els presently convey them thither353 one of madame bourignons girls then aged twelve 1661 declared that her said lover came upon a little horse and took her by the hand asking her if she would be his mistress and she saying ay she was catched up into the air with him and the other girls and they flew all together to a great castle354 the swedish witches 1669 said he set us on a beast which he had there ready and carried us over churches and high walls he gives us a horn with a salve in it wherewith we do anoint our selves and then he gives us a saddle with a hammer and a wooden nail thereby to fix the saddle whereupon we call upon the devil and away we go for their journey they said they made use of all sorts of instruments of beasts of men of spits and posts what the manner of their journey is god alone knows blockula is scituated in a delicate large meadow whereof you can see no end they went into a little meadow distinct from the other where the beasts went that they used to ride on but the men whom they made use of in their journey stood in the house by the gate in a slumbering posture sleeping against the wall355 human beings were also said to be ridden upon in other places besides sweden agnes spark of forfar 1661 said she hard people ther present did speake of isabell shirie and say that shoe was the devills horse and that the divill did allwayes ryde upon hir and that shoe was shoad lyke ane mare or ane horse356 ann armstrong of a northumbrian coven 1673 saith that since she gave information against severall persons who ridd her to severall places where they had conversation with the divell she hath beene severall times lately ridden by anne driden and anne forster and was last night ridden by them to the rideing house in the close on the common whilst she was lying in that condition ie a fitt which happened one night a little before christmas about the change of the moone the informant see the said anne forster come with a bridle and bridled her and ridd upon her crosseleggd till they come to the rest of her companions at rideing millne bridgend where they usually mett and when she light of her back pulld the bridle of this informers head now in the likenesse of a horse but when the bridle was taken of she stood up in her own shape and when they had done bridled this informer and the rest of the horses and rid home upon collupp munday last being the tenth of february the said persons met at allensford where this informant was ridden upon by an inchanted bridle by michael aynsley and margaret his wife which inchanted bridle when they tooke it from her head she stood upp in her owne proper person on monday last at night she being in her fathers house see one jane baites of corbridge come in the forme of a gray catt with a bridle hanging on her foote and breathd upon her and struck her dead and bridled her and rid upon her in the name of the devill southward but the name of the place she does not now remember and the said jane allighted and pulld the bridle of her head357 the method of locomotion which has most impressed the popular imagination and has become proverbial was riding on a stick generally said to be a broomstick it must however be remembered that one of the earliest cases on record of stickriding does not definitely state that the witch flew through the air this was the case of the lady alice kyteler in 1324 when in rifleing the closet of the ladie they found a pipe of oyntment wherewith she greased a staffe upon the which she ambled and galloped through thick and thin when and in what maner she listed358 though holinshed is not always a reliable authority it is worth while to compare this account with the stickriding of the arab witches and the treeriding of the aberdeen covens see pp 110 134 the number of cases vouched for by the persons who actually performed or saw the feat of riding on a stick through the air are disappointingly few guillaume edeline prior of st germainenlaye 1453 se mit en telle servitude de lennemy quil luy convenoit estre en certain lieu toutes fois quil estoit par ledit ennemy vocqu ouquel

doth by meanes of a staffe or rod which he deliuereth vnto the or promiseth to doo it by force of a certen oyntment which he will geue them and sometimes he offreth them an horse to ride vpon361 boguets experience 1598 is more dramatic than that of danaeus les autres y vont tantost sur vn bouc tantost sur vn cheual tantost sur vn ballet ou ramasse sortans ces derniers de leurs maisons le plus

julian cox 1664 said that one evening she walkt out about a mile from her own house and there came riding towards her three persons upon three broomstaves born up about a yard and an half from the ground two of them she formerly knew which was a witch and a wizzard the third person she knew not he came in the shape of a black man368 two of the new england witches 1692 confessed to riding on a pole mary osgood wife of capt osgood of andover was carried through the air to fivemile pond she was transported back again through the air in company with the forenamed persons in the same manner as she went and believes they were carried upon a pole369 goody fosters evidence was reported by two authors one foster confessed that the devil carryd them on a pole to a witchmeeting but the pole broke and she hanging about martha carriers neck they both fell down and she then received an hurt by the fall whereof she was not at this very time recovered370 the second account is substantially the same in particular goody f said inter alia that she with two others one of whom acknowledged the same rode from andover to the same village witch meeting upon a stick above ground and that in the way the stick brake and gave the said f a fall whereupon said she i got a fall and hurt of which i am still sore371 sitethe sabbath seems to have been originally held on a fixed site so much so was this the case that de lancre is able to say communement ils lappellent aquelarre qui signifie lane de bouc comme qui diroit la lane ou lde o le bouc conuoque ses assemblees et de faict les sorciers qui confessent nommet le lieu pour la chose la chose ou assemblee pour le lieu tellement quencore que proprement lane de bouc soit le sabbat qui se tient s landes si estce quils appellent aussi bien lane de bouc le sabbat qui se tient s eglises s places des villages paroisses maisons autres lieux372 the confusion of the original lane de bouc ie the sabbath or great assembly with local meetings is thus shown to be due to the inaccuracy of the witches themselves and therefore it is not surprising that de lancre and other authors should also fail to distinguish between the two still in many of the records there are certain indications by which it is possible to recognize the localities where the real sabbath the true lane de bouc was held de lancre himself notes that the sabbath must be held near a lake stream or water of some kind373 bodin however gives a better clue les lieux des assemblees des sorciers sont notables signalez de quelques arbres ou croix374 the croix is clearly the christian form of the standing stone which is a marked feature in many descriptions of the sabbath and bodins statement recalls one of the laws of cnut in the eleventh century we earnestly forbid every heathenism heathenism is that men worship idols that is that they worship heathen gods or stones or forest trees of any kind estebne de cambrue 1567 said le lieu de ceste grande conuocation sappelle generalement par tout le pays la lanne de bouc o ils se mettent dancer lentour dvne pierre qui est plante audit lieu sur laquelle est assis vn grand homme noir375 at poictiers in 1574 four witches one woman and three men said that they went trois fois lan lassemblee generale o plusieurs sorciers se trouuoyet prs dvne croix dvn carrefour qui seruoit denseigne376 at aberdeen in 1596 the witches acknowledged that they danced round the market cross and the fische croce on allhalloweve and also round ane gray stane at the foot of the hill at craigleauch377 margaret johnson 1633 said shee was not at the greate meetinge at hoarestones at the forest of pendle upon all saints day378 though no stone is actually mentioned the name suggests that there had been or still were one or more stones standing in that place the swedish witches 1669 seem to have used the same site for both kinds of meetings blockula seems to have been a building of some kind set in a meadow which was entered by a painted gate within the building were rooms and some kind of chapel for the religious service379 the new england recorders 1692 did not enter into much detail but even among them the fact is mentioned that there was a general meeting of the witches in a field at salemvillage380 in modern times the identification of stones or of certain places with the devil or with witch meetings is very noticeable out of innumerable instances i will mention only a few in guernsey the catioroc is always identified as the site of the sabbath in belgium godarville hainaut se trouve un tunnel hant par

prs de grandhalleux382 it is also noticeable how many of our own stone circles such as the nine maidens the dancing maidens and so on are connected by tradition with women who danced there on the sabbath dateit appears from the evidence that certain changes took place in course of time in the religion and as might be expected this is shown very markedly in the festivals the ancient festivals remained all through and to them were added the festivals of the succeeding religions the original celebrations belonged to the maynovember year a division of time which follows neither the solstices nor the agricultural seasons i have shown below pp 130 178 that there is reason to believe these festivals were connected with the breeding seasons of the flocks and herds the chief festivals were in the spring may eve april 30 called roodmas or rood day in britain and walpurgisnacht in germany in the autumn november eve october 31 called in britain allhallow eve between these two came in the winter candlemas february 2 and in the summer the gule of august august 1 called lammas in britain to these were added the festivals of the solstitial invaders beltane at midsummer and yule at midwinter the movable festival of easter was also added but the equinoxes were never observed in britain on the advent of christianity the names of the festivals were changed and the date of oneroodmaswas slightly altered so as to fall on may 3 otherwise the dates were observed as before but with ceremonies of the new religion therefore boguet is justified in saying that the witches kept all the christian festivals but the great assemblies were always held on the four original days and it is this fact which makes it possible to distinguish with certainty between the sabbath and the esbat whenever dates are mentioned de lancre generalizing from the evidence before him says quelquefois il y a des sabbats assemblees generales qui se font ordinairement les quatre festes annuelles383 and he also gives the words of a witch tried in 1567 estebne de cambrue dit que les sorcieres nalloient en la grande assemblee au grand sabbat que quatre fois lanne384 the four actual days are given in only one trial that of issobell smyth at forfar in 1661 by these meitings shee mett with him every quarter at candlemas rudday lambemas and hallomas385 but it is very clear that these were the regular days from the mention of them individually in both england and scotland at north berwick barbara napier was accused of being present at the convention on lammas eve at the new haven three covens ie thirtynine persons were assembled and the said barbara was accused that she gave her bodily presence upon all hallow even last was 1590 years to the frequent convention holden at the kirk of northberwick where she danced endlong the kirkyard and gelie duncan played on a trump john fian missellit led the ring agnes sampson and her daughters and all the rest following the said barbara to

does not enter into her usual detail but merely states that a grand meitting vold be about the end of ilk quarter392 of the festivals belonging to later religions several mentions are made de lancre when giving a general account of the ceremonies says that the witches of the bassespyrnes went to their assemblies at easter and other solemn festivals and that their chief night was that of st john the baptist393 jane bosdeau from the puydedme district 1594 bears this out for she went to a meeting with the devil at midnight on the eve of st john394 antide colas 1598 auoit est au sabbat vn chacun

sabbath by being primarily for business whereas the sabbath was purely religious in both feasting and dancing brought the proceedings to a close the business carried on at the esbat was usually the practice of magic for the benefit of a client or for the harming of an enemy sometimes the devil appears to have ordered his followers to perform some action by which to impress the imagination of those who believed in his power though they did not worship him very often also the esbat was for sheer enjoyment only without any ulterior object as the following quotations show estebne de cambrue 1567 who is the authority for the name esbat as applied to local meetings says that les petites assembles qui se font pres des villes ou parroisses o il ny va que ceux du lieu ils les appellent les esbats se font ores en vn lieu de ladicte paroisse ores en vn autre o on ne faict que sauter folastrer le diable ny estant auec tout son grand arroy comme aux grandes assemblees407 alesoun peirsoun

gairdner the elder and janet thomson411 in forfar helen guthrie 1661 confessed that she went to several meetings at one in the churchyard they daunced togither and the ground under them wes all fyre

ceremonies performed by the witches with the help of the devil were usually for the destruction of or for doing harm to an enemy sometimes however the spells were originally for the promotion of fertility but were misunderstood by the recorders and probably by the witches themselves alexia violaea 1589 said that nachdem sie were mit ihren gespielen umb und umb gelauffen eine ziemliche gut

land418 the greater number of meetings were occupied with business of a magical character with the intention of harming certain specified persons though any other kind of business was also transacted the north berwick witches opened the graves which the devil indicated in order to obtain the means of making charms with dead mens bones on another occasion they attempted to wreck a ship by magic419 the lang niddry witches 1608 went to the house of beigis tod where they drank and there christened a cat420 the lancashire witches 1613 met at malking tower for two purposes the first was to give a name to the familiar of alison device which could not be done as she was not present being then in prison the second was to arrange a scheme or plot for the release of mother demdike the principal witch of the community then a prisoner in lancaster castle the plot involved the killing of the gaoler and governor and the blowing up of the castle421 in 1630 alexander hamilton was tried in edinburgh the said alexr hamiltoun haifing concaivet ane deidlie haitrent agains umqle elizabeth lausone lady ormestoun younger becaus the said alexr being at her zet asking for almous she choisit him

sunday after where there was at yt tyme between 30 and 40 witches who did all ride to the said meetinge and the end of theire said meeting was to consult for the killinge and hurtinge of men and beasts423 the forfar witches 1661 claimed to have wrecked a ship424 isobel gowdie 1662 is as usual very dramatic in her account on one occasion the witches met to make a charm against the minister of auldearne mr harie forbes satan wes with ws and learned ws the wordis to say thryse ower quhan we haid learned all thes wordis from the divell we fell all down wpon owr kneis with owr hear down ower

recowering from the said seiknes when making an image only a few of the witches were present with the devil425 marie lamont 1662 claimed that her coven raised storms on two occasions and on a third they in the likeness of kats and the devil as a man with cloven feet made a charm with wyt sand against blackhall younger and mr john hamilton426 amongst the most detailed accounts of the wax or clay images and of the ritual for killing the person whom the image represented are those of the somerset witches427 1664 the baptism of the figure is an interesting point the paisley witches 1678 had a meeting to make a clay figure in order to kill an enemy of the witch in whose house the meeting was held428 at borrowstowness part of the accusation was that ye and ilk ane of yow was at ane metting with the devill and other witches at the croce of murestane upon the threttein of october last where you all danced and the devill acted the pyiper and where yow indewored to have destroyed andrew mitchell429 in new england the witches accused george burroughs that he brought poppets to them and thorns to stick into those poppets430 at the esbats it is also evident that the devil wished to maintain an appearance of miraculous power not only before the world at large but in the eyes of the witches as well this will account for the meetings on the seashore in raging storms when vessels were liable to be wrecked and there are also many indications that the destruction of an enemy was effected by means more certain than the making and pricking of a wax or clay figure means which were used after the figure had been made some of the methods of maintaining this prestige are of the simplest others are noted without any explanation satan faict en ce lieu le sabbat tant de choses estrges nouuelles que leur simplicit abus prend cela pour quelques miracles431 at forfar 1661 the means of obtaining the result are apparent during a great storm the devil and the witches destroyed the bridge of cortaquhie and the destruction was so arranged as to appear to have been effected by magical power but helen guthrie confessed that they went to the bridge of cortaquhie with intentione to pull it doune and that for this end shee her selfe jonnet stout and others of them did thrust ther shoulderis againest the bridge and that the divell wes bussie among them acting his pairt issobell smyth who also assisted on the occasion said wee all rewed that meitting for wee hurt our selves lifting432 still more simple was the method of destroying the harvest of a field at crook of devon where bessie henderson confessed and declared that janet paton was with you at ane meeting when they trampit down thos whites rie in the beginning of harvest 1661 and that she had broad soales and trampit down more nor any of the rest433 the devil of mohra in sweden cared only to impress his followers when the wall which they were building fell down some of the witches are commonly hurt which makes him laugh but presently he cures them again434 sitein some places the esbat was held at a fixed site in others the site varied from week to week in both cases the locality was always in the near neighbourhood of the village whose inhabitants attended the meeting pour le lieu ordinaire cest s carrefours come disoit isaac de queyran qui deposoit y auoir est au carrefour du palays galienne prs

al of them togither nor at once but certen of them whom he pleaseth to call so that he apointeth where they shall meete and at what houre of the day or of the nighte437 the windsor witches however did accustome to meete within the backeside of maister dodges in the pittes there438 boguets evidence also points to there being a settled site for the esbat in each village les sorciers du cost de

moille se tenoit en la cour du prior du mesme lieu439 jane bosdeau 1594 went twice a week regularly to a rendezvous of above sixty witches at puy de dome440 and the swedish witches went so uniformly to one place that there was a special building for their rites they unanimously confessed that blockula is scituated in a delicate large meadow whereof you can see no end the place or house they met at had before it a gate painted with divers colours through this gate they went into a little meadow distinct from the other in a huge large room of this house they said there stood a very long table at which the witches did sit down and that hard by this room was another chamber where there were very lovely and delicate beds441 on the whole the weight of evidence in england and scotland is in favour of danaeuss statement that there was no fixed site though this should be taken as referring to the local meetings only not to the great assemblies the forfar witchtrials give much information helen guthrie wes at a meitting in the church yeard of forfar in the holfe therof betwixt the oatseid and the bearseid barleysowing she wes at ane other meitting at the pavilione hollis this same year

1664 varied in this respect those of wincanton met in different places elizabeth style hath been at several general meetings in the night at high common and a common near motcombe at a place near marnhull and at other placesalice duke hath been at several meetings in lie common and other places in the night but the brewham coven appear to have met commonly at husseys knap in brewham forest445 occasionally a reason is given for the change of site parfois vn sabbat finy vn coin de paroisse on sen va le tenir vne autre o le diable mene les mesmes personnes mais l on y en rencontre dautres446 sometimes also a sidelight is thrown upon these gatherings which explains the fact that in many cases the witches said that they did not know all the people present at a given meeting antoine tornier et iaquema paget ont confess que comme elles retournoient certain iour par ensemble de glanner passans au long du pr de longchamois elles appereurent que lon y tenoit le sabbat surquoy elles poserent

grassy place by which was a cart path and sandy ground in the path in which were the tracks of horses feet448 date and hourthere was no fixed day or hour for the esbat and in this it differed from the sabbath which was always at night the devil let his followers know the time either by going to them himself or by sending a message by the officer the message might be by word of mouth or by some signal understood by the initiated though there was no fixed day for the esbat it seems probable that one day in the week was observed in each locality danaeus in his general survey of the cult in 1575 says he apointeth where they shall meete and at what houre of the day or of the night wherein they haue no surenes nor certentie for these meetinges are not weekely nor monthly nor yeerely but when and how often it shall seeme good to this their maister and many times himself warneth them to meete sometimes hee apoynteth others to warne them in his staede but when he doth it himself he

and friday met a rendezvous of aboue sixty witches at puy de dome451 boguet says that the day of the sabbath was variable usually thursday night452 while according to bodin the most frequent was entre la nuict du lundi mardi453 boguet also goes on to say le sabbat ne se tient pas tousiours de nuict ains que les sorciers y vont aussi quelquefois de iour selon que firent antoine tornier iaquema paget plusieurs autres de leur secte le confessent454 the lorraine witches also had the same custom alle zugleich so viel ihrer bisher in lotharingen peinlich sind verhret worden bekandten dass solche

notice to be ready on all solemn appointments and meetings which are ordinarily on tuesday or wednesday night456 janet breadheid of the auldearne coven emphasizes the irregularity of the dates efter that we vold still meit euerie ten twelve or twantie dayes continwally457 marie lamont merely notes that the meetings were at night the devil came to kattrein scotts house in the midst of the night when she had been at a mietting sine zowle last with other witches in the night the devill convoyed her home in the dawing458 the somerset witches had no special night at every meeting before the spirit vanisheth away he appoints the next meeting place and time459 and mary green went to a meeting on thursday night before whitsunday last460 at paisley the meeting was on thursday the 4th of january 1678 in the night in john stuarts house461 the swedish witches were much harder worked whereas formerly one journey a week would serve his turn from their own town to the place aforesaid now they were forced to run to other towns and places for children and that some of them did bring with them some fifteen some sixteen children every night462 the more modern examples suggest that the date became more fixed on croit que cest toujours un vendredi soir que les sorciers et sorcires se runissent463 sorciers et sorcires vont au sabbat le vendredi travers les airs464 footnotes footnote

never given and probably varied in different localities but the general rule of the ritual at the sabbath seems to have been that proceedings began by the worshippers paying homage to the devil who sat or stood in a convenient place the homage consisted in renewing the vows of fidelity and obedience in kissing the devil on any part of his person that he chose to indicate and sometimes in turning a certain number of times widdershins then followed the reports of all magic worked since the previous sabbath either by individuals or at the esbats and at the same time the witches consulted the master as to their cases and received instructions from him how to proceed after which came admissions to the society or marriages of the members this ended the business part of the meeting immediately after all the business was transacted the religious service was celebrated the ceremonial of which varied according to the season of the year and it was followed by the obscene fertility rites the whole ceremony ended with feasting and dancing and the assembly broke up at dawn this was apparently the usual course of the ritual of the sabbath the esbat had less ceremonial and the religious service was not performed the devil himself often went round and collected the congregation and not being in his grand arroy he appeared as a man in ordinary dress instead of the religious service with the adoration of the god the witches worked the spells and charms with which they bewitched or unbewitched their enemies and friends or they exercised new methods which they learnt from their master or received instructions how to practise the arts of healing and secret poisoning of causing and blasting fertility there are a few general accounts of the usual course of the sabbath ritual danaeus 1575 does not distinguish clearly between the two classes of meetings but at the same time he seems to have realized that a certain order was followed satan calleth them togither into a diuelish sinagoge and that he may also vnderstand of them howe well and diligently they haue fulfilled their office of intoxicating committed vnto them and wh they haue slaine wherefore they meete togither in certen apointed places whe they meete together he appeareth visibly vnto them in sundrie fourmes as the head and chiefe of that congregation then doe they all repeate the othe which they haue geuen vnto him in acknowledging him to be their god the fal they to dauncing whiche beeing all finished then he demaundeth agayne of them what they woulde require of him vnto some he geueth poysons ready made and others he teacheth howe to make and mingle new finally if in any thing they neede his presence and helpe by couenant he promiseth to be present with them465 boguet 1589 is more exact as he obtained his knowledge at first hand les sorciers estans assemblez en leur synagogue adorent premierement satan ils luy offrent des chandelles le baisent aux parties honteuses de derriere quelquefois encor il tient vne image noire quil faut baiser aux sorciers les sorciers en second lieu dansent les danses finies les sorciers viennent saccoupler les sorciers apres sestre veautrez parmy les plaisirs immondes de la chair banquettent se festoient les sorciers rendent conte satan de ce quils ont fait ds la derniere assemble il fait renoncer de nouueau ces miserables dieu chresme baptesme il leur fait rafraischir le serment solennel quils ont fait466 the english account is put together from foreign sources to a great extent they are carryed out of the house either by the window door or chimney mounted on their imps thus brought to the designed place they find a great number of others arrived there by the same means who before lucifer takes his place in his throne as king do make their accustomed homage adoring and proclaiming him their lord and rendring him all honour this solemnity being finished they sit to table where no delicate meats are wanting at the sound of many pleasant instruments the table is taken away and the pleasant consort invites them to a ball at the last the lights are put out the incubuss in the shapes of proper men satisfy the desires of the witches and the succubuss serve for whores to the wizards at last before aurora brings back the day each one mounts on his spirit and so returns to his respective dwelling place sometimes at their solemn assemblies the devil commands that each tell what wickedness he hath committed when the assembly is ready to break up and the devil to dispatch them he publisheth this law with a loud voice revenge your selves or else you shall dye then each one kissing the posteriors of the devil returns upon their aiery vehicles to their habitations467 2 homage in some places the witches saluted their chief by falling on their knees and also by certain manual gestures in other places by curtsies and obeisances in scotland france and belgium another rite was also in vogue that of kissing the devil on any part of his person that he might direct at como and brescia the witches when they paid reverence to the presiding demon bent themselves backwards lifting a foot in the air forwards468 remigius writing of the lorraine witches in 1589 says es erzehlte die beatrix bayona dass einer unter ihnen allen der oberster wer welcher in einer zell auff einem hohen stuhl ssse sehr ernsthafftig und prchtig heraus zu demselbigen trete je einer nach dem andern mit furcht und zittern falle ihm zum zeichen seiner ehrerbietung fr die fsse und umbfange ihn mit aller demuth und reverentzerstlich fallen sie nieder auff ihre knie darnach legen sie die hnde ausswendig zusammen als diejenigen pflegen zu thun welche obtestiren jedoch auff dem rcken und verkehrter weise sie haben den rcken zu ihm gewandt bleiben so lang kniend biss er selbsten zu ihnen sagt dass es genugsam sey469 in somerset 1664 the witches always mention the salutation at their first meeting the man in black bids them welcome and they all make low obeysance to himelizabeth style alice duke anne bishop mary penny met about nine of the clock in the night in the common near trister gate where they met a man in black clothes with a little band to whom they did courtesie and due observancemary green went with others to husseys knap in the forrest in the night time where met them the fiend in the shape of a little man in black clothes with a little band to him all made obeysances on thursday night before whitsunday last she met several others and being met they called out robin upon which instantly appeared a little man in black clothes to whom all made obeysance and the little man put his hand to his hat saying how do ye speaking low but big then all made low obeysances to him again470 as late as the eighteenth century there is a similar account471 danaeus 1575 and cooper 1617 are the only writers who mention the kiss in their general accounts of the ceremonies the former says then biddeth he the that they fall down worship him after what maner and gesture of body he pleaseth and best liketh of thus some of them falle downe at his knees some offre vnto him black burning cdles other kisse him in some part of his body where he appeareth visibly472 cooper mentions it as part of the admission ceremony secondly when this acknowledgement is made in testimoniall of this subiection satan offers his backparts to be

collennette le besa p de derriere et luy p la crysse et luy dist ladite vieillesse q ledit chat estoit le diable476 estebne de cambrue in 1567 described the ceremonies at the sabbath ils se mettent dancer lentour dune pierre sur laquelle est assis vn grand homme noir quelles appellent msieur chacun de lassemblee luy va baiser le derriere477 the witches of poictiers in 1574 dansoyent lentour du bouc puis vn chacun luy baisoit le derriere478 the same ceremony took place at north berwick in 1590 now efter that the deuell had endit his admonitions he cam down out of the pulpit and caused all the company to com and kiss his ers quhilk they said was cauld lyk yce479 jane bosdeau confessed that at meetings at puydedme in 1594 all the witches had candles which they lighted at his and danced in a circle back to back they kissd his backside and prayd that he would help them480 andro man of aberdeen in 1597 confessed that all thay quha convenis with thame kissis christsonday and the quene of elphenis airss481 rolande de vernois in 1598 confessa que le diable se presenta pour lors au sabbat en forme dvn gros chat noir que tous ceux qui estoient au sabbat alloient baiser ce gros chat noir au derriere482 cornlie van beverwyck aged 75 at ghent in 1598 was accused that vous navez pas craint de vous agenouiller devant lui de lui rendre hommage et de baiser son derriere en signe de soumission483 claire goessen in 1603 went to lassemble nocturne de lembeke o aprs la danse elle a comme tous les assistans bais un bouc lendroit de sa queue484 jeannette dabadie in 1609 in the bassespyrnes said regarding the renunciation which she made on admission il luy faisoit renouueller toutes les fois quelle alloit au sabbat puis elle lalloit baiser au derriere485 at the celebrated trial of louis gaufredy at aix in 1610 magdalene de demandouls gave a detailed account of the homage rendered by the witches first the hagges and witches who are people of a sordid and base condition are the first that come to adore the prince of the synagogue who is lucifers lieftenant and he that now holdeth that place is lewes gaufridy then they adore the princesse of the synagogue who is a woman placed at his right hand next they goe and worship the diuell who is seated in a throne like a prince in the second place come the sorcerers and sorceresses who are people of a middle condition and these performe the same kind of adoration with the former kneeling vpon the ground but not prostrating themselves as doe the other although they kisse the hands and feet of the diuell as the first likewise doe in the third place come the magicians who are gentlemen and people of a higher ranke486 isobel gowdie of auldearne in 1662 said somtym he vold be lyk a stirk a bull a deir a rae or a dowg and he vold hold wp his taill wntill we wold kiss his arce487 the explanation of this rite is given in the french authorities le diable estoit en forme de bouc ayant vne queue au dessoubs vn visage dhomme noir o elle fut contrainte le baiserelle depose que la premiere fois quelle luy fut presentee elle le baisa ce visage de derriere au dessoubs dvne grande queu quelle ly a bais par trois fois quil auoit aussi ce visage faict comme le museau dvn boucil a vne grande queu au derriere vne forme de visage au dessoubs duquel visage il ne profere aucune parole ains luy sert pour le donner baiser ceux qui bon luy semblees festes solemnelles on baisoit le diable au derriere mais les notables sorcieres le baisoient au visage488 the two faces are thus distinctly vouched for and the use of them seems to have been to distinguish the position of the witch in the society the mask or disguise is clearly indicated in the evidence of isaac de queyron who with others le baiserent vne fesse qui estoit blanche rouge auoit la forme dvne grande cuisse dvn homme estoit velue489 the devil was also kissed on other parts of his person marion grant of the aberdeen witches 1597 confessed that he causit the kis him in dyvers pairtis and worship him on thy kneis as thy lord490 some of the lyons witches le baiserent aux parties honteuses de derriere les autres le baisent sur lespaule491 jeannette dabadie in the bassespyrnes 1609 confessed que le diable luy faisoit baiser son visage puis le nombril puis le membre viril puis son derriere492 in connexion with this last statement it is worth comparing doughtys account of an arab custom there is a strange custom not only of nomad women but in the arabic countries even among christians which may seem to remain of the old idolatry among them of mothers their gossips and even young maidens visiting married women to kiss with a kind of devotion the hammam of the male children493 3 the dances dances as an important part of fertility rites are too well known to need description the witches dances taken in conjunction with the dates of the four great sabbaths of the year point to the fact that they also were intended to promote fertility there were several forms of ritual dances varying apparently according to the form of fertility required whether of crops animals or human beings the jumping dance seems to have had for its object the growth of the crops the higher the performers jumped the higher the crops would grow the socalled obscene or indecent dance was for the promotion of fertility among animals and women when the dancers were disguised as animals the dance was for the increase of the animals represented when undisguised for the fertility of human beings although the dances took place at english witch meetings they are merely mentioned and not described the scotch trials give rather fuller accounts but the chief details are from france the two principal forms of the dance were the ringdance and the followmyleader dance but there was also a very complicated form which was not understood by the inquisitors who therefore dismiss it with the words tout est en confusion it still survives however in the bassespyrnes in some of the very villages which were inhabited by witches in the sixteenth centurythose witches whose proceedings de lancre describes so vividly494 the ring dances were usually round some object sometimes a stone sometimes the devil stood or was enthroned in the middle thomas leyis with a great number of other witches came to the market and fish cross of aberdeen under the conduct and guiding of the devil present with you all in company playing before you on his kind of instruments ye all danced about both the said crosses and the meal market a long space of time in the which devils dance thou the said thomas was foremost and led the ring and dang the said kathren mitchell because she spoiled your dance and ran not so fast about as the rest testified by the said kathren mitchell who was present with thee at the time forsaid dancing with the devil495 margaret og was indicted for going to craigleauch on hallow even last and there accompanied by thy own two daughters and certain others your devilish adherents and companions ye danced all together about a great stone under the conduct of satan your master a long space496 jonet lucas was accused of danceing in ane ring on the same occasion497 beatrice robbie was indited as a notorious witch in coming under the conduct of the devil thy master with certain others thy devilish adherents to craigleauche and there dancing altogether about a great stone a long space and the devil your master playing before you498 in the bassespyrnes ils se mettent dancer lentour dune pierre qui est plante audit lieu sur laquelle est assis un grand homme noir499 jane bosdeau who confessed freely and without torture and continued constant in it in the midst of the flames in which she was burnt said that she had been to a witchmeeting and danced in a circle back to back500 les sorciers dansent font leurs danses en rond doz contre doz les boiteux y vont plus dispostement que les autres et incitoient les autres sauter danser501 quelquefois mais rarement ils dansent deux deux par fois lvn lautre l tousiours en confusion estans telles danses semblables celles des fes vrais diables incorporez qui

pieds dhomes dfans dours ou bien dautres bestes semblables504 lesquels estoient seulement enfoncez dvn demy doigt dans la neige quoy que pour eux ils y entrassent iusques la ceinture505 the swedish witches danced in the same manner we used to go to a gravel pit which lay hard by a crossway and there we put on a garment over our heads and then danced round506 the round dance was so essentially a witch dance that more says it might be here very seasonable to enquire into the nature of those large dark rings in the grass which they call fairy circles whether they be the rendezvouz of witches or the dancing places of those little puppet spirits which they call elves or fairies507 it will be seen from the above quotations that there were many varieties in the ring dance this was the case also in the followmyleader dance there seems to have been also a combination of the two dances or perhaps it would be more correct to say that sometimes the ring and followmyleader figures were used together so as to form one complete dance as in the modern lancers in both forms of the dance one of the chief members of the society was the ringleader or leader of the dance in the followmyleader dance this was often the devil but in the ring dances this place was usually taken by the second in command when however the devil was the leader the secondincommand was in the rear to keep up those who could not move so quickly as the others as pace was apparently of importance and as it seems to have been a punishable offence to lag behind in the dance this is possibly the origin of the expression the devil take the hindmost at north berwick barbara napier met her comrades at the church where she danced endlong the kirk yard and gelie duncan played on a trump john fian missellit led the ring agnes sampson and her daughters and all the rest following the said barbara to the number of seven score of persons508 isobel gowdie was unfortunately not encouraged to describe the dances in which she had taken part so that our information instead of being full and precise is very meagre jean martein is maiden to the coven that i am of and her nickname is over the dyke with it because the devil always takes the maiden in his hand next him when we dance gillatrypes and when he would loup from words broken here he and she will say over the dyke with it509 another scotch example is mr gideon penman who had been minister at crighton he usually was in the rear in all their dances and beat up all those that were slow510 bartons wife one night going to a dancing upon pentland hills he the devil went before us in the likeness of a rough tanny dog playing on a pair of pipes511 de lancre concludes his description of the dances see above p 131 by an account of an endlong dance la troisieme est aussi le dos tourn mais se tenant tous en long sans se deprendre des mains ils sapprochent de si prs quils se touchent se rencontrent dos dos vn homme auec vne femme certaine cadance ils se choquent frapent impudemment cul contre cul512 it was perhaps this dance which the devil led le diable voit parfois dancer simplement comme spectateur parfois il mene la dance changeant souuent de main se mettant la main de celles qui luy plaisent le plus513 in northumberland in 1673 their particular divell tooke them that did most evill and danced with them firstthe devill in the forme of a little black man and black cloaths called of one isabell thompson of slealy widdow by name and required of her what service she had done him she replyd she had gott power of the body of one margarett teasdale and after he had danced with her he dismissed her and calld of one thomasine wife of edward watson of slealy514 danaeus also notes that the devil was the leader the fal they to dauncing wherin he leadeth the daunce or els they hoppe and daunce merely about him515 this is perhaps what de lancre means when he says that apres la dance ils se mettent par fois sauter516 a curious variation of the followmyleader dance was practised at aberdeen on rood day a date which as i have shown elsewhere corresponds with the walpurgisnacht of the german witches the meeting took place upon st katherines hill and there under the conduct of satan present with you playing before you after his form ye all danced a devilish dance riding on trees by a long space517 other variations are also given the dance is strange and wonderful as well as diabolical for turning themselves back to back they take one another by the arms and raise each other from the ground then shake their heads to and fro like anticks and turn themselves as if they were mad518 reginald scot quoting bodin says at these magicall assemblies the witches neuer faile to danse and in their danse they sing these words har har divell divell danse here danse here plaie here plaie here sabbath sabbath and whiles they sing and danse euerie one hath a broome in hir hand and holdeth it vp aloft item he saith that these nightwalking or rather nightdansing witches brought out of italie into france that danse which is called la volta519 there is also a description of one of the dances of the italian witches at como and brescia a number of children from eight to twelve years of age who had frequented the sabbat and had been reconverted by the inquisitors gave exhibitions in which their skill showed that they had not been taught by human art the woman was held behind her partner and they danced backward and when they paid reverence to the presiding demon they bent themselves backwards lifting a foot in the air forwards520 in lorraine the round dance always moved to the left as the dancers faced outwards this would mean that they moved widdershins ie against the sun ferner dass sie ihre tntze in einem ronden kreiss rings umbher fhren und die rcke zusammen gekehret haben wie eine unter den dreyen gratiis pfleget frgerissen zu werden und also zusammen tanzen sybilla morelia sagt dass der reyhen allezeit auff der lincken hand umbher gehe521 one form of the witches dance seems to survive among the children in the walloon districts of belgium it appears to be a mixture of the ordinary round dance and the third of de lancres dances for it has no central personage and the striking of back against back is a marked feature les enfants font une ronde et rptent un couplet chaque fois un joueur dsign fait demitour sur place et se remet tourner avec les autres en faisant face lextrieur du cercle quand tous les joueurs sont retourns ils se rapprochent et se heurtent le dos en cadence522 4 the music the music at the assemblies was of all kinds both instrumental and vocal the english trials hardly mention music possibly because the sabbath had fallen into a decadent condition but the scotch and french trials prove that it was an integral part of the celebration the devil himself was the usual performer but other members of the society could also supply the music and occasionally one person held the position of piper to the devil the music was always as an accompaniment of the dance the instrument in general use was a pipe varied in england by a cittern in scotland by the trump or jews harp also an instrument played with the mouth the somerset witches said that the man in black sometimes playes on a pipe or cittern and the company dance523 the north berwick witches 1590 when at the special meeting called to compass the death of the king danced along the kirkyeard geilis duncan playing on a trump524 the instrument of the aberdeen devil 1597 though not specified was probably a pipe it is usually called his forme of instrument in the dittays isobel cockie of aberdeen was accused of being at a sabbath on allhallow eve thou wast the ringleader next thomas leyis and because the devil played not so melodiously and well as thou crewit thou took his instrument out of his mouth then took him on the chaps therewith and played thyself thereon to the whole company525 at another meeting jonet lucas was present thou and they was under the conduct of thy master the devil dancing in ane ring and he playing melodiously upon ane instrument albeit invisibly to you526 at tranent 1659 eight women and a man named john douglas confessed to having merry meetings with satan enlivened with music and dancing douglas was the pyper and the two favourite airs of his majesty were kilt thy coat maggie and come thy way with me and hulie the bed will fa527 agnes spark at forfar 1661 did see about a dozen of people dancing and they had sweet music amongst them and as she thought it was the music of a pipe528 bartons wife was at a meeting in the pentland hills where the devil went before us in the likeness of a rough tanny dog playing on a pair of pipes the spring he played says she was the silly bit chiken gar cast it a pickle and it will grow meikle529 at crook of devon 1662 the two old witches margaret huggon and janet paton confessed to being at a meeting and the foresaids hail women was there likeways and did all dance and ane piper play530 in france the instruments were more varied marie daspilcouette aged nineteen voyoit dancer auec violons trompettes ou tabourins qui rendoyent vne tres grande harmonie531 isaac de queyran aged twentyfive said that a minor devil diabloton played on a tambourine while the witches danced532 but as usual de lancre is at his best when making a general summary elles dancent au son du petit tabourin de la fluste par fois auec ce long instrument quils posent sur le col puis sallongeant iusquauprs de la ceinture ils le battent auec vn petit baston par fois auec vn violon mais ce ne sont les seuls instrums du sabbat car nous aus apprins de plusieurs quon y oyt toute sorte dinstrumens auec vne telle harmonie quil ny a concert au monde qui le puisse esgaler533 vocal music was also heard at the meetings sometimes as an accompaniment of the dance sometimes as an entertainment in itself when it was sung as a part of the dance the words were usually addressed to the master and took the form of a hymn of praise such a hymn addressed to the god of fertility would be full of allusions and words to shock the sensibilities of the christian priests and ministers who sat in judgement on the witches danaeus gives a general account of these scenes then fal they to dauncing wherin he leadeth the daunce or els they hoppe and daunce merely about him singing most filthy songes made in his prayse534 sinclair had his account from a clergyman a reverend minister told me that one who was the devils piper a wizzard confest to him that at a ball of dancing the foul spirit taught him a baudy song to sing and play as it were this night and ere two days past all the lads and lasses of the town were lilting it throw the street it were abomination to rehearse it535 at forfar helen guthrie told the court that andrew watson made great merriment by singing his old ballads and isobell shirrie did sing her song called tinkletum tankletum536 occasionally the devil himself was the performer as at innerkip where according to marie lamont he sung to us and we all dancit537 boguet notes that the music was sometimes vocal and sometimes instrumental les haubois ne manquent pas ces esbats car il y en a qui sont commis faire le devoir de menestrier satan y iou mesme de la flutte le plus souuent dautrefois les sorciers se contentent de chanter la voix disant toutefois leurs chansons peslemesle auec vne confusion telle quils ne sentendent pas les vns les autres538 at aix in 1610 the magicians and those that can reade sing certaine psalmes as they doe in the church especially laudate dominum de coelis confitemini domino quoniam bonus and the canticle benedicite transferring all to the praise of lucifer and the diuels and the hagges and sorcerers doe houle and vary their hellish cries high and low counterfeiting a kinde of villanous musicke they also daunce at the sound of viols and other instruments which are brought thither by those that were skild to play vpon them539 at another french trial in 1652 the evidence showed that on dansait sans musique aux chansons540 5 the feast the feast like the rest of the ritual varied in detail in different places it took place either indoors or out according to the climate and the season in southern france almost invariably in the open air in scotland and sweden almost always under cover in england sometimes one sometimes the other where it was usual to have it in the open tables were carried out and the food laid upon them indoor feasts were always spread on tables but in the english accounts of the openair meal the cloth was spread picnicfashion on the ground the food was supplied in different ways sometimes entirely by the devil sometimes entirely by one member of the community and sometimespicnicfashion againall the company brought their own provisions consequently the quality of the food varied considerably on some occasions it was very good on others very homely but no matter who provided it the thanks of the feasters were solemnly and reverently given to the master to whose power the production of all food was due in a certain number of cases it is said that the food eaten at the feasts was of an unsatisfying nature this statement is usually made in the general descriptions given by contemporary writers it is rarely found in the personal confessions when it does so occur it is worth noting that the witch is generally a young girl if this were always the case it would be quite possible that then as now dancing and excitement had a great effect on the appetite and that the ordinary amount of food would appear insufficient the taboo on salt is interesting but it does not appear to have been by any means universal it does not seem to occur at all in great britain where the food at the feasts was quite normal some authorities appear to think that the witches ate the best of everything they sit to table where no delicate meats are wanting to gratifie their appetites all dainties being brought in the twinckling of an eye by those spirits that attend the assembly541 though this is dramatically expressed it is confirmed by the statements of the witches themselves the lancashire witches had a great feast when they met in malking tower to consult as to the rescue of mother demdike the persons aforesaid had to their dinners beefe bacon and roasted mutton which mutton as this examinates said brother said was of a wether of christopher swyers of barley which wether was brought in the night before into this examinates mothers house by the said iames deuice this examinates said brother and in this examinates sight killed and eaten and before their said parting away they all appointed to meete at the said prestons wiues house that day tweluemoneths at which time the said prestons wife promised to make them a great feast542 the feast of the faversham witches was also indoors joan cariden confessed that goodwife hott told her within these two daies that there was a great meeting at goodwife panterys house and that goodwife dodson was there and that goodwife gardner should have been there but did not come and the divell sat at the upper end of the table543 this was always the devils place at the feast and beside him sat the chief of the women witches the somerset trials give more detail than any of the other english cases elizabeth style said that at their meeting they have usually wine or good beer cakes meat or the like they eat and drink really when they meet in their bodies dance also and have musick the man in black sits at the higher end and anne bishop usually next him he useth some words before meat and none after his voice is audible but very low544 she enters into a little more detail in another place they had wine cakes and roastmeat all brought by the man in black which they did eat and drink they danced and were merry and were bodily there and in their clothes545 alice duke gave a similar account all sate down a white cloth being spread on the ground and did drink wine and eat cakes and meat546 the scotch trials show that it was usually the witches who entertained the master and the rest of the band alison peirson whose adventures among the fairies are very interesting stated that a man in green apperit to hir ane lustie mane with mony mene and wemen with him and that scho sanit her and prayit and past with thame fordir nor scho could tell and saw with thame pypeing and mirrynes and gude scheir and wes careit to lowtheane and saw wyne punchounis with tassis with thame547 on another occasion a very considerable meeting took place in an old house near castle semple where a splendid feast was prepared which pleased the royal visitor so much that he complimented his entertainers for their hospitality and endearingly addressed them as his bairns548 the forfar witches had many feasts helen guthrie says of one occasion they went to mary rynds house and sat doune together at the table the divell being present at the head of it and some of them went to johne bennys house he being a brewer and brought ale from hence and others of them went to alexander hieches and brought aqua vitae from thence and thus made themselfes mirrie and the divill made much of them all but especiallie of mary rynd and he kist them all except the said helen herselfe whose hand onlie he kist and shee and jonet stout satt opposite one to another at the table549 of the meeting at muryknowes there are several accounts the first is by little jonet howat helen guthries young daughter at this meiting there wer about twenty persones present with the divill and they daunced togither and eat togither having bieff bread and ale and shoe did eat and drink with them hir self bot hir bellie was not filled and shoe filled the drink to the rest of the company550 elspet alexander confirms this statement the divill and the witches did drinke together having flesh bread and aile551 and so also does the jonet stout who sat opposite to helen guthrie at the table the divill and the said witches did eat and drinke having flesh bread and aile upon ane table and joanet huit was caper and filled the drinke552 on one occasion they tried to wreck the bridge of cortaquhie when we had done elspet bruce gaive the divell ane goose in hir own house and he dated hir mor than them all because shee was ane prettie woman553 the kinrossshire witches obtained their food from the devil and this is one of the few instances of complaints as to the quality of it sathan gave you robert wilson both meat and drink sundry times but it never did you any good554 and janet brugh confessed that ye got rough bread and sour drink from sathan at the bents of balruddrie555 according to marie lamont the devill came to kattrein scotts house in the midst of the night he gave them wyn to drink and wheat bread to eat and they warr all very mirrie556 isobel gowdies confession gives a wealth of detail as usual we would go to several houses in the night time we were at candlemas last in grangehill where we got meat and drink enough the devil sat at the head of the table and all the coven about that night he desired alexander elder in earlseat to say the grace before meat which he did and is this557 we eat this meat in the devils name etc and then we began to eat and when we had ended eating we looked steadfastly to the devil and bowing ourselves to him we said to the devil we thank thee our lord for thiswe killed an ox in burgie about the dawing of the day and we brought the ox with us home to aulderne and did eat all amongst us in an house in aulderne and feasted on it558 at borrowstowness the witches went to different houses for their feasts which seem to have been supplied partly by the hostess partly by the devil and the guests ye and each person of you was at several meetings with the devil in the links of borrowstowness and in the house of you bessie vickar and ye did eat and drink with the devil and with one another and with witches in her house in the night time and the devil and the said william craw brought the ale which ye drank extending to about seven gallons from the house of elizabeth hamilton559 in 1692 goodwife foster of salem gave a rather charming description of the picnic feast with the coven from andover i enquired what she did for victuals at the meeting she answered that she carried bread and cheese in her pocket and that she and the andover company came to the village before the meeting began and sat down together under a tree and eat their food and that she drank water out of a brook to quench her thirst560 the continental evidence varies very little from the british except in a few details the main facts are practically the same de lancre summarizes the evidence which he himself collected and contrasts it with what other authorities said on the subject les liures disent que les sorciers mangent au sabbat de ce que le diable leur a apprest mais bien souuet il ne sy trouue que des viandes quils ont port eux mesmes parfois il y a plusieurs tables seruies de bons viures dautres fois de tres meschans table on se sied selon sa qualit ayant chacun son demon assis auprs parfois vis vis ils benissent leur table inuoquant beelzebub le tenant pour celui qui leur faict ce bien561 the young manwitch isaac de queyran told de lancre that the witches sat at a table with the black man at the end and had bread and meat which was spread on a cloth562 the evidence at the trial of louis gaufredy at aix in 1610 gives other details though the eating of childrens flesh is probably an exaggeration they prouide a banquet setting three tables according to the three diuersities of the people above named they that haue the charge of bread doe bring in bread made of corne the drink which they haue is malmsey the meate they ordinarily eate is the flesh of young children which they cooke and make ready in the synagogue sometimes bringing them thither aliue by stealing them from those houses where they haue opportunity to come they haue no vse of kniues at table for feare least they should be laid a crosse they haue also no salt563 boguet also collected a considerable amount of information from the witches who fell into his hands les sorciers apres sestre veautrez parmi les plaisirs immondes de la chair banquettent se festoient leurs banquets estans composez de plusieurs sortes de viandes selon les lieux qualitez des personnes par de la table estoit couuerte de beurre de fromage de chair clauda ianguillaume iaquema paget quelques autres adioustoient quil y auoit vne grande chaudiere sur le feu dans laquelle chacun alloit prendre de la chair on y boit aussi du vin le plus souuent de leau antoine tornier a confess quelle en auoit beu le vin dans vn goubelet de bois les autres parloient seulement deau mais il ny a iamais sel en ces repas les sorciers auant que de prendre leur repas benissent la table mais auec des parolles remplies de blasphemes faisans beelzebub autheur conseruateur de toutes choses ils accordent tous quil ny a point de gout aux viandes quils mangent au sabbat que la chair nest autre chair que de cheual et adioustent en outre que lors quils sortent de table ils sont aussi affamez que quand ils entrent antide colas racontoit particulierement que les viandes estoient froides toutesfois il faut croire que bien souuent lon mange au sabbat bon escient non par fantaisie imagination564 the cold food occurs also in the accusation against a belgian witch elizabeth vlamynx in 1595 vousmme vous avez apport aux convives un hochepot hutsepot froid que vous aviez prpar davance565 in sweden the witches collected the food and sent it to the devil who gave them as much of it as he thought fit the feast was always held indoors in the house known as blockula in a huge large room of this house they said there stood a very long table at which the witches did sit down they sate down to table and those that the devil esteemed most were placed nearest to him but the children must stand at the door where he himself gives them meat and drink the diet they did use to have there was they said broth with colworts and bacon in it oatmeal bread spread with butter milk and cheese and they added that sometimes it tasted very well and sometimes very ill566 6 candles at first sight it would seem that the candles were naturally used only to illuminate the midnight festivities but the evidence points to the burning lights being part of the ritual this is also suggested by the importance in the cult of the earlyspring festival of candlemas a festival which has long been recognized as of prechristian origin the light is particularly mentioned in many instances as being carried by the devil usually on his head the witches often lit their torches and candles at this flame though sometimes it seems that the devil lit the torch and then presented it to the witch to call the chief of the cult lucifer was therefore peculiarly appropriate especially at the candlemas sabbath in 1574 the witches of poictiers went to a crossroads l se trouuoit vn grand bouc noir qui parloit comme vne personne aux assistans dansoyent a lentour du bouc puis vn chacun luy baisoit le derriere auec vne chandelle ardente567 the witches of north berwick in 1590 mention candles as part of the ritual at ther meting be nycht in the kirk of northberick the deuell cled in a blak gown with a blak hat upon his head preachit vnto a gret nomber of them out of the pulpit having lyk leicht candles rond about him568john fian blew up the kirk doors and blew in the lights which were like mickle black candles holden in an old mans hand round about the pulpit569john fian was taken to north berwick church where satan commanded him to make him homage with the rest of his servants where he thought he saw the light of a candle standing in the midst of his servants which appeared blue lowe flame570 in 1594 at puydedme jane bosdeau went at midnight on the eve of st john into a field where there appeared a great black goat with a candle between his horns571 at aberdeen in 1597 marion grant confessed that the deuill apperit to the within this auchteine dayis or thairby quhome thow callis thy god about ane hour in the nicht and apperit to the in ane gryte man his lickness in silkin abuilzeament habiliment withe ane quhyt candill in his hand572 in 1598 the witches whom boguet tried said that les sorciers estans assemblez en leur synagogue adorent premierement satan qui apparoit l tantost en forme dvn grand homme noir tantost en forme de bouc pour plus grand hommage ils luy offrent des chandelles qui rendent vne flamme de couleur blee quelquefois encor il tient vne image noire quil fait baiser aux sorciers antide colas ses compagnes en baisant ceste image offroient vne chandelle ou buche destrain ardente ces chandelles leur sont bailles par le diable se perdent esuanouissent ds lors quelles luy out est offertes il sen est trouu qui ont confess quils alloient allumer le plus souuent leurs chandelles vne autre chandelle que le demon estant en forme de bouc portoit au dessus de la teste entre les deux cornes573 some of the witches of the bassespyrnes tried in 1609 said that the devil was comme vn grand bouc ayt deux cornes deuant deux en derriere mais le commun est quil a seulement trois cornes quil a quelque espece de lumiere en celle du milieu de laquelle il a accoustum au sabbat desclairer donner du feu de la lumiere mesmes ces sorcieres qui tiennent quelques chandelles alumees aux ceremonies de la messe quils veulent contrefaire on luy voit aussi quelque espece de bonet ou chapeau au dessus de ses cornestoute lassemblee le vient adorer le baisant sous la queu allumant des chandelles noires574 barthlemy minguet of brcy a man of twentyfive tried in 1616 described the ceremonies of the sabbath after the sermon the worshippers vont lofferte tenant en leurs mains des chandelles de poix noire qui leur sont donnes par le diable575 in 1646 elizabeth weed of great catworth hunts confessed that the devil came to her at night and being demanded what light was there she answered none but the light of the spirit576 in 1652 a french witch stated that at the sabbath on dansait sans musique aux chansons toutes les femmes y toient tenues par les diables par lors il y avoit de la lumire une chandelle tenue au millieu par une femme que ne connoit au milieux il y auoit une feme masque tenant une chandelle577 bartons wife was at a witch meeting in the pentland hills and coming down the hill when we had done which was the best sport he the devil carried the candle in his bottom under his tail which played ey wig wag wig wag578 helen guthrie in 1661 does not expressly mention candles or torches but her description of the flickering light on the ground suggests their use she was at a meiting in the churchyeard of forfar in the holfe therof and they daunced togither and the ground under them wes all fyre flauchter579 the somerset witches stated that when they met the man in black bids them welcome and they all make low obeysance to him and he delivers some wax candles like little torches which they give back again at parting580 the light seems to have been sometimes so arranged probably in a lantern as to be diffused this was the case at torryburn where the assembly was lit by a light which came from darkness it was sufficiently strong for the dancers to see one anothers faces and to show the devil wearing a cap or hood which covered his neck and ears581 the latest account of a witchmeeting in the eighteenth century describes how the witches of strathdown went to polnain and there were steering themselves to and fro in their riddles by means of their oars the brooms hallooing and skirling worse than the bogles and each holding in her left hand a torch of fir582 there is one account where the candle was for use and not for ritual john stuart of paisley in 1678 admitted the devil and some witches into his room one night in order to make a clay image of an enemy declares that the black man did make the figure of the head and face and two arms to the said effigies declares that the devil set three pins in the same one in each side and one in the breast and that the declarant did hold the candle to them all the time the picture was making583 john stuart was the principal person on this occasion and therefore had the honour of holding the light the description of the event suggests that the saying to hold a candle to the devil took its rise in actual fact the material of which the candles or torches were made was pitch according to de lancre and at north berwick the lights were like lighted candles burning with a blue flame the white candle seems to have been essentially the attribute of the devil the black candles or torches being distinctive of the witches that the lights burned blue is due to the material of which the torches were made the evanescent character of the light when a wisp of straw was used is noted in the evidence of antide colas 7 the sacrament the earliest example of the religious services occurs in 1324 in the trial of lady alice kyteler in rifeling the closet of the ladie they found a wafer of sacramentall bread hauing the diuels name stamped thereon in stead of jesus christ584 according to boguet 1589 the devil did not always perform the religious service himself but mass was celebrated by a priest among his followers this custom is found in all countries and seems to have been as common as that the devil himself should perform the service celuy qui est commis faire loffice est reuestu dvne chappe noire sans croix apres auoir mis de leau dans le calice il tourne le doz lautel puis esleue vn rond de raue teinte en noir au lieu de lhostie lors tous les sorciers crient haute voix maistre aide nous le diable en mesme temps pisse dans vn trou terre fait de leau beniste de son vrine de laquelle celuy qui dit la messe arrouse tous les assistans auec vn asperges noir585 the devil of the basses pyrnes 1609 performed the religious ceremony himself il shabille en prestre pour dire messe laquelle il fait semblant de celebrer auec mille fourbes souplesses auprs dvn arbre ou parfois auprs dvn rocher dressant

table586 at aix in 1610 magdalene de demandouls said that that accursed magician lewes gaufredy did first inuent the saying of masse at the sabbaths and did really consecrate and present the sacrifice to lucifer she also related that the said magician did sprinkle the consecrated wine vpon all the company at which time euery one cryeth sanguis eius super nos filios nostros587 lord fountainhall remarks in 1670 we heard that the devil appeared in the shape of a minister in the copper mines of sweden and attempted the same villainous apery588 the scotch witches like the swedish performed the rite after the manner of the reformed churches in 1678 the devill had a great meeting of witches in loudian where among others was a warlock who formerly had been admitted to the ministrie in the presbyterian tymes and when the bishops came in conformed with them but being found flagitious and wicked was deposed by them and now he turnes a preacher under the devill of hellish doctrine for the devill at this tyme preaches to his witches really if i may so term it the doctrine of the infernall pitt viz blasphemies against god and his son christ among other things he told them that they were more happy in him than they could be in god him they saw but god they could not see and in mockrie of christ and his holy ordinance of the sacrament of his supper he gives the sacrament to them bidding them eat it and to drink it in remembrance of himself this villan was assisting to sathan in this action and in preaching589 fountainhall in writing of the same convention of witches says that the devil adventured to give them the communion or holy sacrament the bread was like wafers the drink was sometimes blood sometimes black mosswater he preached and most blasphemously mocked them if they offered to trust in god who left them miserable in the world and neither he nor his son jesus christ ever appeared to them when they called on them as he had who would not cheat them590 the abb guibourg 1679 head of the paris witches a fait chez la voisin revtu daube dtole et de manipule une conjuration591 the same abb celebrated mass more than once over the body of a woman and with the blood of a child sacrificed for the occasion in the chalice see section on sacrifice the woman who served as the altar for these masses was always nude and was the person for whose benefit the ceremony was performed marguerite montvoisin makes this clear il est vrai aussi quune sagefemme qui demeurait au coin de la rue des deuxportes distilla aussi les entrailles dun enfant dont la mre y avait accouch avant la distillation les entrailles de lenfant et larrirefaix de la mre avaient t ports saintdenis guibourg par sa mre la sagefemme et la mre de lenfant sur le ventre de laquelle sa mre son retour lui dit que guibourg avait dit la messe592 guibourg acknowledged that besides the one just quoted he celebrated three masses in this way at the first he used a conjuration il dit la deuxime messe dans une masure sur les remparts de saintdenis sur la mme femme avec les mmes crmonies dit la troisime paris chez la voisin sur la mme femme593 the woman mentioned in guibourgs confession was madame de montespan herself the following conjuration was used at the first mass sur le ventre dune femme astaroth asmode princes damiti je vous conjure daccepter le sacrifice que je vous prsente de cet enfant pour les choses que je vous demande qui sont lamiti du roi de mgr le dauphin me soit continue et tre honore des princes et princesses de la cour que rien ne me soit dni de tout ce que je demanderai au roi tant pour mes parents que serviteurs594 a very interesting case is that of the rev george burroughs in new england 1692 he was accused by eight of the confessing witches as being an head actor at some of their hellish randezvouses and one who had the promise of being a king in satans kingdom now going to be erected one lacy testifyd that she and the prisoner martha carrier were once bodily present at a witchmeeting in salem village and that she knew the prisoner to be a witch and to have been at a diabolical sacrament another lacy testifyd that the prisoner was at the witchmeeting in salem village where they had bread and wine administred unto them deliverance hobbs affirmed that this bridget bishop was at a general meeting of the witches in a field at salemvillage and there partook of a diabolical sacrament in bread and wine then administred595 hutchinson had access to the same records and gives the same evidence though even more strongly richard carrier affirmed to the jury that he saw mr george burroughs at the witch meeting at the village and saw him administer the sacrament mary lacy senr and her daughter mary affirmed that mr george burroughs was at the witch meetings with witch sacrements and that she knows mr burroughs to be of the company of witches596 john hale has a similar record this d h deliverance hobbs confessed she was at a witch meeting at salem village and the said g b preached to them and such a woman was their deacon and there they had a sacrament597 abigail williams said that the witches had a sacrament that day at an house in the village and that they had red bread and red drink598 with the evidence before him mather seems justified in saying that the witches had their diabolical sacraments imitating the baptism and the supper of our lord599 8 sacrifices there are four forms of sacrifice 1 the blood sacrifice which was performed by making an offering of the witchs own blood 2 the sacrifice of an animal 3 the sacrifice of a human being usually a child 4 the sacrifice of the god 1 the bloodsacrifice took place first at the admission of the neophyte originally a sacrifice it was afterwards joined to the other ceremony of signing the contract the blood serving as the writing fluid it also seems to be confused in the seventeenth century with the pricking for the mark but the earlier evidence is clear a writer who generalizes on the witchcraft religion and who recognizes the sacrificial nature of the act is cooper as he wrote in 1617 his evidence belongs practically to the sixteenth century he says in further token of their subiection unto satan in yeelding vp themselues wholy vnto his deuotion behold yet another ceremony heere vsually is performed namely to let themselues bloud in some apparant place of the body yeelding the same to be sucked by satan as a sacrifice vnto him and testifying thereby the full subiection of their liues and soules to his deuotion600 the earliest account of the ceremony is at chelmsford in 1556 elizabeth francis learned this arte of witchcraft from her grandmother when shee taughte it her she counseiled her to geue of her bloudde to sathan as she termed it whyche she delyuered to her in the lykenesse of a whyte spotted catte euery time that he the cat did any thynge for her she sayde that he required a drop of bloude which she gaue him by prycking herselfe some time after elizabeth francis presented the satancat to mother waterhouse passing on to her the instructions received from elizabeths grandmother mother waterhouse gaue him for his labour a chicken which he fyrste required of her and a drop of her blod and thys she gaue him at all times when he dyd any thynge for her by pricking her hand or face and puttinge the bloud to hys mouth whyche he sucked601 in 1566 john walsh a dorset witch confessed that at the first time when he had the spirite hys sayd maister did cause him to deliuer one drop of his blud whych bloud the spirite did take away vpon hys paw602 in belgium in 1603 claire goessen aprs avoir donn boire de son sang satan et avoir bu du sien a fait avec lui un pacte603 in the case of the lancashire witch margaret johnson in 1633 it is difficult to say whether the pricking was for the purpose of marking or for a blood sacrifice the slight verbal alterations in the two ms accounts of her confession suggest a confusion between the two ideas the one appears to refer to the mark the other quoted here to the sacrifice such witches as have sharp bones given them by the devill to pricke them have no pappes or dugges whereon theire devil may sucke but theire devill receiveth bloud from the place pricked with the bone and they are more grand witches than any yt have marks604 in suffolk in 1645 one bush of barton widdow confessed that the deuill appeared to her in the shape of a young black man and asked her for bloud which he drew out of her mouth and it dropped on a paper605 at auldearne in 1662 the blood was drawn for baptizing the witch isobel gowdie said the divell marked me in the showlder and suked owt my blood at that mark and spowted it in his hand and sprinkling it on my head said i baptise the janet in my awin name janet breadheids evidence is practically the same the divell marked me in the shoulder and suked out my blood with his mowth at that place he spowted it in his hand and sprinkled it on my head he baptised me thairvith in his awin nam christian606 2 the sacrifice of animals was general and the accounts give a certain amount of detail but the ceremony was not as a rule sufficiently dramatic to be considered worth recording the actual method of killing the animal is hardly ever given the rite was usually performed privately by an individual on rare occasions it was celebrated by a whole coven but it does not occur at the great assembly for there the sacrifice was of the god himself the animals offered were generally a dog a cat or a fowl and it is noteworthy that these were forms in which the devil often appeared to his worshippers the chief authorities all agree as to the fact of animal sacrifices cotta compares it with the sacrifices offered by the heathen some bring their cursed sorcery vnto their wished end by sacrificing vnto the diuell some liuing creatures as serres likewise witnesseth from the confession of witches in henry the fourth of france deprehended among whom one confessed to haue offered vnto his deuill or spirit a beetle this seemeth not improbable by the diabolicall litations sic and bloudy sacrifices not onely of other creatures but euen of men wherewith in ancient time the heathen pleased their gods which were no other then diuels607 the number of sacrifices in the year is exaggerated by the writers on the subject but the witches themselves are often quite definite in their information when it happens to be recorded it appears from their statements that the rite was performed only on certain occasions either to obtain help or as a thankoffering danaeus speaking of the newly admitted witch says then this vngracious and new servant of satan euery day afterward offreth something of his goods to his patrone some his dogge some his hen and some his cat608 scot who always improves on his original states that the witches depart after the sabbath not forgetting euery daie afterwards to offer to him dogs cats hens or bloud of their owne609 the earliest witchtrial in the british isles shows animal sacrifice in 1324 in ireland lady alice kyteler was charged to haue nightlie conference with a spirit called robin artisson to whom she sacrificed in the high waie ix red cocks610 in 1566 at chelmsford mother waterhouse gaue him ie the satancat for his labour a chicken which he fyrste required of her and a drop of her blod another tyme she rewarded hym as before wyth a chicken and a droppe of her bloud which chicken he eate vp cleane as he didde al the rest and she cold fynde remaining neyther bones nor fethers611 joan waterhouse daughter of mother waterhouse a girl of eighteen said that the deuil came in the likeness of a great dog then asked hee her what she wolde geue hym and she saide a red kocke612 john walsh of dorset in 1566 confessed that when he would call him the spirit hee sayth hee must geue hym some lyuing thing as a chicken a cat or a dog and further he sayth he must geue hym twoo lyuing thynges once a yeare613 in lorraine in 1589 beatrix baonensis said etliche geben junge hner oder wohl alte hner wie desideria pari iensis und cathelonia vincentia gethan hatten etliche schneiden ihre haar ab und lieffern dieselbe dahin etliche geben spher etliche vgel oder sonst nicht viel besonders als da sein mchte gemntzt geld aus rindern ledder und wenn sie dergleichen nichts haben so verschafft es ihnen ihr geist auff dass sie staffirt seyn614 in aberdeen in 1597 andro man gave evidence that the devill thy maister whom thow termis christsunday is rasit be the speking of the word benedicite and is laid agane be tacking of a dog vnder thy left oxster in thi richt hand and casting the same in his mouth and speking the word maikpeblis615 at lang niddry in 1608 the whole coven performed a rite beginning at the irne zet of seatoun where they christened a cat by the name of margaret and thaireftir come all bak agane to the deanefute quhair first thai convenit and cuist the kat to the devill616 in 1630 alexander hamilton had consultations with the devil near edinburgh and afoir the devill his away passing the said alexr was in use to cast to him ather ane kat or ane laif or ane dog or any uther sic beast he come be617 in bute in 1622 margaret ncwilliam renounced her baptisme and he baptised her and she gave him as a gift a hen or cock618 in modern france the sacrifice of a fowl to the devil still holds good celui qui veut devenir sorcier doit aller un quatre chemins avec une poule noire ou bien encore au cimetire sur une tombe et toujours minuit il vient alors quelquun qui demande que venez vous faire ici jai une poule vendre rpondon ce quelquun est le mchant619 it is possible that the custom of burying a live animal to cure disease among farm animals as well as the charm of casting a live cat into the sea to raise a storm are forms of the animal sacrifice 3 child sacrificethe childvictim was usually a young infant either a witchs child or unbaptized in other words it did not belong to the christian community this last is an important point and was the reason why unbaptized children were considered to be in greater danger from witches than the baptized if there be anie children vnbaptised or not garded with the signe of the crosse or orizons then the witches may or doo catch them from their mothers sides in the night or out of their cradles or otherwise kill them with their ceremonies620 the same author quotes from the french authorities the crimes laid to the charge of witches among which are the following they sacrifice their owne children to the diuell before baptisme holding them vp in the aire vnto him and then thrust a needle into their braines and they burne their children when they haue sacrificed them621 boguet says les matrones sages femmes sont accoustum doffrir satan les petits enfans quelles reoiuent puis les faire mourir auant quils soient baptizez par le moye dvne grosse espingle quelles leur enfoncent dans le cerueau622 boguets words imply that this was done at every birth at which a witch officiated but it is impossible that this should be the case the sacrifice was probably made for some special purpose for which a newborn child was the appropriate victim the most detailed account of such sacrifices is given in the trial of the paris witches 167981 whom madame de montespan consulted the whole ceremony was performed to the end that the love of louis xiv should return to madame de montespan at that time his discarded mistress it seems to be a kind of fertility rite hence its use on this occasion the abb guibourg was the sacrificing priest and from this and other indications he appears to have been the chief or grandmaster who before a less educated tribunal would have been called the devil both he and the girl montvoisin were practically agreed as to the rite though from the girls words it would appear that the child was already dead while guibourgs evidence implies that it was alive both witnesses gave their evidence soberly and gravely and without torture montvoisin who was eighteen years old stated that she had presented la messe de madame de montespan par lordre de sa mre un enfant paraissant n avant terme le mit dans un bassin guibourg lgorgea versa dans le calice et consacra le sang avec hostie guibourgs evidence shows that the sacrifice was so far from being uncommon that the assistants were well used to the work and did all that was required with the utmost celerity il avait achet un cu lenfant qui fut sacrifi cette messe qui lui fut prsent par une grande fille et ayant tir du sang de lenfant quil piqua la gorge avec un canif il en versa dans le calice aprs quoi lenfant fut retir et emport dans un autre lieu dont ensuite on lui rapporta le coeur et les entrailles pour en faire une deuxieme oblation623 in scotland it was firmly believed that sacrifices of children took place in all classes of society the justices of the peace were seen familiarly conversing with the foul fiend to whom one in dumfriesshire actually offered up his firstborn child immediately after birth stepping out with it in his arms to the staircase where the devil stood ready as it was suspected to receive the innocent victim624 in the later witchtrials the sacrifice of the child seems to have been made after its burying as in the case of the witch of calder in 1720 who confessed that she had given the devil the body of a dead child of her own to make a roast of625 it is possible that the killing of children by poison was one method of sacrifice when the cult was decadent and victims difficult to obtain reginald scots words written in 1584 suggest that this was the case this must be an infallible rule that euerie fortnight or at the least euerie moneth each witch must kill one child at the least for hir part626 sinistrari dameno writing about a century later says the same they promise the devil sacrifices and offerings at stated times once a fortnight or at least each month the murder of some child or an homicidal act of sorcery627 it is impossible to believe in any great frequency of this sacrifice but there is considerable foundation in fact for the statement that children were killed and it accounts as nothing else can for the coldblooded murders of children of which the witches were sometimes accused the accusations seem to have been substantiated on several occasions the method of sacrifice being by poison628 the sacrifice of a child was often performed as a means of procuring certain magical materials or powers which were obtained by preparing the sacrificed bodies in several ways scot says that the flesh of the child was boiled and consumed by the witches for two purposes of the thicker part of the concoction they make ointments whereby they ride in the aire but the thinner potion they put into flaggons whereof whosoeuer drinketh obseruing certeine ceremonies immediatelie becommeth a maister or rather a mistresse in that practise and facultie629 the paris coven confessed that they distilled the entrails of the sacrificed child after guibourg had celebrated the mass for madame de montespan the method being probably the same as that described by scot a variant occurs in both france and scotland and is interesting as throwing light on the reasons for some of the savage rites of the witches pour ne confesser iamais le secret de lescole on faict au sabbat vne paste de millet noir auec de la poudre du foye de quelque enfant non baptis quon faict secher puis meslant cette poudre avec ladicte paste elle a cette vertu de taciturnit si bien que qui en mange ne confesse iamais630 at forfar in 1661 helen guthrie and four others exhumed the body of an unbaptized infant which was buried in the churchyard near the southeast door of the church and took severall peices therof as the feet hands a pairt of the head and a pairt of the buttock and they made a py therof that they might eat of it that by this meanes they might never make a confession as they thought of their witchcraftis631 here the idea of sympathetic magic is very clear by eating the flesh of a child who had never spoken articulate words the witches own tongues would be unable to articulate 4 sacrifice of the godthe sacrifice of the witchgod was a decadent custom when the records were made in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the accounts of the actual rite come from france and belgium where a goat was substituted for the human victim the sacrifice was by fire in both those countries and there are indications that it was the same in great britain it is uncertain whether the interval of time between the sacrifices was one seven or nine years bodin and boguet each writing from his own knowledge of the subject give very similar accounts bodins being the more detailed in describing a trial which took place in poictiers in 1574 he says l se trouuoit vn grand bouc noir qui parloit comme vne personne aux assistans dansoyent lentour du bouc puis vn chacun luy baisoit le derriere auec vne chandelle ardente cel faict le bouc se consommoit en feu de la cedre chacun en prenoit pour faire mourir le boeuf etc et en fin le diable leur disoit dvne voix terrible des mots vengez vous ou vous mourrez632 boguet says that in the lyons district in 1598 the devil celebrated mass and apres auoir prins la figure dvn bouc se consume en feu reduit en cendre laquelle les sorciers recueillent cachent pour sen seruir lexecution de leurs desseins pernicieux abominables633 in 1603 a belgian witch claire goessen was present at such a sacrifice and her account is therefore that of an eyewitness elle sest laisse transporter lassemble nocturne de lembeke o aprs la danse elle a comme tous les assistans bais un bouc lendroit de sa queue lequel bouc fut ensuite brl et ses cendres distribues et emportes par les convives634 jeanne de belloc in 1609 a veu le grand maistre de lassemblee se ietter dans les flammes au sabbat se faire brusler iusques ce quil estoit reduit en poudre les grandes insignes sorcieres prendre les dictes poudres pour ensorceler les petits enfants les mener au sabbat en prenoient aussi dans la bouche pour ne reueler iamais635 a french witch in 1652 declared that at the sabbath le diable sy at mis en feu et en donn des cendres lesquelles tous faisaient voller en lair pour faire mancquer les fruits de la terre636 at lille in 1661 the girls in madame bourignons orphanage stated that on y adoroit une bte quon faisoit avec elle des infamies puis sur la fin on la brloit chacun en prenoit des cendres avec lesquelles on faisoit languir ou mourir des personnes ou autres animaux637 the collection and use of the ashes by the worshippers point to the fact that we have here a sacrifice of the god of fertility originally the sprinkling of the ashes on fields or animals or in running water was a fertility charm but when christianity became sufficiently powerful to attempt the suppression of the ancient religion such practices were represented as evil and were therefore said to be pour faire mancquer les fruits de la terre the animalsubstitute for the divine victim is usually the latest form of the sacrifice the intervening stages were first the volunteer then the criminal both of whom were accorded the power and rank of the divine being whom they personated the period of time during which the substitute acted as the god varied in different places so also did the interval between the sacrifices frazer has pointed out that the human victim whether the god himself or his human substitute did not content himself by merely not attempting to escape his destiny but in many cases actually rushed on his fate and died by his own hand or by voluntary submission to the sacrificer the witchcult being a survival of an ancient religion many of the beliefs and rites of these early religions are to be found in it of these the principal are the voluntary substitute the temporary transference of power to the substitute and the selfdevotion to death as times changed and the ceremonies could no longer be performed openly the sacrifices took on other forms i have already suggested that the childmurders of which the witches were often convicted were in many cases probably offerings made to the god in the same way when the time came for the god or his substitute to be sacrificed recourse was had to methods which hid the real meaning of the ceremony and the sacrifice of the incarnate deity though taking place in public was consummated at the hands of the public executioner this explanation accounts for the fact that the bodies of witches male or female were always burnt and the ashes scattered for the strong prejudice which existed as late as the eighteenth century against any other mode of disposing of their bodies and for some of the otherwise inexplicable occurrences in connexion with the deaths of certain of the victims read in the light of this theory much of the mystery which surrounds the fate of joan of arc is explained she was put to death as a witch and the conduct of her associates during her military career as well as the evidence at her trial bear out the fact that she belonged to the ancient religion not to the christian nine years after her death in the flames her commander gilles de rais was tried on the same charge and condemned to the same fate the sentence was not carried out completely in his case he was executed by hanging and the body was snatched from the fire and buried in christian ground like joan herself gilles received a semicanonization after death and his shrine was visited by nursing mothers two centuries later major weir offered himself up and was executed as a witch in edinburgh refusing to the end all attempts to convert him to the christian point of view the belief that the witch must be burnt and the ashes scattered was so ingrained in the popular mind that when the severity of the laws began to relax remonstrances were made by or to the authorities in 1649 the scotch general assembly has a record concerning the matter of the buriall of the lady pittadro who being vnder a great scandall of witchcraft and being incarcerat in the tolbuith of this burgh during her triall before the justice died in prison the comission of the generall assembly having considered the report of the comittee appointed for that purpose doe give their advyse to the presbyterie of dumfermling to show their dislike of that fact of the buriall of the lady pittadro in respect of the maner and place and that the said presbyterie may labour to make the persons who hes buried her sensible of their offence in so doeing and some of the persons who buried hir being personallie present are desired by the comission to shew themselvis to the presbyterie sensible of their miscarriage therein638 at maidstone in 1652 anne ashby alias cobler anne martyn mary browne anne wilson and mildred wright of cranbrook and mary read of lenham being legally convicted were according to the laws of this nation adjudged to be hanged at the common place of execution some there were that wished rather they might be burnt to ashes alledging that it was a received opinion among many that the body of a witch being burnt her bloud is prevented thereby from becomming hereditary to her progeny in the same evill639 the witches themselves also held the belief that they ought to die by fire anne foster was tried for witchcraft at northampton in 1674 after sentence of death was past upon her she mightily desired to be burned but the court would give no ear to that but that she should be hanged at the common place of execution640 9 magic words the magic words known to the witches were used only for certain definite purposes the most important use being to raise the devil i have omitted the charms which are founded on christian prayers and formulas and quote only those which appear to belong to the witchcult in the section on familiars it will be seen how the witches divined by means of animals which animals were allotted to them by the chief in auguries and divinations of this kind in every part of the world a form of words is always used and the augury is taken by the first animal of the desired species which is seen after the charm is spoken agnes sampson the leading witch of the north berwick coven 1590 summoned her familiar by calling elva and then divined by a dog whom she dismissed by telling him to depart by the law he lives on she also used the formula haill hola and hola was also the cry when a cat was cast into the sea to raise a storm641 a manwitch of alest 1593 gave the devils name as abiron quand il le vouloit voir il disoit vien abiron sinon ie te quitteray642 andro man at aberdeen 1597 confessis that the devill thy maister is rasit be the speking of the word benedicite and is laid agane be tacking of a dog vnder thy left oxster in thi richt hand and casting the same in his mouth and speking the word maikpeblishe grantit that this word benedicite rasit the dewill and maikpeblis laid him againe strikin him on the faice with ane deice with the left hand643 alexander hamilton of east lothian 1630 when covenanting with the devil had ane battoun of fir in his hand the devill than gave the said alexr command to tak that battoun quhan evir he had ado with him and therewt to strek thruse upone the ground and to chairge him to ruse up foule theiff the divining animals in this case were crows cats and dogs644 marie lamont of innerkip 1662 was instructed to call the devil serpent when she desired to speak with him645 the somerset witches 1664 cried out robin at an appointed place and the master then appeared in his proper form as a man elizabeth style and alice duke also called him robin when summoning him privately and elizabeth style added o sathan give me my purpose before saying what she wished done646 the swedish witches 1669 called their chief with the cry antecessor come and carry us to blockula this they did at an appointed place and the devil then appeared as a man647 the words used before starting to a meeting are rarely recorded only a few remain the earliest example is from guernsey in 1563 when martin tulouff heard an old witch cry as she bestrode a broomstick va au nom du diable et luciffer p dessq roches et espyes he then lost sight of her with the inference that she flew through the air though he acknowledged that he himself was not so successful648 the witches of the bassespyrnes 1609 anointed themselves before starting and repeated the words emen hetan emen hetan which de lancre translates ici et l ici et l quelquefois plus furieuses elles se batent entre elles mesmes en disant ie suis le diable ie nay rien qui ne soit toy en ton nom seigneur cette tienne seruante soingt dois estre quelque iour diable maling esprit comme toy when crossing water they cried haut la coude quillet upon which they could cross without getting wet and when going a long distance they said pic suber hoeilhe en ta la lane de bouc bien marrecoueille649 isobel gowdie 1662 gives two variants of the magic words used on these occasions the first horse and hattock in the divellis name is not unlike the form given by martin tulouff the second is longer horse and hattock horse and goe horse and pellattis ho ho650 the somerset witches 1664 when starting to the meeting said thout tout a tout tout throughout and about and when returning rentum tormentum at parting they cried a boy merry meet merry part651 they also had a long form of words which were used when applying the flying ointment but these are not recorded other magical words were used at the religious services of the witches in the bassespyrnes 1609 at the elevation of the host the congregation cried aquerra goity aquerra beyty aquerra goity aquerra beyty qui veut dire cabron arriba cabron abaro sic at the elevation of the chalice at a christian service they said corbeau noir corbeau noir there were two forms of words to be used when making the sign of the cross the first was in nomine patrica aragueaco petrica agora agora valentia iouanda goure gaitz goustia translated as au nom de patrique petrique darragon cette heure cette heure valence tout nostre mal est pass the second roused de lancres horror as peculiarly blasphemous in nomine patrica aragueaco petrica gastellaco ianicot equidae ipordian pot au nom de patrique petrique darragon iannicot de castille faictes moy vn baiser au derriere652 the mention of the ancient basque god janicot makes this spell unusually interesting as the dances were also a religious rite the words used then must be recorded here bodin gives the formula har har diable diable saute icy saute l iou icy iou l et les autres disoyent sabath sabath653 the word diable is clearly bodins own interpellation for the name of the god for the guernsey version which is currently reported to be used at the present day runs har har hou hou danse ici etc hou being the name of an ancient breton god654 jean weir 1670 stated that at the instigation of some woman unnamed she put her foot on a cloth on the floor with her hand upon the crown of her head and repeated thrice all my cross and troubles go to the door with thee655 this seems to have been an admission ceremony but the words are of the same sentiment as the one recorded by de lancre tout notre mal est pass there were also certain magical effects supposed to be brought about by the use of certain words martin tulouff 1563 claimed that he could bewitch cows so that they gave blood instead of milk by saying butyrum de armento but he admitted that he also used powders to accomplish his purpose656 isobel gowdie 1662 described how the witches laid a broom or a stool in their beds to represent themselves during their absence at a meeting by the time that this record was made the witches evidently believed that the object took on the exact appearance of the woman having forgotten its original meaning as a signal to show where she had gone the words used on these occasions show no belief in the change of appearance of the object i lay down this besom or stool in the devils name let it not stir till i come again her statements regarding the change of witches into animals i have examined in the section on familiars p 234 the words used to effect these changes are given in full when a witch wished to take on the form of a hare she said i sall goe intill ane haire with sorrow and sych and meikle caire and i sall goe in the divellis nam ay quhill i com hom againe to change into a cat or a crow the last two lines were retained unaltered but the first two were respectively i sall goe intill ane catt with sorrow and sych and a blak shot or i sall goe intill a craw with sorrow and sych and a blak thraw to return into human form the witch said haire haire god send thee caire i am in an haires liknes just now bot i sal be in a womanis liknes ewin now from a cat or a crow the words were cat cat god send thee a blak shott or craw craw god send thee a blak thraw with the last two lines as before when the witch in animal form entered the house of another witch she would say i conjure thee goe with me on which the second witch would turn into the same kind of animal as the first if however they met in the open the formula was slightly different divell speid the goe thow with me the result being the same657 the somerset trials record the words used for cursing anything these were simply a pox take it the curse being supposed to take effect at once if the curse were pronounced over an image of a person the words were a pox on thee ile spite thee658 alexander elders grace over meat is probably a corrupt form of some ancient rite we eat this meat in the divellis nam with sorrow and sych and meikle shame we sall destroy hows and hald both sheip and noat in till the fald litle good sall come to the fore of all the rest of the litle store659 the conjuring of cats was a distinct feature and is clearly derived from an early form of sacrifice the details are recorded only in scotland and it is possible that scotland is the only country in which it occurred though the sanctity of the cat in other places suggests that the omission in the records is accidental in the dittay against john fian 1590 he was fylit for the chaissing of ane catt in tranent in the quhilk chaise he was careit heich aboue the ground with gryt swyftnes and as lychtlie as the catt hir selff ower ane heicher dyke nor he was able to lay his hand to the heid offand being inquyrit to quhat effect he chaissit the samin ansuerit that in ane conversatioune haldin at brumhoillis sathan commandit all that were present to tak cattis lyke as he for obedience to sathan chaissit the said catt purpoiselie to be cassin in the sea to raise windis for distructioune of schippis and boitis660 agnes sampson of the same coven as fian confessed that at the time when his majestie was in denmark shee being accompanied by the parties before speciallie named tooke a cat and christened it and afterwards bounde to each part of that cat the cheefest parte of a dead man and severall joyntis of his bodie and that in the night following the saide cat was convayed into the middest of the sea by all the witches sayling in their riddles or cives as is aforesaid and so left the said cat right before the towne of leith in scotland this doone there did arise such a tempest in the sea as a greater hath not bene seene661 the legal record of this event is more detailed and less dramatic the sieves are never mentioned the witches merely walking to the pierhead in an ordinary and commonplace manner the coven at prestonpans sent a letter to the leith coven that they sould mak the storm vniuersall thro the sea and within aucht dayes eftir the said bill letter wes delyuerit the said agnes sampsoune

the rites continued witches rainmaking and fertility rites 1 general in common with many other religions of the lower culture the witchcult of western europe observed certain rites for rainmaking and for causing or blasting fertility this fact was recognized in the papal bulls formulated against the witches who were denounced not for moral offences but for the destruction of fertility the celebrated decree of innocent viii which in 1488 let loose the full force of the church against the witches says that they blight the marriage bed destroy the births of women and the increase of cattle they blast the corn on the ground the grapes of the vineyard the fruits of the trees the grass and herbs of the field adrian vi followed this up in 1521 with a decretal epistle denouncing the witches as a sect deviating from the catholic faith denying their baptism and showing contempt of the ecclesiastical sacraments treading crosses under their feet and taking the devil for their lord destroyed the fruits of the earth by their enchantments sorceries and superstitions the charms used by the witches the dances the burning of the god and the broadcast scattering of his ashes all point to the fact that this was a fertility cult and this is the view taken also by those contemporary writers who give a more or less comprehensive account of the religion and ritual though most of the fertility or antifertility charms remaining to us were used by the witches either for their own benefit or to injure their enemies enough remains to show that originally all these charms were to promote fertility in general and in particular when the charm was for fertility in general it was performed by the whole congregation together but for the fertility of any particular woman animal or field the ceremony was performed by one witch alone or by two at most the power which the witches claimed to possess over human fertility is shown in many of the trials jonet clark was tried in edinburgh in 1590 for giving and taking away power from sundry mens genitalmembers664 and in the same year and place bessie roy was accused of causing womens milk to dry up665 the number of midwives who practised witchcraft points also to this fact they claimed to be able to cause and to prevent pregnancy to cause and to prevent an easy delivery to cast the labourpains on an animal or a human being husbands who were the victims are peculiarly incensed against these witches and in every way to have power over the generative organs of both sexes in short it is possible to say that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the better the midwife the better the witch the red book of appin666 which was obtained from the devil by a trick is of great interest in this connexion it was said to contain charms for the curing of diseases of cattle among them must certainly have been some for promoting the fertility of the herds in general and individual animals in particular it is not unlikely that the charms as noted in the book were the result of many experiments for we know that the witches were bound to give account to the devil of all the magic they performed in the intervals between the sabbaths and he or his clerk recorded their doings from this record the devil instructed the witches it is evident from the confessions and the evidence at the trials that the help of the witches was often required to promote fertility among human beings as well as among animals the number of midwives who were also witches was very great and the fact can hardly be accidental witches were called in to perform incantations during the various events of a farmyard margrat og of aberdeen 1597 was indyttit as a manifest witche in that be the space of a yeirsyn or theirby thy kow being

performed a ceremony to obtain for themselves the benefit of a neighbours crop befor candlemas we went beeast kinlosse and ther we yoaked an plewghe of paddokis the divell held the plewgh and johne

seueral tymes abowt and all we of the coeven went still wp and downe with the plewghe prayeing to the divell for the fruit of that land and that thistles and brieris might grow ther668 here the ploughingceremony was to induce fertility for the benefit of the witches while the draught animals and all the parts of the plough connoted barrenness for the owner of the soil the most detailed account of a charm for human fertility is given in the confession of the abb guibourg who appears to have been the devil of the paris witches the ceremony took place at the house of a witchmidwife named voisin or montvoisin and according to the editor was for the benefit of louis xiv or charles ii two of the most notorious libertines of their age il a fait chez la voisin revtu daube dtole et de manipule une conjuration en prsence de la des oeillets attendant of madame de montespan qui prtendait faire un charme pour le roi et qui tait accompagne dun homme qui lui donna la conjuration et comme il tait ncessaire davoir du sperme des deux sexes des oeillets ayant ses mois nen put donner mais versa dans le calice de ses menstrues et lhomme qui laccompagnait ayant pass dans la ruelle du lit avec lui guibourg versa de son sperme dans le calice sur le tout la des oeillets et lhomme mirent chacun dune poudre de sang de chauvesouris et de la farine pour donner un corps plus ferme toute la composition et aprs quil eut rcit la conjuration il tira le tout du calice qui fut mis dans un petit vaisseau que la des oeillets ou lhomme emporta669 the ecclesiastical robes and the use of the chalice point to this being a ceremony of a religious character and should be compared with the childsacrifices performed by the same priest or devil see pp 150 157 an antifertility rite which in its simplicity hardly deserves the name of a ceremony took place at crook of devon in kinrossshire bessie henderson lykeways confessed and declared that janet paton was with you at ane meeting when they trampit down thos whites rie in the beginning of harvest 1661 and that she had broad soals and trampit down more nor any of the rest670 2 rainmaking the rainmaking powers of the witches have hardly been noted by writers on the subject for by the time the records were made the witches were credited with the blasting of fertility rather than its increase yet from what remains it is evident that the original meaning of much of the ritual was for the production of fertilizing rain though both judges and witnesses believed that it was for storms and hail one of the earliest accounts of such powers is given in the story quoted by reginald scot from the malleus maleficarum written in 1487 a century before scots own book a little girle walking abroad with hir father in his land heard him complaine of drought wishing for raine etc whie father quoth the child i can make it raine or haile when and where i list he asked where she learned it she said of hir mother who forbad hir to tell anie bodie thereof he asked hir how hir mother taught hir she answered that hir mother committed hir to a maister who would at anie time doo anie thing for hir whie then said he make it raine but onlie in my field and so she went to the streame and threw vp water in hir maisters name and made it raine presentlie and proceeding further with hir father she made it haile in another field at hir fathers request herevpon he accused his wife and caused hir to be burned and then he new christened his child againe671 scot also gives certaine impossible actions of witches when he ridicules the belief that the elements are obedient to witches and at their commandement or that they may at their pleasure send raine haile tempests thunder lightening when she being but an old doting woman casteth a flint stone ouer hir left shoulder towards the west or hurleth a little sea sand vp into the element or wetteth a broome sprig in water and sprinkleth the same in the aire or diggeth a pit in the earth and putting water therein stirreth it about with hir finger or boileth hogs bristles or laieth sticks acrosse vpon a banke where neuer a drop of water is or burieth sage till it be rotten all which things are confessed by witches and affirmed by writers to be the meanes that witches vse to mooue extraordinarie tempests and raine672 more quotes wierus to the same effect casting of flintstones behind their backs towards the west or flinging a little sand in the air or striking a river with a broom and so sprinkling the wet of it toward heaven the stirring of urine or water with their finger in a hole in the ground or boyling of hogs bristles in a pot673 the throwing of stones as a fertility rite is found in the trial of jonet wischert one of the chief witches at aberdeen and is there combined with a nudity rite in hervest last bypast mr william rayes huikes saw thee at the heid of thi awin gudmannis croft and saw the tak all thi claiss about thi heid and thow beand naikit from the middill down tuik ane gryte number of steynis and thi self gangand baklenis keist ane pairt behind the our thi heid and ane wther pairt fordward674 3 fertility every contemporary writer who gives a general view of the religion and ritual observes the witches powers over human fertility boguet says ils font encor cacher retirer les parties viriles et puis les font ressortir quand il leur plait ils empeschent aussi tantost la copulation charnelle de lhome de la femme en retirant les nerfs ostant la roideur du membre et tantost la procreation en destournant ou bouchant les conduicts de la semence pour empescher quelle ne descende aux vases de la generation675 scot who quotes generally without any acknowledgement and often inaccurately translates this statement they also affirme that the vertue of generation is impeached by witches both inwardlie and outwardlie for intrinsecallie they represse the courage and they stop the passage of the mans seed so as it may not descend to the vessels of generation also they hurt extrinsecallie with images hearbs c676 bodin also remarks that witches whether male or female can affect only the generative organs677 madame bourignon says that the girls whom she befriended told me that persons who were thus engaged to the devil by a precise contract will allow no other god but him and therefore offer him whatsoever is dearest to them nay are constrained to offer him their children or else the devil would beat them and contrive that they should never arrive to the state of marriage and so should have no children by reason that the devil hath power by his adherents to hinder both the one and the other so soon as they come to be able to beget children the devil makes them offer the desire which they have of marrying to his honor and with this all the fruit that may proceed from their marriage this they promise voluntarily to the end that they may accomplish their designs for otherwise the devil threatens to hinder them by all manner of means that they shall not marry nor have children678 glanvil writing on the scotch trials of 1590 speaks of some effects kinds or circumstances of witchcraft such as the giving and taking away power from sundry mens genitalmembers for which jannet clark was accused679 in the official record jonet clark was tried and condemned for gewing of ane secreit member to iohnne coutis and gewing and taking of power fra sindrie mennis memberis item fylit of taking iohnne wattis secreit member fra him680 sexual ritual occurs in many religions of the lower culture and has always horrified members of the higher religions both in ancient and modern times in fertility cults it is one of the chief features not only symbolizing the fertilizing power in the whole animate world but in the belief of the actors actually assisting it and promoting its effects such fertility rites are governed by certain rules which vary in different countries particularly as to the age of girls ie whether they are over or under puberty among the witches there appears to have been a definite rule that no girl under puberty had sexual intercourse with the devil this is even stated as a fact by so great an authority as bodin les diables ne font point de paction expresse auec les enfans qui leurs sont vouz sils nont attaint laage de pubert681 the details of the trials show that this statement is accurate magdalene de la croix abbesse des moniales de cordoe en espaigne confessa que satan neust point copulation ny cognoissance delle quelle neust douze ans682 bodin and de lancre both cite the case of jeanne hervillier of verbery in compigne she was a woman of fiftytwo at the time of her trial in 1578 she confessa qu laage de douze ans sa mere la presenta au diable en forme dvn grand homme noir vestu de noir bott esperonn auec vne espe au cost et vn cheual noir la porte auquel la mere dit voicy ma fille que ie vous ay promise et la fille voicy vostre amy qui vous fera bien heureuse et deslors quelle renona dieu la religion puis coucha auec elle charnellement en la mesme sorte maniere que font les hommes auec les femmes683 de lancre also emphasizes the age ieanne haruillier depose quencore sa mere leust voe satan ds sa naissance neantmoins quil ne la cognut charnellement quelle neust attainct laage de douze ans684 de lancres own experience points in the same direction he found that the children were not treated in the same way as adults nor were they permitted to join in all the ceremonies until after they had passed childhood685 the same rule appears to have held good in scotland for when little jonet howat was presented to the devil he said what shall i do with such a little bairn as she686 it is however rare to find childwitches in great britain therefore the rules concerning them are difficult to discover another rule appears to have been that there was no sexual connexion with a pregnant woman in the case of isobel elliot the devil offered to lie with her but forbore because she was with child that after she was kirked the devil often met her and had carnal copulation with her687 since the days of reginald scot it has been the fashion of all those writers who disbelieved in the magical powers of witches to point to the details of the sexual intercourse between the devil and the witches as proof positive of hysteria and hallucination this is not the attitude of mind of the recorders who heard the evidence at the trials les confessions des sorciers que iay eu en main me font croire quil en est quelque chose dautant quils out tous recogneu quils auoient est couplez auec le diable et que la semence quil iettoit estoit fort froide ce qui est conforme ce quen rapporte paul grilland et les inquisiteurs de la foy688 it pleaseth their new maister oftentimes to offer himselfe familiarly vnto them to dally and lye with them in token of their more neere coniunction and as it were marriage vnto him689 witches confessing so frequently as they do that the devil lies with them and withal complaining of his tedious and offensive coldness it is a shrewd presumption that he doth lie with them indeed and that it is not a meer dream690 it is this statement of the physical coldness of the devil which modern writers adduce to prove their contention that the witches suffered from hallucination i have shown above pp 61 seq that the devil was often masked and his whole person covered with a disguise which accounts for part of the evidence but not for all and certainly not for the most important item for in trial after trial in places far removed from one another and at periods more than a century apart the same fact is vouched for with just the small variation of detail which shows the actuality of the event this is that when the woman admitted having had sexual intercourse with the devil in a large proportion of cases she added the devil was cold and his seed likewise these were women of every class and every age from just above puberty to old women of over seventy unmarried married and widows it is unscientific to disbelieve everything as scot does and it is equally unscientific to label all the phenomena as the imagination of hysterical women by the nature of things the whole of this evidence rests only on the word of the women but i have shown above pp 635 that there were cases in which the men found the devil cold and cases in which the women found other parts of the devils person to be cold also such a mass of evidence cannot be ignored and in any other subject would obtain credence at once but the hallucinationtheory being the easiest appears to have obsessed the minds of many writers to the exclusion of any attempt at explanation from an unbiassed point of view students of comparative and primitive religion have explained the custom of sacred marriages as an attempt to influence the course of nature by magic the people who practise the rite believing that thereby all crops and herds as well as the women were rendered fertile and that barrenness was averted this accounts very well for the occurrence of obscene rites among the witches but fails when it touches the question of the devils coldness i offer here an explanation which i believe to be the true one for it accounts for all the facts those facts which the women confessed voluntarily and without torture or fear of punishment like isobel gowdie or adhered to as the truth even at the stake amid the flames like jane bosdeau in ancient times the sacred marriage took place usually once a year but besides this ceremony there were other sexual rites which were not celebrated at a fixed season but might be performed in the precincts of the temple of a god or goddess at any time the males being often the priests or temple officials these are established facts and it is not too much to suppose that the witches ceremonies were similar but if the women believed that sexual intercourse with the priests would increase fertility how much more would they believe in the efficacy of such intercourse with the incarnate god of fertility himself they would insist upon it as their right and it probably became compulsory at certain seasons such as the breeding periods of the herds or the sowing and reaping periods of the crops yet as the population and therefore the number of worshippers in each congregation increased it would become increasingly difficult and finally impossible for one man to comply with the requirements of so many women691 the problem then was that on the one hand there were a number of women demanding what was in their eyes a thing essential for themselves and their families and on the other a man physically unable to satisfy all the calls upon him the obvious solution of the problem is that the intercourse between the chief and the women was by artificial means and the evidence in the trials points clearly to this solution artificial phalli are well known in the remains of ancient civilizations in ancient egypt it was not uncommon to have statues of which the phallus was of a different material from the figure and so made that it could be removed from its place and carried in procession the earliest of such statues are the colossal limestone figures of the fertilitygod min found at koptos dating to the first dynasty perhaps bc 5500692 but similar figures are found at every period of egyptian history and a legend was current at the time of plutarch to account for this usage as well as for the festival of the phallephoria693 unless the phallus itself were the object of adoration there would be no reason to carry it in procession as a religious ceremony and it is easily understandable that such a cult would commend itself chiefly to women694 the phallus of a divine statue was not always merely for adoration and carrying in procession the roman bride sacrificed her virginity to the god priapus as a sacred rite this is probably the remains of a still more ancient custom when the god was personated by a man and not by an image the same custom remained in other parts of the world as the jus primae noctis which was held as an inalienable right by certain kings and other divine personages as might be expected this custom obtained also among the witches le diable faict des mariages au sabbat entre les sorciers sorcieres leur joignant

brusle comme si cestoit du feu699 in 1662 isobel gowdie said his memberis ar exceiding great and long no mans memberis ar so long bigg as they ar700 the artificial phallus will account as nothing else can for the pain suffered by many of the women and that they suffered voluntarily and even gladly can only be understood by realizing that they endured it for motives other than physical satisfaction and pleasure there appeared a great black goat with a candle between his horns he had carnal knowledge of her which was with great pain701 presque toutes les sorcieres rapportent que cet accouplement leur est le plus souuent desagreable tant pour la laideur deformit de satan que pour ce quelles y ont vne extreme douleur702 elle fuyoit laccouplement du diable cause quayant son membre faict en

vne grande douleur et ils les voyent aussi tost reuenir au sabbat toutes sanglantes704 as regards brides en cet accouplement il leur faict perdre vne infinit de sang et leur faict souffrir mille douleurs705 widow bush of barton said that the devil who came to her as a young black man was colder than man and heavier and could not performe nature as man706 the physical coldness of the devil is vouched for in all parts of europe707 toutes les sorcieres saccordent en cela que la semence quelles reoiuent du diable est froide comme glace spranger les inquisiteurs qui en ont veu vne infinit

onlie he ves heavie lyk a maltsek a hudg nature verie cold as yce709 another point which goes to prove that the intercourse was by artificial means was that pregnancy did not follow except by special consent of the woman jeannette dabadie aged sixteen said elle fuyoit laccouplement du diable cause quayant son membre faict en escailles il fait souffrir vne extresme douleur outre que la semence est

iours et vn iour le diable luy demanda si elle vouloit estre enceinte de luy ce quelle ne voulut pas712 but when the witch was willing to have a child it is noticeable that there is then no complaint of the devils coldness at maidstone in 1652 anne ashby anne martyn and one other of their associates pleaded that they were with child pregnant but confessed it was not by any man but by the divell anne ashby and anne martyn confessed that the divell had known them carnally and that they had no hurt by it713 the devil appears to have donned or doffed his disguise in the presence of his worshippers and this was often the case at the time of the sexual rites whether public or private il cognoist les sorcieres tantost en forme dhomme tout noir tantost en forme de beste comme dvn chien

description of the religious ceremony at the sabbath finalement satan apres auoir prins la figure dvn bouc se consume en feu reduit en cendre721 the witches habit of speaking of every person of the other sex with whom they had sexual intercourse at the sabbath as a devil has led to much confusion in the accounts the confusion has been accentuated by the fact that both male and female witches often used a disguise or were at least veiled et pource que les hommes ne cedent guieres aux femmes en lubricit cest pourquoy le demon se met aussi en femme ou succube ce quil fait principalement au sabbat selon que lont rapport pierre gandillon george gandillon pere fils les autres lesquels disent tout vnanimement quen leurs assembles il y a plusieurs demons que les vns exercent le mestier de lhomme pour les femmes les autres le mestier des femmes pour les hommes722 the incubuss in the shapes of proper men satisfy the desires of the witches and the succubuss serve for whores to the wizards723 margaret johnson said the same their spirittes vsuallie have knowledge of theire bodies shee also saith that men witches usualie have woemen spirittes and woemen witches men spirittes724 the girls under madame bourignons charge declared that they had daily carnal cohabitation with the devil that they went to the sabbaths or meetings where they eat drank dancd and committed other whoredom and sensualities every one had her devil in form of a man and the men had their devils in the form of a woman they had not the least design of changing to quit these abominable pleasures as one of them of twentytwo years old one day told me no said she i will not be other than i am i find too much content in my condition i am always caressed725 one girl of twelve said definitely that she knew the devil very well that he was a boy a little bigger than her self and that he was her love and lay with her every night and another girl named bellot aged fifteen said her mother had taken her with her to the sabbath when she was very young and that being a little wench this mandevil was then a little boy too and grew up as she did having been always her love and caressed her day and night726 such connexions sometimes resulted in marriage gaule mentions this fact in his general account oft times he marries them ere they part either to himselfe or their familiar or to one another and that by the book of common prayer as a pretender to witchfinding lately told me in the audience of many727 this statement is borne out in the trials agnes theobalda sagte sie sey selbst zugegen auff der hochzeit gewesen da cathalina und engel von hudlingen ihren beelzebub zur ehe genommen haben728 the devil of isobel ramsays coven was clearly her husband729 but there is nothing to show whether the marriage took place before she became a witch as in the case of janet breadheid of auldearne whose husband enticed her into that craft730 i have quoted above p 179 the ceremony at the marriage of witches in the bassespyrnes rebecca weste daughter of a witch married the devil by what may be a primitive rite he came to her as shee was going to bed and told her he would marry her and that shee could not deny him shee said he kissed her but was as cold as clay and married her that night in this manner he tooke her by the hand and lead her about the chamber and promised to be her loving husband till death and to avenge her of her enemies and that then shee promised him to be his obedient wife till death and to deny god and christ jesus731 at edinburgh in 1658 a young woman called anderson was tried her confessioun was that scho did marry the devill732 the swedish witches in 1670 confessed that at blockula the devil had sons and daughters which he did marry together733 giraldus cambrensis gives an account of a spirit in the form of a redhaired young man called simon who was begotten upon the wife of a rustic in that parish by a demon in the shape of her husband naming the man and his fatherinlaw then dead and his mother still alive the truth of which the woman upon examination openly avowed734 footnotes footnote 664 pitcairn i pt ii p 206 glanvil pt ii p 301

community each district however was independent and therefore mather is justified in saying that the witches form themselves after the manner of congregational churches735 1 the officer the chief or supreme head of each district was known to the recorders as the devil below him in each district one or more officersaccording to the size of the districtwere appointed by the chief the officers might be either men or women their duties were to arrange for meetings to send out notices to keep the record of work done to transact the business of the community and to present new members evidently these persons also noted any likely convert and either themselves entered into negotiations or reported to the chief who then took action as opportunity served at the esbats the officer appears to have taken command in the absence of the grand master at the sabbaths the officers were merely heads of their own covens and were known as devils or spirits though recognized as greatly inferior to the chief the principal officer acted as clerk at the sabbath and entered the witches reports in his book if he were a priest or ordained minister he often performed part of the religious service but the devil himself always celebrated the mass or sacrament in the absence of all direct information on the subject it seems likely that the man who acted as principal officer became grand master on the death of the previous chief occasionally the devil appointed a personal attendant for himself who waited upon him on all solemn occasions but does not appear to have held any official position in the community estebene de cambrue 1567 said that elle a veu au sabbat vn notaire quelle nomme lequel a accoustum de leuer les defauts de celles qui ont manqu de se trouuer au sabbat736 at the north

whensoever the devil required the devil gave him that charge to be his officer to warn all to the meetings as was said before in which charge he continued for the space of eighteen years and more739 the evidence concerning isobel shyrie at forfar 1661 is too long to quote but it is clear that she acted as the officer740 isobel gowdie 1662 says definitely johne young in mebestowne is officer to owr coeven and remarks in another part of her confession that johne yownge in mebestowne owr officer did drywe the plewghe741 the only indication of a change of personnel is given by janet breadheid of the same coven as isobel gowdie johne taylor my husband was then officer bot johne young in mebestoune is now officer to my coeven quhan i cam first ther the divell called tham all be thair names

fewar i my self the deceassit jean suthirland bessie hay bessie wilsone and janet burnet wold rule thaim742 in somerset 1664 anne bishop appears to have been the chief personage under the devil in other words the officer743 at paisley 1678 bessie weir was officer to their several meetingsbessie weir did intimate to him john stewart that there was a meeting to be at his house the next day and that the devil under the shape of a black man margaret jackson margery craige and the said bessie weir were to be present and that the said bessie weir required the declarant to be there which he promised744 in new england 1692 it appears that both bridget bishop and martha carrier held high rank and were probably officers one duty seems to have been delegated to a particular individual who might perhaps hold no other office or who might on the other hand be the chief official this was the manager often the leader of the dance as pace seems to have been an essential in the dance the leader was necessarily active and generally young at north berwick 1590 john fein mussiled led the ring745 in aberdeen 1596 thomas leyis was the chief person in the dance thow the said thomas was formest and led the ring and dang the said kathren mitchell becaus scho spillet your dans and ran nocht so fast about as the rest746 isobel cockie of the same coven was next in importance in the quhilk danse thow was the ring leader nixt thomas leyis747 mr gideon penman 1678 who had once been minister at crighton went to the sabbaths where the devil spoke of him as mr gideon my chaplain748 the witches said that ordinarily mr gideon was in the rear in all their dances and beat up those that were slow this mr gideon seems to be the same person as the warlock who formerly had been admitted to the ministrie in the presbyterian times and now he turnes a preacher under the devillthis villan was assisting to satan in this action giving the sacrament and in preaching749 the personal attendant of the devil is rare at aberdeen 1596 issobell richie was accused that at that tyme thow ressauit thy honours fra the dewyll thy maister and wer appoynted be him in all tymes thairefter his speciall domestick servand and furriour750 john mcwilliam sclater 1656 was appointed cloakbearer to the devil751 the devils piper was also an official appointment in scotland but does not occur elsewhere john douglas of tranent 1659 was the devils piper752 and so also was a man mentioned by sinclair a reverend minister told me that one who was the devils piper a wizzard confest to him that at a ball of dancing the foul spirit taught him a baudy song to sing and play753 the queen of the sabbath may perhaps be considered as an official during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries though in early times she was probably the chief personage in the cult as pearson has pointed out754 it is not unlikely that she was originally the same as the queen of elfhame in scotland however in the seventeenth century there is a maiden of the coven which was an important position in the esbat but entirely distinct from the queen of faery while in other places a woman not the queen is often the officer and holds the highest place after the grand master elizabeth stile of windsor 1579 said that mother seidre dwelling in the almeshouse was the maistres witche of all the reste755 marion grant of aberdeen 1597 confessed that the devill thy maister causit the dans sindrie tymes with him and with our ladye quha as thow sayes was a fine woman cled in a quhyte walicot756 in france 1609 the custom seems to have been universal en chasque village trouuer vne royne du sabbat who sat at the devils left hand during the celebration of the mass and received the offerings of the faithful757 the witches called her both the grande matresse and the reine du sabbat758 isobel gowdies confession 1662 shows that the queen of elthame was not the same as the chief woman of the coven for she saw the queen only on going into the fairyhowe while the maiden of the coven was at each meeting we doe no great mater without owr maidenquhan we ar at meat or in any vther place quhateuir the maiden of each coven sittis abow the rest nixt the divell759 in new england 1692 deliverance hobbs confessed that the said g b preached to them and such a woman was their deacon760 2 the covens the word coven is a derivative of convene and is variously spelt coven coeven covine cuwing and even covey the special meaning of the word among the witches is a band or company who were set apart for the practice of the rites of the religion and for the performance of magical ceremonies in short a kind of priesthood the coven was composed of men and women belonging to one district though not necessarily all from one village and was ruled by an officer under the command of the grand master the members of the coven were apparently bound to attend the weekly esbat and it was they who were instructed in and practised magical arts and who performed all the rites and ceremonies of the cult the rest of the villagers attended the esbats when they could or when they felt so inclined but did not necessarily work magic and they attended the sabbaths as a matter of course this view of the organization of the religion is borne out by the common belief in modern france il est de croyance gnrale quil faut un nombre fixe de sorciers et de sorcires dans chaque canton le nouvel initi reprend les vieux papiers de lancienles mauvaises gens forment une confrrie qui est dirige par une sorcire celleci a la jarretire comme marque de sa dignit elles se la transmettent successivement par rang danciennet il nexiste que cette diffrence de rang entre les sorciers et les sorcires ceuxl se recrutent aussi bien parmi les gens maris que chez les clibataires761 the fixed number among the witches of great britain seems to have been thirteen twelve witches and their officer the actual numbers can be obtained as a rule only when the full record of the trial is available for when several witches in one district are brought to trial at the same time they will always be found to be members of a coven and usually the other members of the coven are implicated or at least mentioned the earliest account of a coven is in the trial of bessie dunlop 1567 when thom reid was trying to induce her to join the society he took her to the killend quhair he forbaid her to speik or feir for onye thing sche hard or saw and quhene thai had gane ane lytle pece fordwerd sche saw twelf persounes aucht wemene and four men the men wer cled in gentilmennis clething and the wemene had all plaiddis round about thame and wer verrie semelie lyke to se and thom was with thame762 clearly this was a coven with thom as the officer and he had brought bessie to see and be seen the witches tried at st osyth in essex in 1582 were thirteen in number763 at the meeting of the north berwick witches 1590 to consult on the means to compass the kings death nine witches stood in ane cumpany and the rest to the nowmer of threttie persons in ane vthir cumpany in other words there were thirtynine persons or three covens present764 at aberdeen 15967 sixtyfour names of witches occur in the trials of these seven were merely mentioned as being known to the accused though not as taking part in the ceremonies and five were acquitted thus leaving fiftytwo persons or four covens out of these fiftytwo one was condemned and executed at the assize in 1596 and twelve in 1597 making in all thirteen persons or one coven who were put to death765 the great trial of the lancashire witches in 1613 gives a grand total of fiftytwo witches or four covens whose names occur in the record this includes the three salmesbury witches mentioned by grace sowerbuts whose evidence was discredited as being the outcome of a popish plot to destroy the three women as converts to the reformed church but as the record shows that the other accused witches were tried on similar charges and condemned it may be concluded that other causes occasioned the acquittal taking together however only those witches who are mentioned in these trials as having actually taken part in the ceremonies and practices of witchcraft in the neighbourhood of pendle it will be found that there were thirtynine persons or three covens766 in guernsey in 1617 isabel becquet confessed that at the sabbath the devil used to summon the wizards and witches in regular order she remembered very well having heard him call the old woman collette the first in these terms madame the old woman becquette then the woman fallaise and afterwards the woman hardie item he also called marie wife of massy and daughter of the said collette said that after them she herself was called by the devil in these terms the little becquette she also heard him call there collas becquet son of the said old woman who collas held her by the hand in dancing and some one a woman whom she did not know held her by the other hand there were about six others there she did not know767 at queensferry in 1644 thirteen women were tried and seven executed for witchcraft768 at alloa 1658 though thirteen persons or one coven were brought to trial the word is used to indicate a smaller number margret duchall lykewayis declared that ther was sex women mair besyd hir self that was in thair

1661 gives the names of thirteen persons or one coven771 at crook of devon 1662 there were tried twelve women and one man ie one coven772 isobel gowdie of auldearne 1662 gives the most detail concerning the covens jean mairten is maiden of owr coeven johne younge is officer to owr coeventher ar threttein persons in ilk coeven her evidence shows that there were several covens in the

thirtynine persons or three covens who were present in the kirk of nairn when she was admitted into the society773 in somerset 1664 the number of accused was twentysix persons or two covens774 at newcastleontyne 1673 ann armstrong stated that at the meeting at the rideing house in the close on the common she saw ten men and women whom she knew and thre more whose names she knowes not at another meeting at rideing millne bridgend she see the said anne forster anne dryden and luce thompson and tenne more unknowne to heratt the house of john newton off the riding the said lucy wished that a boyld capon with silver scrues might come down to her and the rest which were five coveys consisting of thirteen person in every covey at a large meeting at allensford where a great many witches were present every thirteen of them had a divell with them in sundry shapes it is also noticeable that ann armstrong mentions twentysix persons by name as having been at various meetings to her knowledge775 at paisley 1692 thirteen persons of high position brought an action for libel against six others for saying that they the thirteen had drunk the devils health in the house of one of them the libellers were punished but the number of persons libelled suggests that the accusation might have been true776 3 duties an important part of the organization was the system of reporting to the grand master everything which had happened since the previous great assembly the chief work of the covens was the performance of magical rites either publicly at the esbats or privately in the houses of the witches and their neighbours as these rites especially when performed privately were more or less in the nature of experiments the results were reported and when successful were recorded in writing for future use the book in which the records were made remained in the hands of the devil who in this way had always a store of welltried magical spells and recipes to kill or cure from which he could instruct his followers as occasion demanded the position of the devil as the instructor of the witches is to be found in most of the trials in great britain cooper states this plainly he deliuers unto his proselite and so to the rest the rules of his art instructing them in the manner of hurting and helping and acquainting them with such medicines and poysons as are vsuall herevnto777 bessie dunlop 1567 never attempted to cure any disease without first consulting thom reid quhen sundrie persounes cam to hir to seik help for thair beist thair kow or yow or for ane barne

how scho sould vse thame and gewis hir his directioune att all tymes779 agnes sampson the wise wife of keith 1590 always asked the devils advice in serious cases she had a familiar spirit who upon her call did appear in a visible form and resolve her of any doubtful matter especially concerning the life or death of persons lying sick780 grissel gairdner of newburgh 1610 was executed for consulting with the devill and seiking of responssis fra him at all tymes this fourtene or fyftene 3eir bygane for effectuating of hir devillisch intentiones781 elspeth reoch in orkney 1616 confessed that the fairy man whom she met told her he wald lerne her to ken and sie ony thing she wald desyre782 isobel haldane of perth 1623 also obtained all her information as to life and death from the man with the grey beird whom she met among the fairy folk783 jonet rendall another orkney witch 1629 stated that the devill apperit to you quhom ye called walliman claid in quhyt cloathis with ane quhyt head and ane gray beard and said to you he sould learne yow to win almiss be healling of folk784 sandie hunter was only moderately successful in curing cattle till he covenanted with the devil who came to him in the form of a mediciner and said sandie you have too long followed my trade and never acknowledged me for your master you must now take on with me and be my servant and i will make you more perfect in your calling whereupon the man gave up himself to the devil after this he grew very famous throw the countrey for his charming and cureing of diseases in men and beasts785 reginald scot says that the witches were taught by the devil to make magical ointments and that he supplied their want of powders and roots to intoxicate withal786 it was the devil who pointed out which graves were to be opened in order to obtain the material for working magic and when the bodies had been exhumed and dismembered he told the witches how to use the fragments787 it was the devil who made788 or baptized789 the wax and clay images and who stuck the first thorn or pin into them790 it was the devil who held the mock plough at auldearne and taught the witches of that place all the charms they knew we get all this power from the divell says isobell gowdie791 it was the devil who instigated and superintended the wrecking of the bridge at cortaquhie concerning which helen guthrie said shee her selfe jonnet stout and others of them did thrust ther shoulderis againest the bridge and isobel smyth confessed wee all rewed that meitting for wee hurt our selves lifting792 the book in which the magical recipes were recorded must have been of great value to its owner and one which he would not willingly allow to pass out of his hands a volume of this kind was known to be extant till the beginning of the last century it was called the red book of appin there are two stories as to how it was taken from the devil but both stories agree that it was obtained by a trick it was in manuscript and contained charms for the cure of cattle and was consulted when cows were bewitched and refused to give milk it was also supposed to confer magical powers on the owner who was said to know what the inquiry would be before the inquirer opened his lips and it was in itself so magical that the owner had to wear a hoop of iron on his head when turning its leaves793 another devilsbook was carried away apparently as a joke by mr williamson of cardrona who took it from the witches as they danced on minchmoor but they followed him and he returned it794 the system of reporting everything to the chief of the community makes it certain that he was supplied with such current information as made his knowledge of public and private affairs appear miraculous to the uninitiated even those who supplied that information had firm faith in his supernatural power to kill or cure and believed with equal ardour in the charms which he taught them to make and use in reviewing the evidence it seems clear that the witches of the covens were bound to exercise their powers in the intervals between the meetings they were bound to attend those meetings unless absolutely prevented in order to learn new methods as well as to make their reports and they were bound to obey the grand masters orders and to treat him with the deference and respect due to his exalted position 4 discipline discipline was maintained by a system of rewards and punishments enforced or relaxed according to the personal character of the chief as a rule only the severer punishments are recorded but occasionally there are indications of minor chastisements the contemporary writers make the system of rewards and punishments very clear satan calleth them togither into a diuelish sinagoge and that he may also vnderstand of them howe well and diligently they haue fulfilled their office of intoxicating committed vnto them and wh they haue slaine795 such as are absent and have no care to be assoygned are amerced to this paenalty so to be beaten on the palms of their feete to be whipt with iron rods to be pincht and suckt by their familiars till their heart blood come till they repent them of their sloath and promise more attendance and diligence for the future796 taking account also of the proceedings of his other schollers and so approuing or condemning accordingly797 sometimes at their solemn assemblies the devil commands that each tell what wickedness he hath committed and according to the hainousness and detestableness of it he is honoured and respected with a general applause those on the contrary that have done no evil are beaten and punished798 the usual punishment was beating which was inflicted for various offences chiefly disrespect or neglect of duty at arras in 1460 jean tacquet a rich eschevin had endeavoured to withdraw his allegiance from satan who had forced him to continue it by beating him cruelly with a bulls pizzle799 in lorraine 1589 the grand master seems to have been peculiarly brutal jana gerardina catharina russa und francisca fellaea bezeugten dass sie mehr als einmal schwerlich mit harten streichen htten bssen mssen wenn sie

child with them but now he did plague them and whip them if they did not procure him children808 among the northumberland witches 1673 all of them who had donne harme gave an account thereof to their protector who made most of them that did most harme and beate those who had donne no harmeat the said meeting their particular divell tooke them that did most evill and danced with them first and called every of them to an account and those that did most evill he maid most ofthe devill in the forme of a little black man and black cloaths calld of one isabell thompson of slealy widdow by name and required of her what service she had done him she replyd she had gott power of the body of one margarett teasdale and after he had danced with her he dismissed her and calld of one thomasine wife of edward watson of slealy809 punishments for minor offences are rarely recorded at north berwick 1590 when the witches returned after sinking a ship seeing that they tarried over long hee at their comming enjoyned them all to a pennance which was that they should kisse his buttockes in sign of duety to him810 at aberdeen 1597 christen mitchell confessed that when the devil asked her to join

quhome scho maid this ansuer sir i could wyn na soner812 at lille if any witch desired to leave the religion the devil reproves them then more severely and obligeth them to new promises813 occasionally the witches kept discipline among themselves this seems to have been the case only when the culprit prevented the proper execution of magical performances at aberdeen thomas leyis led the ring and dang the said kathren mitchell becaus scho spillit your dans and ran nocht sa fast about as the rest814 at auldearne isobel gowdie described how the witches used flint arrowheads i shot at

penman acted as the devils chaplain ordinarily mr gideon was in the rear in all their dances and beat up all those that were slow816 but a reasonable excuse for trifling misdemeanours could be accepted the devill asked at kathrine moore quhair hir husband was that he came not she answered there was a young bairne at home and that they could not both come817 capital punishment was reserved for traitors actual and potential it must have been brought into use only after the cult had fallen upon evil days and then only when the chief himself was in danger beating to death hanging and poison were the usual means of execution the earliest instance occurred in 1450 when the church had begun to use its power systematically against the witches the inquisitor of como bartolomeo de homate the podest lorenzo da carorezzo and the notary giovanni da fossato either out of curiosity or because they doubted the witches whom they were trying went to a place of assembly at mendrisio and witnessed the scene from a hidingplace the presiding demon pretended not to know their presence and in due course dismissed the assembly but suddenly recalled his followers and set them on the officials who were so beaten that they died within fifteen days818 alesoun peirson 1588 was burnt as a witch having gained her knowledge from the fairies who threatened that gif scho wald speik and tell of thame and thair doingis thay sould martir hir819 the lorraine witches 1589 took an oath of silence welchen eyd sie so hoch und heilig halten dass wenn sie eydbrchig werden so darfr halten also

be in hell and the said rebecca told this informant that shee promised to keepe all their secrets and moreover they all told her that shee must never confesse any thing although the rope were about her necke and shee ready to be hanged824 in fifeshire 1649 ane mistres hendersone sister to fordell hendersone in the presbytrey of dumfermling sometymes lady of pittahro being delated by many to be a witch was apprehended and caried to edenbroughe wher she was keiped fast and after her remaining in prison for a tyme being in health att night vpon the morne was founde dead it was thought and spoken by many that she wronged her selfe either by strangling or by poyson825 the swedish children 1670 were not spared if the children did at any time name the names of those that had carried them away they were again carried by force either to blockula or to the cross way and there miserably beaten insomuch that some of them died of it826 whether deliverance hobbs 1692 was actually beaten or whether her statement was made from the knowledge of what might happen to her cannot be certain without reference to the records of the trial itself as mathers bias is apt to distort the evidence she now testifid that this bishop tempted her to sign the book again and to deny what she had confessd she affirmd that it was the shape of this prisoner which whipped her with iron rods to compel her thereunto827 elizabeth anderson in renfrewshire 1696 went with her father to a witchmeeting severals of them being affraid that the declarant would confess and tell of them as she done formerly on her grandmother they threatened to tear her all in pieces if she did so828 john reid of the same coven after his confession had called out of his prison window desiring baily scott to keep that old body angus forrester who had been his fellow prisoner closs and secure whereupon the company asked john when they were leaving him on friday night the 21th of may whether he desired company or would be afraid alone he said he had no fear of anything so being left till saturday in the forenoon he was found in this posture viz sitting upon a stool which was on the hearth of the chimney with his feet on the floor and his body straight upward his shoulders touching the lintel of the chimney but his neck tyed with his own neckcloath whereof the knot was behind to a small stick thrust into a hole above the lintel of the chimney upon which the company especially john campbel a chyrurgeon who was called thought at first in respect of his being in an ordinary posture of sitting and the neckcloath

puzzled the student of witchtrials and almost more than any other has been the cause of the belief that hysteria and hallucination were the foundation of the witches confessions yet when the accounts are carefully examined the circumstantial detail given in the evidence shows that here as elsewhere a foundation of fact underlies the statements of the accused these statements are often misunderstood and therefore misrepresented by the recorders and still more so by the modern commentator but by comparison of the details a considerable amount of information can be gained the familiars can be divided into two types 1 those by which the witch divined 2 those who attended on the witch to obey her commands 1 the divining familiar the essence of this familiar is that it did not belong to the witch but was an animal which appeared accidentally after the performance of certain magical ceremonies forbes puts this quite clearly when describing the contract the devil on his part articles with such proselytes concerning the shape he is to appear to them in the services they are to expect from him upon the performance of certain charms or ceremonious rites831 from this statement and from the facts revealed in the trials it would seem that the devil appointed to the witch on her admission some kind of animal or animals by which she should divine and which therefore represented himself for the time being for he claimed the power as god to know and reveal the future this explanation accounts for the fact that the witches always spoke of such animals as the devil and believed that they could foretell the future by his means the actual method of divination is not preserved all that remains of the ceremony are the words and gestures which were used before the appearance of the animal and these only in few cases the method was probably such as obtained in other places where auguries by animals and birds were practised ie by the direction and pace of the animal by its actions by its voice if it emitted any sound and so on the method of making such observations and of translating them when made was part of the instruction given to the witch by the devil and was usually employed to discover whether a person were bewitched the ultimate result of an illness and the length of life of any given person in 1566 john walsh of netherberry in dorset who knoweth when anye man is bewytched sayth vpon his oth that his familiar would sometyme come vnto hym lyke a gray blackish culuer and somtime like a brended dog and somtimes lyke a man832 in 1590 agnes sampson the wise wife of keith was fylit and convict that the dewill apperit to hir in liknes of ane dog att quhom she socht her haill responsis that quhene sche wes send for to haill the auld lady

gregories dog of stapenhill there arose a rumor his dog was her familiar wherefore hee with his neighbour maister coxe went the next day to examin her concerning this report and she saide my diuel i say was like your dog now out vpon thee saide gregorie and departed she being further examined saide she had her familiar of her mother835 alexander hamilton tried at edinburgh in 1630 confessed that haifing ane battoun of fir in his hand the devill than gave the said alexr command to tak that battoun quhan evir he had ado with him and thairwt to strek thruse upone the ground and to nhairge him to ruse up foule theiff conforme to the whilk directioun and be streking of the said battone thryse upone the ground the devill was in use sumtymes to appeir to the said alexr in the liknes of ane corbie at uther tymes in the schape of ane katt and at uther tymes in the schape of ane dog and thereby the said alexr did ressave reponsis frome himthe said alexr hamiltoun coming to the said thomas homes

quhat meanis he sould cure the said thomas of his said seiknes and he haifing ressauit that respons fra the devill the said alexr thereftir cuist to him the kat quha therewt vanischet away836 two of the somerset witches in 1664 had familiars to elizabeth style the familiar came as a black dog and when she hath a desire to do harm she calls the spirit by the name of robin to whom when he appeareth she useth these words o sathan give me my purpose she then tells him what she would have done and that he should so appear to her was part of her contract with himalice duke saith that when the devil doth any thing for her she calls for him by the name of robin upon which he appears and when in the shape of a man she can hear him speak837 this shows that the familiar or devil as she called him was not always in the form of a man the trial of margaret ningilbert at thurso was as late as 1719 being interrogat if ever the devil appeared afterwards to her confessed that sometimes he appeared in the likeness of a great black horse and other times riding on a black horse and that he appeared sometimes in the likeness of a black cloud and sometimes like a black henn838 2 the domestic familiar forbes the great scotch lawyer says that to some he the devil gives certain spirits or imps to correspond with and serve them as their familiars known to them by some odd names to which they answer when called these imps are said to be kept in pots or other vessels839 though the domestic familiar is thus mentioned in the law of scotland it never occurs in the trials it is confined so strictly to england that hutchinson is able to say i meet with little mention of imps in any country but ours where the law makes the feeding suckling or rewarding of them to be felony840 it is not found north of lancashire and the chief records are in essex suffolk and the other eastern counties the domestic familiar was always a small animal was fed in a special manner on bread and milk and blood and was kept as forbes points out in a box or earthen pot on a bed of wool it was used for working magic on the persons and property of other people never for divining giffard records the general belief the witches have their spirits some hath one some hath more as two three foure or five some in one likenesse and some in another as like cats weasils toades or mise whom they nourish with milke or with a chicken or by letting them suck now and then a drop of bloud841 in the earlier trials the witches confessed to pricking the hands or face and giving the resulting drop or drops of blood to the familiar in the later trials this has developed into the sucking of the witchs blood by the familiar and the supernumerary nipple which was so marked a feature of the english witches was popularly supposed to be caused by such sucking it is more probable however that the witch who was possessed of a supernumerary nipple would regard it as something supernatural and would use it to nourish a supernatural animal elizabeth francis tried at chelmsford in 1556 learned this arte of witchcraft of hyr grandmother whose nam mother eue item when shee taughte it her she counseiled her to renounce god and his worde and to geue of her bloudde to sathan as she termed it whyche she delyuered her in the lykenesse of a whyte spotted catte and taughte her to feede the sayde catte with breade and

pouertie to occupie the woll she praied in the name of the father and of the sonne and of the holy ghost that it wold turne into a tode and forthwith it was turned into a tode and so kept it in the

brought to her house by one goodwife hagtree which imp this examinant entertained fed it with oatmeale and suckled it on her body for the space of a yeer and a halfe or thereabouts and then lost it and this examinant further saith that about half a yeer since one joyce boanes who is now also accused for witchcraft brought to this examinants house another imp in the likenesse of a small grey bird which this examinant received and this examinant further saith that about eight dayes since susan cock margaret landish and joyce boanes all which stand now suspected for witchcraft brought to this examinants house each of them an imp in all three to which this examinant added one of her own imps and then the said joyce boanes carryed the said four imps to the house of one robert turner to torment his servantjoyce boanes saith that about thirteen yeers since shee had two imps which came into the bed to her in the likenesse of mouses and that they sucked on this examinants body and this examinant also saith that she carried one of her said imps called rug to the house of the said rose hallybread and that her said imp rug with the three imps of the said rose hallybread susan cock and margaret landish each of them sending one were carried by this examinant from the house of the said rose hallybread to the house of the said robert turner to kill the servant of the said robertsusan cock saith that about three or four yeeres since one margery stoakes this examinants mother lying upon her deathbed and this examinant comming to visit her shee the said margery desired this examinant privately to give entertainment to two of her imps and withall told this examinant they would do this examinant good and this examinant saith that the same night her said mother dyed the said two imps came to her accordingly and sucked on her body and this examinant saith that one of the said imps was like a mouse and the name of that was susan that the other was of a yellow colour about the bigness of a cat and that the name of that imp was besserebecca jones saith that as shee was going to st osyth where this examinant doth now dwell to sell her said masters butter a man met with her being in a ragged sute and having such great eyes that this examinant was much afraid of him who came to this examinant and gave her three things like to moules having foure feet a piece but without tayles and of a black colour and bid this examinant nurse the said three things untill he did desire them againe and this examinant asked the said man what she should give them to eate and he told this examinant milke and that they would not hurt her and wished her not to be afraid of them and the said man told this examinant that those three things which he gave her would avenge her on her enemies and bid her murther some but not too many and he would forgive her and then went away from this examinant and this examinant saith that the names of her three imps were margaret amie and susan and that a while after this examinant and one joyce boanes now in prison did send each of them an impe to kill one thomas bumstead of st osyth and that the impe which the said joyce boanes sent was a dund one like unto a mousejohan cooper saith that she hath been a witch about twenty yeers and hath three familiars two like mouses and the third like a frog the names of the two like mouses are jack and the other prickeare and the name of the third like a frog is froganne cate saith that she hath four familiars which shee had from her mother about two and twenty yeeres since and that the names of the said imps are james prickeare robyn and sparrow and that three of these imps are like mouses and the fourth like a sparrow which she called sparrow852 in 1646 the huntingdonshire witches were tried elizabeth weed of great catworth confessed that about one and twenty yeares since she being saying her prayers in the evening about bedtime there did appeare unto her three spirits one in the likeness of a young man or boy and the other two of two puppies the one white and the other black being demanded the name of the lesser spirits shee saith the name of the white one was lilly and the blacke one priscill and that the office of lilly was to hurt man woman or childe and the office of priscill was to hurt cattell when she desiredfrancis moore saith that about eight yeares since she received a little blacke puppy from one margaret simson of great catworth which dog the said margaret had in her bed with her and took it thence when she gave it to the examinate the examinate further saith that the said margaret told her that she must keep that dogge all her life time and if she cursed any cattell and set the same dog upon them they should presently dye and the said margaret told her that she had named it already his name was pretty and the said examinate further saith that about the same time one goodwife weed gave her a white cat telling her that if she would deny god and affirme the same by her bloud then whomsoever she cursed and sent that cat unto they should dye shortly after whereupon the said examinate saith that shee did deny god and in affirmation thereof shee pricked her finger with a thorne whence issued bloud which the cat presently licked and the said gooodwife sic weed named the cat tissy and she further saith that she killed the said dog and cat about a yeare sincejoan wallis of keiston said that the devil came to her and shee asked what his name was and he said his name was blackeman and asked her if she were poore and she said i then he told her he would send one grissell and greedigut to her that shall do any thing for her and after blackman was departed from her within three or four dayes grissell and greedigut came to her in the shapes of dogges with great brisles of hogges haire upon their backs the accounts given by john winnick ellen shepheard and anne desborough suggest that they are confused amplifications of the ritual to be observed in taking a familiar the ritual being clearly given in the confession of francis moore when she was presented with the cat tissy john winnick said on a friday being in the barne where he lost his purse there appeared unto him a spirit blacke and shaggy and having pawes like a beare but in bulk not fully so big as a coney the spirit asked him what he ailed to be so sorrowfull this examinate answered that he had lost a purse and money and knew not how to come by it againe the spirit replied if you will forsake god and christ and fall down and worship me for your god i will help you to your purse and mony againe this examinate said he would and thereupon fell down upon his knees and held up his hands then the spirit said tomorrow about this time of the day you shall find your purse whereupon at the time prefixed this examinate went unto the place and found his purse upon the floore and tooke it up and looking afterwards into it he found there all the money that was formerly lost but before he had looked into it the same spirit appears unto him and said there is your purse and your money in it and then this examinate fell downe upon his knees and said my lord and god i thanke you the said spirit at that time brought with him two other spirits for shape bignesse and colour the one like a white cat the other like a grey coney and while this examinate was upon his knees the beare spirit spake to him saying you must worship these two spirits as you worship me and take them for your gods also then this examinate directed his bodie towards them and calld them his lords and gods then the beare spirit told him that when he dyed he must have his soule whereunto this examinate yielded hee told him then also that they must suck of his body to which this examinate also yieldedellen shepheard saith that about five years since when she was in her homsted at molesworth there appeared unto her a spirit somewhat like a rat but not fully so big of an irongrey colour and said you must goe with me and she said i will not avoid satan and thereupon he went away shee saith that within a short time after going into the field cursing and fretting and blaspheming there appeared three spirits more with the former in the fashion of rats of an irongrey and said you must forsake god and christ and goe with me and take those spirits for your gods and you shall have all happinesse whereunto she consented and moreover they said unto her that when she dyed they must have her body and soule and said they must have blood from her which she granted and thereupon they sucked her upon and about her hippesanne desborough confesseth that about thirty yeares since the first weeke of cleane lent there appeared unto her a thing somewhat bigger than a mouse of a brown colour and of the likenesse of a mouse this was while shee lived at tichmarsh in the county of northampton she being there in bed and in a dreame the said likenesse then gave her a nip and thereby awakened her out of her dreame and then told her when she was awakened that it must have part of her soule whereupon she was in a great feare and gave him no answer but prayed to god and thereupon it vanished away from her about five dayes after the same mouse appeared to her againe bringing with it another mouse about the bignesse of an ordinary mouse or very little bigger browne like the former save only that the latter had some white about the belly whereas the former was all browne then the mouse that first appeared said we must sucke of your body she yielded to them and said they should upon her yielding they went to her and sucked of her bodie where the markes are found the bigger mouse she called tib and the lesser jone tib told her that she must forsake god and christ and take them for her gods telling her that when she dyed they must have her soule to all which she yielded853 in cambridgeshire in 1647 dorothy ellis saith that about thirtie yeares since shee being much troubled in her minde there appeared unto hir the devell in the liknes of a great catt and speak unto this ext and demanded of hir hir blood wch she gave hime after which the spirit in the liknes of a catt suck upon the body of this ext and the first thing this ext commanded her spirit to doe was to goe and be witch four of the cattell of tho hitch all which cattell presently died 854 john palmer of st albans in 1649 upon his compact with the divel received a flesh brand or mark upon his side which gave suck to two familiars the one in the form of a dog which he called george and the other in the likeness of a woman called jezebell855 of the somerset witches in 1664 alice duke confesseth that her familiar doth commonly suck her right breast about seven at night in the shape of a little cat of a dunnish colour which is as smooth as a want and when she is suckt she is in a kind of a trancechristian green saith the devil doth usually suck her left brest about five of the clock in the morning in the likeness of an hedghog bending and did so on wednesday morning last she saith that it is painful to her and that she is usually in a trance when she is suckt856 in 1665 abre grinset of dunwich in suffolk did confess that the devil did appear in the form of a pretty handsom young man first and since appeareth to her in the form of a blackish gray cat or kitling that it sucketh of a tett and hath drawn blood857 the only published account of the animal familiar in france shows a combination of the two classes for the creature was a toad kept in the house fed in a particular way and used for divination silvain nevillon and gentien le clerc were tried at orleans in 1614 silvain confessed quil y a des sorciers qui nourrissent des marionettes qui sont de petits diableteaux en

marionette luy apportoit tousiours quelque chose858 with this may be compared the account of a lapp familiar in 1653 dans chaque maison il y a un gros chat noir duquel ils font grand estime parlant luy comme sil avoit de la raison ne font rien quil ne luy communique croyans quil leur aide en leurs entreprises ne manquans tous les soirs de sortir de leurs cabannes pour le consulter les suit par tout o ils vont tant la pesche qu la chasse quoy que cet animal ait la figure dun chat par son regard qui est pouvantable jay creu croy encore que cest un diable familier 3 methods of obtaining familiars there seem to have been four methods of obtaining familiars 1 by gift from the devil 2 by gift from a fellowwitch 3 by inheritance 4 by magical ceremonies of these nos 2 and 3 appear to be confined to the domestic familiar consequently they are found chiefly in the eastern counties of england 1 the gift of the devil was sometimes a divining familiar sometimes a domestic familiar commonly presented at the admission ceremony as the divining familiar it represented the devil himself and the responses received to questions were believed to come from him as the essential point of this class of familiar was that it should be a species of animals and not one special animal the devil merely appointed to the witch what species she should observe in divining the domestic familiar being a small animal could be actually given into the hands of the witch with instructions for its feeding and for the method of using it it was sometimes but not always identified with the devil and was usually859 called an imp860 perhaps with the idea of a small or miniature devil like the marionette of silvain nevillon it acted as the devils substitute when he himself was not present and was endowed with some though not all of his power for this reason the witch often had more than one familiar each to serve a single purpose in 1645 at ipswich mother lakeland confessed that after she had signed the covenant with the devil he furnished her with three imps two little dogs and a mole861 in the same year rebecca jones an essex witch saith that as shee was going to st osyth to sell her masters butter a man met with her being in a ragged sute and having such great eyes that this examinant was much afraid of him who came to this examinant and gave her three things like to moules having foure feet a piece but without tayles and of a black colour and bid this examinant nurse the said three things untill he did desire them againe and the said man told this examinant that those three things which he gave her would avenge her on her enemies and bid her murther some but not too many and he would forgive her and then went away from this examinant862 in 1646 the huntingdonshire witch joane wallis said that blackman told her he would send one grissell and greedigut to her that shall do any thing for her and after blackman was departed from her within three or four dayes grissell and greedigut came to her in the shapes of dogges863 another witch of the same coven elizabeth weed confessed that there did appeare unto her three spirits one in the likenesse of a young man or boy and the other two of two puppies the one white and the other black864 2 the gift from a fellowwitch was always a domestic familiar as to the devil alone belonged the power of appointing a divining familiar therefore this method of obtaining a familiar is found only in the eastern counties and other places where the domestic or sucking familiar is recorded in 1556 elizabeth francis whose evidence was corroborated by mother waterhouse said that she came to one mother waterhouse her neighbour she brought her this cat in her apron and taught her as she was instructed by her grandmother eue telling her that she must cal him sathan and geue him of her bloude and bread and milke as beforemother waterhouse said she receyued this cat of this frances wife in the order as is before sayde865 in 1566 john walsh the dorset witch being demaunded whether he had euer any familiar or no he sayth that he had one of his sayde mayster he being demaunded howe long he had the vse of the familiar he sayd one yeare by his sayd maisters life and iiii yeres after his death866 an essex witch in 1588 had three familiars one like a cat which she called lightfoot this lightfoote she said one mother barlie of w solde her aboue sixteene yeares ago for an ouen cake and told her the cat would do her good seruice if she woulde she might send her of her errand867 at orleans in 1614 gentil le clerc said that he had seen nevillons familiar and that nevillon luy a dit vne douzaine de fois que sil vouloit il luy en feroit auoir vne868 elizabeth clarke in essex in 1645 said she had three impes from her mother which were of a broune colour and two from old beldam weste the said anne weste seemed much to pitie this examinant for her lamenesse having but one leg and her poverty and said to this examinant that there was wayes and meanes for her to live much better then now shee did and said that shee would send to this examinant a thing like a little kitlyn which would fetch home some victualls for this examinant and that it should doe her no hurt869 the huntingdonshire witch francis moore in 1646 saith that about eight yeares since she received a little blacke puppy from one margaret simson of great catworth the examinate further saith that the said margaret told her that she must keep that dogge all her life time and if she cursed any cattell and set the same dog upon them they should presently dye and the said examinate further saith that about the same time one goodwife weed gave her a white cat telling her that if she would deny god and affirme the same by her bloud then whomsoever she cursed and sent that cat unto they should dye shortly after870 3 the profession of the witchreligion being hereditary it is not uncommon to find that the familiar descended from mother to daughter this like the familiar given by one witch to another was the domestic familiar it was sometimes presented during the mothers lifetime or was left as a legacy at her death elizabeth francis in 1556 stated that she learned this arte of witchcraft at the age of xii yeres of hyr grandmother whose nam mother eue of hatfyelde peuerell disseased item when shee taughte it her she counseiled her to renounce god and his worde and to geue of her bloudde to sathan as she termed it whyche she delyuered her in the lykenesse of a whyte spotted catte871 in 1582 ales hunt of st osyth confessed to having two spirits and saith that her sister named margerie sammon hath also two spirites like toades the one called tom and the other robbyn and saith further her sayde syster and shee had the sayd spyrites of their mother mother barnes872 in 1597 the derbyshire witch alse gooderidge stated that the diuell appeared to me in lykenesse of a little partiecolored dog red and white and i called him minny she saide she had her familiar of her mother873 the essex witches tried in 1645 also inherited familiars from their mothers anne cooper confessed that she the said anne offered to give unto her daughter sarah cooper an impe in the likenes of a gray kite ie kit or cat to suck on the said sarahsusan cock saith that about three or four yeeres since one margery stoakes this examinants mother lying upon her deathbed and this examinant comming to visit her shee the said margery desired this examinant privately to give entertainment to two of her imps and withall told this examinant they would do this examinant good and this examinant saith that the same night her said mother dyed the said two imps came to her accordingly and sucked on her bodyanne cate saith that she hath four familiars which shee had from her mother about two and twenty yeeres since874 in 1667 at liverpool margaret loy being arraigned for a witch confessed she was one and when she was asked how long she had so been replied since the death of her mother who died thirty years ago and at her decease she had nothing to leave her and this widow bridge that were sisters but her two spirits and named them the eldest spirit to this widow and the other spirit to her the said margaret loy875 this inheritance of a familiar may be compared with the lapp custom the laplanders bequeath their demons as part of their inheritance which is the reason that one family excels another in this magical art876 4 the method of obtaining a familiar by means of magical words or actions is clearly described in two modern examples sometime in the beginning of the last century two old dames attended the morning service at llanddewi brefi church and partook of the holy communion but instead of eating the sacred bread like other communicants they kept it in their mouths and went out then they walked round the church outside nine times and at the ninth time the evil one came out from the church wall in the form of a frog to whom they gave the bread from their mouths and by doing this wicked thing they were supposed to be selling themselves to satan and become witchesthere was an old man in north pembrokeshire who used to say that he obtained the power of bewitching in the following manner the bread of his first communion he pocketed he made pretence at eating it first of all and then put it in his pocket when he went out from the service there was a dog meeting him by the gate to which he gave the bread thus selling his soul to the devil ever after he possessed the power to bewitch877 on the analogy of these two examples i suggest that in the accounts of familiars offering themselves to the witch there was previous to such appearance some formula of words or some magical action which are not recorded the animal which first appeared after such words or actions would be considered as the devil as in the two cases quoted above such an explanation accounts for the statements of some of the witches that on the appearance of the animal they at once renounced the christian religion and vowed obedience to the new god it is noticeable that in many cases the accused acknowledged that before the appearance of the animal they had been banning and cursing in other words calling on the devil the appearance of the animal after such summons produced neither surprise nor alarm and in fact seems to have been regarded as the effect of their words in 1556 joan waterhouse the eighteenyearold daughter of the witch mother waterhouse of hatfield peveril being angry with another girl shee goinge home dydde as she had seene her mother doe callynge sathan whiche came to her as she sayd in the lykenes of a great dogge878 at aberdeen in 1597 agnes wobster said that the devil appeared in the liknes of a lamb quhom thow callis thy god and bletit on the and thaireftir spak to the879 james device one of the chief of the lancashire witches in 1613 confessed that vpon sheare thursday was two yeares his grandmother elizabeth sothernes alias dembdike did bid him this examinate goe to the church to receiue the communion the next day after being good friday and then not to eate the bread the minister gaue him but to bring it and deliuer it to such a thing as should meet him in his way homewards notwithstanding her perswasions this examinate did eate the bread and so in his comming homeward some fortie roodes off the said church there met him a thing in the shape of a hare who spoke vnto this examinate and asked him whether hee had brought the bread880 in 1621 elizabeth sawyer the witch of edmonton said that the first time that the diuell came vnto me was when i was cursing swearing and blaspheming881 the evidence of the huntingdonshire witches john winnick and ellen shepheard in 1646 see above p 219 and of dorothy ellis of cambridgeshire in 1647 also show that the animal which appeared to the witch after an access of emotion was at once acknowledged as god and accepted as the familiar mary osgood of andover in 1692 confesses that about 11 years ago when she was in a melancholy state and condition she used to walk abroad in her orchard and upon a certain time she saw the appearance of a cat at the end of the house which yet she thought was a real cat however at that time it diverted her from praying to god and instead thereof she prayed to the devil882 the familiars in human form were human beings usually of the sex opposite to that of the witch as these familiars were generally called devils it is sometimes difficult to distinguish them from the grandmaster883 but the evidence taken as a whole suggests that at certain parts of the ritual every individual of the company was known as a devil this suggestion is borne out in the modern survival of an ancient dance in the bassespyrnes where the dancers to this day are called satans884 lady alice kyteler in 1324 was accused that the devil came to her quandoque in specie cujusdam aethiopis cum duobus sociis885 in 1598 the lyons witches thievenne paget and antoine tornier speak of leurs demons as distinct from the great devil and the evidence of all the other witches shows that il y a encor des demons qui assistent ces danses886 de lancre says that there was more than one devil the great one who was called matre leonard and a little one called matre jean mullin it was this smaller devil who held the meetings in the absence of the chief en la place du grd maistre il ny auoit quvn petit diable ou demon qui nauoit point de cornes lequel ne contentoit pas la compagnie comme son maistre quelles nauoient tant de confiance en toute la trouppe des mauuais anges quen celuy seul quils auoient accoustum dadorer seruir table on se sied selon sa qualit ayant chacun son demon assis auprs parfois vis vis et quand ils ont mang chaque demon prd sa disciple par la main danse auec elle887 in 1618 joan willimott of leicester confessed that shee hath a spirit which shee calleth pretty which was giuen vnto her by william berry whom she serued three yeares the spirit stood vpon the ground in the shape and forme of a woman which spirit did aske of her her soule which shee then promised vnto it being willed thereunto by her master888 in 1633 margaret johnson the lancashire witch stated that besides theire particular familiars or spirits there was one greate or grand devill or spirit more eminent than the rest shee allsoe saith yt if a witch have but one marke shee hath but one spirit if two then two spirits if three yet but two spirits shee alsoe saith that men witches usually have women spirits and women witches men spirits889 in 1649 at st albans a man witch had two familiars the one in the form of a dog which he called george and the other in the likeness of a woman called jezebell890 in 1662 at auldearne issobell gowdie confessed ther is threttein persones in ilk coeven and ilk on of vs has an sprit to wait wpon ws quhan ve pleas to call wpon him i

said looke who is yonder and then they ran away up the hill i stood still and ye black things came towards mee and then i turned to come away893 4 transformations into animals the belief that human beings can change themselves or be changed into animals carries with it the corollary that wounds received by a person when in the semblance of an animal will remain on the body after the return to human shape this belief seems to be connected with the worship of animalgods or sacred animals the worshipper being changed into an animal by being invested with the skin of the creature by the utterance of magical words by the making of magical gestures the wearing of a magical object or the performance of magical ceremonies the witches of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries appear to have carried on the tradition of the prechristian cults and the stories of their transformations when viewed in the light of the ancient examples are capable of the same explanation much confusion however has been caused by the religious and socalled scientific explanations of the contemporary commentators as well as by the unfortunate belief of modern writers in the capacity of women for hysteria at both periods pseudoscience has prevented the unbiassed examination of the material there are no records extant of the animals held sacred by the early inhabitants of great britain but it is remarkable that the range of the witches transformations was very limited cats and hares were the usual animals occasionally but rarely dogs mice crows rooks and bees in france where the solemn sacrifice of a goat at the sabbath points to that animal being sacred it is not surprising to find both men and women witches appearing as goats and sheep unless there were some definite meaning underlying the change of shape there would be no reason to prevent the witches from transforming themselves into animals of any species it would seem then that the witches like the adorers of animal gods in earlier times attempted to become one with their god or sacred animal by taking on his form the change being induced by the same means and being as real to the witch as to sigmund the volsung894 or the worshipper of lycaean zeus895 in the earlier cults the worshipper on becoming an animal changed his outward shape to the eye of faith alone though his actions and probably his voice proclaimed the transformation the nearest approach to an outward change was by covering the body with the skin of the animal or by wearing a part of the skin or a mask the witches themselves admitted that they were masked and veiled and the evidence of other witnesses goes to prove the same boguet suggests that the disguise was used to hide their identity which was possibly the case at times but it seems more probable judging by the evidence that the masking and veiling were for ritual purposes in lorraine in 1589 a male witness stated that indem wird er eine hle welche sie nennen die morelianische klippe gewahr darinnen sechs weiber mit larven umb ein tisch voll guldernen und silbernen geschieren herumb tanztenbernhardts nicolaea said that she had seen in an open field mitten am

witches whom boguet examined in 1598 confessed to using masks les sorciers dansent doz ctre doz pour ne pas estre recogneus pour la mesme raison ils se masquent encor auiourdhuy pour la plus partils

chacune avec son amoureux accoutr dun dguisement bleu jaune ou noir901 in 1652 a french witch dist quelles dansoient les dots lune lautre et quau milieux il y auoit vne feme masque tenant vne chandelle902 it will be seen from the above that the witches were often disguised at the dance a fact strongly suggesting that the masking was entirely ritual as the witch trials in great britain seldom mention much less describe the dance it follows that the greater number of the cases of masks are found in france though a few occur in scotland still fewer in england the transformation by means of an animals skin or head is mentioned in the liber poenitentialis of theodore in 668 see p 21 it continued among the witches and in 1598 in the lyons district il y a encor des demons qui assistent ces danses en forme de boucs ou de moutons antoine tornier dit que lors quelle dansoit vn mouton noir la tenoit par la main auec ses pieds bien haireux cest dire rudes reuesches903 in many cases it is very certain that the transformation was ritual and not actual that is to say the witches did not attempt to change their actual forms but called themselves cats hares or other animals in the aberdeen trials of 15967 the accused are stated to have come to the fish cross of this burgh under the conduct of sathan ye all danced about the fish cross and about the meal market a long space here there is no suggestion of any change of form yet in the accusation against bessie thom who was tried for the same offence the dittay states that there accompanied with thy devilish companions and faction transformed in other likeness some in hares some in cats and some in other similitudes ye all danced about the fish cross904 in 1617 in guernsey marie becquet said that every time that she went to the sabbath the devil came to her and it seemed as though he transformed her into a female dog905 again at alloa in 1658 margret duchall describing the murder of cowdans bairns said after they war turned all in the liknes of cattis they went in ouer jean lindsayis zaird dyk and went to coudans hous whair scho declared that the dewill being with tham went up the stair first with margret tailzeor besse paton and elspit blak on the other hand jonet blak and kathren renny who were also present and described the same scene said nothing about the catform though they particularize the clothes of the other witches jonet blak said the diwell margret tailzeor with ane long rok and kathren renny with the short rok and the bony las with the blak pok all went up the stair togidder while kathren renny said that ther was ane bony las with ane blak pok who went befor ower jean lindsayis zaird dyk and margret tailzeor with hir906 the evidence of marie lamont 1662 suggests the same idea of a ritual though not an actual change shee confessed that shee kettie scot and margrat holm cam to allan orrs house in the likenesse of kats and followed his wif into the chalmer and on another occasion the devil turned them in likeness of kats by shaking his hands above their heads907 in northumberland 1673 the same fact appears to underlie the evidence ann armstrong declared that at a witch meeting ann baites hath been severall times in the shape of a catt and a hare and in the shape of a greyhound and a bee letting the divell see how many shapes she could turn herself intothey the witches stood all upon a bare spott of ground and bid this informer sing whilst they danced in severall shapes first of a haire then in their owne and then in a catt sometimes in a mouse and in severall other shapesshe see all the said persons beforemencioned danceing some in the likenesse of haires some in the likenesse of catts others in the likenesse of bees and some in their owne likenesse908 the method of making the ritual change by means of magical words is recorded in the auldearne trials where isobel gowdie whose evidence was purely voluntary gives the actual words both for the change into an animal and for the reversion into human form to become a hare i sall goe intill ane haire with sorrow and sych and meikle caire and i sall goe in the divellis nam ay whill i com hom againe to become a cat or a crow the same verse was used with an alteration of the second line so as to force a rhyme instead of meikle caire the words were a blak shot for a cat and a blak thraw for a crow or craw to revert again to the human form the words were hare hare god send thee care i am in an hares likeness just now but i shall be in a womans likeness even now with the same variation of a black shot or a black thraw for a cat or a crow the auldearne witches were also able to turn one another into animals if we in the shape of an cat an crow an hare or any other likeness c go to any of our neighbours houses being witches we will say i or we conjure thee go with us or me and presently they become as we are either cats hares crows c and go with us whither we would when one of us or more are in the shape of cats and meet with any others our neighbours we will say devil speed thee go thou with me and immediately they will turn in the shape of a cat and go with us909 the very simplicity of the method shows that the transformation was ritual the witch announced to her fellow that she herself was an animal a fact which the second witch would not have known otherwise the second witch at once became a similar animal and went with the first to perform the ritual acts which were to follow the witches were in their own estimation and in the belief of all their comrades to whom they communicated the fact actually animals though to the uninitiated eye their natural forms remained unchanged this is probably the explanation of marie daspilcouettes evidence which de lancre records in 1609 elle a veu aussi les sorcieres insignes se changer en plusieurs sortes de bestes pour faire peur ceux quelles rencontroient mais celles qui se transformoyent ainsi disoyent quelles nestoyent veritablement transformees mais seulement quelles sembloyent lestre neantmoins pendant quelles sont ainsi en apparences bestes elles ne parlent du tout point910 the best example of transformation by means of a magical object placed on the person is from northumberland 1673 where ann armstrong stated that anne forster come with a bridle and bridled her and ridd upon her crosseleggd till they come to the rest of her companions and when she light of her back pulld the bridle of this informers head now in the likenesse of a horse but when the bridle was taken of she stood up in her owne shape this informant was ridden upon by an inchanted bridle by michael aynsly and margaret his wife which inchanted bridle when they tooke it of from her head she stood upp in her owne proper person jane baites of corbridge come in the forme of a gray catt with a bridle hanging on her foote and bridled her and rid upon her in the name of the devill911 this is again a clear account of the witch herself and her companions believing in the change of form caused by the magical object in exactly the same way that the shamans believe in their own transformation by similar means the devil had naturally the same power as the witches but in a greater degree the evidence of marie lamont quoted above shows that he transformed them into animals by a gesture only it seems possible that this was also the case with isobel shyrie at forfar 1661 who was called horse and the devils horse the name seems to have given rise to the idea that she was shod like a mare or a horse she was in fact the officer or messenger who brought her companions to the meetings she was never seen in the form of a horse her transformation being probably effected by the devil in order that she might carry the witches to and from the meetings agnes spark said that isobel carried her away to littlemiln and carried her back again to her own house912 there is also another method of transformation which is the simplest the witches themselves like their contemporaries often believed that the actual animals which they saw were human beings in animal form jeannette de belloc aged twentyfour in the bassespyrnes 1609 described the sabbath as vne foire celebre de toutes sortes de choses en laquelle aucuns se promenet en leur propre forme dautres sont transformez ne scayt pourquoy en animaux elle na iamais veu aucune delles se trsformer en beste en sa presence mais seulement certaines bestes courir par le sabbat913 helen guthrie of forfar 1661 states the case with even greater simplicity the last summer except one shee did sie john tailzeour somtymes in the shape of a todde and somtymes in the shape of a swyn and that the said johne tailzeour in these shapes went wp and doune among william millne miller at hetherstakes his cornes for the destructioune of the same because the said william hade taken the mylne ouer his head and that the diuell cam to her and pointed out johne tailzeour in the forsaid shapes unto her and told her that that wes johne tailzeour914 footnotes footnote 831 forbes ii p 33 footnote 832 examination of john walsh footnote 833 pitcairn i pt

p 123 appendix i fairies and witches the dwarf race which at one time inhabited europe has left few concrete remains but it has survived in innumerable stories of fairies and elves nothing however is known of the religious beliefs and cults of these early peoples except the fact that every seven years they made a human sacrifice to their godand aye at every seven years they pay the teind to helland that like the khonds they stole children from the neighbouring races and brought them up to be the victims that there was a strong connexion between witches and fairies has been known to all students of fairy lore i suggest that the cult of the fairy or primitive race survived until less than three hundred years ago and that the people who practised it were known as witches i have already pointed out that many of the witchbeliefs and practices coincide with those of an existing dwarf race viz the lapps the devil and the witches entered freely into the fairy mounds the devil is often spoken of as a fairy man and he consorts with the queen of elfhame fairy gold which turns to rubbish is commonly given by the devil to the witches and the name robin is almost a generic name for the devil either as a man or as his substitute the familiar the other name for the fairy robin goodfellow is puck which derives through the gaelic bouca from the slavic bog which means god the evidence given below shows the close connexion between the fairies and the witches and shows also the witches belief in the superiority of the fairies to themselves in the matter of magic and healing powers 1431 joan of arc not far from domremy there is a certain tree that is called the ladies tree arbor dominarum others call it the fairies tree arbor fatalium gallice des faes beside which is a spring which cured fevers it is a great tree a beech fagus from which comes the may unde venit mayum gallice le beau may it belongs to seigneur pierre de bourlemont old people not of her lineage said that

garlands at the tree with other girls for the image of the blessed mary of domremy sometimes with the other children she hung garlands on the tree sometimes they left them sometimes they took them away she had danced there with the other children but not since she was grown up she had sung there more than she had danced she had heard that it was said jeanne received her mission at the tree of the fairyladies915 the saints katharine and margaret came and spoke to her at the spring beside the fairies tree but she would not say if they came to the tree itself916 denied having a mandrake but knew there was one near the fairies tree917 my godmother who saw the fairyladies was held as a good woman not a diviner or a witch918 refused to say if she believed fairies to be evil spirits919 she did not put chaplets on the fairies tree in honour of ss katharine and margaret920 had never done anything with or knew anything of those who came in the air with the fairies gallice en lerre avec les faes had heard they came on thursdays but considered it witchcraft921 4th article of accusation jeanne was not instructed in her youth in the belief and primitive faith but was imbued by certain old women in the use of witchcraft divination and other superstitious works or magic arts many inhabitants of those villages have been noted from antiquity for the aforesaid misdeeds jeanne herself has said that she had heard from her godmother and from many people of visions and apparitions of fairies or fairy spirits gallice faes by others also she has been taught and imbued with wicked and pernicious errors of such spirits insomuch that in the trial before you she confessed that up to this time she did not know that fairies were evil spirits answer as to the fairyladies she did not know what it was as to instruction she learnt to believe and was well and duly taught to do what a good child should as to her godmother she referred to what she had said before922 5th article near the village of domremy is a certain great big and ancient tree called vulgarly the charmed fairytree of bourlemont923 larbre charmine fae de bourlemont beside the tree is a spring round these gather it is said evil spirits called fairies with whom those who use witchcraft are accustomed to dance at night going round the tree and spring answer as to the tree and spring referred to her previous answers denied the rest924 6th article jeanne frequented the said tree and spring alone chiefly at night sometimes in the day most often at the hour that divine service was celebrated in church in order to be alone and dancing went round the spring and tree afterwards hung many garlands of various herbs and flowers on the branches of the tree made with her own hands saying and singing before and after certain incantations and songs with certain invocations witchcrafts and other misdeeds which garlands the following morning were not found answer referred for part to previous answers denied the rest925 23rd article her letters showed that she had consulted evil spirits denied ever having done anything by inspiration of evil spirits926 1566 john walsh of netherberry dorset he being demaunded

hee would blow into her a fairy which should doe her good and that shee opened her mouth and he did blow into her mouth and that presently after his blowing there came out of her mouth a spirit which

shoe hath bein controlled with the phairie942 1653 yorkshire there was he saith as i have heard the story credibly reported in this country a man apprehended for suspicion of witchcraft he was of that sort we call white witches which are such as do cures beyond the ordinary reasons and deductions of our usual practitioners and are supposed and most part of them truly to do the same by ministration of spirits from whence under their noble favours most sciences at first grow and therefore are by good reason provided against by our civil laws as being ways full of danger and deceit and scarce ever otherwise obtained than by a devillish compact of the exchange of ones soul to that assistant spirit for the honour of its mountebankery what this man did was with a white powder which he said he received from the fairies and that going to a hill he knocked three times and the hill opened and he had access to and conversed with a visible people and offered that if any gentleman present would either go himself in person or send his servant he would conduct them thither or shew them the place and persons from whom he had his skill hothams account ends here webster continues first in his own words and then in inverted commas as if quoting but gives no authority to this i shall only add thus much that the man was accused for invoking and calling upon evil spirits and was a very simple and illiterate person to any mans judgment and had been formerly very poor but had gotten some pretty little meanes to maintain himself his wife and diverse small children by his cures done with this white powder of which there were sufficient proofs and the judge asking him how he came by the powder he told a story to this effect that one night before day was gone as he was going home from his labour being very sad and full of heavy thoughts not knowing how to get meat and drink for his wife and children he met a fair woman in fine cloaths who asked him why he was so sad and he told her it was by reason of his poverty to which she said that if he would follow her counsel she would help him to that which would serve to get him a good living to which he said he would consent with all his heart so it were not by unlawful ways she told him it should not be by any such ways but by doing of good and curing of sick people and so warning him strictly to meet her there the next night at the same time she departed from him and he went home and the next night at the time appointed he duly waited and she according to promise came and told him that it was well he came so duly otherwise he had missed of that benefit that she intended to do unto him and so bade him follow her and not be afraid thereupon she led him to a little hill and she knocked three times and the hill opened and they went in and came to a fair hall wherein was a queen sitting in great state and many people about her and the gentlewoman that brought him presented him to the queen and she said he was welcom and bid the gentlewoman give him some of the white powder and teach him how to use it which she did and gave him a little wood box full of the white powder and bad him give 2 or 3 grains of it to any that were sick and it would heal them and so she brought him forth of the hill and so they parted and being asked by the judge whether the place within the hill which he called a hall were light or dark he said indifferent as it is with us in the twilight and being asked how he got more powder he said when he wanted he went to that hill and knocked three times and said every time i am coming i am coming whereupon it opened and he going in was conducted by the aforesaid woman to the queen and so had more powder given him this was the plain and simple story however it may be judged of that he told before the judge the whole court and the jury and there being no proof but what cures he had done to very many the jury did acquit him943 1655 it might be here very seasonable to enquire into the nature of those large dark rings in the grass which they call fairy circles whether they be the rendezvouz of witches or the dancing place of those little puppet spirits which they call elves or fairies944 1661 jonet watson of dalkeith she confessed that three months before the devill apeired vnto her in the liknes of ane prettie boy in grein clothes as also about the tyme of the last

itself in the matter of names the following remarks refer only to england and scotland the lists of witchnames bring to light several facts as regards the women one of these is the entire absence of saxon names such as gertrude edith hilda old testament names are so few in number as to be negligible scandinavian names are not found the essentially puritan names such as temperance hardly occur but the great mass of the names fall under eight heads with their dialectical differences 1 ann annis agnes annabel 2 alice alison 3 christian christen cirstine 4 elizabeth elspet isobel bessie 5 ellen elinor helen 6 joan jane janet jonet 7 margaret marget meg marjorie 8 marion mary at first sight the list suggests new testament and greek influence and though i am not prepared to dispute this i would point out 1 that there was a british goddess called anna which may account not only for all the forms of ann but also for the terminations in alison and marion 2 that the name christian clearly indicates the presence of another religion 3 that there is at present nothing to prove that isobel is a variant of elizabethit is quite possible that isobel was the original name and that the missionaries christianized it as elizabeth 4 that helen was a prechristian name in great britain 5 that margaret may have been originally marget the spelling and pronunciation being influenced by the greek form and as g and y are dialectically interchangeable marget would be the same as or closely allied to the finnish marjatta if christianity had obtained the hold on the people which the ecclesiastical writers would have us believe the name mary should surely have been the most common but it hardly occurs in great britain before 1645 while marion is hardly used after that date this looks as though marion were the earlier form and mary may therefore be merely the contraction of the longer name as regards the name joan i can offer no explanations or suggestions i can only call attention to its overwhelming preponderance in comparison with the others in the lists the names are arranged without regard to local differences of spelling the surnames are in alphabetical order

arc and gilles de rais these two personagesso closely connected in life and dying similar deaths yet as the poles asunder in characterhave been minutely studied from the historical and medical points of view and in the case of joan from the religious standpoint also but hitherto the anthropological aspect has been disregarded this is largely due to the fact that these intensive studies have been made of each person separately whereas to obtain the true perspective the two should be taken together this individual treatment is probably owing to the wide divergence of the two characters the simplicity and purity of the one is in marked contrast with the repulsive attributes of the other yet anthropologically speaking the tie between the two is as strongly marked as the contrast of character the case of joan is easily studied as the documents are accessible956 anatole france has realized that behind joan there lay some unseen power which charles vii feared and from which he unwillingly accepted help m france sees in this power a party in the church and in his eyes the church was a house divided against itself though agreeing with the view that joan was the rallyingpoint of a great and powerful organization i see in that organization the underlying religion which permeated the lower orders of the people in france as in england that religion which i have set forth in the foregoing chapters the menatarms drawn from the lower orders followed without hesitation one whom they believed to have been sent by their god while the whole army was commanded by marshal gilles de rais who apparently tried to belong to both religions at once 1 joan of arc the questions asked by the judges at joans trial show that they were well aware of an underlying organization of which they stood in some dread the judges were ecclesiastics and the accusation against the prisoner was on points of christian faith and doctrine and ecclesiastical observance it was the first great trial of strength between the old and the new religions and the political conditions gave the victory to the new which was triumphant accordingly we have caught her now said the bishop of beauvais and she was burned without even the formality of handing her over to the secular authorities after the execution the judges and counsellors who had sat in judgement on joan received letters of indemnity from the great council the chancellor of england sent letters to the emperor to the kings and princes of christendom to all the nobles and towns of france explaining that king henry and his counsellors had put joan to death through zeal for the christian faith and the university of paris sent similar letters to the pope the emperor and the college of cardinals such action can hardly be explained had joan been an ordinary heretic or an ordinary political prisoner but if she were in the eyes of the great mass of the population not merely a religious leader but actually the incarnate god then it was only natural for the authorities who had compassed her death to shelter themselves behind the bulwark of their zeal for the christian religion and to explain to the heads of that religion their reasons for the execution on the other hand the belief that joan was god incarnate will account as nothing else can for the extraordinary supineness of the french who never lifted a finger to ransom or rescue joan from the hands of either the burgundians or the english as god himself or his voluntary substitute she was doomed to suffer as the sacrifice for the people and no one of those people could attempt to save her in comparing the facts elicited at the trial with the dianic cult as set out in the previous chapters the coincidences are too numerous to be merely accidental i do not propose to enter into a detailed discussion of the trial i only wish to draw attention to a few points in this connexion the questions put to joan on the subject of fairies appear to the modern reader to be entirely irrelevant though much importance was evidently attached to her answers by the court she could not disprove though she denied the popular rumour that joan received her mission at the tree of the fairyladies iohanna ceperat factum suum apud arborem dominarum fatalium and she was finally forced to admit that she had first met the voices near that spot connexion with the fairies was as damning in the eyes of the bishop of beauvais and his colleagues as it was later in the eyes of the judges who tried john walsh and aleson peirson the names of christian saints given to the persons whom joan called her voices have misled modern writers but the questions showered upon her show that the judges had shrewd suspicions as to the identity of these persons that the voices were human beings is very clear from joans own testimony those of my party know well that the voice had been sent to me from god they have seen and known this voice my king and many others have also heard and seen the voices which came to me i saw him st michael with my bodily eyes as well as i see you she refused to describe st michael and bearing in mind some of the descriptions of the devil in later trials it is interesting to find that when the judges put the direct question to her as to whether st michael came to her naked she did not give a direct answer later the following dialogue took place if the devil were to put himself in the form or likeness of an angel how would you know if it were a good or an evil angel asked the judges again joans reply was not direct i should know quite well if it were st michael or a counterfeit she then stated that she had seen him many times before she knew him to be st michael when a child she had seen him and had been afraid at first pressed for a description she said he came in the form of a true honest man tres vray preudomme forma unius verissimi probi hominis957 the accounts of the trial prove that joan continually received advice from the saints the person whom she called st katherine was obviously in the castle and able to communicate with the prisoner this was not difficult for the evidence shows that there was a concealed opening between joans room and the next it was in the adjoining room close to the opening that the notaries sat to take down joans words when the spy loyseleur engaged her in conversation and it was evidently through this opening that st katherine spoke when she awoke joan without touching her and again when joan could not hear distinctly what she said on account of the noise in the castle a remark of joans that she often saw them the voices among the christians they themselves unseen is noteworthy for the use of the word christian suggesting that the voices were of a different religion the remark should also be compared with the account given by bessie dunlop as to her recognizing thom reid when those about him did not know him and with the statement by danaeus that among a great company of men the sorcerer only knoweth satan that is present when other doo not know him although they see another man but who or what he is they know not the points of mortal sin of which joan finally stood accused were the following 1 the attack on paris on a feast day 2 taking the horse of the bishop of senlis 3 leaping from the tower of beaurevoir 4 wearing male costume 5 consenting to the death of franquet darras at lagny of these the most surprising to modern ideas is the one referring to costume yet it was on this that the judges laid most stress even the severest of sumptuary laws has never made the wearing of male dress by a woman a capital crime yet though joan had recanted and been received into the church the moment that she put on male attire she was doomed on that account only whether she donned it by accident by treachery by force or out of bravado the extraordinary fact remains that the mere resuming of male garments was the signal for her death without further trial on the sunday she wore the dress on the monday she was condemned on the tuesday the sentence was communicated to her on the wednesday she was burned as an idolator apostate heretic relapsed if as i suppose she were a member of the dianic cult the wearing of male attire must have been for her an outward sign of that faith and the resuming of it indicated the relapse the inscription on the high cap which she wore at her execution shows that the judges at least held this opinion throughout the trial questions were poured upon her as to her reasons for wearing the dress and she acknowledged that she wore it not by the advice of a human man per consilium hominis mundi totum quod feci est per praeceptum domini et si aliam praeciperet assumere ego assumerem postquam hoc esset per praeceptum dei asked if she thought she would have been committing mortal sin by wearing womens clothes she answered that she did better in obeying and serving her supreme lord who is god she refused to wear womens dress except by command of god i would rather die than revoke what god has made me do on her letters were placed sometimes the words jhesus maria or a cross sometimes i put a cross as a sign for those of my party to whom i wrote so that they should not do as the letters said though the mark was merely a codesignal to the recipient of the letter it seems hardly probable that a christian of that date would have used the symbol of the faith for such a purpose she also consistently refused to take an oath on the gospels and was with difficulty persuaded to do so on the missal when she was asked whether she had ever blasphemed blasphemaverit god she replied that she had never cursed the saints maledixit sanctum vel sanctam when pressed whether she had not denied denegaverit god she again refused a direct answer saying that she had not denied the saints denegaverit sanctum nec sanctam the general feeling towards her among the christian priesthood is shown by the action of brother richard when he first entered her presence he made the sign of the cross and sprinkled holy water and i said to him approach boldly i shall not fly away another point to be noted is her answer that she learned the paternoster ave maria and credo from her mother thus proving that she was not of a witchfamily according to reginald scot it was sufficient evidence to condemn a woman to death as a witch if her mother had been a witch before her at the same time however joan refused to say the paternoster except in confession when the priests lips would have been sealed if she had proved herself not to be a christian she was very urgent to confess to the bishop of beauvais but he was too wary to be caught she first heard the voices at the age of thirteen the usual time for the devil and the witch to make paction one of her followers pierronne was burnt as a witch avowing to the last that she had spoken with god as friend with friend and describing the costume of her deity with a detail which shows the reality of the occurrence if also there is any weight to be attached to certain namesas seems likely after studying the lists given abovethen we have in this history four of the chief witchnames joan the daughter of isabel and the two saints katherine and margaret these coincidences may be small but there are too many of them to be ignored there is evidence from joans own words that she felt herself divine and also that she knew her time was limited but she never realized till the last that the end meant death this however the voices knew and it was for this that they were preparing her at the beginning of the trial she said she had come from god and had nothing to do here asking to be sent back to god from whom she came dixit quod venit ex parte dei et non habet quid negotiari quidquam petens ut remitteretur ad deum a quo venerat many times she said to him the king i shall live a year barely longer during that year let as much as possible be done the voices told her she would be taken before the feast of st john and that thus it must be and that she must not be troubled but accept willingly and god would help her they also said it was necessary for her to be captured receive all willingly care not for thy martyrdom thou shalt come at last to the kingdom of paradise on the fatal tuesday when she learned her doom flesh and spirit quailed at the prospect of the agony to come and she cried out that her voices had deceived her for she had thought that in her imprisonment she had already suffered the promised martyrdom yet within twentyfour hours she went to the stake with courage unquenched acknowledging that her voices were from god like john fian nearly two centuries later her spirit had sunk at first and again like fian she endured to the end dying a martyr to the god who had exploited her confidence and simplicity and whom she had served so well to her de lancres words might well apply the witches are so devoted to his service that neither torture nor death can affright them and they go to martyrdom and to death for love of him as gaily as to a festival of pleasure and public rejoicing the ashes were collected and thrown into running water a common rite in religions of the lower culture after the sacrifice of the incarnate god it is also worth noting that rouen was one of the french cities in which there was still a living tradition of human sacrifice 2 gilles de rais like joan of arc gilles de rais was tried and executed as a witch and in the same way much that is mysterious in this trial can also be explained by the dianic cult on the mothers side he descended from tiphaine de champtoc and on the fathers from tiphaine de husson this latter was the niece of bertrand du guesclin and called after du guesclins wife who was a fairy woman958 the name tiphaine appears to come from the same root as fein finn and fian all of which meant fairy in great britain and probably in brittany as well there is therefore a strong suggestion of a strain of fairy blood and with that blood there may also have descended to gilles many of the beliefs and customs of the dwarf race the bond between gilles and joan was a very close one she obtained permission from the king to choose whom she would for her escort her choice at once fell on gilles for she would naturally prefer those of her own faith he held already a high command in the relieving force and added the protection of joan as a special part of his duties later on even after he had reached the high position of marshal of france he still continued those duties remaining with her all day when she was wounded at the assault on paris it is an interesting point also that charles vii granted permission to both these great leaders to bear the royal arms on their escutcheons it seems incredible that a soldier of gilless character and standing should have made no move to rescue joan by ransom or by force when she was captured she was not only a comrade she was especially under his protection and it is natural for us to think that his honour was involved but if he regarded her as the destined victim chosen and set apart for death as required by the religion to which both he and she belonged he could do nothing but remain inactive and let her fate be consummated if this is so then the mystery of orleans of which he was the author would be a religious play of the same class as the mysteryplays of the christians the extraordinary prodigality and extravagance of gilles may have been due as is usually suggested to profligacy or to madness but it may equally well have been that he took seriously the belief that as the incarnate godor at any rate as a candidate for that honourhe must give to all who asked he rode a black horse as also did joan and the devils of later centuries and on two separate occasions he attempted to enter into a compact with the devil he could not decide to which religion he would belong the old or the new and his life was one long struggle the old religion demanded human sacrifices and he gave them the new religion regarded murder as mortal sin and he tried to offer expiation openly he had christian masses and prayers celebrated with the utmost pomp secretly he followed the ancient cult when he was about to remove the bodies of the human victims from the castle of champtoc he swore his accomplices to secrecy by the binding oaths of both religions on the other hand members of the old faith whom he consulted when in trouble warned him that as long as he professed christianity and practised its rites they could do nothing for him an infringement of the rights of the church brought him under the ecclesiastical law and the church was not slow to take advantage of the position had he chosen to resist his exalted position would have protected him but he preferred to yield and like joan he stood his trial on the charge of heresy the trial did not take long he was arrested on september 14 and executed on october 26 with him were arrested eight others of whom two were executed with him seeing that thirteen was always the number of witches in a coven it is surely more than an accidental coincidence that nine men and women including gilles were arrested two saved themselves by flight and two more who had played a large part in the celebration of the rites of the old religion were already dead thus even as early as the middle of the fifteenth century the coven of thirteen was in existence gilles was charged with heresy before a court composed of ecclesiastics only and like joan he was willing to be tried for his faith he announced that he had always been a christian which may be taken to mean that there was some doubt as to whether he was not a heathen he suddenly gave way to a curious outburst against the authority of the court saying that he would rather be hanged by the neck with a lace than submit to them as judges this can only be understood by comparing his reference to hanging with a lace with the method by which playfair in 1597 p 204 john stewart in 1618 p 202 and john reid in 1697 p 203 met their deaths the sudden change of front in this haughty noble may be accounted for by the excommunication which was decreed against him but this explains neither his passionate haste to confess all and more than all of which he was accused nor his earnest and eager desire to die how much of his confession was true cannot be determined now but it is very evident that he was resolved to make his own death certain his action in this may be compared with that of major weir in 1670 who also was executed on his own voluntary confession of witchcraft and crime gilless last words though couched in christian phraseology show that he had not realized the enormity of the crimes which he confessed we have sinned all three of us he said to his two companions but as soon as our souls have left our bodies we shall all see god in his glory in paradise he was hanged on a gibbet above a pyre but when the fire burned through the rope the body was snatched from the flames by several ladies of his family who prepared it for burial with their own hands and it was then interred in the carmelite church close by his two associates were also hanged their bodies being burned and the ashes scattered on the spot where gilles was executed his daughter erected a monument to which came all nursing mothers to pray for an abundance of milk here again is a strong suggestion that he was regarded as the incarnate god of fertility another suggestive fact is the length of timenine yearswhich elapsed between the death of joan and the death of gilles this is a usual interval when the incarnate god is given a timelimit it required twentyfive years before an action of rehabilitation could be taken for joan in the case of gilles two years after the execution the king granted letters of rehabilitation for that the said gilles unduly and without cause was condemned and put to death an intensive study of this period might reveal the witch organization at the royal court and possibly even the grandmaster to whom joan owed allegiance the god who sent her giac the kings favourite was executed as a witch and joans beau duc the duke dalenon was also of the fraternity footnotes footnote 956 it is advisable to read the trial in the original latin and french as the translations have often a christian bias eg the king of heaven being rendered as our lord and my lord as our saviour this is not merely inaccurate but actually misleading footnote 957 compare bessie dunlops more homely description of thom reid an honest wele elderlie man footnote 958 tiphaine de maurice chevalier clmence bertrand tiphaine champtoc de craon de husson du guesclin the fairy guy de tiphaine laval i marie de craon guy de laval ii gilles de rais appendix v flying ointments the three formulae for the flying ointment used by witches are as follows 1 du persil de leau de laconite des feuilles de peuple et de la suye 2 de la berle de lacorum vulgaire de la quintefeuille du sang de chauuesouris de la morelle endormante et de lhuyle 3 de graisse denfant de suc dache daconite de quintefeuille de morelle et de suye these formulae may be translated as follows 1 parsley water of aconite poplar leaves and soot 2 water parsnip sweet flag cinquefoil bats blood deadly nightshade and oil 3 babys fat juice of water parsnip aconite cinquefoil deadly nightshade and soot these prescriptions show that the society of witches had a very creditable knowledge of the art of poisoning aconite and deadly nightshade or belladonna are two of the three most poisonous plants growing freely in europe the third is hemlock and in all probability persil refers to hemlock and not to the harmless parsley which it resembles closely the other ingredients have no marked toxic action unless berle and ache refer not to the harmless water parsnip but to the poisonous water hemlock or cowbane the babys fat and bats blood would of course have no action aconite was one of the bestknown poisons in ancient times indeed it was so extensively used by professional poisoners in rome during the empire that a law was passed making its cultivation a capital offence aconite root contains about 04 per cent of alkaloid and onefifteenth of a grain of the alkaloid is a lethal dose the drug has little effect upon the consciousness but produces slowing irregularity and finally arrest of the heart the use of belladonna as a poison was also known in classical times fourteen of the berries have been known to produce death a moderate dose will produce wild excitement and delirium hemlock is also a wellknown and ancient poison the fruit may contain as much as 09 per cent of alkaloid and 14 grain of the alkaloid may produce death the action of hemlock usually is to produce a gradual motor paralysis consciousness being unimpaired and death being caused by paralysis of respiration but sometimes hemlock may produce delirium and excitement there is no doubt therefore about the efficacy of these prescriptions and their ability to produce physiological effects they were administered by being rubbed into the skin which is not an efficient way of introducing most drugs into the body indeed some have denied that alkaloids can be absorbed from the unbroken skin but there is no doubt that alkaloids can be absorbed when rubbed into scratches or into the quick of the nails and it must be remembered that an unbroken skin is only possessed by those who are free from vermin and who wash regularly and neither of these conditions would be likely to apply to a mediaeval witch cases of poisoning associated with delirium have actually been recorded following the application of belladonna plasters to the skin of the three prescriptions the first is a watery solution and would not be very efficacious when rubbed into the skin but the second and third are ointments and if they were rubbed into the skin in sufficient quantities definite physiological results would be produced the first preparation which contains hemlock and aconite would produce mental confusion impaired movement irregular action of the heart dizziness and shortness of breath the belladonna in the second ointment would produce excitement which might pass into delirium the third ointment containing both aconite and belladonna would produce excitement and irregular action of the heart i cannot say whether any of these drugs would produce the impression of flying but i consider the use of aconite interesting in this respect irregular action of the heart in a person falling asleep produces the wellknown sensation of suddenly falling through space and it seems quite possible that the combination of a delirifacient like belladonna with a drug producing irregular action of the heart like aconite might produce the sensation of flying a j clark
