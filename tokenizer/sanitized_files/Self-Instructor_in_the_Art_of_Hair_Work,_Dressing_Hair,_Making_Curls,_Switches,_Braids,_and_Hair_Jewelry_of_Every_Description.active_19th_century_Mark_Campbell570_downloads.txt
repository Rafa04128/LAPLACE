beads to suit the occasion synoptic of human hair in placing before the public the only book ever published in the art of hair work it is but due to the purchasers of it to say something in relation to the trade in human hair it is not my intention however to enter into an extended detail and complete history but simply give a few items that will serve to show what enormous strides have been taken within the last few years in this branch of business it is a business that but few know anything aboutat least in this country for it is comparatively new herebut it is one that is very rapidly increasing and is now almost doubling itself each year the larger quantity in fact nearly the whole amount of hair retailed in this country is imported from europe where the dealing in human hair has been made an established and legitimate business for years and a great deal of attention is paid in purchasing and preparing it for the market paris is the greatest market for the sale of human hair in the world but the amount of superfluous hair used and worn throughout all europe could we give the figures would seem incredible the amount imported to the united states in the years of 1859 and 1860 was not far from 150000 and 200000 pounds which was valued at that time at from 800000 to 1000000 since that time it has been steadily increasing and the amount imported last year may be set down at three times as much as during the years above mentioned paris also finds as great a sale for the article in russia as in americathe shipments to each being about equal thus it will be seen that if all the hair reserved in europe for the home demand were added to that which is imported the amount would be almost beyond conception and yet but about onetenth part of the whole production ever leaves its native country it is mostly procured from the markets of france italy russia and germany and large quantities are obtained from norway and sweden the norwegians were among the first to make ornaments of hair to be worn as jewelry but in a great measure we are indebted to the french for the perfection to which the art has attained of the different varieties of hair that which is obtained in france and italy is by far the best being of a much finer texture even color and of a more glossy appearance than that from other countries the principal requirement in hair to make it valuable is length and after it is thrown upon the market it is all assortedthe long from the shortwhich is a task of extreme difficulty the prices of hair range all the way from 15 to 200 per pound a wide range but certainly not too large and is rated according to hue length and texture the smallest price paid is for the short coarse hair of the poorest quality and which can be used only for certain purposes hair of the ordinary colors range in price from 15 to 100 per pound but that of gray and white from 100 to 200 per pound and even then is not considered exorbitant in fact hair is worth any and all prices we know of one dealer who had in his possession a very small quantity weighing but a half pound and measuring seventy inches for which he was offered four hundred dollars and strange as it may appear he refused to accept it white hair is mostly obtained by being picked from the gray and it not unfrequently happens that many hundred pounds have to be assorted before being able to secure one single pound of pure white it is mainly used in the manufacture of wigs and it frequently puzzles the dealer to prepare one for a customer that will exactly match and this with the scarcity of the article cause the extraordinary price hair is shipped in both a prepared and unprepared state that which is prepared undergoes a process of washing scouring and cleansing which leaves it in the nicest possible state all the oil dirt and other unhealthy substances are completely separated from it leaving it perfectly free from all unhealthy influences that which is shipped in an unprepared or raw state is subjected to the same process of cleansing after its arrival and it is so thorough that it is altogether impossible for anything except the hair to remain it has frequently been examined with a microscope which has proved in every case how successful the cleansing process had been for it revealed nothing whatever of a foreign nature and in fact after its extraordinary cleaning it would be simply impossible after being fully prepared it is then made into switches curls plaits fronts wigs chignons and not a small amount is used in the manufacture of hair jewelry and such other articles as are worn for ornaments the jewelry manufactured at this time is as durable as the all gold jewelry and is done in a style of surpassing neatness thus rendering it beautiful either as an ornament or memento there are but very few places in the united states where hair jewelry is made and as it is comparatively a new business but few have learned it it is surprising however to notice the many beautiful patterns and elegant designs into which it is transformed there is nothing in the way of jewelry or ornament of any description but what is or may be made from human hair and after being goldmounted the contrast between them makes the hair jewelry preferable to the all gold there are many strange incidents related of the human hair suddenly changing its colormany of which it is hard to believeand the causes assigned are various we are told of persons who from excessive grief found their hair had gradually changed from a dark brown to an almost perfect white others from the same cause in the short space of one week discovered their hair plentifully streaked with grey giving them the appearance although young of being quite old many have had their hair change on account of extreme fright but we have now to give the first instance we have ever heard of its turning from white to that of any other color except by the aid of dyes a parisian m stanislaus martin has published in the bulletin de therapeutique the curious case of a worker in metals who had wrought in copper only five months and whose hair which was lately white is now of so decided a green that the man cannot appear in the street without immediately becoming the object of general curiosity he is perfectly well his hair alone being affected by the copper notwithstanding the precautions taken by him to protect it from the action of the metal chemical analysis shows that his hair contains a notable quantity of acetate of copper and that it is to this circumstance that it owes its beautiful green color which is most singular and remarkable the practice of wearing false hair although it was not generally dealt in as traffic has been in vogue many hundred years the greek and roman ladies were in olden times as active in their toilet for the head as the fashionable ladies of the present day and false hair was always brought into requisition which was then obtained from the germans and they in turn from their slaves powdering the hair which is now the rage in all fashionable circles is also an ancient practice and was as much indulged in by the men as the women history tells us that the consumption of hair powder by the soldiers of george ii was enormous it was calculated that inasmuch as the military force of england and the colonies was including cavalry infantry militia and fensibles 250000 each man used a pound of flour a week simply for powdering their hair the quantity consumed in this way was 6500 tons per annum an amount sufficient to sustain 30000 persons on bread gold and silver hair powder was also plentifully used and at a time much earlier in the worlds history than is generally supposed josephus relates that solomons horseguards daily strewed their heads with golddust which glittered in the sun and there are similar instances of different personages recorded in the bible the human hair seems to have been given us both for an ornament and coveringbeing susceptible of transformation in almost any desired shape and apparently indispensable for covering and protecting the head the ancient greeks were very partial to long hair considering it by far the more becoming but the egyptians regarded it as an incumbrance shaved their heads and substituted wigs the ancients generally speaking strangely considered a fine head of hair so desirable that it became sacred they frequently dedicated it to the gods on important occasions of marriage victory escape from death and danger and the burial of friends different styles of wearing the hair was resorted to for denoting the various grades or positions in life of the people some wearing it quite long others short and some dressing it in a peculiar mannereach style or length being according to the condition wealth or social standing of the wearer plucking it out or neglecting it was a token of affliction hair contains a very small quantity of water manganese iron and various salts of lime which have been found by the various methods of analyzation and it is owing to these properties that it is peculiarly indestructible it has been found on mummies more than twenty centuries old in a perfect and unaltered state and many instances are related which are now admitted to be facts of the hair continuing to grow for a time after death there has never before been a book written and published that was particularly dedicated to the subject of hair and as the field is a vast one both as regards the importance of the subject and the information to be gained thereby it is simply strange that no one has ever entered it it has been too long neglected and the increasing necessity for a treatise of this kind has been pressed upon the attention of the author and induced the publication of this work which will certainly meet the necessities of the age there is much else that might be said on this subject that would prove both interesting and instructive but we prefer for the present to let it rest we have endeavored in preparing this book both to instruct and amuse for by following its instructions it may be made to be profitable and highly remunerative and in making articles either for gifts mementoes or otherwise it will certainly be amusing and entertaining we have given the instructions in a way that all may readily understand and as the patterns are numerous and the designs elegant we think there can be nothing lacking to make the book all it claims to be the principal offices for the sale of these books will be at my establishments no 737 broadway new
