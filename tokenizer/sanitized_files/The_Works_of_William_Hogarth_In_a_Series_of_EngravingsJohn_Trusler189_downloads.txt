author and his works by j hogarth and j nichols london published by jones and co temple of the muses late lackingtons finsbury square 1833 c baynes printer 13 duke street lincolns inn fields the life of hogarth william hogarth is said to have been the descendant of a family originally from kirby thore in westmorland his grandfather was a plain yeoman who possessed a small tenement in the vale of bampton a village about fifteen miles north of kendal in that county and had three sons the eldest assisted his father in farming and succeeded to his little freehold the second settled in troutbeck a village eight miles north west of kendal and was remarkable for his talent at provincial poetry richard hogarth the third son who was educated at st bees and had kept a school in the same county appears to have been a man of some learning he came early to london where he resumed his original occupation of a schoolmaster in shipcourt in the old bailey and was occasionally employed as a corrector of the press mr richard hogarth married in london and our artist and his sisters mary and anne are believed to have been the only product of the marriage william hogarth was born november 10 and baptised nov 28 1697 in the parish of st bartholomew the great in london to which parish it is said in the biographia britannica he was afterwards a benefactor the school of hogarths father in 1712 was in the parish of st martin ludgate in the register of that parish therefore the date of his death it was natural to suppose might be found but the register has been searched to no purpose hogarth seems to have received no other education than that of a mechanic and his outset in life was unpropitious young hogarth was bound apprentice to a silversmith whose name was gamble of some eminence by whom he was confined to that branch of the trade which consists in engraving arms and cyphers upon the plate while thus employed he gradually acquired some knowledge of drawing and before his apprenticeship expired he exhibited talent for caricature he felt the impulse of genius and that it directed him to painting though little apprised at that time of the mode nature had intended he should pursue the following circumstance gave the first indication of the talents with which hogarth afterwards proved himself to be so liberally endowed during his apprenticeship he set out one sunday with two or three companions on an excursion to highgate the weather being hot they went into a publichouse where they had not long been before a quarrel arose between some persons in the same room from words they soon got to blows and the quart pots being the only missiles at hand were sent flying about the room in glorious confusion this was a scene too laughable for hogarth to resist he drew out his pencil and produced on the spot one of the most ludicrous pieces that ever was seen which exhibited likenesses not only of the combatants engaged in the affray but also of the persons gathered round them placed in grotesque attitudes and heightened with character and points of humour on the expiration of his apprenticeship he entered into the academy in st martins lane and studied drawing from the life but in this his proficiency was inconsiderable nor would he ever have surpassed mediocrity as a painter if he had not penetrated through external form to character and manners it was character passions the soul that his genius was given him to copy the engraving of arms and shopbills seems to have been his first employment by which to obtain a decent livelihood he was however soon engaged in decorating books and furnished sets of plates for several publications of the time an edition of hudibras afforded him the first subject suited to his genius yet he felt so much the shackles of other mens ideas that he was less successful in this task than might have been expected in the mean time he had acquired the use of the brush as well as of the pen and graver and possessing a singular facility in seizing a likeness he acquired considerable employment as a portraitpainter shortly after his marriage he informs us that he commenced painter of small conversation pieces from twelve to fifteen inches in height the novelty of which caused them to succeed for a few years one of the earliest productions of this kind which distinguished him as a painter is supposed to have been a representation of wanstead assembly the figures in it were drawn from the life and without burlesque the faces were said to bear great likenesses to the persons so drawn and to be rather better coloured than some of his more finished performances grace however was no attribute of his pencil and he was more disposed to aggravate than to soften the harsh touches of nature a curious anecdote is recorded of our artist during the early part of his practice as a portrait painter a nobleman who was uncommonly ugly and deformed sat for his picture which was executed in his happiest manner and with singularly rigid fidelity the peer disgusted at this counterpart of his dear self was not disposed very readily to pay for a reflector that would only insult him with his deformities after some time had elapsed and numerous unsuccessful applications had been made for payment the painter resorted to an expedient which he knew must alarm the noblemans pride he sent him the following cardmr hogarths dutiful respects to lord finding that he does not mean to have the picture which was drawn for him is informed again of mr hogarths pressing necessities for the money if therefore his lordship does not send for it in three days it will be disposed of with the addition of a tail and some other appendages to mr hare the famous wild beast man mr h having given that gentleman a conditional promise on his lordships refusal this intimation had its desired effect the picture was paid for and committed to the flames hogarths talents however for original comic design gradually unfolded themselves and various public occasions produced displays of his ludicrous powers in the year 1730 he clandestinely married the only daughter of sir james thornhill the painter who was not easily reconciled to her union with an obscure artist as hogarth then comparatively was shortly after he commenced his first great series of moral paintings the harlots progress some of these were at lady thornhills suggestion designedly placed by mrs hogarth in her fathers way in order to reconcile him to her marriage being informed by whom they were executed sir james observed the man who can produce such representations as these can also maintain a wife without a portion he soon after however relented and became generous to the young couple with whom he lived in great harmony until his death which took place in 1733 in 1733 his genius became conspicuously known the third scene of the harlots progress introduced him to the notice of the great at a board of treasury which was held a day or two after the appearance of that print a copy of it was shown by one of the lords as containing among other excellences a striking likeness of sir john gonson a celebrated magistrate of that day well known for his rigour towards women of the town from the treasury each lord repaired to the printshop for a copy of it and hogarth rose completely into fame upwards of twelve hundred subscribers entered their names for the plates which were copied and imitated on fan mounts and in a variety of other forms and a pantomime taken from them was represented at the theatre this performance together with several subsequent ones of a similar kind have placed hogarth in the rare class of original geniuses and inventors he may be said to have created an entirely new species of painting which may be termed the moral comic and may be considered rather as a writer of comedy with a pencil than as a painter if catching the manners and follies of an age living as they riseif general satire on vicesand ridicule familiarised by strokes of nature and heightened by witand the whole animated by proper and just expressions of the passionsbe comedy hogarth composed comedies as much as moliere soon after his marriage hogarth resided at south lambeth and being intimate with mr tyers the then spirited proprietor of vauxhall gardens he contributed much to the improvement of those gardens and first suggested the hint of embellishing them with paintings some of which were the productions of his own comic pencil among the paintings were the four parts of the day either by hogarth or after his designs two years after the publication of his harlots progress appeared the rakes progress which lord orford remarks though perhaps superior had not so much success for want of notoriety nor is the print of the arrest equal in merit to the others the curtain however was now drawn aside and his genius stood displayed in its full lustre the rakes progress was followed by several works in series viz marriage alamode industry and idleness the stages of cruelty and election prints to these may be added a great number of single comic pieces all of which present a rich source of amusementsuch as the march to finchley modern midnight conversation the sleeping congregation the gates of calais gin lane beer street strolling players in a barn the lecture laughing audience enraged musician c c which being introduced and described in the subsequent part of this work it would far exceed the limits necessarily assigned to these brief memoirs here minutely to characterise all the works of this original genius are in fact lectures of morality they are satires of particular vices and follies expressed with such strength of character and such an accumulation of minute and appropriate circumstances that they have all the truth of nature heightened by the attractions of wit and fancy nothing is without a meaning but all either conspires to the great end or forms an addition to the lively drama of human manners his single pieces however are rather to be considered as studies not perhaps for the professional artist but for the searcher into life and manners and for the votaries of true humour and ridicule no furniture of the kind can vie with hogarths prints as a fund of inexhaustible amusement yet conveying at the same time lessons of morality not contented however with the just reputation which he had acquired in his proper department hogarth attempted to shine in the highest branch of the artserious historypainting from a contempt says lord orford of the ignorant virtuosi of the age and from indignation at the impudent tricks of picture dealers whom he saw continually recommending and vending vile copies to bubble collectors and from having never studied or indeed having seen few good pictures of the great italian masters he persuaded himself that the praises bestowed on those glorious works were nothing but the effects of prejudice he talked this language till he believed it and having heard it often asserted as is true that time gives a mellowness to colours and improves them he not only denied the proposition but maintained that pictures only grew black and worse by age not distinguishing between the degrees in which the proposition might be true or false he went farther he determined to rival the ancients and unfortunately chose one of the finest pictures in england as the object of his competition this was the celebrated sigismonda of sir luke schaub now in the possession of the duke of newcastle said to be painted by correggio probably by furinoit is impossible to see the picture continues his lordship or read drydens inimitable tale and not feel that the same soul animated both after many essays hogarth at last produced his sigismondabut no more like sigismonda than i to hercules notwithstanding hogarth professed to decry literature he felt an inclination to communicate to the public his ideas on a topic connected with his art his analysis of beauty made its appearance in one volume quarto in the year 1753 its leading principle is that beauty fundamentally consists in that union of uniformity which is found in the curve or waving line and that round swelling figures are most pleasing to the eye this principle he illustrates by many ingenious remarks and examples and also by some plates characteristic of his genius in the year 1757 his brotherinlaw mr thornhill resigned his office of kings serjeantpainter in favour of hogarth who received his appointment on the 6th of june and entered on his functions on the 16th of july both in the same year this place was regranted to him by a warrant of george the third which bears date the 30th october 1761 with a salary of ten pounds per annum payable quarterly this connexion with the court probably induced hogarth to deviate from the strict line of party neutrality which he had hitherto observed and to engage against mr wilkes and his friends in a print published in september 1762 entitled the times this publication provoked some severe strictures from wilkess pen in a north briton no 17 hogarth replied by a caricature of the writer a rejoinder was put in by churchill in an angry epistle to hogarth not the brightest of his works and in which the severest strokes fell on a defect the painter had not caused and could not amendhis age which however was neither remarkable nor decrepit much less had it impaired his talents for only six months before he had produced one of his most capital works in revenge for this epistle hogarth caricatured churchill under the form of a canonical bear with a club and a pot of porter during this period of warfare so virulent and disgraceful to all the parties hogarths health visibly declined in 1762 he complained of an internal pain the continuance of which produced a general decay of the system that proved incurable and on the 25th of october 1764 having been previously conveyed in a very weak and languid state from chiswick to leicester fields he died suddenly of an aneurism in his chest in the sixtyseventh or sixtyeighth year of his age his remains were interred at chiswick beneath a plain but neat mausoleum with the following elegant inscription by his friend garrick farewell great painter of mankind who reachd the noblest point of art whose pictured morals

human life there is none greater than that of extravagance or profuseness it being constant labour without the least ease or relaxation it bears indeed the colour of that which is commendable and would fain be thought to take its rise from laudable motives searching indefatigably after true felicity now as there can be no true felicity without content it is this which every man is in constant pursuit of the learned for instance in his industrious quest after knowledge the merchant in his dangerous voyages the ambitious in his passionate pursuit of honour the conqueror in his earnest desire of victory the politician in his deeplaid designs the wanton in his pleasing charms of beauty the covetous in his unwearied heapingup of treasure and the prodigal in his general and extravagant indulgencethus far it may be wellbut so mistaken are we in our road as to run on in the very opposite tract which leads directly to our ruin whatever else we indulge ourselves in is attended with some small degree of relish and has some trifling satisfaction in the enjoyment but in this the farther we go the more we are lost and when arrived at the mark proposed we are as far from the object we pursue as when we first set out here then are we inexcusable in not attending to the secret dictates of reason and in stopping our ears at the timely admonitions of friendship headstrong and ungovernable we pursue our course without intermission thoughtless and unwary we see not the dangers that lie immediately before us but hurry on even without sight of our object till we bury ourselves in that gulf of woe where perishes at once health wealth and virtue and whose dreadful labyrinths admit of no return struck with the foresight of that misery attendant on a life of debauchery which is in fact the offspring of prodigality our author has in the scenes before us attempted the reformation of the worldling by stopping him as it were in his career and opening to his view the many sad calamities awaiting the prosecution of his proposed scheme of life he has in hopes of reforming the prodigal and at the same time deterring the rising generation whom providence may have blessed with earthly wealth from entering into so iniquitous a course exhibited the life of a young man hurried on through a succession of profligate pursuits for the few years nature was able to support itself and this from the instant he might be said to enter into the world till the time of his leaving it but as the vice of avarice is equal to that of prodigality and the ruin of children is often owing to the indiscretion of their parents he has opened the piece with a scene which at the same time that it exposes the folly of the youth shews us the imprudence of the father who is supposed to have hurt the principles of his son in depriving him of the necessary use of some portion of that gold he had with penurious covetousness been hoarding up for the sole purpose of lodging in his coffers plate i the young heir taking possession oh vanity of age untoward ever spleeny ever froward why these bolts and massy chains squint suspicions jealous pains why thy toilsome journey oer layst thou up an useless store hope along with time is flown nor canst thou reap the field thoust sown hast thou a son in time be wise he views thy toil with other eyes needs must thy kind paternal care lockd in thy

and with the father mix the friend uncircumscribed by prudent rules or precepts of expensive schools abused at home abroad despised unbred unletterd unadvised the headstrong course of life begun what comfort from thy darling son hoadley the history opens representing a scene crowded with all the monuments of avarice and laying before us a most beautiful contrast such as is too general in the world to pass unobserved nothing being more common than for a son to prodigally squander away that substance his father had with anxious solicitude his whole life been amassinghere we see the young heir at the age of nineteen or twenty raw from the university just arrived at home upon the death of his father eager to know the possessions he is master of the old wardrobes where things have been rotting time out of mind are instantly wrenched open the strong chests are unlocked the parchments those securities of treble interest on which this avaricious monster lent his money tumbled out and the bags of gold which had long been hoarded with griping care now exposed to the pilfering hands of those about him to explain every little mark of usury and covetousness such as the mortgages bonds indentures c the piece of candle stuck on a saveall on the mantlepiece the rotten furniture of the room and the miserable contents of the dusty wardrobe would be unnecessary we shall only notice the more striking articles from the vast quantity of papers falls an old written journal where among other memorandums we find the following viz may the 5th 1721 put off my bad shilling hence we learn the store this penurious miser set on this trifle that so penurious is the disposition of the miser that notwithstanding he may be possessed of many large bags of gold the fear of losing a single shilling is a continual trouble to him in one part of the room a man is hanging it with black cloth on which are placed escutcheons by way of dreary ornament these escutcheons contain the arms of the covetous viz three vices hard screwed with the motto beware on the floor lie a pair of old shoes which this sordid wretch is supposed to have long preserved for the weight of iron in the nails and has been soling with leather cut from the covers of an old family bible an excellent piece of satire intimating that such men would sacrifice even their god to the lust of money from these and some other objects too striking to pass unnoticed such as the gold falling from the breaking cornice the jack and spit those utensils of original hospitality locked up through fear of being used the clean and empty chimney in which a fire is just now going to be made for the first time and the emaciated figure of the cat strongly mark the natural temper of the late miserly inhabitant who could starve in the midst of plentybut see the mighty change view the hero of our piece left to himself upon the death of his father possessed of a goodly inheritance mark how his mind is affecteddetermined to partake of the mighty happiness he falsely imagines others of his age and fortune enjoy see him running headlong into extravagance withholding not his heart from any joy but implicitly pursuing the dictates of his will to commence this delusive swing of pleasure his first application is to the tailor whom we see here taking his measure in order to trick out his pretty person in the interim enters a poor girl with her mother whom our hero has seduced under professions of love and promises of marriage in hopes of meeting with that kind welcome she had the greatest reason to expect but he corrupted with the wealth of which he is now the master forgets every engagement he once made finds himself too rich to keep his word and as if gold would atone for a breach of honour is offering money to her mother as an equivalent for the nonfulfilling of his promise not the sight of the ring given as a pledge of his fidelity not a view of the many affectionate letters he at one time wrote to her of which her mothers lap is full not the tears nor even the pregnant condition of the wretched girl could awaken in him one spark of tenderness but hard hearted and unfeeling like the generality of wicked men he suffers her to weep away her woes in silent sorrow and curse with bitterness her deceitful betrayer one thing more we shall take notice of which is that this unexpected visit attended with abuse from the mother so engages the attention of our youth as to give the old pettifogger behind him an opportunity of robbing him hence we see that one ill consequence is generally attended with another and that misfortunes according to the old proverb seldom come alone mr ireland remarks of this platehe here presents to us the picture of a young man thoughtless extravagant and licentious and in colours equally impressive paints the destructive consequences of his conduct the first print most forcibly contrasts two opposite passions the unthinking negligence of youth and the sordid avaricious rapacity of age it brings into one point of view what mr pope so exquisitely describes in his epistle to lord bathurst who sees pale mammon pine amidst his store sees but a backward steward for the poor this year a reservoir to keep and spare the next a fountain spouting through his heir the introduction to this history is well delineated and the principal figure marked with that easy unmeaning vacancy of face which speaks him formed by nature for a dupe ignorant of the value of money and negligent in his nature he leaves his bag of untold gold in the reach of an old and greedy pettifogging attorney who is making an inventory of bonds mortgages indentures c this man with the rapacity so natural to those who disgrace the profession seizes the first opportunity of plundering his employer hogarth had a few years before been engaged in a law suit which gave him some experience of the practice of those pests of society illustration the rakes

and fashion in her changing vest hoadley we are next to consider our hero as launched into the world and having equipped himself with all the necessaries to constitute him a man of taste he plunges at once into all the fashionable excesses and enters with spirit into the character he assumes the avarice of the penurious father then in this print is contrasted by the giddy profusion of his prodigal son we view him now at his levee attended by masters of various professions supposed to be here offering their interested services the foremost figure is readily known to be a dancingmaster behind him are two men who at the time when these prints were first published were noted for teaching the arts of defence by different weapons and who are here drawn from the life one of whom is a frenchman teacher of the smallsword making a thrust with his foil the other an englishman master of the quarterstaff the vivacity of the first and the cold contempt visible in the face of the second beautifully describe the natural disposition of the two nations on the left of the latter stands an improver of gardens drawn also from the life offering a plan for that purpose a taste for gardening carried to excess must be acknowledged to have been the ruin of numbers it being a passion that is seldom if ever satisfied and attended with the greatest expense in the chair sits a professor of music at the harpsichord running over the keys waiting to give his pupil a lesson behind whose chair hangs a list of the presents one farinelli an italian singer received the next day after his first performance

prevailing dissipation and luxury of the times near the principal figure in this plate is that of him with one hand on his breast the other on his sword whom we may easily discover to be a bravo he is represented as having brought a letter of recommendation as one disposed to undertake all sorts of service this character is rather italian than english but is here introduced to fill up the list of persons at that time too often engaged in the service of the votaries of extravagance and fashion our author would have it imagined in the interval between the first scene and this that the young man whose history he is painting had now given himself up to every fashionable extravagance and among others he had imbibed a taste for cockfighting and horseracing two amusements which at that time the man of fashion could not dispense with this is evident from his rider bringing in a silver punchbowl which one of his horses is supposed to have won and his saloon being ridiculously ornamented with the portraits of celebrated cocks the figures in the back part of this plate represent tailors perukemakers milliners and such other persons as generally fill the antichamber of a man of quality except one who is supposed to be a poet and has written some panegyric on the person whose levee he attends and who waits for that approbation he already vainly anticipates upon the whole the general tenor of this scene is to teach us that the man of fashion is too often exposed to the rapacity of his fellow creatures and is commonly a dupe to the more knowing part of the world how exactly says mr ireland does bramston describe the character in his man of taste without italian and without an ear to bononcinis music i adhere to boon companions i my time would give with players pimps and

discriminative stamp it has been said by a very judicious critic the rev mr gilpin from whom it is not easy to differ without being wrong that the hero of this history in the first plate of the series is unmeaning and in the second ungraceful the fact is admitted but for so delineating him the author is entitled to our praise rather than our censure rakewells whole conduct proves he was a fool and at that time he had not learned how to perform an artificial character he therefore looks as he is unmeaning and uninformed but in the second plate he is ungracefulgranted the illeducated son of so avaricious a father could not have been introduced into very good company and though by the different teachers who surround him it evidently appears that he wishes to assume the character of a gentleman his internal feelings tell him he has not attained it under that consciousness he is properly and naturally represented as ungraceful and embarrassed in his new situation illustration the

representedthe composition is good the form of the group made up of the figures in action the chair and the lamplighter is pleasing only here we have an opportunity of remarking that a group is disgusting when the extremities of it are heavy a group in some respects should resemble a tree the heavier part of the foliage the cup as the landscapepainter calls it is always near the middle the outside branches which are relieved by the sky are light and airy an inattention to this rule has given a heaviness to the group before us the two bailiffs the woman and the chairman are all huddled together in that part of the group which should have been the lightest while the middle part where the hand holds the door wants strength and consistence it may be added too that the four heads in the form of a diamond make an unpleasing shape all regular figures should be studiously avoidedthe light had been well distributed if the bailiff holding the arrest and the chairman had been a little lighter and the woman darker the glare of the white apron is disagreeablewe have in this print some beautiful instances of expression the surprise and terror of the poor gentleman is apparent in every limb as far as is consistent with the fear of discomposing his dress the insolence of power in one of the bailiffs and the unfeeling heart which can jest with misery in the other are strongly marked the selfimportance too of the honest cambrian is not ill portrayed who is chiefly introduced to settle the chronology of the storyin pose of grace we have nothing striking hogarth might have

london as to become the usual resort of those who wished to be privately married that such was the view of this prostituted young man may be fairly inferred from a glance at the object of his choice

figure is admirable and the whole is a strong representation of the human mind in a storm three stages of that species of madness which attends gaming are here described on the first shock all is

the leg to prevent any further mischief he might either do to himself or others but in this scene dreary and horrid as are its accompaniments he is attended by the faithful and kindhearted female whom he so basely betrayed in the first plate we see him refuse her his promised hand in the fourth she releases him from the harpy fangs of a bailiff she is present at his marriage and in the hope of relieving his distress she follows him to a prison our artist in this scene of horror has taken an opportunity of pointing out to us the various causes of mental blindness for such surely it may be called when the intuitive faculties are either destroyed or impaired in one of the inner rooms of this gallery is a despairing wretch imploring heaven for mercy whose brain is crazed with liplabouring superstition the most dreadful enemy of human kind which attended with ignorance error penance and indulgence too often deprives its unhappy votaries of their senses the next in view is one man drawing lines upon a wall in order if possible to find out the longitude and another before him looking through a paper by way of a telescope by these expressive figures we are given to understand that such is the misfortune of man that while perhaps the aspiring soul is pursuing some lofty and elevated conception soaring to an uncommon pitch and teeming with some grand discovery the ferment often proves too strong for the feeble brain to support and lays the whole magazine of notions and images in wild confusion this melancholy group is completed by the crazy tailor who is staring at the mad astronomer with a sort of wild astonishment wondering through excess of ignorance what discoveries the heavens can possibly afford proud of his profession he has fixed a variety of patterns in his hat by way of ornament has covered his poor head with shreds and makes his measure the constant object of his attention behind this man stands another playing on the violin with his book upon his head

flying at him behind him and in the inner room are two persons maddened with ambition these men though under the influence of the same passion are actuated by different notions one is for the papal dignity the other for regal one imagines himself the pope and saying mass the other fancies himself a king is encircled with the emblem of royalty and is casting contempt on his imaginary subjects by an act of the greatest disdain to brighten this distressful scene and draw a smile from him whose rigid reasoning might condemn the bringing into public view this blemish of humanity are two women introduced walking in the gallery as curious spectators of this melancholy sight one of whom is supposed in a whisper to bid the other observe the naked man which she takes an opportunity of doing by a leer through the sticks of her fan thus imagining the hero of our piece to expire raving mad the story is finished and little else remains but to close it with a proper application reflect then ye parents on this tragic tale consider with yourselves that the ruin of a child is too often owing to the imprudence of a father had the young man whose story we have related been taught the proper use

poet the bench character caricatura and outre it having been universally acknowledged that mr hogarth was one of the most ingenious painters of his age and a man possessed of a vast store of humour which he has sufficiently shown and displayed in his numerous productions the general approbation his works receive is not to be wondered at but as owing to the false notions of the public not thoroughly acquainted with the true art of painting he has been often called a caricaturer when in reality caricatura was no part of his profession he being a true copier of nature to set this matter right and give the world a just definition of the words character caricatura and outr in which humorous painting principally consists and to show their difference of meaning he in the year 1758 published this print but as it did not quite answer his purpose giving an illustration of the word character only he added in the year 1764 the group of heads above which he never lived to finish though he worked upon it the day before his death the lines between inverted commas are our authors own words and are engraved at the bottom of the plate there are hardly any two things more essentially different than character and caricatura nevertheless they are usually confounded and mistaken for each other on which account this explanation is attempted it has ever been allowed that when a character is strongly marked in the living face it may be considered as an index of the mind to express which with any degree of justness in painting requires the utmost efforts of a great master now that which has of late years got the name of caricatura is or ought to be totally divested of every stroke that hath a tendency to good drawing it may be said to be a species of lines that are produced rather by the hand of chance than of skill for the early scrawlings of a child which do but barely hint the idea of a human face will always be found to be like some person or other and will often form such a comical resemblance as in all probability the most eminent caricaturers of these times will not be able to equal with design because their ideas of objects are so much more perfect than childrens that they will unavoidably introduce some kind of drawing for all the humorous effects of the fashionable manner of caricaturing chiefly depend on the surprise we are under at finding ourselves caught with any sort of similitude in objects absolutely remote in their kind let it be observed the more remote in their nature the greater is the excellence of these pieces as a proof of this i remember a famous caricatura of a certain italian singer that struck at first sight which consisted only of a straight perpendicular stroke with a dot over as to the french word outr it is different from the rest and signifies nothing more than the exaggerated outlines of a figure all the parts of which may be in other respects a perfect and true picture of nature a giant or a dwarf may be called a common man outr so any part as a nose or a leg made bigger or less than it ought to be is that part outr which is all that is to be understood by this word injudiciously used to the prejudice of characteranalysis of beauty chap vi to prevent these distinctions being looked upon as dry and unentertaining our author has in this group of faces ridiculed the want of capacity

print that hogarth engraved to the last that he published i do not think says mr ireland there is one in which character is more displayed than in this very spirited little etching it is much superior to the more delicate engravings from his designs by other artists and i prefer it to those that were still higher finished by his own burin the prim coxcomb with an enormous bag whose favours like those of hercules between virtue and vice are contended for by two rival orange girls gives an admirable idea of the dress of the day when if we may judge from this print our grave forefathers defying nature and despising convenience had a much higher rank in the temple of folly than was then attained by their ladies it must be acknowledged that since that period the softer sex have asserted their natural rights and snatching the wreath of fashion from the brow of presuming man have tortured it into such forms that were it possible which certes it is not to disguise a beauteous facebut to the high behest of fashion all must bow governed by this idol our beau has a cuff that for a modern fop would furnish fronts for a waistcoat and a family firescreen might be made of his enormous bag his bare and shrivelled neck has a close resemblance to that of a halfstarved greyhound and his face figure and air form a fine contrast to the easy and degage assurance of the grisette whom he addresses the opposite figure nearly as grotesque though not quite so formal as its companion presses its left hand upon its breast in the style of protestation and eagerly contemplating the superabundant charms of a beauty of rubenss school presents her with a pinch of comfort every muscle every line of his countenance is acted upon by affectation and grimace and his queue bears some resemblance to an eartrumpet the total inattention of these three polite persons to the business of the stage which at this moment almost convulses the children of nature who are seated in the pit is highly descriptive of that refined apathy which characterises our people of fashion and raises them above those mean passions that agitate the groundlings one gentleman indeed is as affectedly unaffected as a man of the first world by his saturnine cast of face and contracted brow he is evidently a profound critic and much too wise to laugh he must indisputably be a very great critic for like voltaires poccocurante nothing can please him and while those around open every avenue of their minds to mirth and are willing to be delighted though they do not well know why he analyses the drama by the laws of aristotle and finding those laws are violated determines that the author ought to be hissed instead of being applauded this it is to be so excellent a judge this it is which gives a critic that exalted gratification which can never be attained by the illiteratethe supreme power of pointing out faults where others discern nothing but beauties and preserving a rigid inflexibility of muscle while the sides of the vulgar herd are shaking with laughter these merry mortals thinking with plato that it is no proof of a good stomach to nauseate every aliment presented them do not inquire too nicely into causes but giving full scope to their risibility display a set of features more highly ludicrous than i ever saw in any other print it is to be regretted that the artist has not given us some clue by which we might have known what was the play which so much delighted his audience i should conjecture that it was either one of shakespears comedies or a modern tragedy sentimental comedy was not the fashion of that day the three sedate musicians in the orchestra totally engrossed by minims and crotchets are an admirable contrast to the company in the pit illustration the laughing audience gate of

founded originated in calais to which place mr hogarth accompanied by some of his friends made an excursion in the year 1747 extreme partiality for his native country was the leading trait of his character he seems to have begun his three hours voyage with a firm determination to be displeased at every thing he saw out of old england for a meagre powdered figure hung with tatters alamode de paris to affect the airs of a coxcomb and the importance of a sovereign is ridiculous enough but if it makes a man happy why should he be laughed at it must blunt the edge of ridicule to see natural hilarity defy depression and a whole nation laugh sing and dance under burthens that would nearly break the firmknit sinews of a briton such was the picture of france at that period but it was a picture which our english satirist could not contemplate with common patience the swarms of grotesque figures who paraded the streets excited his indignation and drew forth a torrent of coarse abusive ridicule not much to the honour of his liberality he compared them to callots beggarslazarus on the painted cloththe prodigal sonor any other object descriptive of extreme contempt against giving way to these effusions of national spleen in the open street he was frequently cautioned but advice had no effect he treated admonition with scorn and considered his monitor unworthy the name of englishman these satirical ebullitions were at length checked ignorant of the customs of france and considering the gate of calais merely as a piece of ancient architecture he began to make a sketch this was soon observed he was seized as a spy who intended to draw a plan of the fortification and escorted by a file of musqueteers to m la commandant his sketchbook was examined leaf by leaf and found to contain drawings that had not the most distant relation to tactics notwithstanding this favourable circumstance the governor with great politeness assured him that had not a treaty between the nations been actually signed he should have been under the disagreeable necessity of hanging him upon the ramparts as it was he must be permitted the privilege of providing him a few military attendants who should do themselves the honour of waiting upon him while he resided in the dominions of the grande monarque two sentinels were then ordered to escort him to his hotel from whence they conducted him to the vessel nor did they quit their prisoner until he was a league from shore when seizing him by the shoulders and spinning him round upon the deck they said he was now at liberty to pursue his voyage without further molestation so mortifying an adventure he did not like to hear recited but has in this print recorded the circumstance which led to it in one corner he has given a portrait of himself making the drawing and to shew the moment of arrest the hand of a serjeant is upon his shoulder the french sentinel is so situated as to give some idea of a figure hanging in chains his ragged shirt is trimmed with a pair of paper ruffles the old woman and a fish which she is pointing at have a striking resemblance the abundance of parsnips and other vegetables indicate

so frequent in the metropolis that it was customary for men in trade to wear swords not to preserve their religion and liberty from foreign invasion but to defend their own pockets from domestic

which this print was copied hogarth painted by the order of miss edwards a woman of large fortune who having been laughed at for some singularities in her manners requested the artist to recriminate on her opponents and paid him sixty guineas for his production it is professedly intended to ridicule the reigning fashions of high life in the year 1742 to do this the painter has brought into one group an old beau and an old lady of the chesterfield school a fashionable young lady a little black boy and a fulldressed monkey the old lady with a most affected air poises between her finger and thumb a small teacup with the beauties of which she appears to be highly enamoured the gentleman gazing with vacant wonder at that and the companion saucer which he holds in his hand joins in admiration of its astonishing beauties each varied colour of the brightest hue the green the red the yellow and the blue in every part their dazzled eyes behold here streakd with silverthere enrichd with gold this gentleman is said to be intended for lord portmore in the habit he first appeared at court on his return from france the cane dangling from his wrist large muff long queue black stock feathered chapeau and shoes give him the air of an old and finishd fop all cork at heel and feather all at top the old ladys habit formed of stiff brocade gives her the appearance of a squat pyramid with a grotesque head at the top of it the young one is fondling a little black boy who on his part is playing with a petite pagoda this miniature othello has been said to be intended for the late ignatius sancho whose talents and virtues were an honour to his colour at the time the picture was painted he would have been rather older than the figure but as he was then honoured by the partiality and protection of a noble family the painter might possibly mean to delineate what his figure had been a few years before the little monkey with a magnifying glass bagwig solitaire laced hat and ruffles is eagerly inspecting a bill of fare with the following articles pour diner cocks combs ducks tongues rabbits ears fricasee of snails grande doeufs buerre in the centre of the room is a

fat lady to a thin proportion and another cupid blowing up a fire to burn a hoop petticoat muff bag queue wig c on the dexter side is another picture representing monsieur desnoyer operatically

corner enshrined as hogarth made this design from the ideas of miss edwards it has been said that he had no great partiality for his own performance and that as he never would consent to its being

and blighting are their smiles destruction waits upon their wiles alas thy guardian angel sleeps vice clasps her hands and virtue weeps the general aim of historical painters says mr ireland has been to emblazon some signal exploit of an exalted and distinguished character to go through a series of actions and conduct their hero from the cradle to the grave to give a history upon canvass and tell a story with the pencil few of them attempted mr hogarth saw with the intuitive eye of genius that one path to the temple of fame was yet untrodden he took nature for his guide and gained the summit he was the painter of nature for he gave not merely the groundplan of the countenance but marked the features with every impulse of the mind he may be denominated the biographical dramatist of domestic life leaving those heroic monarchs who have blazed through their day with the destructive brilliancy of a comet to their adulatory historians he like lillo has taken his scenes from humble life and rendered them a source of entertainment instruction and morality this series of prints gives the history of a prostitute the story commences with her arrival in london where initiated in the school of profligacy she experiences the miseries consequent to her situation and dies in the morning of life her variety of wretchedness forms such a picture of the way in which vice rewards her votaries as ought to warn the young and inexperienced from entering this path of infamy the first scene of this domestic tragedy is laid at the bell inn in woodstreet and the heroine may possibly be daughter to the poor old clergyman who is reading the direction of a letter close to the york waggon from which vehicle she has just alighted in attireneat plain unadorned in demeanorartless modest diffident in the bloom of youth and more distinguished by native innocence than elegant symmetry her conscious blush and downcast eyes attract the attention of a female fiend who panders to the vices of the opulent and libidinous coming out of the door of the inn we discover two men one of whom is eagerly gloating on the devoted victim this is a portrait and said to be a strong resemblance of colonel francis chartres the old procuress immediately after the girls alighting from the waggon addresses her with the familiarity of a friend rather than the reserve of one who is to be her mistress had her father been versed in even the first rudiments of physiognomy he would have prevented her engaging with one of so decided an aspect for this also is the portrait of a woman infamous in her day but he good easy man unsuspicious as fieldings parson adams is wholly engrossed in the contemplation of a superscription to a letter addressed to the bishop of the diocese so important an object prevents his attending to his daughter or regarding the devastation occasioned by his gaunt and hungry rozinante having snatched at the straw that packs up some earthenware and produced the wreck of flowerpots and the crash of pans from the inn she is taken to the house of the procuress divested of her homespun garb dressed in the gayest style of the day and the tender native hue of her complexion incrusted with paint and disguised by patches she is then introduced to colonel chartres and by artful flattery and liberal promises becomes intoxicated with the dreams of imaginary greatness a short time convinces her of how light a breath these promises were composed deserted by her keeper and terrified by threats of an immediate arrest for the pompous paraphernalia of prostitution after being a short time protected by one of the tribe of levi she is reduced to the hard necessity of wandering the streets for that precarious subsistence which flows from the drunken rake or profligate debauchee here her situation is truly pitiable chilled by nipping frost and midnight dew the repentant tear trickling on her heaving bosom she endeavours to drown reflection in draughts of destructive poison this added to the contagious company of women of her own description vitiates her mind eradicates the native seeds of virtue destroys that elegant and fascinating simplicity which gives additional charms to beauty and leaves in its place art affectation and impudence neither the painter of a sublime picture nor the writer of an heroic poem should introduce any trivial circumstances that are likely to draw the attention from the principal figures such compositions should form one great whole minute detail will inevitably weaken their effect but in little stories which record the domestic incidents of familiar life these accessary accompaniments though trifling in themselves acquire a consequence from their situation they add to the interest and realise the scene in this as in almost all that were delineated by mr hogarth we see a close regard paid to things as they then were by which means his prints become a sort of historical record of the manners of the age illustration the harlots progress plate 1 ensnared by a procuress the harlots progress plate ii ah why so vain though blooming in thy spring thou shining frail adornd but wretched thing old age will come disease may come before and twenty prove as fatal as threescore entered into the path of infamy the next scene exhibits our young heroine the mistress of a rich jew attended by a black boy1 and surrounded with the pompous parade of tasteless profusion her mind being now as depraved as her person is decorated she keeps up the spirit of her character by extravagance and inconstancy an example of the first is exhibited in the monkey being suffered to drag her rich headdress round the room and of the second in the retiring gallant the hebrew is represented at breakfast with his mistress but having come earlier than was expected the favourite has not departed to secure his retreat is an exercise for the invention of both mistress and maid this is accomplished by the lady finding a pretence for quarrelling with the jew kicking down the teatable and scalding his legs which added to the noise of the china so far engrosses his attention that the paramour assisted by the servant escapes discovery the subjects of two pictures with which the room is decorated are david dancing before the ark and jonah seated under a gourd they are placed there not merely as circumstances which belong to jewish story but as a piece of covert ridicule on the old masters who generally painted from the ideas of others and repeated the same tale ad infinitum on the toilettable we discover a mask which well enough intimates where she had passed part of the preceding night and that masquerades then a very fashionable amusement were much frequented by women of this description a sufficient reason for their being avoided by those of an opposite character under the protection of this disciple of moses she could not remain long riches were his only attraction and though profusely lavished on this unworthy object her attachment was not to be obtained nor could her constancy be secured repeated acts of infidelity are punished by dismission and her next situation shows that like most of the sisterhood she had lived without apprehension of the sunshine of life being darkened by the passing cloud and made no provision for the hour of adversity in this print the characters are marked with a masters hand the insolent air of the harlot the astonishment of the jew eagerly grasping at the falling table the start of the black boy the cautious trip of the ungartered and barefooted retreating gallant and the sudden spring of the scalded monkey are admirably expressed to represent an object in its descent has been said to be impossible the attempt has seldom succeeded but in this print the tea equipage really appears falling to the floor and in rembrandts abrahams offering in the houghton collection now at petersburg the knife dropping from the hand of the patriarch appears in a falling state quin compared garrick in othello to the black boy with the teakettle a circumstance that by no means encouraged our roscius to continue acting the part indeed when his face was obscured his chief power of expression was lost and then and not till then was he reduced to a level with several other performers it has been remarked however that garrick said of himself that when he appeared in othello quin he supposed would say heres pompey wheres the teakettle footnote 1 the attendant black boy gave the foundation of an illnatured remark by quin when garrick once attempted the part of othello he pretend to play othello said the surly satirist he pretend to play othello he wants nothing but the teakettle and lamp to qualify him for hogarths pompey illustration the harlots progress plate 2 quarrels with her jew protector the harlots progress plate iii reproach scorn infamy and hate on all thy future steps shall wait thy furor be loathd by every eye and every foot thy presence fly we here see this child of misfortune fallen from her high estate her magnificent apartment is quitted for a dreary lodging in the purlieus of drurylane she is at breakfast and every object exhibits marks of the most wretched penury her silver teakettle is changed for a tin pot and her highly decorated toilet gives place to an old leaf table strewed with the relics of the last nights revel and ornamented with a broken lookingglass around the room are scattered tobaccopipes gin measures and pewter pots emblems of the habits of life into which she is initiated and the company which she now keeps this is farther intimated by the wigbox of james dalton a notorious streetrobber who was afterwards executed in her hand she displays a watch which might be either presented to her or stolen from her last nights gallant by the nostrums which ornament the broken window we see that poverty is not her only evil the dreary and comfortless appearance of every object in this wretched receptacle the bit of butter on a piece of paper the candle in a bottle the basin upon a chair the punchbowl and comb upon the table and the tobaccopipes c strewed upon the unswept floor give an admirable picture of the style in which this pride of drurylane ate her matin meal the pictures which ornament the room are abraham offering up isaac and a portrait of the virgin mary dr sacheverell and macheath the highwayman are companion prints there is some whimsicality in placing the two ladies under a canopy formed by the unnailed valance of the bed and characteristically crowned by the wigbox of a highwayman when theodore the unfortunate king of corsica was so reduced as to lodge in a garret in deanstreet soho a number of gentlemen made a collection for his relief the chairman of their committee informed him by letter that on the following day at twelve oclock two of the society would wait upon his majesty with the money to give his attic apartment an appearance of royalty the poor monarch placed an armchair on his halftestered bed and seating himself under the scanty canopy gave what he thought might serve as the representation of a throne when his two visitors entered the room he graciously held out his right hand that they might have the honour ofkissing it a magistrate cautiously entering the room with his attendant constables commits her to a house of correction where our legislators wisely suppose that being confined to the improving conversation of her associates in vice must have a powerful tendency towards the reformation of her manners sir john gonson a justice of peace very active in the suppression of brothels is the person represented in a view of the town in 1735 by t gilbert fellow of peterhouse cambridge are the following lines though laws severe to punish crimes were made what honest man is of these laws afraid all felons against judges will exclaim as harlots tremble at a gonsons name pope has noticed him in his imitation of dr donne and loveling in a very elegant latin ode thus between the poets and the painter the name of this harlothunting justice is transmitted to posterity he died on the 9th of january 1765 illustration the harlots progress plate 3 apprehended by a magistrate the harlots progress plate iv with pallid cheek and haggard eye and loud laments and heartfelt sigh unpitied hopeless of relief she drinks the bitter cup of grief in vain the sigh in vain the tear compassion never enters here but justice clanks her iron chain and calls forth shame remorse and pain the situation in which the last plate exhibited our wretched female was sufficiently degrading but in this her misery is greatly aggravated we now see her suffering the chastisement due to her follies reduced to the wretched alternative of beating hemp or receiving the correction of a savage taskmaster exposed to the derision of all around even her own servant who is well acquainted with the rules of the place appears little disposed to show any return of gratitude for recent obligations though even her shoes which she displays while tying up her garter seem by their gaudy outside to have been a present from her mistress the civil discipline of the stern keeper has all the severity of the old school with the true spirit of tyranny he sentences those who will not labour to the whippingpost to a kind of picketing suspension by the wrists or having a heavy log fastened to their leg with the last of these punishments he at this moment threatens the heroine of our story nor is it likely that his obduracy can be softened except by a well applied fee how dreadful how mortifying the situation these accumulated evils might perhaps produce a momentary remorse but a return to the path of virtue is not so easy as a departure from it to show that neither the dread nor endurance of the severest punishment will deter from the perpetration of crimes a oneeyed female close to the keeper is picking a pocket the torn card may probably be dropped by the welldressed gamester who has exchanged the dicebox for the mallet and whose laced hat is hung up as a companion trophy to the hooppetticoat one of the girls appears scarcely in her teens to the disgrace of our police these unfortunate little wanderers are still suffered to take their nocturnal rambles in the most public streets of the metropolis what heart so void of sensibility as not to heave a pitying sigh at their deplorable situation vice is not confined to colour for a black woman is ludicrously exhibited as suffering the penalty of those frailties which are imagined peculiar to the fair the figure chalked as dangling upon the wall with a pipe in his mouth is intended as a caricatured portrait of sir john gonson and probably the production of some wouldbe artist whom the magistrate had committed to bridewell as a proper academy for the pursuit of his studies the inscription upon the pillory better to work than stand thus and that on the whippingpost near the laced gambler the reward of idleness are judiciously introduced in this print the composition is good the figures in the background though properly subordinate are sufficiently marked the lassitude of the principal character well contrasted by the austerity of the rigid overseer there is a fine climax of female debasement from the gaudy heroine of our drama to her maid and from thence to the still object who is represented as destroying one of the plagues of egypt such well dressed females as our heroine are rarely met with in our present houses of correction but her splendid appearance is sufficiently warranted by the following paragraph in the grubstreet journal of september 14th 1730 one mary moffat a woman of great note in the hundreds of drury who about a fortnight ago was committed to hard labour in tothillfields bridewell by nine justices brought his majestys writ of habeas corpus and was carried before the right honourable the lord chief justice raymond expecting to have been either bailed or discharged but her commitment appearing to be legal his lordship thought fit to remand her back again to her former place of confinement where she is now beating hemp in a gown very richly laced with silver illustration the harlots progress plate 4 scene in bridewell the harlots progress plate v with keen remorse deep sighs and trembling fears repentant groans and unavailing tears this child of misery resigns her breath and sinks despondent in the arms of death released from bridewell we now see this victim to her own indiscretion breathe her last sad sigh and expire in all the extremity of penury and wretchedness the two quacks whose injudicious treatment has probably accelerated her death are vociferously supporting the infallibility of their respective medicines and each charging the other with having poisoned her the meagre figure is a portrait of dr misaubin a foreigner at that time in considerable practice these disputes it has been affirmed sometimes happen at a consultation of regular physicians and a patient has been so unpolite as to die before they could determine on the name of his disorder about the symptoms how they disagree but how unanimous about the fee while the maid servant is entreating them to cease quarrelling and assist her dying mistress the nurse plunders her trunk of the few poor remains of former grandeur her little boy turning a scanty remnant of meat hung to roast by a string the linen hanging to dry the coals deposited in a corner the candles bellows and gridiron hung upon nails the furniture of the room and indeed every accompaniment exhibit a dreary display of poverty and wretchedness over the candles hangs a cake of jews bread once perhaps the property of her levitical lover and now used as a flytrap the initials of her name m h are smoked upon the ceiling as a kind of memento mori to the next inhabitant on the floor lies a paper inscribed anodyne necklace at that time deemed a sort of charm against the disorders incident to children and near the fire a tobaccopipe and paper of pills a picture of general and at this awful moment indecent confusion is admirably represented the noise of two enraged quacks disputing in bad english the harsh vulgar scream of the maid servant the table falling and the pot boiling over must produce a combination of sounds dreadful and dissonant to the ear in this pitiable situation without a friend to close her dying eyes or soften her sufferings by a tributary tear forlorn destitute and deserted the heroine of this eventful history expires her premature death brought on by a licentious life seven years of which had been devoted to debauchery and dissipation and attended by consequent infamy misery and disease the whole story affords a valuable lesson to the young and inexperienced and proves this great this important truth that a deviation from virtue is a departure from happiness the emaciated appearance of the dying figure the boys thoughtless inattention and the rapacious unfeeling eagerness of the old nurse are naturally and forcibly delineated the figures are well grouped the curtain gives depth and forms a good background to the doctors head the light is judiciously distributed and each accompaniment highly appropriate illustration the harlots progress plate 5 expires while the doctors are disputing the harlots progress plate vi no friends complaint no kind domestic tear pleasd thy pale ghost or gracd thy mournful bier by harlots hands thy dying eyes were closd by harlots hands thy decent limbs composd by harlots hands thy humble grave adornd by harlots honourd and by harlots mournd the adventures of our heroine are now concluded she is no longer an actor in her own tragedy and there are those who have considered this print as a farce at the end of it but surely such was not the authors intention the ingenious writer of tristram shandy begins the life of his hero before he is born the picturesque biographer of mary hackabout has found an opportunity to convey admonition and enforce his moral after her death a wish usually prevails even among those who are most humbled by their own indiscretion that some respect should be paid to their remains that their eyes should be closed by the tender hand of a surviving friend and the tear of sympathy and regret shed upon the sod which covers their grave that those who loved them living should attend their last sad obsequies and a sacred character read over them the awful service which our religion ordains with the solemnity it demands the memory of this votary of prostitution meets with no such marks of social attention or pious respect the preparations for her funeral are as licentious as the progress of her life and the contagion of her example seems to reach all who surround her coffin one of them is engaged in the double trade of seduction and thievery a second is contemplating her own face in a mirror the female who is gazing at the corpse displays some marks of concern and feels a momentary compunction at viewing the melancholy scene before her but if any other part of the company are in a degree affected it is a mere maudlin sorrow kept up by glasses of strong liquor the depraved priest does not seem likely to feel for the dead that hope expressed in our liturgy the appearance and employment of almost every one present at this mockery of woe is such as must raise disgust in the breast of any female who has the least tincture of delicacy and excite a wish that such an exhibition may not be displayed at her own funeral in this plate there are some local customs which mark the manners of the times when it was engraved but are now generally disused except in some of the provinces very distant from the capital sprigs of rosemary were then given to each of the mourners to appear at a funeral without one was as great an indecorum as to be without a white handkerchief this custom might probably originate at a time when the plague depopulated the metropolis and rosemary was deemed an antidote against contagion it must be acknowledged that there are also in this print some things which though they gave the artist an opportunity of displaying his humour are violations of propriety and customs such is her child but a few removes from infancy being habited as chief mourner to attend his parent to the grave rings presented and an escutcheon hung up in a garret at the funeral of a needy prostitute the whole may be intended as a burlesque upon ostentatious and expensive funerals which were then more customary than they are now mr pope has well ridiculed the same folly when hopkins dies a thousand lights attend the wretch who living savd a candles end the figures have much characteristic discrimination the woman looking into the coffin has more beauty than we generally see in the works of this artist the undertakers gloating stare his companions leer the internal satisfaction of the parson and his next neighbour are contrasted by the irish howl of the woman at the opposite side and evince mr hogarths thorough knowledge of the operation of the passions upon the features the composition forms a good shape has a proper depth and the light is well managed sir james thornhills opinion of this series may be inferred from the following circumstance mr hogarth had without consent married his daughter sir james considering him as an obscure artist was much displeased with the connexion to give him a better opinion of his soninlaw a common friend one morning privately conveyed the six pictures of the harlots progress into his drawingroom the veteran painter eagerly inquired who was the artist and being told cried out very well very well indeed the man who can paint such pictures as these can maintain a wife without a portion this was the remark of the moment but he afterwards considered the union of his daughter with a man of such abilities an honour to his family was reconciled and generous when the publication was advertised such was the expectation of the town that above twelve hundred names were entered in the subscription book when the prints appeared they were beheld with astonishment a subject so novel in the idea so marked with genius in the execution excited the most eager attention of the public at a time when england was coldly inattentive to every thing which related to the arts so desirous were all ranks of people of seeing how this little domestic story was delineated that there were eight piratical imitations besides two copies in a smaller size than the original published by permission of the author for thomas bakewell the whole series were copied on fanmounts representing the six plates three on one side and three on the other it was transferred from the copper to the stage in the form of a pantomime by theophilus cibber and again represented in a ballad opera entitled the jew decoyed or the harlots progress illustration the harlots progress plate 6 the funeral the lecture datur vacuum no wonder that science and learning profound in oxford and cambridge so greatly abound when so many take thither a little each day and we see very few who bring any away i was once told by a fellow of a college says mr ireland that he disliked hogarth because he had in this print ridiculed one of the universities i endeavoured to defend the artist by suggesting that this was not intended as a picture of what oxford is now but of what it was in days long past that it was that kind of general satire with which no one should be offended c c his reply was too memorable to be forgotten sir the theatre the bench the college of physicians and the foot guards are fair objects of satire but those venerable characters who have devoted their whole lives to feeding the lamp of learning with hallowed oil are too sacred to be the sport of an uneducated painter their unremitting industry embraced the whole circle of the sciences and in their logical disputations they displayed an acuteness that their followers must contemplate with astonishment the present state of oxford it is not necessary for me to analyze as you contend that the satire is not directed against that in answer to this observation which was uttered with becoming gravity a gentleman present remarked as follows for some of the ancient customs of this seminary of learning i have much respect but as to their dry treatises on logic immaterial dissertations on materiality and abstruse investigations of useless subjects they are mere literary legerdemain their disputations being usually built on an undefinable chimera are solved by a paradox instead of exercising their power of reason they exert their powers of sophistry and divide and subdivide every subject with such casuistical minuteness that those who are not convinced are almost invariably confounded this custom it must be granted is not quite so prevalent as it once was a general spirit of reform is rapidly diffusing itself and though i have heard coldblooded declaimers assert that these shades of science are become the retreats of ignorance and the haunts of dissipation i consider them as the great schools of urbanity and favourite seats of the belles lettres by the belles lettres i mean history biography and poetry that all these are universally cultivated i can exemplify by the manner in which a highly accomplished young man who is considered as a model by his fellowcollegians divides his hours at breakfast i found him studying the marvellous and eventful history of baron munchausen a work whose periods are equally free from the longwinded obscurity of tacitus and the asthmatic terseness of sallust while his hair was dressing he enlarged his imagination and improved his morals by studying doctor whats his names abridgement of chesterfields principles of politeness to furnish himself with biographical information and add to his stock of useful anecdote he studied the lives of the highwaymen in which he found many opportunities of exercising his genius and judgment in drawing parallels between the virtues and exploits of these modern worthies and those dignified and almost deified ancient heroes whose deeds are recorded in plutarch and nepos with poetical studies he is furnished by the english operas which added to the prologues epilogues and odes of the day afford him higher entertainment than he could find in homer or virgil he has not stored his memory with many epigrams but of puns has a plentiful stock and in conundra is a wholesale dealer at the same college i know a most striking contrast whose readingbut as his opponent would hear no more my advocate dropped the subject and i will follow his example it seems probable that when the artist engraved this print he had only a general reference to an university lecture the words datur vacuum were an afterthought some prints are without the inscription and in some of the early impressions it is written with a pen the scene is laid at oxford and the person reading universally admitted to be a mr fisher of jesus college registrat of the university with whose consent this portrait was taken and who lived until the 18th of march 1761 that he should wish to have such a face handed down to posterity in such company is rather extraordinary for all the band except one man have been steeped in the stream of stupidity this gentleman has the profile of penetration a projecting forehead a roman nose thin lips and a long pointed chin his eye is bent on vacancy it is evidently directed to the moonfaced idiot that crowns the pyramid at whose round head contrasted by a cornered cap he with difficulty suppresses a laugh three fellows on the right hand of this fat contented firstborn transmitter of a foolish face have most degraded characters and are much fitter for the stable than the college if they ever read it must be in brackens farriery or the country gentlemans recreation two squarecapped students a little beneath the top one of whom is holding converse with an adjoining profile and the other lifting up his eyebrows and staring without sight have the same misfortune that attended our first jamestheir tongues are rather too large a figure in the lefthand corner has shut his eyes to think and having in his attempt to separate a syllogism placed the forefinger of his right hand upon his forehead has fallen asleep the professor a little above the book endeavours by a projection of his under lip to assume importance such characters are not uncommon they are more solicitous to look wise than to be so of mr fisher it is not necessary to say much he sat for his portrait for the express purpose of having it inserted in the lecturewe want no other testimony of his talents illustration the lecture the chorus rehearsal of the oratorio of judith o cara cara silence all that train joy to great chaos let division reign the oratorio of judith mr ireland observes was written by esquire william huggins honoured by the music of william de fesch aided by new painted scenery and magnifique decoration and in the year 1733 brought upon the stage as de fesch2 was a german and a genius we may fairly presume it was well set and there was at that time as at this a sort of musical mania that paid much greater attention to sounds than to sense notwithstanding all these points in her favour when the jewish heroine had made her theatrical dbut and so effectually smote holofernes as to sever his head from his great trunk for ever and for ever the audience compelled her to make her exit to set aside this partial and unjust decree mr huggins appealed to the public and printed his oratorio though it was adorned with a frontispiece designed by hogarth and engraved by vandergucht the world could not be compelled to read and the unhappy writer had no other resource than the consolatory reflection that his work was superlatively excellent but unluckily printed in a tasteless age a comfortable and solacing selfconsciousness which hath i verily believe prevented many a great genius from becoming his own executioner to paint a sound is impossible but as far as art can go towards it hogarth has gone in this print the tenor treble and bass of these earpiercing choristers are so decisively discriminated that we all but hear them the principal figure whose head hands and feet are in equal agitation has very properly tied on his spectacles it would have been prudent to have tied on his periwig also for by the energy of his action he has shaken it from his head and absorbed in an eager attention to true time is totally unconscious of his loss a gentlemanpardon me i meant a singerin a bag wig immediately beneath his uplifted hand i suspect to be of foreign growth it has the engaging air of an importation from italy the little figure in the sinister corner is it seems intended for a mr tothall a woollendraper who lived in tavistockcourt and was hogarths intimate friend the name of the performer on his right hand whose growling bass would drown the clarion of the braying ass i cannot learn nor do i think that this group were meant for particular portraits but a general representation of the violent distortions into which these crotchetmongers draw their features on such solemn occasions even the head of the bassviol has air and character by the band under the chin it gives some idea of a professor or what is i think called a mus d the words now singing the world shall bow to the assyrian throne are extracted from mr huggins oratorio the etching is in a most masterly style and was originally given as a subscription ticket to the modern midnight conversation i have seen a small political print on sir robert walpoles administration entitled excise a new ballad opera of which this was unquestionably the basis beneath it is the following learned and poetical motto experto crede roberto mind how each hireling songster tunes his throat and the vile knight beats time to every note so nero sung while rome was all in flames but time shall brand with infamy their names footnote 2 he was a respectable performer on the violin some years chapelmaster at antwerp and several seasons leader of the band at marybone gardens he published a collection of musical compositions to which was annexed a portrait of himself characterised by three lines from milton thou honourdst verse and verse must lend her wing to honour thee the priest of phoebus quire that tunst her happiest lines in hymn or song he died in 1750 aged seventy years and gives one additional name to a catalogue i have somewhere seen of very old professors of music who saith my author generally live unto a greater age than persons in any other way of life from their souls being so attuned unto harmony that they enjoy a perpetual peace of mind it has been observed and i believe justly that thinking is a great enemy to longevity and that consequently they who think least will be likely to live longest the quantity of thought necessary to make an adept in this divine science must be determined by those who have studied itit would seem by this remark that mr ireland was not aware that to acquire proficiency in the divine science to which he so pleasantly alludes requires great application and study illustration the chorus columbus breaking the egg by the success of columbuss first voyage doubt had been changed into admiration from the honours with which he was rewarded admiration degenerated into envy to deny that his discovery carried in its train consequences infinitely more important than had resulted from any made since the creation was impossible his enemies had recourse to another expedient and boldly asserted that there was neither wisdom in the plan nor hazard in the enterprise when he was once at a spanish supper the company took this ground and being by his narrative furnished with the reflections which had induced him to undertake his voyage and the course that he had pursued in its completion sagaciously observed that it was impossible for any man a degree above an idiot to have failed of success the whole process was so obvious it must have been seen by a man who was half blind nothing could be so easy it is not difficult now i have pointed out the way was the answer of columbus but easy as it will appear when you are possessed of my method i do not believe that without such instruction any person present could place one of these eggs upright on the table the cloth knives and forks were thrown aside and two of the party placing their eggs as required kept them steady with their fingers one of them swore there could be no other way we will try said the navigator and giving an egg which he held in his hand a smart stroke upon the table it remained upright the emotions which this excited in the company are expressed in their countenances in the beruffed booby at his left hand it raises astonishment he is a dear me man of the same family with sternes simple traveller and came from amiens only yesterday the fellow behind him beating his head curses his own stupidity and the whiskered ruffian with his forefinger on the egg is in his heart cursing columbus as to the two veterans on the other side they have lived too long to be agitated with trifles he who wears a cap exclaims is this all and the other with a bald head by st jago i did not think of that in the face of columbus there is not that violent and excessive triumph which is exhibited by little characters on little occasions he is too elevated to be overbearing and pointing to the conical solution of his problematical conundrum displays a calm superiority and silent internal contempt two eels twisted round the eggs upon the dish are introduced as specimens of the line of beauty which is again displayed on the tablecloth and hinted at on the knifeblade in all these curves there is peculiar propriety for the etching was given as a receiptticket to the analysis where this favourite undulating line forms the basis of his system in the print of columbus there is evident reference to the criticisms on what hogarth called his own discovery and in truth the connoisseurs remarks on the painter were dictated by a similar spirit to those of the critics on the navigator they first asserted there was no such line and when he had proved that there was gave the honour of discovery to lomazzo michael angelo c c illustration columbus breaking the egg a midnight modern conversation think not to find one meant resemblance there we lash the vices but the persons spare prints should be prizd as authors should be read who sharply smile prevailing folly dead so rabelais laughd and so cervantes thought so nature dictated what art has taught notwithstanding this inscription which was engraved on the plate some time after its publication it is very certain that most of these figures were intended for individual portraits but mr hogarth not wishing to be considered as a personal satirist and fearful of making enemies among his contemporaries would never acknowledge who were the characters some of them the world might perhaps mistake for though the author was faithful in delineating whatever he intended to portray complete intoxication so far caricatures the countenance that according to the old though trite proverb the man is not himself his portrait though given with the utmost fidelity will scarcely be known by his most intimate friends unless they have previously seen him in this degrading disguise hence it becomes difficult to identify men whom the painter did not choose to point out at the time and a century having elapsed it becomes impossible for all who composed the group with the artist by whom it was delineated shake hands with dust and call the worm their kinsman mrs piozzi was of opinion that the divine with a corkscrew occasionally used as a tobaccostopper hanging upon his little finger was the portrait of parson ford dr johnsons uncle though upon the authority of sir john hawkins of anecdotish memory it has been generally supposed to be intended for orator henley as both these worthies were distinguished by that rubicundity of face with which it is marked the reader may decree the honour of a sitting to which he pleases the roaring bacchanalian who stands next him waving his glass in the air has pulled off his wig and in the zeal of his friendship crowns the divines head he is evidently drinking destruction to fanatics and success to mother church or a mitre to the jolly parson whom he addresses the lawyer who sits near him is a portrait of one kettleby a vociferous barorator who though an utter barrister chose to distinguish himself by wearing an enormous fullbottom wig in which he is here represented he was farther remarkable for a diabolical squint and a satanic smile a poor maudlin miserable who is addressing him when sober must be a fool but in this state it would puzzle lavater to assign him a proper class he seems endeavouring to demonstrate to the lawyer that in a poipoipoint of law he has been most cruelly cheated and lost a caucaucause that he ought to have gotand all this was owing to his attorney being an infernal villain this may very probably be true for the poor mans tears show that like the person relieved by the good samaritan he has been among thieves the barrister grins horribly at his misfortunes and tells him he is properly punished for not employing a gentleman next to him sits a gentleman in a black periwig he politely turns his back to the company that he may have the pleasure of smoking a sociable pipe the justice in fair round belly with good capon lindthe justice having hung up his hat wig and cloak puts on his nightcap and with a goblet of superior capacity before him sits in solemn cogitation his left elbow supported by the table and his right by a chair with a pipe in one hand and a stopper in the other he puffs out the bland vapour with the dignity of an alderman and fancies himself as great as jupiter seated upon the summit of mount olympus enveloped by the thick cloud which his own breath has created with folded arms and open mouth another leans back in his chair his wig is dropped from his head and he is asleep but though speechless he is sonorous for you clearly perceive that where nasal sounds are the music he is qualified to be leader of the band the fallen hero who with his chair and goblet has tumbled

fire to it the person in a bagwig and solitaire with his hand upon his head would not now pass for a fine gentleman but in the year 1735 was a complete beau unaccustomed to such joyous company he appears to have drank rather more than agrees with him the company consists of eleven and on the chimneypiece floor and table are three and twenty empty flasks these added to a bottle which the apothecary holds in his hand prove that this select society have not lost a moment the overflowing bowl full goblets and charged glasses prove that they think tis too early to part though the dial

according to the rules of heraldry and is called the undertakers arms to show us the connexion between death and the quack doctor as are also those crossbones on the outside of the escutcheon when an undertaker is in want of business he cannot better apply than to some of those gentlemen of the faculty who are for the most part so charitably disposed as to supply the necessities of these sable deathhunters and keep them from starving in a healthy time by the tenour of this piece mr hogarth would intimate the general ignorance of such of the medical tribe and teach us that they possess little more knowledge than their voluminous wigs and goldenheaded canes they are represented in deep consultation upon the contents of an urinal our artists own illustration of this coat of arms as he calls it is as follows the company of undertakers beareth sable an urinal proper between twelve quack heads of the second and twelve cane heads or consultant on a chief nebul ermine one complete

around from kentstreet end to famd st giless pound many of them are unquestionably portraits but as these grave and sage descendants of galen are long since gone to that place where they before sent their patients we are unable to ascertain any of them except the three who are for distinction placed in the chief or most honourable part of the escutcheon those who from their exalted situation we may naturally conclude the most distinguished and sagacious leeches of their day have marks too obtrusive to be mistaken he towards the dexter side of the escutcheon is determined by an eye in the head of his cane to be the allaccomplished chevalier taylor in whose marvellous and surprising history written by his own hand and published in 1761 is recorded such events relative to himself and

the german flute and hautboy and much employed as a teacher of music to each of his scholars he devoted one hour each day at nine oclock in the morning said he i once waited upon my lord spencer but

large pewter measure is placed upon a post before the door and three of a smaller size hang over the window of the house the character of the principal figure is admirably delineated she is marked with that prim and awkward formality which generally accompanies her order and is an exact type of a hard winter for every part of her dress except the flying lappets and apron ruffled by the wind is

gratifying to the public but is frequently fatal to the satirist churchill by the lines famd vinestreet where heaven the kindest wish of man to grant gave me an old house and an older aunt lost a considerable legacy and it is related that hogarth by the introduction of this withered votary of diana into this print induced her to alter a will which had been made considerably in his favour she was at first well enough satisfied with her resemblance but some designing people taught her to be angry extreme cold is very well expressed in the slipshod footboy and the girl who is warming her hands the group of which she is a part is well formed but not sufficiently balanced on the opposite side the church dial a few minutes before seven marks of little shoes and pattens in the snow and various productions of the season in the market are an additional proof of that minute accuracy with which this artist inspected and represented objects which painters in general have neglected govent garden is the scene but in the print every building is reversed this was a common error with hogarth not from his being ignorant of the use of the mirror but from his considering it as a matter of little consequence footnote 3 what signifies says some one to dr johnson giving halfpence to common beggars they only lay them out in gin or tobacco and why replied the doctor should they be denied

congregation whether male or female old or young carry the air of their country in countenance dress and deportment like the three principal figures they are all marked with some affected peculiarity affectation in a woman is supportable upon no other ground than that general indulgence we pay to the omnipotence of beauty which in a degree sanctifies whatever it adopts in a boy when we consider that the poor fellow is attempting to copy what he has been taught to believe praiseworthy we laugh at it the largest portion of ridicule falls upon his tutors but in a man it is contemptible the old fellow in a black periwig has a most vinegarlike aspect and looks with great contempt at the frippery gentlewoman immediately before him the woman with a demure countenance seems very piously

descendants by the dial of st giless church in the distance we see that it is only half past eleven at this early hour in those good times there was as much good eating as there is now at six oclock in the evening from twenty pewter measures which are hung up before the houses of different distillers it seems that good drinking was considered as equally worthy of their serious attention the dead cat and choked kennels mark the little attention shown to the streets by the scavengers of st giless at that time noxious effluvia was not peculiar to this parish the neighbourhood of fleetditch and many other parts of the city were equally polluted even at this refined period there would be some use in a more strict attention to the medical police of a city so crowded with inhabitants we

amiable pair in a few of the earliest impressions mr hogarth printed the hands of the man in blue to show that he was a dyer and the face and neck of the woman in red to intimate her extreme heat the ladys aspect lets us at once into her character we are certain that she was born to command as to her husband god made him and he must pass for a man what his wife has made him is indicated by the cows horns which are so placed as to become his own the hopes of the family with a cockade in his hat and riding upon papas cane seems much dissatisfied with female sway a face with more of the shrew in embryo than that of the girl it is scarcely possible to conceive upon such a character the most casual observer pronounces with the decision of a lavater nothing can be better imagined than the group in the alehouse they have taken a refreshing walk into the country and being determined to have a cooling pipe seat themselves in a chairlumbered closet with a low ceiling where every man pulling off his wig and throwing a pockethandkerchief over his head inhales the fumes of hot punch the smoke of half a dozen pipes and the dust from the road if this is not rural felicity what is the old gentleman in a black bagwig and the two women near him sensibly enough take their seats in the open air from a woman milking a cow we conjecture the hour to be about five in the afternoon and from the same circumstance i am inclined to think this agreeable party is going to their pastoral bower rather than returning from it the cow and dog appear as much inconvenienced by heat as any of the party the former is whisking off the flies and the latter creeps unwillingly along and casts a longing look at the crystal river in which he sees his own shadow a remarkably hot summer is intimated by the luxuriant state of a vine creeping over an alehouse window on the side of the new river where the scene is laid lies one of the wooden pipes employed in the waterworks opposite sadlers wells there

humour in some of the figures the wounded freemason who in zeal of brotherly love has drank his bumpers to the craft till he is unable to find his way home is under the guidance of a waiter this has been generally considered as intended for sir thomas de veil and from an authenticated portrait which i have seen i am says mr ireland inclined to think it is notwithstanding sir john hawkins asserts that he could discover no resemblance when the knight saw him in his magisterial capacity he was probably sober and sedate here he is represented a little disguised the british xantippe showering her favours from the window upon his head may have its source in that respect which the inmates of such houses as the rummer tavern had for a justice of peace on the resignation of mr horace walpole in february 1738 de veil was appointed inspectorgeneral of the imports and exports and was so severe against the retailers of spirituous liquors that one allen headed a gang of rioters for the purpose of pulling down his house and bringing to a summary punishment two informers who were there concealed allen was tried for this offence and acquitted upon the jurys verdict declaring him lunatic the waiter who supports his worship seems from the patch upon his forehead to have been in a recent affray but what use he can have for a lantern it is not easy to divine unless he is conducting his charge to some place where there is neither moonlight nor illumination the salisbury flying coach oversetting and broken by passing through the bonfire is said to be an intended burlesque upon a right

the twentyninth of may the anniversary of our second charless restoration that happy day when according to our old ballad the king enjoyed his own again this might be one reason for the artist choosing a scene contiguous to the beautiful equestrian statue of charles the first in the distance we see a house on fire an accident very likely to happen on such a night as this on this spot once stood the cross erected by edward the first as a memorial of affection for his beloved queen eleanor whose remains were here rested on their way to the place of sepulture it was formed from a design by cavalini and destroyed by the religious fury of the reformers in its place in the year 1678 was erected the animated equestrian statue which now remains it was cast in brass in the year 1633 by le soeur i think by order of that munificent encourager of the arts thomas howard earl of arundel the parliament ordered it to be sold and broken to pieces but john river the brazier who purchased it having more taste than his employers seeing with the prophetic eye of good sense that the powers which were would not remain rulers very long dug a hole in his garden in holborn and buried it unmutilated to prove his obedience to their order he produced to his masters several pieces of brass which he told them were parts of the statue m de archenholtz adds further that the brazier with the true spirit of trade cast a great number of handles for knives and forks and offered them for sale as composed of the brass which had formed the statue they were eagerly sought for and purchasedby the loyalists from affection to their murdered monarchby the other party as trophies of triumph the original pictures of morning and noon were sold to the duke of ancaster for fiftyseven guineas evening and night to sir william heathcote for sixtyfour guineas illustration night sigismonda let the picture rust perhaps times priceenhancing dust as statues moulder into earth when im no more may mark its worth and future connoisseurs may rise honest as ours and full as wise to puff the piece and painter too and make me then what guidos now hogarths epistle a competition with either guido or furino would to any modern painter be an enterprise of danger to hogarth it was more peculiarly so from the public justly conceiving that the representation of elevated distress was not his forte and his being surrounded by an host of foes who either dreaded satire or envied genius the connoisseurs considering the challenge as too insolent to be forgiven before his picture appeared determined to decry it the painters rejoiced in his attempting what was likely to end in disgrace and to satisfy those who had formed their ideas of sigismonda upon the inspired page of dryden was no easy task the bard has consecrated the character and his heroine glitters with a brightness that cannot be transferred to the canvass mr walpoles description though equally radiant is too various for the utmost powers of the pencil hogarths sigismonda as this gentleman poetically expresses it has none of the sober grief no dignity of suppressed anguish no involuntary tear no settled meditation on the fate she meant to meet no amorous warmth turned holy by despair in short all is wanting that should have been there all is there that such a story would have banished from a mind capable of conceiving such complicated woe woe so sternly felt and yet so tenderly this glowing picture presents to the mind a being whose contending passions may be felt but were not delineated even by corregio had his tints been aided by the grace and greatness of raphael they must have failed the author of the mysterious mother sought for sublimity where the artist strictly copied nature which was invariably his archetype but which the painter who soars into fancys fairy regions must in a degree desert considered with this reference though the picture has faults mr walpoles satire is surely too severe it is built upon a comparison with works painted in a language of which hogarth knew not the idiomtrying him before a tribunal whose authority he did not acknowledge and from the picture having been in many respects altered after the critic saw it some of the remarks become unfair to the frequency of these alterations we may attribute many of the errors the man who has not confidence in his own knowledge of the leading principles on which his work ought to be built will not render it perfect by following the advice of his friends though messrs wilkes and churchill dragged his heroine to the altar of politics and mangled her with a barbarity that can hardly be paralleled except in the history of her husbandthe artist retained his partiality which seems to have increased in exact proportion to their abuse the picture being thus contemplated through the medium of party prejudice we cannot wonder that all its imperfections were exaggerated the painted harlot of babylon had not more opprobrious epithets from the first race of reformers than the painted sigismonda of hogarth from the last race of patriots when a favourite child is chastised by his preceptor a partial mother redoubles her caresses hogarth estimating this picture by the labour he had bestowed upon it was certain that the public were prejudiced and requested if his wife survived him she would not sell it for less than five hundred pounds mrs hogarth acted in conformity to his wishes but after her death the painting was purchased by messrs boydell and exhibited in the shakspeare gallery the colouring though not brilliant is harmonious and natural the attitude drawing etc may be generally conceived by the print i am much inclined to think that if some of those who have been most severe in their censures had consulted their own feelings instead of depending upon connoisseurs poor sigismonda would have been in higher estimation it has been said that the first sketch was made from mrs hogarth at the time she was weeping over the corse of her mother hogarth once intended to have appealed from the critics fiat to the worlds opinion and employed mr basire to make an engraving which was begun but set aside for some other work and never completed illustration sigismonda with the heart of her husband martin folkes esq martin folkes was a mathematician and antiquary of much celebrity in the philosophical annals of this country he was at the early age of twentyfour admitted a member of the royal society where he was greatly distinguished two years afterwards he was chosen one of the

illhealth in the philosophical transactions are numerous memoirs of this learned man his knowledge in coins ancient and modern was very extensive and the last work he produced was concerning the english silver coin from the conquest to his own time he was president of the society of antiquaries at the time of his death which happened on the 28th of june 1754 at the age of sixtyfour a few days

actions can be clearly ascertained it is not necessary to seek the minds construction in the writings and we must regret being compelled to believe that some of mr popes actions at the same time that they prove him to be querulous and petulant lead us to suspect that he was also envious malignant and cruel how far this will tend to confirm the assertion that when a boy he was an amateur of this royal sport i do says mr ireland not pretend to decide but were a child in whom i had any interest cursed with such a propensity my first object would be to correct it if that were impracticable and

cock pit captain thomas coram captain coram was born in the year 1668 bred to the sea and passed the first part of his life as master of a vessel trading to the colonies while he resided in the vicinity of rotherhithe his avocations obliging him to go early into the city and return late he frequently saw deserted infants exposed to the inclemencies of the seasons and through the indigence or cruelty of their parents left to casual relief or untimely death this naturally excited his compassion and led him to project the establishment of an hospital for the reception of exposed and deserted young children in which humane design he laboured more than seventeen years and at last by his unwearied application obtained the royal charter bearing date the 17th of october 1739 for its incorporation he was highly instrumental in promoting another good design viz the procuring a bounty upon naval stores imported from the colonies to georgia and nova scotia but the charitable plan which he lived to make some progress in though not to complete was a scheme for uniting the indians in north america more closely with the british government by an establishment for the education of indian girls indeed he spent a great part of his life in serving the public and with so total a disregard to his private interest that in his old age he was himself supported by a pension of somewhat more than a hundred pounds a year raised for him at the solicitation of sir sampson gideon and dr brocklesby by the voluntary subscriptions of publicspirited persons at the head of whom was the prince of wales on application being made to this venerable and good old man to know whether a subscription being opened for his benefit would not offend him he gave this noble answer i have not wasted the little wealth of which i was formerly possessed in selfindulgence or vain expenses and am not ashamed to confess that in this my old age i am poor this singularly humane persevering and memorable man died at his lodgings near leicestersquare march 29 1751 and was interred pursuant to his own desire in the vault under the chapel of the foundling hospital where an historic epitaph records his virtues as hogarths portrait has preserved his honest countenance the portrait which i painted with most pleasure says hogarth and in which i particularly wished to excel was that of captain coram for the foundling hospital and if i am so wretched an artist as my enemies assert it is somewhat strange that this which was one of the first i painted the size of life should stand the test of twenty years competition and be generally thought the best portrait in the place notwithstanding the first painters in the kingdom exerted all their talents to vie with it for the portrait of mr garrick in richard iii i was paid two hundred pounds which was more than any english artist ever received for a single portrait and that too by the sanction of several painters who had been previously consulted about the price which was not given without mature consideration notwithstanding all this the current remark was that portraits were not my province and i was tempted to abandon the only lucrative branch of my art for the practice brought the whole nest of phyzmongers on my back where they buzzed like so many hornets all these people have their friends whom they incessantly teach to call my women harlots my essay on beauty borrowed and my composition and engraving contemptible this so much disgusted me that i sometimes declared i would never paint another portrait and frequently refused when applied to for i found by mortifying experience that whoever would succeed in this branch must adopt the mode recommended in one of gays fables and make divinities of all who sit to him whether or not this childish affectation will ever be done away is a doubtful question none of those who have attempted to reform it have yet succeeded nor unless portrait painters in general become more honest and their customers less vain is there much reason to expect they ever will though thus in a state of warfare with his brother artists he was occasionally gratified by the praise of men whose judgment was universally acknowledged and whose sanction became a higher honour from its being neither lightly nor indiscriminately given illustration captain thomas coram the country inn yard or the

and sickening sorrows end sunk every eye and languid every breast each wearied pilgrim sighs and sinks to rest e among the writers of english novels henry fielding holds the first rank he was the novelist of nature and has described some scenes which bear a strong resemblance to that which is here delineated the artist like the author has taken truth for his guide and given such characters as are familiar to all our minds the scene is a country inn yard at the time passengers are getting into a stagecoach and an election procession passing in the background nothing can be better described we become of the party the vulgar roar of our landlady is no less apparent than the grave insinuating imposing countenance of mine host boniface solemnly protests that a bill he is presenting to an old gentleman in a laced hat is extremely moderate this does not satisfy the paymaster whose countenance shows that he considers it as a palpable fraud though the act against bribery which he carries in his pocket designates him to be of a profession not very liable to suffer imposition they are in general less sinned against than sinning an ancient lady getting into the coach is from her breadth a very inconvenient companion in such a vehicle but to atone for her rotundity an old maid of a spare appearance and in a most grotesque habit is advancing towards the steps a portly gentleman with a sword and cane in one hand is deaf to the entreaties of a poor little deformed postilion who solicits his customary fee the old woman smoking her short pipe in the basket pays very little attention to what is passing around her cheered by the fumes of her tube she lets the vanities of the world go their own way two passengers on the roof of the coach afford a good specimen of french and english

twenty years of age when he offered himself a candidate industry and idleness as our future welfare depends in a great measure on our own conduct in the outset of life and as we derive our best expectations of success from our own attention and exertion it may with propriety be asserted that the good or illfortune of mankind is chiefly attributable to their own early diligence or sloth either of which becomes through habit in the early part of life both familiar and natural this mr hogarth has made appear in the following history of the two apprentices by representing a series of such scenes as naturally result from a course of industry or idleness and which he has illustrated with such texts of scripture as teach us their analogy with holy writ now as example is far more convincing and persuasive than precept these prints are undoubtedly an excellent lesson to such young men as are brought up to business by laying before them the inevitable destruction that awaits the slothful and the reward that generally attends the diligent both appropriately exemplified in the conduct of these two fellowprentices where the one by taking good courses and pursuing those purposes for which he was put apprentice becomes a valuable man and an ornament to his country the other by giving way to idleness naturally falls into poverty and ends fatally as shown in the last of these instructive prints in the chamber of the city of london where apprentices are bound and enrolled the twelve prints of this series are introduced and with great propriety ornament the room plate i the fellowprentices at their looms the drunkard shall come to poverty and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags proverbs chap xxiii verse 21 the hand of the diligent maketh richproverbs chap x verse 4 the first print presents us with a noble and striking contrast in two apprentices at the looms of their master a silkweaver of spitalfields in the one we observe a serene and open countenance the distinguishing mark of innocence and in the other a sullen downcast look the index of a corrupt mind and vicious heart the industrious youth is diligently employed at his work and his thoughts taken up with the business he is upon his book called the prentices guide supposed to be given him for instruction lies open beside him as if perused with care and attention the employment of the day seems his constant study and the interest of his master his continual regard we are given to understand also by the ballads of the london prentice whittingham the mayor c that hang behind him that he lays out his pence on things that may improve his mind and enlighten his understanding on the contrary his fellowprentice with wornout coat and uncombed hair overpowered with beer indicated by the halfgallon pot before him is fallen asleep and from the shuttle becoming the plaything of the wanton kitten we learn how he slumbers on inattentive alike to his own and his masters interest the ballad of moll flanders on the wall behind him shows that the bent of his mind is towards that which is bad and his book of instructions lying torn and defaced upon the ground manifests how regardless he is of any thing tending to his future welfare illustration industry and idleness plate 1 the fellow prentices at their looms plate ii the industrious prentice performing the duty of a christian o how i love thy law it is my meditation all the daypsalm cxix verse 97 this plate displays our industrious young man attending divine service in the same pew with his masters daughter where he shows every mark of decent and devout attention mr hogarths strong bias to burlesque was not to be checked by time or place it is not easy to imagine any thing more whimsically grotesque than the female falstaff a fellow near her emulating the deeptoned organ and the man beneath who though asleep joins his sonorous tones in melodious chorus with the admirers of those two preeminent poets hopkins and sternhold the pewopener is a very prominent and principal figure two old women adjoining miss wests seat are so much in shadow that we are apt to overlook them they are however all three making the dome ring with their exertions ah had it been king davids fate to hear them sing the preacher reader and clerk with many of the small figures in the gallery and beneath are truly ludicrous and we regret their being on so reduced a scale that they are scarce perceptible to the naked eye it was necessary that the artist should exhibit a crowded congregation but it must be acknowledged he has neglected the rules of perspective the print wants depth in the countenance of miss west and her lover there is a resemblance their faces have not much expression but this is atoned for by a natural and pleasing simplicity character was not necessary illustration industry and idleness plate 2 the industrious prentice performing the duty of a christian industry and idleness plate iii the idle prentice at play in the churchyard during divine service judgments are prepared for scorners and stripes for the back of fools proverbs chap xix verse 29 as a contrast to the preceding plate of the industrious young man performing the duties of a christian is this representing the idle prentice at play in the churchyard during divine service as an observance of religion is allowed to be the foundation of virtue so a neglect of religious duties has ever been acknowledged the forerunner of every wickedness the confession of malefactors at the place of execution being a melancholy confirmation of this truth here we see him while others are intent on the holy service transgressing the laws both of god and man gambling on a tombstone with the offscouring of the people the meanest of the human species shoeblacks chimneysweepers c for none but such would deign to be his companions their amusement seems to be the favourite old english game of hustlecap and our idle and unprincipled youth is endeavouring to cheat by concealing some of the halfpence under the broad brim of his hat this is perceived by the shoeblack and warmly resented by the fellow with the black patch over his eye who loudly insists on the hats being fairly removed the eager anxiety which marks these mean gamblers is equal to that of two peers playing for an estate the latter could not have more solicitude for the turn of a die which was to determine who was the proprietor of ten thousand acres than is displayed in the countenance of young idle indeed so callous is his heart so wilfully blind is he to every thing tending to his future welfare that the tombs those standing monuments of mortality cannot move him even the newdug grave the sculls and bones those lively and awakening monitors cannot rouse him from his sinful lethargy open his eyes or pierce his heart with the least reflection so hardened is he with vice and so intent on the pursuit of his evil course the hand of the boy employed upon his head and that of the shoeblack in his bosom are expressive of filth and vermin and show that our hero is within a step of being overspread with the beggarly contagion his obstinate continuance in his course until awakened by the blows of the watchful beadle point out to us that stripes are prepared for the backs of fools that disgrace and infamy are the natural attendants of the slothful and the scorner and that there are but little hopes of his alteration until he is overtaken in his iniquity by the avenging hand of omnipotence and feels with horror and amazement the unexpected and inevitable approach of death thus do the obstinate and incorrigible shut their ears against the alarming calls of providence and sin away even the possibility of salvation the figures in this print are admirably grouped and the countenances of the gamblers and beadle strikingly characteristic illustration industry and idleness plate 3 the idle prentice at play in the church yard industry and idleness plate iv the industrious prentice a favourite and intrusted by his master well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things matthew chap xxv verse 21 the industrious apprentice by a discreet and steady conduct attracts the notice of his master and becomes a favourite accordingly we behold him here exquisitely continued from the first and second prints in the countinghouse with a distant view of the looms and of the quilsters winding quills for the shuttles from whence he was removed entrusted with the books receiving and giving orders the general reward of honesty care and diligence as appears from the delivery of some stuffs by a city porter from blackwellhall by the keys in one hand and the bag in the other we are shown that he has behaved himself with so much prudence and discretion and given such proofs of fidelity as to become the keeper of untold gold the greatest mark of confidence he could be favoured with the integrity of his heart is visible in his face the modesty and tranquillity of his countenance tell us that though the great trust reposed in him is an addition to his happiness yet that he discharges his duty with such becoming diffidence and care as not to betray any of that pride which attends so great a promotion the familiar position of his master leaning on his shoulder is a further proof of his esteem declaring that he dwells as it were in his bosom and possesses the utmost share of his affection circumstances that must sweeten even a state of servitude and make a pleasant and lasting impression on the mind the headpiece to the london almanack representing industry taking time by the forelock is not the least of the beauties in this plate as it intimates the danger of delay and advises us to make the best use of time whilst we have it in our power nor will the position of the gloves on the flap of the escritoire be unobserved by a curious examiner being expressive of that union that subsists between an indulgent master and an industrious apprentice the strongbeer nose and pimpled face of the porter though they have no connexion with the moral of the piece are a fine caricatura and show that our author let slip no opportunity of ridiculing the vices and follies of the age and particularly here in laying before us the strange infatuation of this class of people who because a good deal of labour requires some extraordinary refreshment will even drink to the deprivation of their reason and the destruction of their health the surly mastiff keeping close to his master and quarrelling with the housecat for admittance though introduced to fill up the piece represents the faithfulness of these animals in general and is no mean emblem of the honesty and fidelity of the porter in this print neither the cat dog nor the porter are well drawn nor is much regard paid to perspective but the general design is carried on by such easy and natural gradations and the consequent success of an attentive conduct displayed in colours so plain and perspicuous that these little errors in execution will readily be overlooked illustration industry and idleness plate 4 the industrious prentice a favourite and entrusted by his master industry and idleness plate v the idle prentice turned away and sent to sea a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother proverbs chap x verse 1 corrupted by sloth and contaminated by evil company the idle apprentice having tired the patience of his master is sent to sea in the hope that the being removed from the vices of the town and the influence of his wicked companions joined with the hardships and perils of a seafaring life might effect that reformation of which his friends despaired while he continued on shore see him then in the ships boat accompanied by his afflicted mother making towards the vessel in which he is to embark the disposition of the different figures in the boat and the expression of their countenances tell us plainly that his evil pursuits and incorrigible wickedness are the subjects of their discourse the waterman significantly directs his attention to a figure on a gibbet as emblematical of his future fate should he not turn from the evil of his ways and the boy shows him a catoninetails expressive of the discipline that awaits him on board of ship these admonitions however he notices only by the application of his fingers to his forehead in the form of horns jestingly telling them to look at cuckolds point which they have just passed he then throws his indentures into the water with an air of contempt that proves how little he is affected by his present condition and how little he regards the persuasions and tears of a fond mother whose heart seems ready to burst with grief at the fate of her darling son and perhaps her only stay for her dress seems to intimate that she is a widow well then might solomon say that a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother for we here behold her who had often rejoiced in the prospect of her child being a prop to her in the decline of life lamenting his depravity and anticipating with horror the termination of his evil course one would naturally imagine from the common course of things that this scene would have awakened his reflection and been the means of softening the ruggedness of his dispositionthat some tender ideas would have crossed his mind and melted the obduracy of his heart but he continues hardened and callous to every admonition the group of figures composing this print has been copied by the ingenious lavater with whose appropriate remarks we conclude our present description observe says this great analyst of the human countenance in the annexed group that unnatural wretch with the infernal visage insulting his supplicating mother the predominant character on the three other villainfaces though all disfigured by effrontery is cunning and ironical malignity every face is a seal with this truth engraved on it nothing makes a man so ugly as vice nothing renders the countenance so hideous as villainy illustration industry and idleness plate 5 the idle prentice turned away and sent to sea industry and idleness plate vi the industrious prentice out of his time and married to his masters daughter the virtuous woman is a crown

circumstance is intimated was at first inscribed goodchild and west some of mr hogarths city friends informing him that it was usual for the senior partners name to precede it was altered to show that

industry and idleness plate vii the idle prentice returned from sea and in a garret with a common prostitute the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase him leviticus chap xxvi verse 26 the idle apprentice as appears by this print is advancing with rapid strides towards his fate we are to suppose him returned from sea after a long voyage and to have met with such correction abroad for his obstinacy during his absence from england that though it was found insufficient to alter his disposition yet it determined him to pursue some other way of life and what he entered on is here but too evident from the pistols by the bedside and the trinkets his companion is examining in order to strip him of to be that of the highway he is represented in a garret with a common prostitute the partaker of his infamy awaking after a night spent in robbery and plunder from one of those broken slumbers which are ever the consequences of a life of dishonesty and debauchery though the designs of providence are visible in every thing yet they are never more conspicuous than in thisthat whatever these unhappy wretches possess by wicked and illegal means they seldom comfortably enjoy in this scene we have one of the finest pictures imaginable of the horrors of a guilty conscience though the door is fastened in the strongest manner with a lock and two bolts and with the addition of some planks from the flooring so as to make his retreat as secure as possible though he has attempted to drive away thought by the powerful effects of spirituous liquors plain from the glass and bottle upon the floor still he is not able to brave out his guilt or steel his breast against reflection behold him roused by the accidental circumstance of a cats coming down the chimney and the falling of a few bricks which he believes to be the noise of his pursuers observe his starting up in bed and all the tortures of his mind imprinted in his face he first stiffens into stone then all his nerves and muscles relax a cold sweat seizes him his hair stands on end his teeth chatter and dismay and horror stalk before his eyes how different is the countenance of his wretched bedfellow in whom unconcern and indifference to every thing but the plunder are plainly apparent she is looking at an earring which with two watches an etwee and a couple of rings are spread upon the bed as part of last nights plunder the phials on the mantelpiece show that sickness and disease are ever attendant on prostitution and the beggarly appearance of the room its wretched furniture the hole by way of window by the light of which she is examining her valuable acquisition and against which she had hung her old hooppetticoat in order to keep out the cold and the rats running across the floor are just and sufficient indications that misery and want are the constant companions of a guilty life illustration industry and idleness plate 7 the idle prentice returned from sea and in the a garret with a

to honour when thou dost embrace her proverbs chap iv verse 7 8 from industry become opulent from integrity and punctuality respectable our young merchant is now sheriff of london and dining with the different companies in guildhall a group on the left side are admirably characteristic their whole souls seem absorbed in the pleasures of the table a divine true to his cloth swallows his soup with the highest got not less gratified is the gentleman palating a glass of wine the man in a black wig is a positive representative of famine and the portly and oily citizen with a napkin tucked in his buttonhole has evidently burnt his mouth by extreme eagerness the backs of those in the distance behung with bags major perukes pinners c are most laughably ludicrous every person present is so attentive to business that one may fairly conclude they live to eat rather than eat to live but though this must be admitted to be the case with this party the following instance of city temperance proves that there are some exceptions when the lord mayor sheriffs aldermen chamberlain c of the city of london were once seated round the table at a public and splendid dinner at guildhall mr chamberlain wilkes lisped out mr alderman b shall i help you to a plate of turtle or a slice of the haunchi am within reach of both sir neither one nor tother i thank you sir replied the alderman i think i shall dine on the beans and bacon which are at this end of the table mr alderman a continued the chamberlain which would you choose sir sir i will not trouble you for either for i believe i shall follow the example of my brother b and dine on beans and bacon was the reply on this second refusal the old chamberlain rose from his seat and with every mark of astonishment in his countenance curled up the corners of his mouth cast his eyes round the table and in a voice as loud and articulate as he was able called silence which being obtained he thus addressed the pretorian magistrate who sat in the chair my lord mayor the wicked have accused us of intemperance and branded us with the imputation of gluttony that they may be put to open shame and their profane tongues be from this day utterly silenced i humbly move that your lordship command the proper officer to record in our annals that two aldermen of the city of london prefer beans and bacon to either turtle soup or venison notwithstanding all this there are men who looking on the dark side and perhaps rendered splenetic and soured by not being invited to these sumptuous entertainments have affected to fear that their frequent repetition would have a tendency to produce a famine or at least to check the increase if not extirpate the species of those birds beasts and fish with which the tables of the rich are now so plentifully supplied but these half reasoners do not take into their calculation the number of gentlemen so laudably associated for encouraging cattle being fed so fat that there is no lean left or that more ancient association sanctioned and supported by severe acts of parliament for the preservation of the game from the exertions of these and similar societies we may reasonably hope there is no occasion to dread any such calamity taking place though the guildhall tables often groaning under such hecatombs as are recorded in the following account may make a man of weak nerves and strong digestion shake his head and shudder a little on the 29th october 1727 when george ii and queen caroline honoured the city with their presence at guildhall there were 19 tables covered with 1075 dishes the whole expense of this entertainment to the city was 4889l 4s to return to the printa selfsufficient and consequential beadle reading the direction of a letter to francis goodchild esq sheriff of london has all the insolence of office the important and overbearing air of this dignified personage is well contrasted by the humble simplicity of the straighthaired messenger behind the bar the gallery is well furnished with musicians busily employed in their vocation music hath charms to sooth the savage breast and therefore proper at a sheriffs feast besides a portrait of william the third and a judge the hall is ornamented with a full length of that illustrious hero sir william walworth in commemoration of whose valour the weapon with which he slew wat tyler was introduced into the city arms illustration industry and idleness plate 8 the industrious prentice grown rich and sheriff of london industry and idleness plate ix the idle prentice betrayed by a prostitute and taken in a night cellar with his accomplice the adulteress will hunt for precious life proverbs chap vi verse 26 from the picture of the reward of diligence we return to take a further view of the progress of sloth and infamy by following the idle prentice a step nearer to the approach of his unhappy end we see him in the third plate herding with the worst of the human species the very dregs of the people one of his companions at that time being a oneeyed wretch who seemed hackneyed in the ways of vice to break this vile connexion he was sent to sea but no sooner did he return than his wicked disposition took its natural course and every day he lived served only to habituate him to acts of greater criminality he presently discovered his old acquaintance who no doubt rejoiced to find him so ripe for mischief with this worthless abandoned fellow he enters into engagements of the worst kind even those of robbery and murder thus blindly will men sometimes run headlong to their own destruction about the time when these plates were first published which was in the year 1747 there was a noted house in chick lane smithfield that went by the name of the bloodbowl house so called from the numerous scenes of blood that were almost daily carried on there it being a receptacle for prostitutes and thieves where every species of delinquency was practised and where indeed there seldom passed a month without the commission of some act of murder to this subterraneous abode of iniquity it being a cellar was our hero soon introduced where he is now represented in company with his accomplice and others of the same stamp having just committed a most horrid act of barbarity that of killing a passerby and conveying him into a place under ground contrived for this purpose dividing among them the illgotten booty which consists of two watches a snuffbox and some other trinkets in the midst of this wickedness he is betrayed by his strumpet a proof of the treachery of such wretches into the hands of the high constable and his attendants who had with better success than heretofore traced him to this wretched haunt the background of this print serves rather as a representation of nightcellars in general those infamous receptacles for the dissolute and abandoned of both sexes than a further illustration of our artists chief design however as it was mr hogarths intention in the history before us to encourage virtue and expose vice by placing the one in an amiable light and exhibiting the other in its most heightened scenes of wickedness and impiety in hopes of deterring the halfdepraved youth of this metropolis from even the possibility of the commission of such actions by frightening them from these abodes of wretchedness as this was manifestly his intention it cannot be deemed a deviation from the subject by the skirmish behind the woman without a nose the scattered cards upon the floor c we are shown that drunkenness and riot disease prostitution and ruin are the dreadful attendants of sloth and the general forerunners of crimes of the deepest die and by the halter suspended from the ceiling over the head of the sleeper we are to learn two thingsthe indifference of mankind even in a state of danger and the insecurity of guilt in every situation illustration industry and idleness plate 9 the idle prentice betrayed by a prostitute industry and idleness plate x the industrious prentice alderman of london the idle one brought before him and impeached by his accomplice thou shalt do no unrighteousness in judgment leviticus chap xix verse 15 the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands psalms chap ix verse 16 imagine now this depraved and atrocious youth handcuffed and dragged from his wicked haunt through the streets to a place of security amidst the scorn and contempt of a jeering populace and thence brought before the sitting magistrate who to heighten the scene and support the contrast is supposed to be his fellowprentice now chosen an alderman in order to be dealt with according to law see him then at last having run his course of iniquity fallen into the hands of justice being betrayed by his accomplice a further proof of the perfidy of man when even partners in vice are unfaithful to each other this is the only print among the set excepting the first where the two principal characters are introduced in which mr hogarth has shown his great abilities as well in description as in a particular attention to the uniformity and connexion of the whole he is now at the bar with all the marks of guilt imprinted on his face how if his fear will permit him to reflect must he think on the happiness and exaltation of his fellowprentice on the one hand and of his own misery and degradation on the other at one instant he condemns the persuasions of his wicked companions at another his own idleness and obstinacy however deeply smitten with his crime he sues the magistrate upon his knees for mercy and pleads in his cause the former acquaintance that subsisted between them when they both dwelt beneath the same roof and served the same common master but here was no room for lenity murder was his crime and death must be his punishment the proofs are incontestable and his mittimus is ordered which the clerk is drawing out let us next turn our thoughts upon the alderman in whose breast a struggle between mercy and justice is beautifully displayed who can behold the magistrate here without praising the man how fine is the painters thoughts of reclining the head on one hand while the other is extended to express the pity and shame he feels that human nature should be so depraved it is not the golden chain or scarlet robe that constitutes the character but the feelings of the heart to show us that application for favour by the ignorant is often idly made to the servants of justice who take upon themselves on that account a certain state and consequence not inferior to magistracy the mother of our delinquent is represented in the greatest distress as making interest with the corpulent selfswoln constable who with an unfeeling concern seems to say make yourself easy for he must be hanged and to convince us that bribery will even find its way into courts of judicature here is a woman feeing the swearing clerk who has stuck his pen behind his ear that his hands might be both at liberty and how much more his attention is engaged to the money he is taking than to the administration of the oath may be known from the ignorant treacherous witness being suffered to lay his left hand upon the book strongly expressive of the sacrifice even of sacred things to the inordinate thirst of gain from newgate the prison to which he was committed where during his continuance he lay chained in a dismal cell deprived of the cheerfulness of light fed upon bread and water and left without a bed to rest on the prisoner was removed to the bar of judgment and condemned to die by the laws of his country illustration industry and idleness plate 10 the industrious prentice alderman of london the idle one impeached before him by his accomplice industry and idleness plate xi the idle prentice executed at tyburn when fear cometh as desolation and their destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress cometh upon them then shall they call upon god but he will not answer proverbs chapter i verse 7 8 thus after a life of sloth wretchedness and vice does our delinquent terminate his career behold him on the dreadful morn of execution drawn in a cart attended by the sheriffs officers on horseback with his coffin behind him through the public streets to tyburn there to receive the just reward of his crimesa shameful ignominious death the ghastly appearance of his face and the horror painted on his countenance plainly show the dreadful situation of his mind which we must imagine to be agitated with shame remorse confusion and terror the careless position of the ordinary at the coach window is intended to show how inattentive those appointed to that office are of their duty leaving it to others which is excellently expressed by the itinerant preacher in the cart instructing from a book of wesleys mr hogarth has in this print digressing from the history and moral of the piece taken an opportunity of giving us a humorous representation of an execution or a tyburn fair such days being made holidays produce scenes of the greatest riot disorder and uproar being generally attended by hardened wretches who go there not so much to reflect upon their own vices as to commit those crimes which must in time inevitably bring them to the same shameful end in confirmation of this see how earnestly one boy watches the motions of the man selling his cakes while he is picking his pocket and another waiting to receive the booty we have here interspersed before us a deal of low humour but such as is common on occasions like this in one place we observe an old bawd turning up her eyes and drinking a glass of gin the very picture of hypocrisy and a man indecently helping up a girl into the same cart in another a soldier sunk up to his knees in a bog and two boys laughing at him are well imagined here we see one almost squeezed to death among the horses there another trampled on by the mob in one part is a girl tearing the face of a boy for oversetting her barrow in another a woman beating a fellow for throwing down her child here we see a man flinging a dog among the crowd by the tail there a woman crying the dying speech of thomas idle printed the day before his execution and many other things too minute to be pointed out two however we must not omit taking notice of one of which is the letting off a pigeon bred at the gaol fly from the gallery which hastes directly home an old custom to give an early notice to the keeper and others of the turning off or death of the criminal and that of the executioner smoking his pipe at the top of the gallows whose position of indifference betrays an unconcern that nothing can reconcile with the shocking spectacle but that of use having rendered his wretched office familiar to him whilst it declares a truth which every character in this plate seems to confirm that a sad and distressful object loses its power of affecting by being frequently seen illustration industry and idleness plate 11 the idle prentice executed at tyburn industry and idleness plate xii the industrious prentice lord mayor of london length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honour proverbs chap iii ver 16 having seen the ignominious end of the idle apprentice nothing remains but to represent the completion of the others happiness who is now exalted to the highest honour that of lord mayor of london the greatest reward that ancient and noble city can bestow on diligence and integrity our artist has here as in the last plate given a loose to his humour in representing more of the low part of the lord mayors show than the magnificent yet the honour done the city by the presence of the prince and princess of wales is not forgotten the variety of comic characters in this print serves to show what generally passes on such public processions as these when the people collect to gratify their childish curiosity and indulge their wanton disposition or natural love of riot the front of this plate exhibits the oversetting of a board on which some girls had stood and represents them sprawling upon the ground on the left at the back of the scaffold is a fellow saluting a fair nymph and another enjoying the joke near him is a blind man straggled in among the crowd and joining in the general halloo before him is a militiaman so completely intoxicated as not to know what he is doing a figure of infinite humour though mr hogarth has here marked out two or three particular things yet his chief intention was to ridicule the city militia which was at this period composed of undisciplined men of all ages sizes and height some fat some lean some tall some short some crooked some lame and in general so unused to muskets that they knew not how to carry them one we observe is firing his piece and turning his head another way at whom the man above is laughing and at which the child is frightened the boy on the right crying a full and true account of the ghost of thomas idle which is supposed to have appeared to the mayor preserves the connexion of the whole work the most obtrusive figure in his lordships coach is mr swordbearer in a cap like a reversed saucepan which this great officer wears on these grand occasions the company of journeymen butchers with their marrowbones and cleavers appear to be the most active and are by far the most noisy of any who grace this solemnity numberless spectators upon every house and at every window dart their desiring eyes on the procession so great indeed was the interest taken by the good citizens of london in these civic processions that formerly it was usual in a london lease to insert a clause giving a right to the landlord and his friends to stand in the balcony during the time of the shows or pastimes upon the day commonly called the lord mayors day thus have we seen by a series of events the prosperity of the one and the downfall of the other the riches and honour that crown the head of industry and the ignominy and destruction that await the slothful after this it would be unnecessary to say which is the most eligible path to tread lay the roads but open to the view and the traveller will take the right of course give but the boy this history to peruse and his future welfare is almost certain illustration industry and idleness plate 12 the industrious prentice lord mayor of london southwark fair the subject of the plate under consideration is that of the borough fair a fair held some time since in the borough of southwark though now suppressed this fair was attended generally by the inhabitants of town and country and therefore was one that afforded great variety especially as before its suppression it was devoted to every thing loose and irregular a view of the scene of which the following print is a faithful representation will affirm this truth the principal view upon the left represents the fall of a scaffold on which was assembled a strolling company pointed out by the paper lantern hanging in front to be that belonging to cibber and bullock ready dressed to exhibit the fall of bajazet here we see merryandrews monkeys queens and emperors sinking in one general confusion and that the crash may appear the greater the stand beneath is humorously supposed to consist of earthenware and china notwithstanding this fatal overthrow few below are seen to notice it witness the boys and woman gambling at the box and dice the upright monkey and the little bagpiper dancing his wooden figures above this scaffold hangs a painting the subject of which is the stage mutiny whose figures are as followon one side is pistol strutting and crying out pistols alive falstaff justice shallow and many other characters of shakspeare on the other the manager bearing in his hand a paper on which is written it cost 6000l a scenepainter who has laid his brushes aside and taken up a cudgel and a woman holding an ensign bearing the words well starve em out in the corner is a man quiet and snug hugging a bag of money laughing at the folly of the rest and behind a monkey perched upon a sign iron supposed to be that of the rose tavern in drurylane squeaking out i am a gentleman these paintings are in general designed to show what is exhibited within but this alludes to a dispute that arose at the time when this print was published which was in the year 1733 between the players and the patentee of drurylane theatre when young cibber the son of the laureate was at the head of the faction above on one side is an equilibrist swinging on a slack rope and on the other a man flying from the tower to the ground by means of a groove fastened to his breast slipping over a line strained from one place to the other at the back of this plate is lee and harpers great booth where by the picture of the wooden horse we are told is represented the siege of troy the next paintings consist of the fall of adam and eve and a scene in punchs opera beneath is a mountebank exalted on a stage eating fire to attract the public attention while his merryandrew behind is distributing his medicines further back is a shift and hat carried upon poles designed as prizes for the best runner or wrestler in front is a group of strollers parading the fair in order to collect an audience for their next exhibition in which is a female drummer at that time well known and remarked for her beauty which we observe has caught the eye of two countrymen the one old the other young behind these men is a buskined hero beset by a marshalsea court officer and his follower to the right is a savoyard exhibiting her farthing show and behind a player at back sword riding a blind horse round the fair triumphantly in all the boast of selfimportant heroism affecting terror in his countenance glorying in his scars and challenging the world to open combat a folly for which the english were remarkable to this man a fellow is directing the attention of a country gentleman while he robs him of his handkerchief next him is an artful villain decoying a couple of unthinking country girls to their ruin further back is a man kissing a wench in the crowd and above a juggler performing some dexterity of hand indeed it would be tedious to enter into an enumeration of the various matter of this plate it is sufficient to remark that it presents us with an endless collection of spirited and laughable characters in which is strikingly portrayed the character of the times illustration southwark fair garrick in the character of richard iii give me another horsebind up my wounds have mercy jesusoft i did but dream o coward conscience how dost thou afflict me the lights burn blueis it not dead midnight cold fearful drops hang on my trembling flesh such is the exclamation of richard and such is the disposition of his mind at the moment of this delineation the lamp diffusing a dim religious light through the tent the crucifix placed at his head the crown and unsheathed sword at his hand and the armour lying on the ground are judicious and appropriate accompaniments those who are acquainted with this princes history need not be told that he was naturally bold courageous and enterprising that when business called him to the field he shook off every degree of indulgence and applied his mind to the management of his affairs this may account for his being stripped no otherwise than of his armour having retired to his tent in order to repose himself upon his bed and lessen the fatigues of the preceding day see him then hastily rising at dead of night in the utmost horror from his own thoughts being terrified in his sleep by the dreadful phantoms of an affrighted imagination seizing on his sword by way of defence against the foe his disordered fancy presents to him so great is his agitation that every nerve and muscle is in action and even the ring is forced from his finger when the heart is affected how great is its influence on the human frameit communicates its sensibility to the extreme parts of the body from the centre to the circumference as distant water is put in motion by circles spreading from the place of its disturbance the paper on the floor containing these words jockey of norfolk be not so bold for dicken thy master is bought and is sold brought him by the duke of norfolk saying he found it in his tent and lying here unattended to as a mark of contempt plainly informs us that however a man may attempt to steel himself against the arrows of conscience still they will find a way to his breast and shake the sinner even in his greatest security and indeed we cannot wonder when we reflect on the many murders he was guilty of deserving the severest punishment for providence has wisely ordained that sin should be its own tormentor otherwise in many cases the offender would in this life escape unpunished and the design of heaven be frustrated but richard though he reached a throne and by that means was exempt from the sufferings of the subject yet could not divest himself of his nature but was forced to give way to the workings of the heart and bear the tortures of a distracted mind the expression in his face is a masterpiece of execution and was a great compliment paid by mr hogarth to his friend garrick yet not unmerited as all that have seen him in the part must acknowledge the greatness of the actor the figures in the distance two of whom like sacrifices by their fires of watch with patience sit and inly ruminate the mornings danger are properly introduced and highly descriptive the tents of richmond are so near that the fixd sentinels almost receive the secret whispers of each others watch considered as a whole the composition is simple striking and original and the figures well drawn the whole moral tenour of the piece informs us that conscience is armed with a thousand stings from which royalty itself is not secure that of all tormentors reflection is the worst that crowns and sceptres are baubles compared with selfapprobation and that nought is productive of solid happiness but inward peace and serenity of mind illustration garrick in the character of richard the third the invasion or france and england in the two following designs mr hogarth has displayed that partiality for his own country and contempt for france which formed a strong trait in his character he neither forgot nor forgave the insults he suffered at calais though he did not recollect that this treatment originated in his own ill humour which threw a sombre shade over every object that presented itself having early imbibed the vulgar prejudice that one englishman was a match for four frenchmen he thought it would be doing his country a service to prove the position how far it is either useful or politic to depreciate the power or degrade the character of that people with whom we are to contend is a question which does not come within the plan of this work in some cases it may create confidence but in others lead to the indulgence of that negligent security by which armies have been slaughtered provinces depopulated and kingdoms changed their rulers plate i france with lantern jaws and croaking gut see how the halfstard frenchmen strut and call us english dogs but soon well teach these bragging foes that beef and beer give heavier blows than soup and roasted frogs the priests inflamd with righteous hopes prepare their axes wheels and ropes to bend the stiffneckd sinner but should they sink in coming over old nick may fish twixt france and dover and catch a glorious dinner the scenes of all mr hogarths prints except the gate of calais and that now under consideration are laid in england in this having quitted his own country he seems to think himself out of the reach of the critics and in delineating a frenchman at liberty to depart from nature and sport in the fairy regions of caricature were these gallic soldiers naked each of them would appear like a forked radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife so forlorn that to any thick sight he would be invisible to see this miserable woebegone refuse of the army who look like a group detached from the main body and put on the sick list embarking to conquer a neighbouring kingdom is ridiculous enough and at the time of publication must have had great effect the artist seemed sensible that it was necessary to account for the unsubstantial appearance of these shadows of men and has hinted at their want of solid food in the bare bones of beef hung up in the window the inscription on the alehouse sign soup maigre au sabot royal and the spiderlike officer roasting four frogs which he has impaled upon his sword such light and airy diet is whimsically opposed by the motto on the standard which two of the most valorous of this ghastly troop are hailing with grim delight and loud exultation it is indeed an attractive motto and well calculated to inspire this famishing company with couragevengeance avec la bonne bire et bon boeuf dangleterre however meagre the military the church militant is in no danger of starving the portly friar is neither emaciated by fasting nor weakened by penance anticipating the glory of extirpating heresy he is feeling the sharp edge of an axe to be employed in the decollation of the enemies to the true faith a sledge is laden with whips wheels ropes chains gibbets and other inquisitorial engines of torture which are admirably calculated for the propagation of a religion that was established in meekness and mercy and inculcates universal charity and forbearance on the same sledge is an image of st anthony accompanied by his pig and the plan of a monastery to be built at black friars in the background are a troop of soldiers so averse to this english expedition that their serjeant is obliged to goad them forward with his halberd to intimate that agriculture suffers by the invasion having engaged the masculine inhabitants two women ploughing a sterile promontory in the distance complete this catalogue of wretchedness misery and famine illustration france the invasion plate ii england see john the soldier

regions of france our scene changes to the fertile fields of england england bound in with the triumphant sea whose rocky shores beat back the envious siege of watry neptune instead of the forlorn and famished party who were represented in the last plate we here see a company of wellfed and highspirited britons marked with all the hardihood of ancient times and eager to defend their country in the first group a young peasant who aspires to a niche in the temple of fame preferring the service of mars to that of ceres and the dignified appellation of soldier to the plebeian name of farmer offers to enlist standing with his back against the halberd to ascertain his height and finding he is rather under the mark he endeavours to reach it by rising on tiptoe this artifice to which he is impelled by towering ambition the serjeant seems disposed to connive atand the serjeant is a hero and a great man in his way your hero always must be tall you know to evince that the polite arts were then in a flourishing state and cultivated by more than the immediate professors a gentleman artist who to common eyes must pass for a grenadier is making a caricature of le grand monarque with a label from his mouth worthy the speaker and worthy observation you take a my fine ships you be de pirate you be de teef me send my grand armies and hang you all the action is suited to the word for with his left hand this most christian potentate grasps his sword and in his right poises a gibbet the figure and motto united produce a roar of approbation from the soldier and sailor who are criticising the work it is so natural that the helen and briseis of the camp contemplate the performance with apparent delight and while one of them with her apron measures the breadth of this herculean painters shoulders the other to show that the performance has some point places her forefinger against the prongs of a fork the little fifer playing that animated and inspiring tune god save the king is an old acquaintance we recollect him in the march to finchley in the background is a serjeant teaching a company of young recruits their manual exercise this military meeting is held at the sign of the gallant duke of cumberland who is mounted upon a prancing charger as if an angel droppd down from the clouds to turn and wield a fiery pegasus and witch the world with noble horsemanship underneath is inscribed roast and boiled every day which with the beef and beverage upon the table forms a fine contrast to the soup maigre bare bones and roasted frogs in the last print the bottle painted on the wall foaming with liquor which impatient of imprisonment has burst its cerements must be an irresistible invitation to a thirsty traveller the soldiers sword laid upon the round of beef and the sailors pistol on the vessel containing the ale intimate that these great bulwarks of our island are as tenacious of their beef and beer as of their religion and liberty these two plates were
