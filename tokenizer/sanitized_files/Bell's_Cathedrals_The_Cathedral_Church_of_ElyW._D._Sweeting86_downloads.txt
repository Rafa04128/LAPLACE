the isle of elywhich now includes the whole of the northern part of cambridgeshire above the river ouse together with a few parishes east of that river that are in the countyis spoken of at the time of the marriage of the princess as if it were a district well known and perhaps of some importance as it was assigned to her as a dowry some writers have held that the expression the isle of ely applied only to the rising ground on which the city now stands and to its immediate neighbourhood if this were ever the case the name was soon used for a larger district in the liber eliensis the limits of the isle are given as seven miles in length by four in breadth while the extent of the two hundreds belonging to ely reaches from tydd to upware and from bishops delf to peterborough we have many examples of large inland districts where a series of rivers has happened to isolate them being known as isles the isles of athelney axholme purbeck thanet are familiar instances perhaps the town is more likely to take its name from the district than the district from the town it will be seen that in none of the examples just given is the name derived from a town we have the authority of bede for the statement that ely elge was a region containing about six hundred families like an island in similitudinem insul and surrounded by marshes or waters when told that ely means the island of eels many persons suppose this to be a fanciful etymology and smile at the idea but the best authorities are agreed that this is the true derivation of the name1 a suggestion that the willowtrees so abundant in the region gave the name celtic helyg has met with some support a third suggestion that the word comes from the greek for a marsh hardly deserves mention the saxon word for eel was apparently pronounced exactly as the modern word bede gives this etymology a copia anguillarum qu in iisdem paludibus capiuntur nomen accepit william of malmesbury in his gesta pontificum 1125 takes the same view the liber eliensis of about the same date also adopts it milton may not be regarded as a great authority upon such a question he writes however as considering the matter settled in his latin poem on the death of bishop felton of ely who died in 1626 he says that fame with her hundred tongues ever a true messenger of evil and disaster has spread the report of the bishops death cessisse morti et ferreis sororibus te generis humani decus qui rex sacrorum fuisti in insul qu nomen anguill tenet that ely should mean isle of eels and that the expression isle of ely is consequently redundant is no argument against this view the isle of athelney beyond all question means the isle of the thelings isle compare also a remarkable instance of redundancy in the name of the isle of axholme this name says canon taylor shows that it has been an island during the time of the celts saxons danes and english the first syllable ax is the celtic word for the water by which it was surrounded the anglosaxons added their word for island to the celtic name and called it axey a neighbouring village still goes by the name of haxey the danes added holmthe danish word for islandto the saxon name and modern english influences have corrupted axeyholme into axelholme and contracted it into axholme and have finally prefixed the english word isle2 the north girvii and the south girvii were two peoples that formed districts of the east anglian kingdom in the early part of the seventh century anna was king of the east angles and etheldreda his daughter was born at exning near newmarketa suffolk parish but detached from the main county and entirely surrounded by cambridgeshireabout the year 630 when quite young there were many suitors for her hand but she was altogether unwilling to accept any one of them but the king her father had so high an opinion of tonbertone of the noblemen of his court who was alderman or as some render it prince of the south girviithat he prevailed upon his daughter to be married to him and the marriage took place in 652 two years before annas death from her husband etheldreda received the isle of elythat is the whole of the region of the south girviias a marriage settlement insulam elge ab eodem sponso ejus accepit in dotem it is clear therefore that tonbert was something more than an officer of the kings if he had the power of assigning such a district to his wife tonbert only lived for three years after his marriage and at his death his widow came into possession of the isle of ely according to the terms of her marriage settlement she resided within it and gave herself up entirely to works of religion and devotion entrusting the civil government of her territory to ovin her reputation for piety was spread far and wide and attracted the attention of egfrid son of oswy king of northumberland who sought her hand in marriage but no attraction he could offer could persuade the princess to change her state until her uncle ethelwold who was now king of east anglia overcame her scruples the disturbed state of his kingdom and the importance of an alliance with so powerful a house as that of oswy are believed to have influenced ethelwold to urge his niece to give her consent to the proposed marriage and the marriage took place at york it is constantly affirmed by all historians that in neither of these marriages did the married couple live together as man and wife at the northumbrian court etheldreda lived for twelve years her husband meanwhile in 670 having become king he had been for some years previously associated with his father in the government the queen however became more and more wearied of the glories of her royal position and tired out her husband with persistent entreaties that she might be permitted to withdraw herself altogether from his court and devote herself entirely to the religious life at last she obtained his reluctant consent and betook herself to coldingham where ebba the kings aunt was abbess and was there admitted into the order of nuns at the hands of wilfrid archbishop of york this ebba was afterwards canonised and her name is preserved in the name of the promontory on the coast of berwickshire known as s abbs head after remaining about a year at coldingham the queen found it necessary to move away the king began to regret the permission he had given her and following the advice of some of his courtiers made his way to the religious house where etheldreda was settled with the intention of forcibly compelling her return to his court his intention having become known to the abbess she recommended the queen to escape at once to her own territory the isle of ely the queen immediately followed this advice egfrid arrived at coldingham very soon after her departure and set off in pursuit no reason for her leaving coldingham is given by bede but a lengthy account of the journey and its occasion is given in the liber eliensis in the remarkable sculptures on the corbels in the octagon are representations of two scenes that are unintelligible without this account it is necessary therefore to summarise it here directly after setting out from coldingham which is some ten miles north of the tweed not far from the sea the queen with two lady companions sewenna and sewara reached a rocky eminence on the coast where the king in pursuit came up with them but he was prevented from coming near them by a sudden and unusual inundation of water from the sea which surrounded the hill and continued in that state several days without retiring into its former channel amazed at the strangeness of this appearance the king presently interpreted it as the interposition of heaven in her favour and concluded that it was not the will of god that he should have her again and this occasioned his retiring to york again leaving the queen quietly to pursue her journey3 after the king had abandoned his intention of reclaiming his wife the three ladies proceeded southwards and crossed the humber and so through winteringham and alftham where she stayed a few days and where she is said to have built a church this can only mean that she arranged for its building or undertook the cost at west halton the next village to winteringham as bentham has observed the church is dedicated to s etheldreda and this place may be identified with the alftham of the chronicler the party had now assumed the dress of pilgrims and went by unfrequented roads so as to escape observation at one point of their journey a second miraculous event is recorded the queen had lain down to sleep while her attendants kept watch and had stuck her pilgrims staff in the ground when she awoke this staff was found to have taken root and already to have brought forth leaves it was left standing and grew into a flourishing tree and the place from the circumstance was named etheldredesstow4 a church was afterwards built and dedicated to s etheldreda in course of time the three pilgrims arrived safely at their destination wilfrid the archbishop soon joined them he had lost favour with king egfrid being supposed to have influenced the queen in her decision to take the veil the king regarding his marriage with etheldreda as being de facto dissolved took another wife who was for various reasons much opposed to wilfrid the archbishop also greatly resented the action of the king and archbishop theodore in dividing his diocese without his consent into four different sees and he was at one time banished and at another imprisoned etheldreda now set to work in earnest to establish a religious house her buildings were begun in 673 this year is accordingly taken as the date of the foundation of the monastery and of the town itself king ethelbert is indeed said to have built a church a short distance from the site of the present cathedral at a place called cratendune5 but there is much uncertainty as to the fact and some considerable difficulties in reconciling the different references to it it is stated that this church had but a short existence being destroyed by penda king of mercia this ethelbert was the bretwalda king of kent husband of the christian queen bertha after his conversion he was instrumental in furthering the spread of christianity among the east saxons and also apparently in east anglia one of the east anglian kings redwald having but only for a time given his adherence to the christian religion as the building of this church near ely is stated to have been undertaken on the advice of augustine who died in 604 we have an approximate date for it since augustine only arrived in england in 597 whether this church was so built by ethelbert or not it seems clear there was some church in a state of partial decay standing in 673 because it is recorded that at first etheldreda designed to restore it and to make it the centre of her religious work but the present site was judged to be more suitable and there she began to build the few remaining inhabitants of cratendune soon abandoned their dwellings and came to live near the rising buildings of the monastery upon the death of king anna who fell in battle against penda king of the mercians he was succeeded in turn by his brothers adelbert and ethelwold and the kingdom then went to adulphus annas son and etheldredas brother he greatly assisted his sister in raising the buildings of her monastery contributing considerably to the cost but the plans and arrangements are thought to have been designed by wilfrid who is known to have spent much time at ely it was he who gave his benediction when etheldreda was formally instituted as abbess and who admitted the earliest members of the house as was not unusual the society included monks as well as nuns in later times the benedictine rule was adopted in the very year of the foundation possibly on account of its royal foundress and the support of the king her brother the special privilege of exemption from interference either by king or bishop was assigned to it in a national assembly this at least seems to be the meaning of the decree as given in liber eliensis that with respect to the isle of ely now dedicated to gods service non de rege nec de episcopo libertas loci diminueretur vel in posterum confringeretur to endow and provide for her monastery the foundress assigned her entire principality of the isle in this way the temporal power which was afterwards so peculiar a feature in the privileges of the bishops was acquired in about five years wilfrid went to rome to obtain the papal confirmation of the grants and liberties of the new foundation but etheldreda did not live to see his return she died of some contagious disease june 23 679 in the seventh year after she had become abbess she was buried by her own directions not in the church but in the nuns graveyard she was certainly not fifty years of age at the time of her death as will be seen hereafter her body was removed into the church in the time of her successor no description is extant of the buildings of the monastery first erected we know that the present cathedral is on the same site nor has any record been preserved of any discoveries that may have been made in later times when extensive operations must have necessitated the laying bare of some of the original foundations from what is known of some contemporary monasteries we may conclude that the church at least was of stone not a fragment of it is known to be in existence at the present day whatever may have been its extent it was wholly destroyed by the danes in 870 for four years the danes had been ravaging the eastern part of the country burning monasteries and slaying their inmates in the immediate district crowland and thorney medeshamstede peterborough and ramsey had already felt the severity of their attack crumbling walls alone remained where their destructive violence had been experienced on their first attack on ely they were repulsed the advantages of the situation among the fens had already suggested the formation of something very similar to the famous camp of refuge in the eleventh century and the force thus collected was sufficient to drive the danes to their ships but before long they returned with greater numbers headed by one of their kings most likely hubba and altogether overcame the resistance of the people of the isle the conquerors then marched directly to the monastery of s etheldreda at ely broke their way into it and put all the religious to the sword as well the nuns as the monks and others belonging to it without any respect to age sex or condition and after they had stript the monastery of every thing that was valuable and plundered the town they set fire to the church and all the buildings and houses and went away loaded with the spoils not only of the town and monastery of ely but likewise the chief effects and riches of the country round about which the inhabitants of those parts had brought with them as to a place of security6 the destruction of ely monastery in 870 and its resuscitation by king edgar in 970 are an almost exact repetition of what took place at peterborough but there is a difference in the history of the interval in the case of peterborough as far as is known the ruin was complete and not the smallest attempt was made for a hundred years either to restore the buildings or to revive the society but at ely though the destruction was hardly less complete we read that within a few years eight of the inmates of the monastery who had escaped when the place was burnt came back and to a certain extent continued the establishment they effected a partial restoration of a small portion of the church and performed divine service it is said that king alfred who succeeded in expelling the danes acquiesced in these clerks thus taking possession of the place although the former king of mercia finding the monasteries deserted had annexed all their property it does not appear certain whether these clerks were actual monks of the old monastery or clergy of the place but the new society thus inaugurated was like a college of secular clergy they were so far recognised as a settled establishment that new endowments were acquired from various benefactors the latter part of the tenth century was a time of great activity in founding monasteries and in restoring those that had fallen into decay edgar the king dunstan archbishop of canterbury and ethelwold bishop of winchester were all enthusiastic in the work the advancement of the monastic system was the great object they all had at heart application was made to the king by two nobles about his court both foreigners for a grant of the isle of ely lately the possession of the monastery it does not appear what services either had rendered to warrant the application the sheriff of the county however interfered to prevent any such grant being made he represented to the king the true state of affairsin what way the isle of ely had become the property of the monastery how all had been lost after the danish invasion and in what a lamentable condition the place was at the time although the remains of the sainted abbesses were still on the spot the king immediately saw here a new opportunity of furthering his religious work committing the details to bishop ethelwold he authorised him to repair the church provide fresh monks but no nuns make arrangements for divine service and supply new buildings for the new inmates at the same time the king undertook to provide lands and revenues for the support of the monastery when the bishop had discharged his commission he obtained from the king a new grant of the whole of the isle of ely for the restored monastery the charter of king edgar is printed in the appendix to benthams history and antiquities the king describes himself as basileus dilecte insule albionis and as desirous of shewing his gratitude for the peace secured after conquering the scots cambrians and britons by restoring decayed monasteries and establishing them under the benedictine rule and in particular he desires to honour the monastery in the region of ely elig anciently dedicated to s peter rendered famous by the relics and miracles of the renowned virgin etheldreda who with body uncorrupted lasts even to this day in a white marble mausoleum he appoints brithnoth first abbot and assigns certain lands and revenues including ten thousand eels due to him as king for the maintenance of the monastery to signify the public character of the grant it is stated in the attestation clause that it is made not in a corner but in the open non clam in angulo sed sub divo palam evidentissime the charter is signed by the king two archbishops twelve bishops the queen eleven abbots nine dukes duces and fortyone knights this was in the year 970 as has been said the old establishment had given place to a company of secular clergy these were dispossessed by bishop ethelwold unless any chose to attach themselves to the new foundation upon the constitution of the benedictine house but during the century that had elapsed since the danes evicted the monks these clergy must have been careful custodians of the church and buildings most likely restoring by degrees and erecting fresh accommodation as their means permitted for there is no account of any considerable rebuilding by bishop ethelwold repairs and enlargement and decorations were necessary but the bishop probably found everything nearly ready to his hands and he was not required to undertake anything so extensive as had to be done under similar circumstances at peterborough everything was duly prepared for the new monastery by the feast of the purification 970 and on that day the church and buildings some partly restored and some newly erected were consecrated by archbishop dunstan during the time of elsin the second abbot 9811016 some considerable improvements were effected by leofwin of whom more will be told in a later chapter in the church he rebuilt and enlarged the south aisle joining it to the rest of the building in one of its porches or sidechapels in uno porticu he built an altar to the virgin mary erecting over it a stately image of gold and silver adorned with valuable jewels it is probable that this chapel and the one that possibly replaced it when the present cathedral was built may have been colloquially known as the ladychapel for it is sometimes said that a ladychapel was in existence before the fourteenth century but there was nothing about it of the dignity and importance usually associated with the name although the isle of ely plays so important a part in the history of the norman conquest and was the scene of the last great stand made against the conqueror neither the party of hereward and the camp of refuge nor the forces of the king did any material damage to the buildings of the monastery its affairs were indeed brought to confusion as the monks had sided with hereward and the conqueror gave orders for the plunder of all the goods of the monastery but the monks purchased from the king his forgiveness and the liberty of the place and the restoration of what property had been taken away for the sum of a thousand marks to raise this amount they had to sell almost everything in the church of gold and silver and the liber eliensis enumerates among precious objects thus alienated crosses altars shrines texts chalices patens basins brackets pipes fistulas cups salvers and the image of the virgin seated with her son on a throne which abbot elsin had wrought of gold and silver it is true that most if not all of these were recovered in about ten years for it is on record that the norman abbot theodwin refused to accept the abbacy until the king would restore what had been taken away this seems to refer to the goods sold to raise the money demanded as the price of his forgiveness when the building of the existing cathedral was commenced there was not the same necessity as existed in many other cases there was no ruin to be rendered serviceable a church was actually standing and in constant use it must therefore have been felt that the importance and wealth of the foundation demanded a more magnificent minster when simeon the ninth abbot 10811093 was appointed he found the property of the abbey still in an unsatisfactory state lands really belonging to it were in many instances held by powerful persons who under various pretences defied the rights of the religious house so the abbots first work was to recover these by help of the kings commission he was entirely successful but while inquiries were being instituted and proceedings for recovery were being taken he conceived the design of erecting a very noble church and set about laying the foundations of it he could not from his great age have hoped to see much progress made but he did live to see a very considerable portion completed he devoted a great part of his private fortune which was large to the work he began with the transepts this is in itself sufficient to shew that there was a choir in use the regular practice when a wholly new church was to be built was to commence at the east end the lower part of both transepts is simeons work it is of plain early norman character and represents all that is now in existence of what he erected from a slight increase in ornamentation in the capitals in the north transept we infer that the actual commencement was made in the south transept of course these transepts were of four baysnot as at present of three onlythe bay in each case nearest the central tower having been destroyed when the tower fell that tower was of norman date and is sometimes spoken of as simeons tower but he cannot have built the whole of it if he raised it as high as the great supporting arches which is of course possible there must have been also supports in all the four adjacent portions of the church reaching almost to the summit of the arches so that he would have had to build at least one bay of the triforium and clerestory stages if he did so all such work perished with the fall of the tower it is more probable that he raised the piers of the tower arches only a few feet higher than the main arcade of the transepts abbot simeons successor richard 11001107 proceeded with the building no abbot had been appointed by william ii and the works had consequently been suspended for seven years notwithstanding many troubles and distractions he was actually deposed at a council at westminster in 1102 though restored by papal bull in the next year abbot richard made great advance in the building of the church he was only abbot for seven years by 1106 he had finished the east end which may have terminated in an apse as at peterborough and possibly the tower on october 17 in that year the remains of saints etheldreda sexburga ermenilda and withburga were solemnly removed to the new choir and reinterred in front of the high altar for some reason not explained there was no such attendance of high ecclesiastical dignitaries as was usual on such occasions the bishop of norwich four abbots and one archdeacon were all that could be found to attend the translation the account is noteworthy because it describes the orderly processions from the old church and the taking the bodies thence one at a time with singing and praise into the new church we are not to conclude from this that the former church was on a different site the new buildings were apparently quite close to the former and possibly some part of the old church had already been pulled down as the new choir was being built and the completion of the aisles of the choir would necessitate the pulling down of the remainder but the remains of the foundress and others must first be removed to their new restingplace both simeon and richard while urging on the church building were by no means regardless of the domestic buildings of the monastery these were being enlarged and improved at the same time two bays of the nave next to the tower were also the work of abbot richard two years after the death of abbot richard the bishopric was constituted the bishop henceforward was the abbot of the house though the superintendence of the domestic concerns of the monastery devolved upon the prior until 1198 the bishops appointed the priors but afterwards they were elected by the monks there was naturally some difficulty in dividing fairly between the bishop and the monastery the peculiar rights which were attached to the government of the isle of ely but all was amicably arranged as part of the arrangement the bishops were discharged from all obligation to repair or sustain the fabric of the church but numbers of the bishops did contribute largely to its building and embellishments and henceforward the works carried on are assigned to the bishops holding office at the time by degrees during the twelfth century the building of the nave advanced for upwards of sixty years we find no record in the chronicles of any specific work done at any particular time when we come to bishop riddell 11741189 we read that he carried on the new work and tower at the westend of the church almost to the top how high this tower was we cannot tell it was probably surmounted by a pyramid a later bishop northwold 12291254 removed the original capping and built the existing early english stage so we conclude from the words ipse construxit de novo turrim ligneam versus galileam ab opere cementario usque ad summitatem the first three bishops ruled for a period of eighty years this seems too long a time to assign for the building of the nave because there is so little difference in detail as we examine the work from east to west and even when later work in a large building is purposely made to assimilate to what had been built some years before the experienced eye can usually discover slight variations in mouldings or ornamentation which indicate something of a new fashion in architecture here we detect nothing of the sort we can well understand how much reason there was at ely why building work should have been in the twelfth century intermittent the troublous times of henry i and stephen were specially unfavourable to this place bishop hervey moreover would have had but little time to devote to building the complete constitution of the bishopric the regaining possession of property that had been alienated in the time of rufus and the thorough establishment of his temporal jurisdiction over the isle took up all his time and energies he was also constantly abroad in attendance on the king in the next bishops time the disaffected barons assembled in the isle of ely and the bishop was of their party the whole district was alternately in the hands of the king and of the barons the property of the monastery suffered greatly by fines and exactions the bishop himself was constantly moving about from place to place and was many times compelled to make a hurried escape in fear of being apprehended by the kings party when at last his peace was made with the king his submission cost him three hundred marks neither his own resources nor those of the monastery were sufficient to raise this sum some of the treasures of the church had already been sold now the monks were persuaded to part with silver from s etheldredas shrine and other valuable ornaments in order to lend the bishop the sum he required after the death of king stephen there occurred a time of tranquillity the bishop was advanced in dignity and became a baron of the exchequer these various considerations make it at least very probable that no additions to the church of any importance were made until the reign of henry ii and if so we may come to the conclusion that the whole of the nave was built in his reign the difference in the style of architecture between the late norman and the transition to early english is very noticeable as we look at the remaining portion of the west front south of the galilee porch the lower stages shewing no trace of anything but pure norman while above we see pointed arches quatrefoils in circles and other indications of the approaching change of style bishop eustace 11981215 made large additions to the fabric at his own expense one sentence in the account of his work has given rise to much controversy ipse construxit a fundamento novam galileam ecclesi eliensis versus occidentem sumptibus suis was this the early english porch now known as the galilee some have thought that this name was bestowed upon the whole of the western transept not including the porch this is the view taken in recent years by canon stewart he shews it was the current local opinion at the beginning of the eighteenth century dr tanner who wrote the account of ely in browne williss mitred abbies takes this view and speaks of the south arm of the transept as the old galilee and the north arm as the new galilee in the plan in williss survey of cathedrals 1727 the south part is described as the south galilee now the church workhouse while on the north side we read ruined part of galilee no doubt the character of the architecture is not inconsistent with the theory that the northern part may have been built or finished by bishop eustace soon after he was appointed in intentional imitation of the pronounced norman work adjacent canon stewart also points out that bishop eustace is known to have rebuilt s marys church where the rough masonry and plain lancets are wholly unlike the beautiful work in the west porch and he adds it is evident that eustace had nothing to do with the erection of any part of the present cathedral the galilee which he built has totally disappeared and the porch which has gone under that name of late years must be the work of some unknown benefactor who had probably seen hugh de northwolds presbytery and determined to lengthen the church westward as it had been extended in the opposite direction7 the more generally received opinion however is that bishop eustace did really build what is now called the galilee this is accepted by bentham essex and miller and more recently by sir g g scott illustration the interior of the galilee before restoration c 1817 from stevensons supplement to bentham no one can doubt that the entire west front when standing was much improved by the addition of this great porch the front indeed never had the painfully flat appearance presented at some cathedrals for its extreme length was not very great and the projecting turrets at each end would greatly relieve the impression that it was the side and not the end of a building but it requires something more than a tower in the centre of the front to give a true finish to a composition in which there runs at the top a single horizontal line from north to south richly traceried windows are not sufficient deeply recessed doorways are better but here there was only one of the nature of which we have no account the great porch is exactly what was wanted in 1757 essex recommended the removal of the galilee as being an encumbrance the roof was ruinous the walls were in bad condition it was neither ornamental nor useful it would cost a large sum to put it into decent repair happily this advice was not followed in the course of the renovation then undertaken it was discovered that the remains of an older porch had been incorporated with the present one bishop northwold 12291254 commenced the building of the present presbytery8 there are now nine bays between the screen and the east end the apse if such were the termination of the norman church was situated between what are now on each side the fourth and fifth piers from the screen a line drawn from the west side of the fifth piers north and south would just touch the eastern end of the apse bishop northwold pulled down the apse and one bay west of it and extended the presbytery four more bays to the east building in all six bays of which two were included in the ritual choir and four were to the east of the high altar all this was done between the years 1235 and 1251 the bishop also erected a lofty timber spire on the west tower which remained until the present decorated stage was built we have no account of the consecration of the norman choir but after this extension of the building eastwards we read that the whole church was solemnly dedicated on september 17 1252 in honour of saints mary peter and etheldreda king henry iii was present as well as prince edward afterwards king when the new portion of the church was ready the remains of the four saints were removed further east in the norman church the high altar was in the chord of the apse assuming one to have been built after bishop northwolds alterations it was placed at the east end of the present sixth bay where the apse terminated the shrine of the foundress was placed some feet further to the east its eastern face standing about twelve feet in front of the existing altar this work of bishop northwold completed the plan of the cathedral as it now stands the ladychapel was indeed built afterwards but that is to all intents and purposes a separate building nor is there any later thirteenthcentury work in the church itself the building operations of the second half of the century were confined to the domestic part of the monastery as these were doubtless carried out by the convent from its own resources there is little notice to be found of them in the records of the see it is known that the rectory now in the deanery grounds belonged to this period it was finished in the time of prior hemmingston 12741288 illustration the shrine of s etheldreda as given in bentrams history and antiquities the first half of the next century was a time of great and important work at the church in 1321 the first stone of the ladychapel was laid by alan de walsingham the subprior afterwards sacrist it was finished in 1349 and though john of wisbech had the charge of the erection the sacrist having more important work to do at the church itself we can hardly doubt that the designs were by walsingham the position of the ladychapel to the northeast of the north transept is unique at bristol it is to the north of the north choir aisle at peterborough the ladychapel destroyed during the commonwealth was in a nearly similar situation projecting eastward from the north transept whatever may have been the reason at peterborough for this unusual position some say that a public road close to the apse prevented an extension of the choir to the east there is no necessity to question the accuracy of the explanation generally given of the site of the ladychapel herenamely that the place of honour east of the high altar was already appropriated to the shrine of s etheldreda on the night of february 12 1322 the eve of s ermenildas day the central tower fell its insecurity had long been known the monks had just left their matin service in s catharines chapel some persons conclude from this fact that the choir had already been disused as being unsafe but unless there is other evidence of this the mere fact of the monastic matins being held in the chapel nearest to the domestic buildings seems hardly sufficient to justify the conclusion the chapel here named was not according to dean stubbs the one now dedicated to s catharine at the west end of the cathedral but one that adjoined the chapterhouse the fall of the tower destroyed three bays of the choir different opinions are held as to the character of the architecture of the bays thus destroyed some hold that bishop northwold built the choir and presbytery from the central tower to the east end in the early english style and that three of his bays were thrown down by the fall of the tower9 others think that the bays now ruined were part of the norman work10 it is most probable that northwold designing to increase the length of the presbytery only pulled down so much of the norman work as was necessary for his purpose leaving the western arches standing this opinion is adopted in the account of his work given above if this is correct there would have been four norman arches left standing between the tower and the early english work of these three on each side fell when the new choir was constructed the octagon taking up the space of the first bay the fourth baypresumably left uninjuredwas removed as being out of keeping between the early english and the new decorated bays and hence three new bays were built reaching to bishop northwolds work all accounts agree that three bays were destroyed but if both choir and presbytery were of early english date there must have been four bays overthrown because the three decorated bays now existing do not correspond in position to the three destroyed for the present third bay from the screen is where the fourth bay was when the tower was standing no one could possibly have been found in the whole kingdom better qualified to cope with the great disaster that took place at ely in 1322 than the officer of the house who had the special custody of the fabric the originality and skill with which he designed and carried out the noble work that takes the place of the central tower which is without a rival in the architecture of the whole world are beyond all praise the exquisite work in the ladychapel would in itself have been sufficient to establish walsinghams reputation as an architect of the very highest order of merit but it would have revealed nothing if it stood alone of the consummate constructive genius which he displayed in the conception of the octagon of the design itself we shall speak hereafter no time was lost in removing the mass of ruins and we can imagine as the ground was cleared and the grandeur of the opportunity gradually dawned upon walsinghams mind how he formed the design of dispensing with the four central pillars and thereby securing eight instead of four for the support of his substitute for a central tower at the same time the weight which these supports would have to bear was very much less than that of a massive tower of stone so that there need be little fear of the fall of the lantern fergusson has pointed out that the roof of the octagon is the only gothic dome in existence beresford hope11 compares the octagonal lanterns of milan and antwerp with that at ely which he calls unique in this country the building was begun as soon as the space was cleared the stonework was finished in 1328 little more than six years after the tower fell the woodwork of the vaulting and lantern took longer time but this also was quite complete in 1342 walsingham had become prior in the previous year the weight of the lantern it need hardly be said is not borne though it looks like it from below by the vaulting that we see there is a perfect forest of oak hidden from sight the eight great angle posts being no less than 3 feet 4 inches by 2 feet 8 inches in section there is also the leaden roof of the octagon of that part which is exclusive of the lantern 18 feet above the vaulting to be supported a glance at plate 44 in benthams history gives some slight idea of the method of construction12 illustration the octagon about 1825 from wilds english cathedrals with such a man as walsingham on the spot we cannot be wrong in assigning to him the authorship of all the architectural designs that were carried out in his lifetime it is believedfor the date is not exactly knownthat he died in 1364 besides the ladychapel and octagon he must have designed the singularly beautiful bays of the presbytery between the octagon and northwolds work the exquisite way in which the main characteristics of the early english work are adapted to the decorated style demands our highest admiration the arrangement of the three western bays on each side is exactly like northwolds work while the additional grace and beauty of ornamentation mark the advance in taste that distinguished the decorated period bishop hotham undertook the whole expense of rebuilding this portion of the cathedral he did not live to see it completed as he died in 1337 but he left money for the purpose the total expense of this rebuilding is given at 2034 12s 8d while the cost of the octagon and lantern amounted to not very much more2406 6s 11d nearly all this latter cost was defrayed by the monastery little more than 200 having been contributed from external sources these amounts must be multiplied by twenty if not twentyfive to represent the present value the rebuilding of these three bays in the presbytery involved the rebuilding of the corresponding portions of the aisles the domestic buildings were also improved and some new ones erected by walsingham the sacrists office he almost new built made several additional apartments in it and encompassed the whole with a strong wall in the northwest corner of which he built a square building of stone and covered it with lead part of this he appropriated to the use of goldsmiths work and for other purposes relative to his office another building taken notice of as built by him was contiguous to the infirmary it was of stone covered with lead and had convenient offices under it chiefly intended for the use of the custos of the infirmary in his time also bells13 were first put up in the great western tower14 of this period the following are enumerated as works executed in the monastery15 prior craudens chapel the priors new hall above the old one the guest hall the fair hall and the residence of the subprior on the death of bishop de lisle in 1361 walsingham was elected bishop by the convent but the election was set aside by the pope this eminent architect was buried in the cathedral but the precise spot is not known the epitaph on his tomb has been preserved and in it we find that he was buried ante chorum in front of the choir this would mean the ritual choir as then existing and would fix the place of his interment approximately at the spot where there is now a large monumental slab from which the brass has been removed and this has always been traditionally said to be the actual stone placed over his body the brass represented an ecclesiastic with mitre and pastoral staff the objection to this having been walsinghams memorial that these emblems could not have been correctly placed upon it has been thus met on the other hand it is contended that although alan died a prior of the convent he had been elected bishop by the monks though his election was overruled by the pope and that seeing to his successor prior powcher the pope gave permission that he and all future priors of ely should wear the mitre and carry the crozier it is possible that the monks had anticipated somewhat the popes edict and had represented their beloved prelate with episcopal mitre on his head and crozier in his hand16 he well deserved the description in the epitaph flos operatorum the flower of craftsmen the rich woodwork in the choirthe stalls with their beautiful canopiesis also certainly walsinghams work besides the great operations of this century there were various alterations and additions made in the cathedral of which the date is not recorded the triforium in the presbytery was rearranged the external walls were raised and the early english windows of northwolds work were replaced by much larger ones with decorated tracery as the clerestory windows were not altered the leanto roof of the triforium was of course made much more flat than before the graceful flying buttresses with their elegant pinnacles are of this same date the character of northwolds triforium windows and the corbel table below the parapet may be still seen in two bays on the south side the aisle windows of the presbytery were also enlarged in the decorated period but they are not of the same design as the triforium windows and they were probably not inserted at the same time judging by ordinary methods of discriminating dates by character and style we should suppose the aisle windows to be earlier than those above possibly some of this was done by bishop barnet 13661373 the whole designing is so unlike any of walsinghams known work that we can hardly suppose that he was the author after the extensive changes of the fourteenth century were completed the fabric of the cathedral was left practically as we see it now rearrangements of the interior have taken place on many occasions since and the numerous sidechapels have been despoiled of their altars but there has been no material structural change from the death of bishop barnet in 1373 to the suppression of the monasteries no bishop of ely is credited with having done anything towards the fabric of the cathedral except bishop gray 14541478 some of them were at variance with the prior and convent and would be little inclined to spend money on the church those that had a taste for architecture displayed it in beautifying their palaces or manorhouses or upon buildings connected with the universities or other places in which they had private interest some were men of great political influence and found their time and energies fully occupied in matters of national importance one at least spent immense sums upon the drainage of the fens some did indeed erect chapels or shrines in the cathedral or left provision that they should be erected after their deaths but these were as memorials of themselves the monastery carried out whatever was done in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as long as the monastery existed the first such work was begun early in the fifteenth century by prior powcher this was the erection of the upper portion of the western tower at the top of the tower before this addition there was a wooden spire covered with lead the upper story now is octagonal and there are also octagonal turrets at the corners detached except at top and bottom from the main body these were clearly built so as to harmonise with the large projecting turretsmassive enough themselves to be called towersat the ends of the west front this octagon was also itselfbut probably at a much later datesurmounted with some sort of spire an engraving dated 1786 shows this spire it was no improvement to the tower it was happily removed early in the nineteenth century this additional story was built without due preparation the extra weight was too much for the support which had been sufficient for the smaller tower accordingly casing was added round the four great piers to increase the support this was in bishop grays time and he contributed largely towards the cost the prior and convent were at great charges in repairing the lower part of the western tower the arches and pillars of which being found insufficient for its support were therefore obliged to be strengthened by wholly newcasing them with stone in the most substantial manner as we now see them17 it has been reasonably conjectured that this extra weight was the cause of the ruin of the northern part of the west transept or that it was then damaged beyond repair to bishop gray is also assigned in particular the insertion of two windows in the north aisle of the presbytery near the place where he was afterwards buried the undoubted decorated character of the upper stage of the west tower marks it as belonging to the very earliest years of the century there is not the least tendency towards any features of the perpendicular style without reckoning tombs and chapels there is no structural work of distinct perpendicular character to be seen at ely cathedral except some remains of the cloisters and the windows in the nave aisles and clerestory and those in the upper parts of the great transept and the large supporting arches which have been inserted beneath the norman arches of the west tower the triforium walls in the nave were raised in the fifteenth century as those in the presbytery had been raised in the fourteenth the style of the tracery shews that this alteration was carried out quite late in the century perhaps about 1480 in the south transept there is also a large perpendicular window the very late east window of the south presbytery aisle was inserted as part of bishop wests chapel who died in 1533 in 1539 the monastery was surrendered to the king such of the domestic buildings as were not required for the use of the dean and canons were as usual sold the constitution of henry viii provided for the customary officers of a cathedral establishment the prior became the first dean and remained in office till his death eighteen years later though the minster had become a cathedral when the bishopric was instituted yet the prior and convent were always custodians of the fabric and apparently supreme therein and there was nothing strictly corresponding to a capitular body a memory of the fact that the bishop was in place of the abbot remains to this day in the position of the bishops seat in the choir there is no throne properly so called the bishop occupies what is in most cathedrals the deans seaton the south of the entrance at the screen the north side is in consequence the decani side and the cantoris side is on the south this position of the deans stall on the north though very unusual is not unique it occurs also at durham and carlisle but at those cathedrals there is a throne for the bishop and the bishops seat in a stall in the south corresponding to the deans in the north is not met with elsewhere at ely alone of all cathedrals in christendom owing to its first bishop having been an abbot who was himself the banished bishop of another see the diocesan has continued to occupy the abbots stall while the head of the corporation before the reformation a prior and since then a dean has occupied the opposite stall usually assigned to a subprior or subdean18 there were three benedictine abbeys which retained their monastic establishment after a bishop had been made and the minster became a cathedralcanterbury durham and ely it is always taken for granted that the destruction of the beautiful work in the ladychapel as well as of the shrines and statuary in the cathedral was effected very soon after the dissolution of the monastery but precise authority for this seems not to be forthcoming it is known that bishop goodrich was an ardent supporter of the reformation movement and that he issued an injunction in 1541 which would have authorised such destruction there was no other material damage done to the cathedral at this time in 1566 a parish church dedicated to s cross which was situated at the north side of the nave was found to be so dilapidated that no attempt was made to render it fit for service and the dean and chapter gave to the parishioners the ladychapel for a parish church and it has so remained to this day it is probable that the wealth of the monastery had kept the fabric itself in such a state of complete repair that there was no occasion for much sustentation work for a long time after the reformationat least we read nothing of any work being undertaken or of any portions of the building falling into decay in the commonwealth period the cathedral suffered less than in many places the stained glass was indeed destroyed and the cloisters and some parts of the domestic buildings pulled down by order of commissioners as oliver cromwell was governor of the isle of ely and often in the city he was not likely to let the cathedral services alone in january 1644 he interfered during service and stopped it ejecting the congregation and is said to have professed that this was an act of kindness in order to prevent damage to the building according to carlyle19 he had written to the officiating minister requiring him to forbear altogether the choir service so unedifying and offensive lest the soldiers should in any tumultuary or disorderly way attempt the reformation of the cathedral church if the people of ely had heard about the reformation of the cathedral church at peterborough as carried out by the soldiers of the parliament in july of the preceding year they were certainly well advised in taking this hint bishop wrenan eager opponent of the puritanswas at the time in prison where he remained until the restoration the only account we have met with of disrepair in the seventeenth century says a little part of the end of the north part fell down march 28 anno 1699 but it was soon neatly rebuilt again at the charge of the church with some assistance from a brief20 this was the northwest21 corner of the north transept the rebuilding was carried out under the direction of sir christopher wren nephew of the bishop there is an account of the impression produced upon a visitor to ely in the reign of william and mary the quaintness of which may perhaps justify the length of the quotation the bishop does not care to stay long in this place not being good for his health he is lord of all the island has the command and ye jurisdiction there is a good palace for the bishop built but it was unfurnished there are two churches ely minster is a curious pile of building all of stone the outside full of carvings and great arches and fine pillars in the front and the inside has the greatest variety and neatness in the works there are two chappels most exactly carvd in stone all sorts of figures cherubims gilt and painted in some parts ye roofe of one chappell was one entire stone most delicately carvd and hung down in great poynts all about ye church the pillars are carvd and painted with ye history of the bible especially the new testament and description of christs miracles the lanthorn in ye quire are vastly high and delicately painted and fine carvd work all of wood in it ye bells used to be hung five the demention of ye biggest was so much that when they rung them it shooke ye quire so and ye carvd worke that it was thought unsafe therefore they were taken down there is one chappel for confession with a roome and chaire of state for ye priest to set to hear ye people on their knees confess into his eare through a hole in ye wall this church has ye most popish remaines of any i have seen there still remains a cross over the alter the candlesticks are 3 quarters of a yard high massy silver gilt very heavy the ffont is one entire piece of white marble stemm and foote the cover was carvd wood with ye image of christs being baptised by john and the holy dove descending on him all finely carvd white wood without any paint or varnish22 in the eighteenth century some extensive repairs became necessary and some alterations in the arrangements of the choir were carried out the former chiefly affected the roofs of the octagon and presbytery other parts of the cathedral seem to have needed some repair but not to a considerable extent the latter consisted in the moving of the ritual choir to the extreme east end of the church the returned stalls at its western limit being at the sixth piers from the east end this alteration was effected in 1770 the position of the high altar has been perhaps more often moved in this cathedral than in any other in the norman choir the altar was situated in the centre of the fourth bay east of the present octagon when bishop northwold enlarged the presbytery it was moved one bay further east after the rebuilding of the three bays west of northwolds work it seems to have been moved again westward as far as the first piers east of the octagon again in 1770 at the time of which we are now speaking it was moved to the extreme east end and was placed just against the east wall now it stands between the second piers from the east it is not a little singular to notice the enthusiasm with which this eighteenthcentury change was greeted bentham says23 it was an alteration which had long been wished for by all persons of true taste and again it is allowed by the best judges to be one of the most useful and ornamental improvements that could have been effected and he gives a long disquisition highly praising the alteration the eastern portion formerly an useless encumbrance was now brought into use the organ and voices could be better heard the view of the octagon was greatly improved and the nave and transepts have acquired their due dimensions compare this with hewetts observations less than eighty years later never was there a more illjudged step than the removal of the choir hither towards the latter portion of the last century to give it such stinted proportions and for this purpose to displace some of the fine old monuments and to hide others to obscure the pillars and above all to erect the miserable organ gallery which we now behold may surely be pronounced most tasteless performances24 when he wrote the proposal was to replace walsinghams stalls in the octagon and to make bishop hothams three decorated bays into a sacrarium and so presumably reerect the high altar on the very spot where it stood in norman times bishop mawson contributed 1000 towards the removal of the choir to the east end he had also been at the expense of paving the choir with black and white marble and of inserting stained glass at the east end the work done at this time was under the superintendence of the architect essex an organgallery was placed at the entrance of the choir judging by the plan given by bentham this occupied the whole of the eastern bay of hothams work screens of some sort are marked as crossing both aisles as a continuation of the western face of this organgallery or perhaps these were only metal gates the design of the whole seems to have been very poor the miserable organ gallery is what hewett calls it the original stone screen that formed the entrance to the choir before the tower fell situated in the bay of the nave next to the octagon was still standing it had served as the organloft until the alteration browne willis who wrote before bishop mawson came to ely records that the choir had been paved with black and white marble at the charge of bishop gunning and that he had proposed to move the choir to the east end nearly a hundred years before it was actually done which if he had done it would have added vastly to the beauty of the church25 still later in the century in 1796 wyatt the destructive was directed to make a report on the state of the fabric and to supply estimates for a restoration among other things he recommended the selling of the lead on the roof the removal of the roodloft and the reducing of the number of bells from five to one the nineteenth century began with works of destruction in 180126 the spire on the tower was taken down soon afterwards in accordance with wyatts recommendation the ancient roodloft in the nave was removed as it had ceased to be the entrance to the choir it was probably deemed useless the roof of the galilee was also removed and the lancets at the west of the cathedral blocked up mr bernasconis contract in 1801 for the repair of part of the west end amounting to 232 14s 6d27 probably covered the whole of this a note on the receipt speaks of a picture at the east end in 1800 a pulpit in 1806 and a new window in 1808 but whether all these were new or merely repaired does not appear from goodwins ely gossip we learn that the upper part of the doorway of the galilee porch was renewed in plaster in a pamphlet published in 1827 it is said that so much has been done to this cathedral of late as to afford a reasonable ground of hope that ere long the beautiful purbeck shafts will be cleared of the yellow ochre which coats and defiles them and that the earth will be cleared away from the walls on the north side where at present it is injuring both walls and pavement28 what had then been recently done and thus mentioned apparently with approval did not long satisfy the public taste although a large outlay testified to the good intentions if not the judgment of the authorities walsinghams stalls were painted and the nave octagon lantern and transepts were colourwashed within about twentyfive years what had been introduced as embellishments were removed as disfigurements and the removal cost possibly as much as the introduction illustration ely cathedral at the end of the eighteenth century from stevensons supplement to bentham soon after dean peacock came to ely he commenced the restoration and decoration of the fabric which have gone on continuously to the present time and are not yet complete besides many munificent gifts of which the cost is not known upwards of 70000 has been expended upon the works at the cathedral since 1843 the first great work included in this sum was the entire releading of the roof in 1842 there had been a fire discovered in the roof near the west tower but no great damage was done most likely it was the prospect of having to spend large sums upon the cathedral itself that induced the dean and chapter to sanction the demolition of the sextrybarn on the ground that the repairs it required were too expensive this barn was situated to the north of the ladychapel it was an object of the greatest architectural interest and its destruction is much to be lamented it was of early english date and is said to have been a noble and almost unrivalled building it seems to have been of the same character as the abbey tithebarn at peterborough which was perfect a very few years ago and of which the whole of the wooden posts and beams are still to be seen in situ the peterborough barn was also of thirteenth century date it had aisles and nave all formed by the oak beams and supports the ely barn was much smaller in july 1845 the restoration had been well begun and was being carried on with energy the works in bishop alcocks chapel had been commenced the south end of the west transept hitherto used as a kind of storehouse or lumberroom was repaired and thrown open to the church a poor deal roof was added as a temporary protection the choir roof was scraped and cleaned in the ladychapel the colourwash that had obscured the remains of the beautiful carvings was removed the west tower was ceiled up to this time there appears to have been no properly qualified architect in charge of the work in 1847 mr scott afterwards sir g g scott was appointed architect to the cathedral he soon made an extensive examination of the whole building and issued a report upon the state of the fabric and the amount of restoration needful dean peacock who so thoroughly identified himself with the restoration died in 1858 his successor dean goodwin entered with enthusiasm upon the work and was instrumental in raising large sums of money for the carrying out of the architects designs after he had been dean seven years he published a paper upon the progress that had been made which commences with these words the time seems to be now come when the completion of the great work of restoration commenced under dean peacock and guided for many years by his care and judgment may be looked upon as within reach29 in this paper he enumerated these works as already accomplished 1 the choir restored and rearranged 2 central lantern restored peacock memorial 3 southeast transept restored 4 southwest transept restored 5 roof of north transept restored and painted 6 nave ceiled and painted 7 nave roof repaired and releaded 8 s catherines chapel rebuilt 9 bishop alcocks chapel restored 10 galilee porch repaved 11 western tower opened ceiled reroofed strengthened etc 12 about seventy windows filled with stained glass of the painting the north transept roof the expense was borne by the tradesmen employed upon the cathedral the restoration of bishop alcocks chapel was undertaken out of respect to the memory of their founder by jesus college cambridge the painting of the nave ceiling was the work of mr le strange and mr gambier parry the former of whom also painted the ceiling of the west tower exclusive of special donations for specific works included in the above list the dean reckoned that up to the time of his report 27185 had been spent of which the dean and chapter had contributed no less than 15200 several individual members of the chapter had besides money gifts presented windows or other decorations or had been responsible for various structural repairs at a rough estimate the total sum expended had amounted to 40000 the works still to be executed were these 1 paving the nave octagon and transepts 2 completion of pinnacles and parapet of octagon 3 internal decoration of lantern 4 repair of galilee there would also be much to be done in the matter of properly warming and lighting the cathedral but those expenses were more strictly within the ordinary obligations of the dean and chapter the only one of the above works that calls for special notice is the restoration of the octagon and lantern in a statement circulated by the dean and chapter in 1853 it was declared that of all works which remain to be undertaken the most considerable and the most important is the restoration of the lantern including the decoration of the vault the substitution of windows of an appropriate character for those which now disfigure it so seriously and the addition of the outer corona of turrets and pinnacles as originally designed by alan de walsingham but nothing was done towards this during dean peacocks lifetime in the summer before his death he had described more particularly the disfigurements and the mutilations which the lantern had undergone and he further pointed out the unsafe condition of the exterior the upper windows of the octagon were of the meanest description of carpenters gothic they had been reduced from four to three lights each they had been shortened more than three feet probably by essex in the eighteenth century the upper timbers were in a ruinous state and incapable of being used again the original design provided for eight lofty turrets at the angles of the greater octagon and four pinnacles in the middle of its longer sides at the first meeting of the chapter after dean peacocks death it was resolved that no memorial of him would be so appropriate as the restoration of the lantern and mr scott was instructed to prepare designs at once a tentative sketch of his design was published in october 1859 and the opinion of experts was invited mr scotts report dated june 10 1859 gave the result of his careful examination he concluded that the wooden lantern was originally to a certain extent an imitation of the general form of the stone octagon below it each had large windows of four lights below with circular panels in the spandrils each had a distinct story over these windows lighted by smaller windows consisting of several detached lights and each had considerable turrets probably surmounted by pinnacles at the angles and in all probability open parapets between them30 he embodied the results of the evidence he had got together in the design he submitted further examination in the following year satisfied the architect that no spire had ever been erected on the lantern and that even if walsingham had ever intended to have one he had yet finished his work without any preparation for such an addition a design for such a spire was however prepared and submitted to the dean and chapter but it was never adopted as was to be expected many opinions were expressed upon the design some wanted the whole to be surmounted by a pyramidal capping it was objected that the design was a stone construction for what must of necessity be erected of wood it was pointed out that walsingham used his upper story as a bellchamber and argued that a true restoration should aim at reproducing this feature in the end scotts design was carried out exactly as proposed except that the eight small square turrets of the wooden lantern have no pinnacles the enumeration of works completed in 1866 as given by dean goodwin above did not include several important and costly gifts the chief of these were the carved panels above the stalls supplied by individual donors a pinnacle at the southeast corner of the choir mr beresford hope the reredos mr j dunn gardner the font canon selwyn the gates of aisles of presbytery mr lowndes and dean peacock the brass eagle lectern canon e b sparke and the monumental effigies of bishop allen and dr mill canon e b sparke had also contributed to the restoration of the south transept mr h r evans sen and mr h r evans jun had helped with the works in the west tower the rev g millers minor canon had bequeathed 100 and his residuary legatees gave another 300 which was applied to the ceiling of the nave miss allen daughter of the bishop also bequeathed 500 appropriated to a new pulpit and bishop turton left the same amount for repaving the nave the only other work of importance done before dean goodwin left for carlisle was the reconstruction of the organ canon dickson in his admirable historical account of the organ is confident that the instrument in use in 1831 was the original prereformation organ gradually enlarged from time to time with all the improvements suggested by the progress of musical and mechanical art its preservation during the commonwealth period is possibly due to the personal influence of oliver cromwell about that date 1831 the organ was rebuilt by elliott and hill it was fitted into the old cases of renaissance design from the similarity of these cases to some which are known to have inclosed organs built by renatus harris the old organ has sometimes been attributed to him but there is no record whatever of the employment of harris by the dean and chapter the progress made in the time of dean merivale 18691894 was steady and substantial but calls for no detailed account the foundations of many parts of the building were made more secure much of the pavement was renewed the tower at the west was strengthened with iron bands several stained glass windows were inserted perhaps the most noteworthy undertaking of this period was the decoration of the interior and the

illustration entrance to the cathedral from the galilee chapter ii the cathedral exterior few persons would dispute the statement that for external grandeur of effect the cathedral at ely is surpassed only if at all in england by durham and lincoln with the natural advantages of position enjoyed by those cathedrals ely cannot compete in both these cases also there are grand medival buildings of great size near at hand that group well with the cathedrals and materially improve the effect but compared with the adjacent country ely does stand on an eminence and consequently can be seen from a great distance in all directions at durham the distant view is limited by the hilly nature of the district lincoln except on the north side can probably be seen more than thirty miles off from the ground1 ely can be seen quite well from the tower of peterboroughabout thirtyfive miles as the crow flies ely is nearly but not quite the highest spot in the fenland one place in ely is 109 feet above mean sealevel the highest elevation in the fenland is near haddenham some five miles to the southwest of ely where a few benchmarks give 121 and 122 feet above sealevel it is not only its magnificence that makes the view of ely cathedral so remarkable there is also the feeling that it has so many striking features to which we can find nothing to compare the first glimpse of ely overwhelms us not only by its stateliness and variety of its outline but by its utter strangeness its unlikeness to anything else so says professor freeman2 and again ely with its vast single western tower with its central octagon unlike anything else in the whole world has an outline altogether peculiar to itself although ely with the single exception of wells3 is the smallest of the ancient episcopal cities4 of england the area of the cathedral is exceeded only by four othersyork s pauls lincoln and winchester the church certainly gives the impression of being out of all proportion to the town5 there has been nothing to occasion any considerable increase in the number of the inhabitants sixty years ago there were within about four hundred as many as now the town as has been pointed out above grew out of the foundation of the monastery the history of ely is the history of wells lichfield peterborough bury saint edmunds and a crowd of others where the church came first and the town grew up at the gate of the bishop or abbot the great wealth of the monastery accounts for the original magnificence of the church and even when the resources both of the see and the cathedral body were reduced they were still amply sufficient to maintain the fabric without the loss of any material portion of it we have no knowledge of the occasion of the ruin of the northern part of the west transept but there is no suggestion that it was allowed to fall through want of means to keep it up the west frontthe visitor will naturally commence his investigation of the cathedral with studying the view of the tower from the west and here he should endeavour to picture to himself the appearance of the west front as it originally stood it has indeed been questioned whether the northern limb of the western transept had ever been really completed the prevailing opinion is that it was completed and the weathermould against the north wall of the tower is held by many to be almost conclusive evidence of the fact from what we see remaining it is clear that it was if ever built similar to the southern limb and it was doubtless terminated in the same way by two massive octangular towers imagine therefore a west front having to the left of the tower as we look at it from the west a limb corresponding to that on the right imagine also a line of roof extending over both western transepts situated in a line with the foot of the three lancet windows just below the clock imagine also further a roof of similar pitch over the galilee porch6 and instead of the present decorated stage at the summit a pyramidal spire of timber leaded the front with its tower thus terminated with leaded spires also on the four terminal towers of the transept and with the high roofs of the transept and western porch must have presented a tout ensemble of the most imposing and majestic character7 when we examine the details of the architecture we can express nothing but the greatest admiration the whole of the south wing of the front belongs to the last quarter of the twelfth century the lowest stage of all for there are six stages divided by horizontal strings is blank the next three are late norman these have in the lowest stage in each of the two divisions an arcade of seven tall lancets in the next above are four broader arches each containing two small lancets beneath in the upper one is a large window under a round arch of four receding orders with a blank lancet on each side in the north wing it should be noted the late norman work was carried up one stage higher than on the south the upper stages are transitional in character but they carry on the idea of the norman design below here we see first an arcade of four trefoiled lancets of greater depth than those underneath while the uppermost stage has a large pointed window with a lancet on each side and above each lancet a quatrefoil in a circle the arches of the window and lancets are highly enriched with carving below the parapet is a good corbel table the fourth and sixth stages are further covered with admirable diaper panelwork the octagonal towers at the end of the southern transept of which that to the west is larger than the other have three more stages the central one having small deeply sunk trefoiled lancets the other two large plain ones the uppermost tier of lancets being open a singular effect is produced in the third stage from the top by the lancets being divided in the centre by the main shaft that rises from the ground at the angles of the tower on the south and east these shafts are not perfect the galilee porch is of excellent early english work with details of great beauty certainly nowhere in england possibly nowhere in the world is there to be seen so fine a porch perhaps the most gorgeous porch of this style in existence is the galilee at the west end of ely cathedral this magnificent specimen of the early english style must be seen to be duly appreciated it combines the most elegant general forms with the richest detail a very happy effect is produced by the double arcade on each side one in front of the other with detached shafts not opposite but alternate8 each side externally is covered with lancet arcading in four tiers in the upper tier the lancets are trefoiled with dogtooth in the moulding in the next lower tier the lancets are cinquefoiled with two sets of dogtooth the lancets in the west face are all cinquefoiled and the three lower tiers here have trefoils in the spandrels nearly all are highly enriched with dogtooth while the mouldings of the west door have conventional foliage as well the lancets here are deeper than on the sides of the porch and were probably designed to hold figures of the three large lancets in the west window the central one is slightly more lofty than the others illustration doorway of the galilee the interior of the porch is even more beautiful the profusion of ornamentation on the inner doorway and the exceeding gracefulness of the double arcades in the sides are quite unsurpassed both doorways are divided by a shaft and both have open tracery of exceptional beauty above bishop eustace to whom this porch is attributed died in 1215 it is not surprising to learn that many careful students of english architecture have found a difficulty in believing that work of such consummate grace and perfection of detail can belong to so early a date many dated examples belonging to later years in the century which seem to indicate a steady growth from the simplest pointed lancets to the elaborately cusped arches which were themselves the prelude to the geometric period are adduced as evidence of the improbability of the early english style having so to say grown suddenly to perfection at ely numerous instances may however be found in other great minsters where a similar difficulty has been encountered the probable explanation is that the best artists and the most original designers belonged to the monastic or cathedral bodies they maintained what would be described in modern language as schools of architects and the very best talents and energies of such bodies would naturally be brought to bear upon any great work connected with their own church we cannot suppose that a new conception in architectural design sprang into existence simultaneously in several different centres there must have been a beginning in some one place the idea would spread in the neighbourhood and in buildings where the particular abbey or cathedral had property or influence and would by degrees be carried to other religious houses and so become generally adopted and mark a distinct change in style but this would take time sometimes we can trace how new methods were carried about those who were brought over from normandy by the norman kings of england to be abbots in english monasteries brought with them their characteristic style of building and at the end of the twelfth century this had entirely superseded the old english style one monastery passed on the new fashion to another as simeon at ely came fresh from the great work being carried on at winchester under his brother walkelin it is not claimed for bishop eustace that his work here is the earliest known specimen of the style finished in so perfect a form at lincoln the choir was erected in the time of bishop hugh who died in 1200 some features there have been pointed out that shew that the style was a new departure and that the architect was feeling his way it is admitted that there is not to be found an earlier dated example of the finest early english work than the choir at lincoln second only to this the galilee porch at ely may take rank other erections of very nearly the same date have admirable work such as the ladychapel at winchester and the east end of chichester but there is nothing in either of those examples to compare with the elaborate richness of detail at ely the west tower has six stages of early english date above the porch three of these have each three separate lancet windows the two lower having banded shafts in the projecting corner turrets are lancets of similar design in the two upper stages but not so broad and not pierced for windows while in the lowest stage in the turrets above the porch are several tall thin trefoiled lancets having more the character of transition norman work between the window ranges are arcades of short deep trefoiled lancets at the top below the parapet and corbel table are five quatrefoils in circles one not pierced on the north and south sides are but two ranges of windows the tower must of course have been built before the porch and may consequently be assigned to the last years of the twelfth century and it is a noble specimen for such an early date the upper decorated stage consists of an octagon having a fine window of three lights in each face the part below the transom not glazed and an open parapet above at the corners are octagonal turrets with open lights above the level of the central portion and plain parapets the turrets are detached from the centre except at the top and bottom the latest calculations give the height of these turrets as 215 feet this would be nearly the same as the central tower at durham the early english tower must have had some erection above it probably of wood of a low pyramidal form but before long it was replaced by something of a better style bishop northwold 12291254 construxit de novo turrim ligneam versus galileam ab opere cementario usque ad summitatem this was in turn removed when the present octagonal stage was erected about the year 1400 this addition was soon found to be a source of danger and it threatened the destruction of the whole tower for several years in the middle of the fifteenth century the tower was undergoing repairs before this the upper part had been braced together with frames of timber in the interior as will be seen hereafter inner arches of great strength were inserted under the original norman arches of the tower a light and thin wooden spire was unwisely placed at the top and this was in 1757 reported to be in bad condition and injurious to the tower it was not finally restored till about 1801 when the whole of the upper portion including the corner turrets was materially strengthened illustration the west tower from the south on the west face of the buttress built against the tower in the north can be seen some panels of perpendicular date these have suggested the idea that it was in contemplation to rebuild what had fallen in a later style notwithstanding the ruins the view of the cathedral from the northwest is very striking and in some respects more remarkable than any other see p 2 we have here the only external view of the whole length of the north side of the nave with the exception of the clerestory range and of course the north transept the first impression is not that of a norman building the single broad light of the norman clerestory with its adjacent roundheaded lancets in the wall remains in each bay unaltered above these windows was once a battlement but miller records in 1834 that it was removed within the last sixty years the aisle battlement remains the walls of the triforium were raised and the norman windows both of the aisle and triforium altered in the perpendicular period the alterations having been begun on the south side in 1469 all these windows now have ogee arches and are of three lights the tracery is unimposing about the middle of the wall can be distinctly seen the marks of the door and covered way that led from the cathedral to the church of s cross this church had been erected in the early part of the fourteenth century but as has been mentioned p 29 was found in 1566 to be too dilapidated for use and beyond repair it was accordingly destroyed and the ladychapel assigned in lieu of it to the parishioners for their parish church either the fabric of this church must have been strangely neglected by its custodians or it must have been very inferior in merit of construction to walsinghams work which was being erected at the same time if it could last no longer than about two hundred and thirty years round the clerestory windows and arcading can be seen the billet moulding under the triforium parapet is a corbel table with billets below the triforium windows is a stringcourse consisting of little double squares with a diagonal sometimes called the hatched moulding a form of ornament not one of the most common good examples of it are to be seen in westminster hall in the sixth bay from the transept is a tablet with the date 1662 this must be the time when some alterations were made but it can neither refer to the raising of the triforium walls nor to the building up the wall when the door to the destroyed church was no longer needed between this point and the transepts can be plainly seen the marks of the original norman windows over the heads of the existing perpendicular ones the octagon can be nowhere seen to better advantage than from this point of view restored as a memorial to dean peacock it has been brought as nearly as possible to what walsingham intended for it is not quite certain that he entirely completed his own design the quadrangular turrets for instance at the corners of the lantern were probably meant to be surmounted by pinnacles these were included in scotts original designs for the restoration but have not been erected indeed two of benthams views of the building represent pinnacles at the corners of both octagon and lantern while one view has them to neither it is certain also that there were slighter pinnacles designed for the middle of the longer sides of the octagon these have now been built the lantern has quite recovered its original beauty after being sadly mutilated and altered at various times during the discussions about the correct way of completing the lantern not a few persons maintained that the true termination of the whole was a lofty light open spire and that if walsingham never erected one he must at least have had one in contemplation the examination of the interior construction leaves no doubt whatever that no such flche was ever erected and also that walsingham intentionally completed the whole without making any preparation for the addition of such a feature a preparation which he would beyond question have made had he thought a spire was necessary to the completion of the work the octagon is not equilateral the cardinal faces being equal to the inner breadth of the nave and transepts are the longer in all the faces just below the open parapet are arcades of cinquefoiled arches some of them pierced for windows the cardinal faces have each six such arches and the other faces only three these shorter sides only have large windows the others abutting directly upon the roofs these large windows have exquisite tracery they are all of four lights with transoms and are beneath arches unusually acute for the decorated period the windows in the lantern are new essex having destroyed the original fourlight windows and substituted poor ones of three lights each the way in which the octagon and lantern combine in producing a perfectly harmonious composition is in great part due to two points of difference points which very few observers detect these are firstly that the lantern is a regular octagon having all its sides equal in this respect being unlike the stone octagon beneath it and secondly that the eight faces of the lantern are not parallel to the eight faces of the octagon the new windows of the lantern are similar to the large ones below but are not mere copies of them the upper stage of the lantern above the roof as seen from within was once a bellchamber its lights are not and never have been glazed the whole of the lantern is of wood covered with lead two flying buttresses rise from the corners of the nave and transept aisles to the corbel table of the clerestory range there are also eight elegant flying buttresses one to each of the angles of the lantern these are part of the new work the originals having long disappeared the north transept retains its original norman windows in the lower stage of its western aisle though we must remember that the northwestern angle of this transept fell down in 1699 and was rebuilt9 under the superintendence of sir christopher wren it is said that an earthquake had occurred some few years before and had caused some damage which was not suspected at the time however much we may admire wrens constructive genius we cannot justify the incongruous door in the north wall of the transept for which we take it for granted he was responsible it is in the classical style utterly out of keeping with the architecture near the arch and jambs of the norman window above it were replaced but this again is spoilt by the insertion of rude unadorned mullions the corresponding window over the eastern aisle is original and unaltered the north end of the transept has also norman lights larger than those below on the second range while above are two large perpendicular windows each of three lights with transoms to see the east wall of the transept we have to go round the ladychapel here both triforium and clerestory are in their original norman condition the lower windows are decorated it cannot but be regretted that the two large windows east and west of the ladychapel are not portions of the building as it stood at first that to the east of seven lights is known to have been inserted by bishop barnet who died in 1373 the authority for this is the sacrists roll for that year the item is given in dean stubbs historical memorials p 147 the bishops executors paid 20 for making a certain window in the ladychapel near the high altar in the preceding year the west window of eight lights is of somewhat later date considering that the chapel was finished in 1349 and that there is no reason to doubt that the east and west ends were adorned with fine windows of the same character as those in the sides it seems extraordinary that within twentyfive years it should have been thought worth while to alter the eastern end was the alteration made in connection with the insertion of a grander reredos than had been at first provided this seems possible as may be judged from the following observations of the present dean it is evident from indications supplied by the masonry of the central light of the east window the mullions of which are of unusual solidity that the reredos and east window were originally combined in some structure of which the chief object was the large figure of s mary often mentioned in the rolls of the custos capell and which must have occupied a canopied niche blocking up the whole of the middle light from sill to transom10 the design of the east window is inelegant the transom is heavy and the tracery in the large circle at the top spoils the effect of the window as a whole illustration the choir and ladychapel from the northeast the west window except for the central portion at the top and the heavy mullions is just like two of the side windows placed side by side but here again the vertical lines in the upper part harmonise ill with the rest there are some good niches at the west end above the window but there are no figures in them and there are shallow arches on the surface of the wall on each side of the window as well as beneath it above most of the niches are shields with heraldic bearings twelve in all among these are the coats of edward the confessor the see of ely bishops hotham montacute fordham and perhaps barnet11 one shield has a cross and one a lion between three helmets the arms of the monasterythree keys said to have been adopted from bishop ethelwold of winchesteroccur four times in three cases with initials beneath these initials are a w which may certainly be assigned to alan de walsingham j c and c w s from the occurrence of bishop fordhams arms we may conclude that this west end was reconstructed or at least that its reconstruction was completed in his time 13881425 in some of the lower niches are memorial tablets on each side of the ladychapel are five large windows of four lights each with very beautiful tracery those on the north side have been thoroughly restored within the last few years at the same time the cusps have been replaced in the large circles of which two are over the head of each window between the windows are buttresses necessarily large to support the vast extent of the stonegroined roof at the four corners are double buttresses with much larger pinnacles and two niches toward the top the upper one shallow but the lower deep enough to hold a statue and with a projecting canopy the east end is less decorated than the west there was once as it seems some sculptured figure or figures in front of the upper part of the window no doubt destroyed when the interior was mutilated illustration elevation of original bays of bishop northwolds presbytery the east end of the cathedral itself bishop hughs work is a grand example of early english12 except for the windows of the chapels of bishops alcock and west in the aisles and that the early english lancets in the triforium range in the south aisle have been removed and a plain wall substituted this eastern front is almost unaltered it does not appear when this last alteration was made in the view in bentham dated 1767 are represented lancets glazed and blank exactly similar to those in the triforium on the north the windows are all lancets without any cusping their grouping is specially effective in the centre in the lowest stage are three broad lancets of equal height divided by shafts and with deep mouldings and with two sets of dogtooth all round below the stringcourse above are four deep quatrefoils in the next stage the lancets are five in number the central one being the tallest while above the outer ones are trefoiled niches and there are two sixfoils below the next stringcourse the upper stage has three lancets of equal height which give light to the space above the stonegroined roof with a small trefoiled arch unglazed and half of another on each side in the gable are three large sunk panels two of six cusps and one of eight the whole is surmounted by a large handsome cross restored at the expense of lady mildred hope the large buttresses on each side of the central group of windows have four niches on each side the three upper ones having bases to support statues the upper and lower of these have trefoiled heads the two others cinquefoiled heads at the summit are sunk trefoils under the gabled tops and a little further to the west on the south the whole is finished by an octangular turret with shallow arches and a pyramidal top with crockets13 the buttresses at the corners of the aisles have much loftier pyramidal heads these have also crockets the east end of the triforium range on the north is particularly good the east window of bishop alcocks chapel which was of course in existence long before his time is roundheaded with four lights and some good decorated tracery that to bishop wests chapel in the south aisle is of five lights of very late perpendicular character it may be noticed that the window in the north aisle is in the wall as originally built but in the south aisle the whole wall has been advanced further east as far as the bases of the buttresses both of the aisles have on the sides large pinnacled buttresses of graceful design and from all of these on the north and from some on the south there rise flying buttresses to support the roof of the presbytery and choir two of the bays on the south side have the early english triforium range unaltered this gives the original height of bishop hughs triforium walls below the parapet here is a characteristic corbel table these bays form the western portion of bishop hughs work in the presbytery illustration the lantern and south transept photochrom co ltd photo the retention of this little portion of the early english triforium is very interesting and instructive for we should otherwise not have known precisely how this part of the work had been carried out professor willis traced out with great care the alterations to which the presbytery had been subjected and his conclusions are given in canon stewarts book early triforium windows were only for lighting the triforium passage they were small and could not be seen from the floor of the church it will be noticed that the windows remaining in the portion spoken of are quite small and quite close to the floor the changes that were made in the three great norman minsters norwich peterborough and ely were made evidently for the purpose of introducing more light into the church the walls were raised the windows much enlarged and the slope of the roof consequently much flattened no doubt as regards dimensions bishop hughs triforium was a continuation of the norman triforium of the choir the first appearance of a high triforium outer wall is in bishop hothams work 13161337 in the following centuries this new form was extended by alterations first to hugh de northwolds presbytery and next to the nave but before the early english gallery had been thus completely transformed it happened that some architect apparently employed by bishop barnet 13661374 introduced in two of the southern compartments a method of getting rid of the gloom of the lowwindowed early english triforium which although perfectly successful within the church would if it had been carried throughout have been productive of a most injurious effect upon the appearance of the fabric within and without as may be seen at present in the compartments in question14 this method was to remove entirely the triforium roof and to convert the open arcade of the triforium towards the church into windows by filling the tracery with glass the designer thus introduced a flood of light upon the choir altar the shrines in the neighbourhood and bishop barnets tomb under the pier arch which is beneath one of these windows fortunately the experiment was not repeated after some time had elapsed the changes above indicated were carried out the low early english triforium outer wall was removed and the loftier decorated wall and windows erected in the extract above given it looks as if the removal of the triforium roof putting a lead roof to the aisle below and turning the triforium arches into windows were confined to these two bays on the south but the same thing was also done in the two corresponding bays on the north but there when the later raising of the triforium walls took place this raised wall was continued over the two bays in question and we do not now see there any remains of early english work illustration the priors doorway photochrom co ltd photo in the east wall of the south transept are broad geometrical windows of two lights each at the top of the southern face of this transept deeply recessed is an extraordinary perpendicular window of seven lights there seems no record of this being constructed by the remains of corbels in the lower part of the wall we see that there was once a covered passage here no doubt connecting the cloister with the chapterhouse beyond the transept are three norman doors of exceptional interest one indeed is in the west side of the transept and must have been the original entrance here into the church it is now quite blocked up with stone it has only recently been discovered there are remains of two norman doors the lower with enriched mouldings and shaft being considerably later in date than the round arch above it this latter has the nailhead ornament the northern end of the arch is concealed as well as the eastern end of the adjoining door into the south aisle by a mass of masonry built for a buttress the door into the south aisle is known as the monks door and is the regular entrance into the cathedral from the south it opened from the eastern walk of the cloister it is of later date than the wall in which it is placed the ornamentation is very rich one spiral column is especially noteworthy there is a trefoiled arch the cusps having circular terminations with the star ornament in the spandrels are quaint crouching monks each holding a pastoral staff above are two curiously twisted dragons the priors door is nearly at the west end of the north alley of the cloister like the monks door it is an insertion being later than the wall it is a very fine specimen of late norman the tympanum is filled with carving in high relief in the centre is the saviour seated enclosed within a vesica piscis his right hand uplifted in blessing his left hand resting on an open book his bare feet rest upon the border of the oval enclosure this oval is supported by two angels the arms which hold the upper part being abnormally lengthened on each side is a round shaft enriched with a deeply cut series of ornaments running in a spiral and at the head is a cushion capital with interlacing ornamentation on each side of the shaft is a square pillar the outer one having some curious figures of beasts and other objects enclosed in circular rings while the foliage of the inner one is singularly like a premature specimen of early english conventional decoration the topmost stone of this inner jamb is enlarged into a corbel to support the lintel and is carved with a large face the expense of the restoration of this doorway was undertaken by the bedfordshire architectural society15 one or two bays of the north alley of the cloister have been lately restored by canon dickson as a vestry for the choirboys these are not of course now open to the air against the wall of the church can be seen the norman arcading showing there were cloisters from the first while the remains of the windows towards the cloister enclosure to be seen in the north and east alleys tell us that they were rebuilt in the perpendicular period probably in the last quarter of the fifteenth century some corbels remain in the wall of the cathedral the roof of the cloister was therefore of wood but there are remains of vaulting to the west of the priors door so perhaps the western alley had a stone roof the first window to the west of the priors door is original norman all the rest except one were changed into three light windows apparently of the same date as those in the north aisle but have lately been reconstructed in the norman style this applies only to the windows in the aisle those in the triforium are of three lights similar to those removed from the aisle and those in the clerestory are the original norman just as on the north side footnotes 1 not many persons who travel by the great northern main line know that a good view of lincoln cathedral is to

of the structure1 very massive perpendicular arches have been built beneath the lofty norman ones and all the four great piers were surrounded with masonry at the same time both bentham and miller give the date 14051406 for the beginning of this work this date is quite consistent with the character of the mouldings of the arches there was at one time a plaster ceiling just above these lower arches above the inner west door is a series of panels bearing coats of arms so much resembling the fronts of galleries built for the accommodation of instrumental performerswhich were known as minstrels galleriesas to suggest the idea that the large room over the porch was devoted to this purpose the window above is an unfortunate insertion dating only from 1800 and this as well as the stained glass with which it is filled could well be spared the western transept and s catharines chapelthe transitional character of the late norman work here is more marked than on the outside of the west front it will be noticed that the great arches of the tower though retaining all other characteristics of the period are pointed there are two rows of mouldings and in the spandrels above are pointed ovals above the stringcourse are three stages the lowest has three sets of lofty trefoiled lancets supported by double detached shafts above is a similar series less lofty at the top are three large glazed windows the painted ceiling of the tower was mr le stranges first experiment in painting at ely some ancient decoration in the vault of the south aisle of the nave had been brought to light when he was on a visit at the deanery and this to some extent suggested the thought of painting the flat roof of the tower the subject is the creation we see the right hand of the lord the saviour holding a globe surrounded by the heavenly bodies of the fourth day of the creation the holy dove angels holding scrolls with the trisagion and all these are in circular designs united by branches of foliage a very sad accident occurred during the early period of the restoration of the tower in 1845 when mr basevi the architect met his death by falling from the upper floor of the scaffold which had been erected for the work he was buried in the cathedral and a brass has been laid over his grave he was not in any way professionally connected with the work of the restoration illustration the nave looking east the very late appearance of the highly enriched work in the south part of the western transept makes it probable that this part was completed in quite the latest years of the twelfth century the zigzag mouldings to the two arches in the east are of extraordinary richness one opens to the south aisle and one to s catharines chapel the whole of this arm of the transept was at one time walled off and the chapel itself was destroyed this has been rebuilt under the advice and authority of professor willis the woodford trustees of the theological college were at the expense of providing the alabaster altar and the chapel is now used for the daily service of the members of that college as well as for early celebrations of holy communion although now known as s catharines chapel it has never strictly speaking been so dedicated and the present dean has pointed out that the name was given under a misapprehension the font in the transept was the gift of canon selwyn its style is in keeping with the adjacent architecture the north portion of the western transept is entirely walled off no documentary evidence has been discovered to decide if it had been actually built the old tradition of the cathedral was that it had been finished by bishop eustace at the beginning of the thirteenth century the naveoriginally of thirteen bays but since the fall of the central tower of twelve bays the nave is a most complete and perfect specimen of late norman work the naves of ely and peterborough are conspicuously the best examples of the period in england in most respects they are very similar and it would be difficult to pronounce one superior to the other in one point indeed the superiority is with the ely nave there is not in it the slightest mixture of any transitional details at peterborough we can detect towards the west some unmistakable evidences of the approaching change in style it is believed that the nave was completed in the time of bishop riddellthat is before 1173 this is probably somewhat earlier than the nave at peterborough but both were obviously being built at the same time for the greater part of the period of their erection both are manifestly superior to norwich where to mention only one point the excessive height of the triforium arches and the comparative low elevation of the nave archesso that the two arcades are almost of the same dimensionsproduce an unpleasing effect but the work at norwich was earlier perhaps by thirty years than either of the others it is very difficult to obtain exact and authoritative measurements but those usually given supply the following comparisonnorwich 14 bays length of nave 250 feet peterborough 11 bays length of nave 228 feet ely 12 bays length of nave 208 feet from this it will be seen that before the tower fell the naves of ely and peterborough were almost exactly of the same length while the former had two more bays than the latter the piers are of alternate design in front of each an inner shaft runs up to the roof the stringcourse above the main arcade has the billet moulding all the attached shafts in all three stages have cushion capitals under each of the large triforium arches are two smaller ones though it has been said that there is no trace of any change of style throughout the entire nave yet it has been noticed that there is a certain roughness about the execution of the arches towards the east which is not seen further west the floors of the nave and its aisles are on one level but till recently the floors of the aisles were a few inches lower and this is believed to have been the original arrangement the clerestory range has three arches the central being the highest illustration panels in the nave ceiling photochrom co ltd photo the western half of the ceiling was painted by mr styleman le strange of hunstanton hall in norfolk between 1858 and 1861 he died in 1862 the eastern half was then undertaken by mr gambler parry of highnam court near gloucester and the main design of mr le strange was carried to a most successful issue the original idea had been that a jesse tree should commence at the seventh bay and the arrangement of the subjects towards the west was meant to lead up to this but mr le strange himself as the work proceeded realised that a grander effect would be produced by introducing larger scriptural subjects towards the east and mr gambier parry accordingly acted upon what was known to be the intention of the original designer it has been many times said that the whole design was suggested by the painted ceiling at hildesheim and some words of sir g g scott have been quoted as proof of this but dean goodwin says that the scheme was not taken in any way from the foreign example and that mr le strange had not seen the hildesheim ceiling when his design was formed2 it is worth noting that some of the faces of the prophets are portraits that of isaiah for instance is a portrait of dean peacock the general tone of the colouring is intentionally subdued and the effect of this is said to be to increase the apparent height of the nave the twelve subjects along the central portion of the ceiling commencing at the west are these 1 the creation 2 the fall 3 the sacrifice of noah 4 the sacrifice of isaac 5 jacobs dream 6 the marriage of ruth 7 jesse 8 david 9 the annunciation 10 the nativity 11 the adoration of the shepherds and of the magi 12 the lord in glory3 on the inner slope on each side of the central line for the ten western bays are figures of patriarchs and prophets each with a scroll bearing some of his own words all having prophetic reference to the messiah on the outer slope on each side are heads in circular medallions three in each bay the heads forming the border represent the human ancestors of our lord according to the genealogy in s lukes gospel they commence at the eastern end and terminate at the western thus linking together the glorified manhood as exhibited in the last of the pictorial representations with the creation of man in the first4 the sloping sides of the ceiling follow the course of the great beams supporting the roof till it was resolved to construct this ceiling the beams were exposed and the whole was open to the leads canon stewart speaks of it as a remarkable example of a trussed rafter roof of seven cants and says that such a roof was sometimes called a compass roof he thinks it might have taken the place of an original roof of the thirteenth century illustration the north aisle of the nave photochrom co ltd photo the nave aislesthese retain their groined roofs some remains of coloured decoration may be seen in various places especially in the south aisle and the appearance of more elaborate colouring at one place seems to indicate that there was a side altar beneath the roodscreen in the nave was by the pier in which is a small canopied niche in the north aisle beneath the windows is an arcade of roundheaded lancets four in each bay above the arcade was originally a string of chevron moulding running along the whole length of the aisle but this has been hacked off except beneath the most eastern window in the south aisle there are five such lancets in each bay west of the priors door and four in each bay beyond the windows east of this door are higher in the wall than the others because of the cloister and the wall arcade is correspondingly more lofty the chevron moulding remains in this aisle for seven bays after which until the last bay but one the marks of it are clearly to be seen one of the windows in the south aisle is original all the rest except one have been recently made like it in the north aisle all the windows are of the perpendicular period and have three lights under ogee arches all are filled with stained glass illustration the south aisle of the nave photochrom co ltd photo in the south aisle is placed an ancient memorial stone of the greatest interest it consists of the square base and part of the shaft of a cross it was brought here from haddenham where it had been used as a horseblock by mr bentham on the base is this inscription lvcem tvam ovino da devs et reqviem amen ovin has been named in the account of the foundress as being her chief agent to whom was entrusted the civil government of her territory there is every reason to believe that this cross was erected either by him or to his memory and if so it must be twelve centuries old just west of the monks door is the entrance to the recently constructed vestry for the choirboys this is thought to have been originally the entrance to the cloister library or bookcase the octagonfew visitors will perhaps be disposed to examine any of the objects of interest in the cathedral before an inspection of the beauties of this magnificent erection the first sight of which from one of the smaller arches towards the aisles is a thing never to be forgotten there is not one of the many able artists and architects who have written about the octagon that has not spoken of it as being without rival in the whole world and the admiration that was expressed fifty and more years ago would have been far greater and the enthusiasm more profound had the writers seen it in its present state of perfect restoration no description can do adequate justice to the grandeur of the conception or to the brilliancy of the execution of this renowned work the four great arches rise to the full height of the roof that to the east indeed is higher than the vaulted roof of the choir and presbytery the intervening space being occupied with tracery of woodwork on painted boards the saviour on the cross being painted in the middle the wooden vaulting of the octagon springs from capitals on the same level as those of the great arches the four small arches to the aisles are of course no higher than the roofs of the aisles above these on each side are three figures of apostles under canopies with crockets the figures are seated and each holds an emblem by which it can be seen for whom the figure is intended it may be noticed in the central figure on the southwest side that s paul not s matthias is put in the place of iscariot the hoodmoulds of the arches are terminated by heads of which six are portraits king edward iii and queen philippa are at the northeast bishop hotham and prior crauden at the southeast walsingham and his master mason so it is believed at the northwest those to the southwest are mere grotesques above the seated figures on each side is a window of four broad lights filled with stained glass the eight chief vaulting shafts rise from the ground as slight triple shafts they support a little above the spring of the side arches large corbels which form bases for exquisitely designed niches and through these spring more shafts reaching to the vault on each of the corbels is a boldly carved scene from the career of s etheldreda they commence at the northwest arch the subjects two to each arch are as follows northwest archs etheldredas second marriage her taking the veil at coldingham northeast archher staff taking root her preservation in the flood at s abbs head southeast archher installation as abbess of ely her death and burial two scenes southwest archone of her miracles her translation all these incidents have been sufficiently explained in the chapter on the history of the building with the exception of the seventh the authority for this is the liber eliensis a man named brytstan5 being ill had vowed that if he were restored to health he would become a monk upon his taking steps to carry out this intention he was charged with seeking refuge in a monastery simply to escape the consequences of robberies of which he had been guilty in his business after trial at huntingdon he was condemned and put in chains in prison in london after continuous prayers for the intercession of s etheldreda and s benedict these two saints appeared to him and the latter drew the links of the chain apart and set the prisoner free the miracle came to the knowledge of matilda henry is queen and investigations followed which resulted in the release of brytstan and he was conducted to ely with manifestations of joy some have thought that the ribands still to be bought at the stalls at the annual fair and known as s audreys laces are a reminiscence of this legend and that they represent the chains from which brytstan was delivered but the more probable explanation is that they refer to the disease that afflicted s etheldreda a swelling in the neck which she held to be a fit punishment for the vanity of her youthful days when she was fond of wearing necklaces and jewels saint audreys laces became corrupted into tawdry laces and so the adjective has been applied to all cheap and showy pieces of female ornament special attention may be given to some points in the sculpture of these corbels every one of which is worthy of careful study in 1 notice the figure of ovin previously named as the steward bearing an official staff or perhaps a sword in 2 the surrender of royal dignity is signified by the crown placed on the altar in 3 the leafbearing staff has an abundance of conventional foliage in 5 wilfrid bears a simple pastoral staff and not an archbishops cross as in previous scenesa point to which dean stubbs calls attention as indicating the historical accuracy of the designer because in former scenes the archbishop is represented in his own diocese while here he is a simple bishop in banishment in 6 there is a dignified figureprobably s sexburgastanding behind the priest who is ministering to the dying abbess in 7 the kneeling figure is s benedict handling the fetters until the plain colourwash with which the vault had been covered was removed in 1850 there was no knowledge of what had been the character of the original decoration traces of colouring were then discovered and in some places geometrical designs but there was no evidence of anything very elaborate the whole of the present decoration forms accordingly an entirely new design it is by mr gambier parry who himself painted the principal figures the central boss of the lantern is carved in oak and is original only its painting is new all the remaining figures are wholly new groups of seraphim bands of heavenly minstrels bearing all kinds of ancient musical instruments monograms and sacred emblems all combine to give a rich variety illustration the south transept photochrom co ltd photo the transeptsthe architectural student will find the transepts of the greatest interest as in them is to be seen the earliest work in the cathedral they are similar in general character to those at winchester which were built by abbot simeons brother the transepts at winchester were ready for consecration in 1093 and this was seven years before simeon came to ely the triforium is probably only in part simeons work and the clerestory was almost certainly added by his successor both transepts have aisles but in the south transept the western aisle is walled off along the western wall in the north transept is a stone bench the square capitals of the piers here have indentations at the corners and this is an early example of such indentation some slight ornamentation may be noticed in the cushions of the capitals especially in the south transept where there are traces of ancient colouring the three chapels to the east of the north transept are divided by walls and two have wooden screens one of these has been restored by professor stanton for use as a chapel for early celebrations and for private devotion some early paintings on the vaulted roof representing the martyrdom of s edmund are sufficient to justify this being called s edmunds chapel it is probable that this was the chantry on the green so called from the place of residence of the four chaplains founded by bishop northwold the screen in front of this chapel is exceedingly light and graceful it dates from about 1350 at one time it is said to have been in the south transept and afterwards where it now stands it was removed in 1865 but is now replaced in the south transept the whole of the eastern aisle is walled off for the library in the plan in benthams history 1770 only the single bay to the south is marked as the library the walls of partition between the chapels were taken down in 1814 the western aisle has always been separated by a low wall of norman date possibly a little later than the adjacent piers this wall has an intersecting arcade of round arches with a string of chevrons above this aisle is used as a vestry within is the ancient norman vaulting and there are some good original windows which cannot be seen from without except from the deanery gardens from the devices on the late perpendicular door it is clear that it belonged to some church erected by bishop alcock it was only brought here from landbeach about fifty years ago illustration the north transept photochrom co ltd photo the triforium and clerestory ranges are almost identical with those in the nave in the south transept the western windows of the triforium have been altered into threelight perpendicular windows the roofs of both transepts have been raised but it is not known at what time at the north end are two large windows of good perpendicular character at the south is a single window of seven lights of very singular design at the ends of the transepts are two original galleries level with the triforium supported on roundheaded arches on the north are five arches not of equal height the two most lofty of which reach nearly to the triforium level on the south are six much lower arches and above them is a blank arcade of intersecting arches in the floor of the south transept are laid some very remarkable ancient tiles illustration the choir screen photochrom co ltd photo the choir and presbyterya beautiful screen of oak with brass gates designed by scott divides the choir from the octagon it is of early geometric character and if there had been an original screen of this design it would have been intermediate in date between the presbytery and the choir the tracery is very graceful a rich cresting runs along the top cut through by the gable over the gates which bears a terminal cross on both sides the small niches have statuettes illustration elevation of the bays of the presbytery for exterior see p 55 the choir of three bays is the work of bishop hotham the last six bays are the work of bishop northwold and form the presbytery in the present arrangement seven of these nine bays form the ritual choir and two form the retrochoir the difference in date between the presbytery and choir may be roughly taken as very nearly a hundred years the former had been begun in 1240 the latter was nearly finished in 1340 in the juxtaposition of these two magnificent specimens of the early english and decorated periods of architecture there is an opportunity of comparison which on such a scale occurs nowhere else it is to be remembered that in neither case is the treatment of the upper part quite in accordance with the usual practice of the period when the presbytery was being built there were still standing east of the central tower the four original bays of the norman choir these it may be assumed were very similar in character to those in the nave there would beyond question have been in each bay large triforium arches each with a couple of subordinate arches and a single window in the clerestory with a blank arch on each side bishop northwolds work was purposely made to correspond with these bays as far as early english work could do so and when after the fall of the tower it became necessary to rebuild the choir bishop hotham in like manner made his decorated work correspond with the early english presbytery the choir is as would be expected richer in detail as well as more elaborate in design and it would be difficult to find in england anything to surpass the tracery of the clerestory windows and triforium arches the beautiful cusped inner arches of the clerestory range the open parapets at the base of the two stages or the long corbels covered with foliage that support the vaulting shafts in the choir the clerestory windows have four lights each in the presbytery are triplets the old colouring has been renewed throughout on the north side of the choir the three bays are precisely alike but on the south there is a variation in the tracery of the western triforium arch there are also shields of arms of the see of ely and of bishop hotham in the spandrels of the triforium and arch below and the shaft between this arch and the next is enlarged at the top into a base for a statue probably of s etheldreda while level with the string above is a very fine large canopy called by the workmen the table which is like nothing else in the cathedral the clerestory windows also on the south have different tracery illustration the choir looking west photochrom co ltd photo the difference between the two styles of architecture is well marked in the groining of the roof the decorated portion being much more elaborate some of the bosses are very remarkable one has s etheldreda with pastoral staff one has the coronation of the virgin mary one has the foundress bearing the model of a church in which as dean stubbs has pointed out both arms of the western transept are represented so that it is a fair inference that at the time this roof was constructed the whole of the western transept was standing illustration the triforium of the choir and presbytery photochrom co ltd photo between the choir and presbytery there rise the massive norman piers built as the entrance to the apse and these are the only remains of the norman church east of the octagon since the careful examination of the foundations here made by professor willis in 1850 it is not thought certain that the apse was actually built the foundations of the apse were very manifest and the design did not include a passage round it but there was also clear evidence that the apsidal foundation was altered into a straight wall of the same thickness and the probability is that before the apse was built it was resolved to convert it into a squareended presbytery such as we now see at oxford cathedral and st cross6 illustration the choir stalls north side photochrom co ltd photo the two most western triforium arches in the presbytery are glazed the roof of the triforium itself being wholly removed the object of this alteration has been fully explained in the account of the exterior of the cathedral on the ground beneath were the shrines and under one of the arches was erected not long afterwards the monument of bishop barnet in whose time and at whose expense the alteration was made the arrangement of the lancets at the east end is even more effective within than without the east end of ely says professor freeman is the grandest example of the grouping of lancets ely is also undoubtedly the head of all east ends and eastern limbs of that class in which the main body of the church is of the same height throughout and in which the aisles are brought out to the full length of the building7 it will hardly be believed that the magnificent stalls which were formerly ranged in the octagon and at a later period in the presbytery were once painted all over with a mahogany colour they are the finest decorated stalls in england the beautiful ones at winchester being of late thirteenthcentury date the carved panels in the upper parts are new and are the gifts of individual donors they were executed in belgium it is not known how these spaces were originally filled mr le strange thought possibly with heraldic devices the designs on the south are from the new testament those on the north from the old testament the seats in the lower range are also modern as are the various statuettes at the stall ends which represent the builders of the most important parts of the fabric on the misereres of the ancient stalls are some wonderful grotesque carvings the brass eagle lectern has been copied as to its main features from an ancient example at isleham the organ is in the triforium on the north and part of the case projects over the easternmost arch of the choir the reredos is the first example in modern cathedral work of the elaborate style of decoration for the most holy part of the sanctuary which is now not uncommon it was the gift of mr john dunn gardner of chatteris and was designed by scott it forms the central portion of a screen of stone which extends for the whole width of the presbytery the lower part of the whole is of deeply cut diaperwork the upper part has an open arcade of six arches each with a mullion and tracery in the early decorated style the reredos itself is of alabaster and consists of five main arches under canopies and with tracery and is ornamented with a rich abundance of mosaic work panels medallions statuettes twisted columns and various kinds of carving five scenes from the last days of our lords life on earth are carved in relief under canopies beneath the chief arches a full description giving all the details of the sculpture and the materials of the mosaic and the different persons and emblematic graces represented by the busts and figures would require more space than we can give the altar cross of silver gilt is in memory of bishop woodford illustration the reredos photochrom co ltd photo illustration the ladychapel photochrom co ltd photo the ladychapelnotwithstanding the cruel mutilation of the sculpture all round this chapel it can be seen that for perfection of exquisite work there is no building of the size in this country worthy for one moment to be compared with this in its unmutilated state its single defect strikes the beholder at once the span of the roof is too broad and the vaulting too depressed for the size of the chapel the windows of which those on the north have been restored have already been described the end windows which are of great size are of later date that to the east has a look of transition work about it the building was finished in 1349 and the east window was inserted by bishop barnet circa 1373 for a possible explanation of the insertion of this window only a quarter of a century after the completion of the chapel see ante p 52 it is not thought probable that the original designers left anything incomplete the great beauty of the interior consists in the series of tabernacle work and canopies that runs round all the four sides below and between the windows the heads of the canopies project in the tracery beneath at the head of the mullion was a statue the delicate carving of the cusps and other tracery is varied throughout on the spandrels were incidents connected with the history of the virgin mary mainly legendary and of julian the apostate and though in no single instance is a perfect uninjured specimen left yet enough remains in all but a few cases for the original subjects to be identified8 all was once enriched with colour and many traces remain and in various parts of the windows there are fragments of stained glass most of the monumental tablets which once disfigured the arcade below the windows have been happily removed into the vestibule the arches and canopies at the east end are arranged differently from those on the sides in the roof which reminds us of the contemporary roof in the choir are some carved bosses not large but singularly good among the subjects can be recognised a crucifixion with halffigures beside the cross adam and eve the virgin mary and elizabeth holding between them a book inscribed magnificat the annunciation with ave maria gracia plena the ascension indicated by the skirt and feet of the saviour and five heads of apostles the coronation of the virgin and the virgin in an aureole illustration doorway of the ladychapel rev t perkins photo the arrangements for worship present an appearance very unlike those of sixty years ago a writer in 1876 writing of his early recollections says when i first knew ely the state of the ladychapelthen as now used as a parish churchwas so miserable from decay violence and neglect that it was simply painful to enter it now welldesigned benches have replaced the mean deal square pews the whitewash and yellowwash which thickly clogged the carving has been removed the windows have been repaired and made watertight and the altar and its adjuncts made to assume an air of reverent dignity we do not remember to have anywhere seen an explanation of the fact that this chapel is now used as the parish church of holy trinity parish whereas the old church the destruction of which occasioned the appropriation of the ladychapel to parochial use was dedicated to s cross monuments and stained glassit is convenient to treat the monuments as a separate subject so as not to break the continuity of the architectural description we will commence at the west proceeding along the north aisle and so round the cathedral pointing out those that have anything of special interest against the blocked doorway which gave access to the church of s cross is placed an altartomb to the late bishop woodford see below p 129 the figure of the bishop is vested in cope and mitre and has a pastoral staff the crucifixion is on the wall at the back there are several shields of arms relating to the bishops career or to the cathedral history among these are those of the merchant taylors company at whose school he was educated pembroke college cambridge of which he was a member and of other colleges at cambridge founded by bishops of ely three tablets in this north aisle near the transept record donations towards the repaving of the nave and aisles in 1676 1869 and 1873 there is no monumental memorial in the nave but the large slab of marble in the centre just in front of the position of the old roodloft which has been already referred to as traditionally marking the grave of alan de walsingham should be noticed under the four arches of the presbytery on the north between the stalls and the altar are monuments of great importance first we see that of bishop redman d 1505 a very fine specimen of enriched perpendicular work the mitred figure of the bishop is on an altartomb beneath a richly groined roof and a space is left at the feet where a priest might stand to pray for the soul of the deceased prelate9 there are grand canopies on the sides with crockets and coloured shields bearing emblems of the crucifixion the arms of the see of ely and of s asaph where bishop redman was at first but the arms of the see of exeter from which diocese he came to ely as now used are not to be seen above the roof is fine open screenwork and against the adjoining piers east and west are large canopied niches next to this is the effigy of bishop kilkenny d 1256 a fine example of early english the figure has cope mitre and staff the bishops heart only was buried here illustration the north choir aisle in the next arch is a large decorated structure of two stories believed by scott to have been built by walsingham as the base for the shrine of s etheldreda it was formerly known as bishop hothams shrine and his effigy was placed beneath it the lower story is open in the arch north of the altar is the tomb of the builder of the presbytery bishop northwold d 1254 he is represented in full vestments at the east of the tomb is a curious carving apparently meant for the martyrdom of s edmund a king naked above the middle except for his kingly crown is tied to a tree and pierced by arrows archers with drawn bows are behind at one end the king has his head still crowned in his hands with a figure bearing a sword over him at the other side is either the wolf of the legend or an evil spirit in animal shape in the aisle itself are several memorials mostly of the eighteenth century that call for no special mention the latest is the brass to mr basevi 1845 at the east end of the aisle is the chapel of bishop alcock d 1500 the date 1488 is fixed precisely by the inscribed stone now placed in the wall above a small stone altar the stone in the wall has five crosses as though intended for a chantry altar but the slab of the altar beneath has no crosses the inscription is iohanes alkoc epus eliesis hanc fabricam fieri fecit m cccc iiijxx viij the sides of the chapel are covered with niches canopies crockets panels and devices the roof has fan tracery with a massive pendant a singular little chantry is at the north access to which is through a door at the foot of the bishops tomb in a small window here is a little contemporary stained glass the bishops rebusa cock on a globerepeatedly occurs in the stonework the ornamentation strikes the spectator as being excessive and too profuse no figures have been replaced in the niches in the retrochoir a mosaic slab over the remains of bishop allen d 1845 has a curious history a son of the bishop was passing through paris soon after napoleons tomb was finished and the surplus materials were offered for sale by auction some of these were purchased by mr allen and utilised for the slab over the bishops grave the large monument to canon mill d 1853 has an effigy in copper on a support of marble and alabaster students of india and cambridge are by the feet the tomb of cardinal luxemburg d 1443 is beneath the most eastern arch on the south just north of bishop wests chapel when the monument was concealed behind some woodwork great dispute arose as to the headdress of the effigy bentham has an engraving with a cardinals hat on the archbishops head cole records that it was a mitre when the woodwork was removed it was found that the figure was headless as it still remains illustration the early english presbytery and the supposed shrine of s etheldreda corresponding to the chapel of bishop alcock on the north is that of bishop west d 1533 in the south aisle this is a most valuable example of the renaissance style the niches and canopies with which the walls are covered are much smaller than those in the other chapel and consequently more numerous but by reason of the great delicacy of the tracery and the wonderful variety of the designs there is no impression that the decoration is overdone no perfect specimen is left of the statues or of the heads which were introduced in the tabernacle work and in its complete state this exquisite work can have existed for not more than twelve or thirteen years as the order in council for removing images was made in 1548 the roof is curious as being an adaptation in the renaissance of the late gothic fan tracery some colouring remains the wroughtiron gates with motto in latin several times repeated and the curious little pendants from the roof consisting of angels bearing shields of arms should be noticed bishops greene d 1738 keene d 1781 sparke d 1836 and woodford d 1885 are all buried in this chapel on the south side within a shrinelike receptacle have been placed the relics of seven early benefactors of the church originally buried in the saxon church they have been several limes removed they were placed here in 1771 the names are carved in seven shallow niches one was an archbishop five were bishops and the seventh was alderman brithnoth the dates range from 991 to 1067 the very interesting early norman monumental slab with carving in relief preserved in the aisle does not strictly belong to the cathedral having been found at s marys church above a roundheaded canopy are some norman buildings in the chamfer of the canopy is an invocation of the archangel michael a figure of whom below has wings and nimbus and in the robe a portion of a naked figure with pastoral staff beside it illustration bishop alcocks chapel proceeding westward the monuments under the windows are those of canon selwyn d 1875 bishop gunning d 1684 wearing a mitre with long hair and short beard and bishop heton d 1609 in a cope and having an ample beard under the arches of the presbytery after the huge tablet to bishop moore d 1714 are four monuments the first is all that is left of the tomb of bishop hotham d 1337 the next has figures of john tiptoft earl of worcester kg and his two wives the earl was beheaded in 1470 and is not interred here one of the wives was cecily neville sister of richard earl of warwick the kingmaker of the tomb of bishop barnet d 1373 the base only remains it resembles in general character the monument of bishop northwold illustration bishop wests chapel under the last arch of the presbytery is the fine monument of bishop louth d 1298 it is a very beautiful early decorated composition two brasses remain in the floor of the south aisle both of great interest the famous brass of bishop goodrich d 1554 represents him in full vestments wearing a chasuble not a cope with mitre and pastoral staff see below p 124 this is specially noteworthy as he was an enthusiastic supporter of the reformation changes and is believed to have encouraged if he did not order the wholesale destruction of statues and other ornamentation of the cathedral he was lord chancellor for three years and the great seal is figured on the brass dean tyndall d 1614 is represented in a very different style he is figured in academical dress wearing a ruff and a skullcap and with a long beard on one of the shields of arms may be seen the arms of the deanery impaling tyndall very many other tablets and inscriptions remain but we have no space for a more extended treatment of the subject in the south transept is a tablet to dean merivale d 1894 with a likeness in slight relief and mention of this gives opportunity for saying that the very greatest care seems to have been taken to secure good likenesses in the most recent monuments those of three as to which the writer can speak from personal knowledgebishop woodford dean merivale and canon selwynbeing of conspicuous merit it would require a book to itself to treat exhaustively of the stained glass in the windows in nearly all cases certainly in those which can be examined without the aid of a glass the names of the donors or of the persons to whose memory the windows were inserted are plainly set forth either in the windows or on brass tablets adjoining it should be stated that the greatest encouragement to this form of decoration was given by canon e b sparke who secured partly by his influence and persuasion and largely by his own munificence the insertion of so many windows it is true that in the first instance not a few were prepared in too great a hurry and some of those first placed in the restored cathedral as those in the octagon have been at a later time condemned as being deficient in harmony of colouring and in artistic design but there is little fault to be found with the most recent additions among so many it is inevitable that very different degrees of merit will be exhibited it has been said that the entire series is an exemplification of the horatian maxim sunt bona sunt qudam mediocria sunt mala plura and except that we should be disposed to exchange the position of the words qudam and plura if the metre allowed it with this sentiment we agree footnotes 1 quite recently further security has been attained by a system of iron bracing not visible from

iv history of the monastery all that need be said of the original establishment at ely has already been told in the account of the foundress there is no doubt that in the monastery there were religious persons of both sexes dean stubbs says the mixed community was the fashion of the time1 and he gives coldingham kildare and three in normandychelles autun brie and fontevraultas examples of similar foundations in this instance the abbess was the head of all and this accounts for bedes calling the house a nunnery what name was given to the superior of the mens part does not appear of all the abbesses who ruled over this twin monastery we know only the names of the first four and all these were in due time canonised these were s etheldreda 673679 s sexburga 679699 s ermenilda 699 and s werburga dates unknown if we allow ten years for the duration of the rule of the last two we still have the names of the abbesses for only thirtysix years out of the one hundred and ninetyseven years that the institution lasted it is said to have been in a very flourishing condition when the danes came to destroy it and there is no hint anywhere that there was not a continuous succession of abbesses during the whole period s sexburga the elder sister of the foundress succeeded her as abbess she was the widowed queen of ercombert king of kent and had herself founded the monastery of sheppey at the place now known as minster and set over it her daughter ermenilda another widowed queen s sexburga joined the house at ely and had resided there some time before her sisters death the body of s etheldreda was in her time removed into the church under the superintendence of archbishop wilfrid bede gives a full account of the translation the monks who had the charge of providing a stone coffin suitable for the reception of the remains of the foundress are said to have found one of marble among the ruins of grantchester the name of the old town of cambridge when disinterred the body was reported free from all corruption the account would not be complete without the customary miraclesmarvellous cures effected by touching the clothes and coffin and by the healing efficacy of a spring that flowed from the place of the first interment this translation took place on october 17th 695 this is the day assigned to the commemoration of s etheldreda the importance of this festival is sometimes held to account for the fact that the feast of s luke on october 18th is not preceded by a fast but as no fast is assigned to the vigils of the conversion of s paul s mark or saints philip and james it is questionable if this opinion is sound upon the death of s sexburga in 699 her body was laid in the church next to that of her sister the next abbess was her daughter s ermenilda her husband had been wulphere king of mercia who died in 675 she had been professed at ely and left to become the head of her mothers foundation at sheppey the date of her death is not known she was succeeded both at sheppey and at ely by her daughter s werburga how long she ruled at ely is not recorded she was buried by her own desire at hanbury in staffordshire when the danes reached derbyshire in their incursions this was deemed no longer a safe place and her body was removed to chester where the cathedral was afterwards placed under the joint invocation of s werburga and s oswald2 the reason why it is suggested above that ten years may be taken as the limit of time to be assigned to the rules of s ermenilda and s werburga is that the author of her life3 says that her body was taken up 9 years after her decease to translate it to a more eminent part of hanbury church by order of ceolred king of mercia as this king died at latest in 717 it would follow that s werburga must have died not later than 708 probably in the isle of ely more special respect was paid to the festivals of these four sainted abbesses than elsewhere but we find no churches dedicated to any of the four in the isle except those previously named as dedicated to s etheldreda the cathedral histon and a chapel at swaffham prior minster church in kent is dedicated to saints mary and sexburga in a tenthcentury will of the widowed queen of edmund i we read i give to s peters and to s theldryth and to s wihtburh and to s sexburh and to s eormenhild at ely where my lords body rests the three lands which we both promised to god and his saint4 there were no doubt sidealtars erected in honour of one or more of the four at wisbech for instance there was a light of s etheldreda to which we find persons bequeathing small sums of the monastery of s etheldreda and that of bishop ethelwold professor freeman writes that there is no continuity between the two5 by this we must probably understand that he considered the original monastery absolutely at an end after its destruction by the danes and that the monastery founded in its place a century later was something quite new that had no claim to be regarded as the continuation of the former one but the history of the place during the interval was not an absolute blank the danish destruction took place in 870 the reconstruction by king edgar and bishop ethelwold took place in 970 in the monastery so founded or as most would prefer to say resuscitated there were no nuns it has been pointed out that at ely unlike other religious houses in the district there was not complete desolation during the century intervening between the destruction of the former and the construction of the latter house some clergy banded themselves together and formed a religious community of what precise character is not known but apparently it was something in the nature of a college of secular priests when the second monastery arose these clergy were either absorbed or evicted brithnoth 970981 was the first abbot he had been prior of winchester he devoted his energies to the consolidation of the new house securing many fresh endowments settling the boundaries of the isle of ely and laying out the grounds of the abbey in beautiful order the church possessed only the bodies of three of the four saints connected with the original foundation there being no hope of recovering the fourth bishop ethelwold and the abbot resolved to find a substitute in the body of s withburga the youngest sister of s etheldreda her youth had been spent at holkham in norfolk where the church is now said to be dedicated to her and afterwards founded a nunnery at dereham in the same county where she died and was buried a long account is given by bentham6 of the trickery by which her body was purloined and brought to ely where it was interred near the bodies of the three abbesses7 brithnoth is said to have been murdered at the instigation of queen elfrida having grievously offended her in many ways especially by reproving her infamous and abandoned life this is the same elfrida who two years before had caused her stepson king edward thence called the martyr to be assassinated in order that her own son ethelred the unready might have the crown edward only reigned four years but during that time much that his father king edgar had done towards establishing the monastic rule in england was set aside in some instances the monastic rule was quashed and minsters dissolved and monks driven out and gods servants put down whom king edgar had ordered the holy bishop ethelwold to establish8 the queen confessed before her death to having compassed the death of abbot brithnoth his body was conveyed to ely for interment he was succeeded by elsin 9811016 of a noble family in his time very considerable donations and bequests were made to the monastery in some cases members of the house who rose to eminence and obtained lucrative appointments became benefactors sometimes the parents of young men who joined the society testified their confidence by munificent gifts sometimes widows gave manors and lands in their lifetimes or in their wills in one case at least much wealth was acquired by way of penance leofwin a man of large possessions in a violent fit of anger had occasioned the death of his own father in his remorse he betook himself to rome to obtain absolution undertaking to perform any penance that might be enjoined the pope required him to dedicate his eldest son to the religious life in some monastery which he was liberally to endow and to bestow largely of his substance to the relief of the poor his son edelmor was accordingly devoted to the service of god at ely and very large estates were assigned by leofwin to the monastery he further improved the church rebuilding and enlarging the south aisle and joining it to the rest of the building and in one of its porches or sidechapels in uno porticu he built an altar to the virgin mary erecting over it a stately image of gold and silver adorned with valuable jewels it is probably to this altar that reference is made when we find some speak as if there were a ladychapel in existence before the present one at leofwins death his body was buried in the church and to it he bequeathed his entire property alderman brithnoth a man of great rank and eminence and of great reputation as a soldier was another considerable benefactor on one occasion he was marching with his forces from the north to encounter the danes who had been plundering in suffolk and had reached essex passing ramsey abbey he sent word to the abbot that he proposed to stop there with his men for refreshment but the abbot though willing to entertain the alderman and a few select friends declined the honour of providing for his troops this did not suit brithnoth and he went on to ely there the whole company was hospitably entertained and brithnoth was so pleased that he on the next day made over to the monastery a number of manors into their immediate possession and also assigned certain others on condition that if he should be slain in battle his body should be buried at ely in the battle the english forces were outnumbered and brithnoth fell the danes taking his head away with them in their triumph on hearing of his death the abbot and some of the monks went to the scene of the engagement recovered the body and interred it with all honour in their church a great accession of dignity was granted by king ethelred while his brother king edward was on the throne ethelred with his mother had visited the tomb of s etheldreda and professed great admiration for her character and work when ethelred became king he granted to the churches of ely canterbury and glastonbury the office of chancellor of the kings court putting as it were the office in commission so the abbot of each place or his deputy officiated as chancellor for periods of four months each this privilege was only retained till the time of the normans elsin died in a good old age after a life of great sanctity and observance of the commandments of god and after the acquisition of much honour and great possessions to the church his death took place according to the liber eliensis in king ethelreds timethat is not later than 1016 wharton gives 1019 as the date possibly the unsettled state of the kingdom may have caused the abbey to be vacant for three years at the battle of assendun 1016 some of the monks of ely as well as ednod bishop of dorchester and the abbot of ramsey were slain the ely monks took with them to the camp the relics of s wendreda which were there lost and never recovered canute is thought to have acquired them and to have bestowed them upon the church of canterbury the body of bishop ednod was brought to ely with the intention of taking it on to ramsey where he had been abbot for interment but when the body arrived at ely it was buried privately by night in the church of leofwin called also oschitel 10191022 who is given in the lists as the third abbot nothing whatever is known except that he was deposed by the monks and reinstated after a journey to rome by the pope his successor leofric 10221029 who had been prior is remembered only as being abbot when archbishop wulstan of york and bishop alfwin of elmham were buried at ely and when divers possessions were acquired by gift or bequest of a certain countess godiva leofsin 10291045 like his predecessor was appointed by king canute canute was much in the eastern counties and he is said to have made a point when possible of keeping the feast of the purification at ely that being the date on which the abbots turn as chancellor commenced it was on one of these occasions while coming by water with his queen and nobles that the remarkable incident occurred of his hearing the monks singing in the distance and breaking out himself into verse four lines of his song have been preserved9 the latin of them as given in the liber eliensis runs thus dulce cantaverunt monachi in ely dum canutus rex navigaret prope ibi nunc milites navigate propius ad terram et simul audiamus monachorum harmoniam the incident has attracted many writers and not a few poems have been written upon it wordsworths sonnet on the subject commences a pleasant music floats along the mere from monks in ely chanting service high while as canute the king is rowing by my oarsmen quoth the mighty king draw near that we the sweet song of the monks may hear and in a ballad upon chelsea a quarter of new york where the general theological seminary of the american church is situated a poet of that communion has these verses when old cante the dane was merry englands king a thousand years agone and more as ancient rymours sing his boat was rowing down the ouse at eve one summer day where elys tall cathedral peered above the glassy way anon sweet music on his ear comes floating from the fane and listening as with all his soul sat old cante the dane and reverent did he doff his crown to join the clerkly prayer while swelled old lauds and litanies upon the stilly air10 ely minster was however not a cathedral in canutes time and it is a strange poetical licence that can describe an evening just before the feast of the purification as a summer day perhaps the greatest distinction belonging to the monastery at this period was the honour of having educated king edward the confessor he had been brought here in his infancy and offered by his parents on the altar and it was a constant tradition with the monks that he used to take great delight in learning to sing psalms and godly hymns among the children of his own age in the cloister on which account he always retained a favourable regard to the place after he became king11 in 1036 the year after canutes death edward and his brother alfred came over from normandy to england ostensibly to visit their mother queen emma who lived at winchester but really to ascertain the feeling of the nation with regard to the succession to the throne alfred fell into the hands of earl godwin by whose orders he was deprived of his eyes and committed to the custody of the monks of ely he lived a very short time after this cruel treatment and died and was buried at ely abbot wilfric 10451065 came from winchester he was a kinsman of edward the confessor through this relationship as well as from personal connection with the place the king greatly favoured the abbey he granted a confirmatory charter himself and obtained a bull from the pope confirming all the rights and privileges of the church but several of the possessions of the abbey were lost in wilfrics time in one instance the high constable of england seized a village belonging to the monks proceedings were taken against him and sentence pronounced but he evaded even the kings orders and at last actually secured the possession of the village for his own life after which it was to revert to the true owners after the conquest however all the lands of this nobleman were seized by the conqueror this village among the rest nor could the church of ely ever regain it in another instance abbot wilfric himself was the cause of the loss of much landed property in order to advance his brother he conveyed to him without the consent of the monastery several estates upon discovery the abbot withdrew from ely in sorrow and disgrace and soon fell sick and died as in the previous case a composition was effected between guthmund the late abbots brother and the monks whereby he was to retain the lands for his life but as before these lands were alienated after the conquest and never recovered abbot thurstan 10661072 was appointed by king harold and was the last saxon abbot he was a native of the isle of ely having been born at witchford he naturally took the part of edgar athelingwhom he regarded as the rightful heir after harold was killedagainst william the conqueror he gave every support to the many who gathered together in the isle as to a fastness and encouraged the plans of hereward when the cause of the english seemed hopeless the monks endeavoured to persuade the soldiers to surrender not being successful they sent messengers to the king assuring him of their sorrow at having taken part against him and promising to behave better in future afterwards the abbot himself went and gave the king much information about the place and the best method of subduing it but when the isle was finally subdued the king signified his great displeasure at the behaviour of the monks and exacted a heavy fine he is said to have gone in person to the minster after his victory and to have made an offering at the altar but the monks were under such strict surveillance and the kings visit was so secret that no one knew of his coming till after he was gone thurstan escaped deprivation by his complete submission and prudent conduct and remained abbot till his death in 1072 but it appears that the monks had not thoroughly made their peace with the conqueror by the time of abbot thurstans death for we read eodem anno monachi elienses quibusdam anglorum magnatibus contra regem willelmum rebellantibus succursum prbentes exlegati sunt12 he was succeeded by a norman theodwin 10721075 a monk of jumiges this was a benedictine abbey of great repute in the diocese of rouen its church had been built during the abbacy of robert afterwards archbishop of canterbury and he died and was buried at jumiges theodwin was present at the council of london in 1075 he died the same year for upwards of six years the affairs of the monastery were administered by godfrey one of the monks he was an able and efficient administrator in his time the king sent a number of knights and gentlemen to live at ely and he supported them out of the revenues of the house the names and armorial bearings of these pensioners are preserved in a curious painting called the tabula eliensis now in the palace this is a copy as it is said of one formerly in the refectory it cannot be earlier than the fifteenth century there are in it forty compartments in each of which is represented a knight and a monk the names of both being given above and the arms of the knights being placed beside their heads some of the names are still to be found among the nobility and gentry of england and in some instances the very same armorial bearings are used this is the case in the families of lacy st leger montfort clare touchet furnival fulke newbury lucy talbot fitzallen longchamp it need hardly be pointed out that no contemporary norman painting could have given such shields of arms to the different knights heraldry having only established itself as a science in england in the thirteenth century the affairs of the abbey had been in a very unsettled state since the time when the camp of refuge was attacked so many of the estates of the church having been granted to norman followers of the conqueror but the kings resentment at last gave way and he was induced to sanction an inquiry into the rights and liberties of the monastery he appointed his brother odo then bishop of bayeux to summon an assembly of barons sheriffs and others interested in the matter to consider and determine the claims of the monks the meeting was held at kentford in suffolk and the report was so favourable that the king directed the church to be put into possession of all the rights customs and privileges which it enjoyed at the time of king edwards death godfrey the administrator being made abbot of malmesbury an abbot was at length given to ely in the person of simeon 10811093 he was prior of winchester and brother to walkelin bishop of winchester he was very old when he came to ely but though upwards of eightysix years of age at the time he remained abbot for more than twelve years he laid the foundations of the present church and completed some part of the building as has been previously told he died in 109313 king william ii immediately took possession of the abbey estates let them to various tenants and appointed a receiver to pay the rents into his treasury this arrangement lasted during the remainder of his reign king henry i upon coming to the throne at once restored the liberties of the church and made richard 11001107 abbot he was a norman and a kinsman of the king as his grandfather earl gilbert was descended from robert duke of normandy he successfully resisted the claim of the bishop of lincoln to give him benediction though simeon had received benediction from bishop remigius in the council of london in 1102 abbot richard with many others was deposed anselmus archiepiscopus concilio convocato apud londiniam rege consentiente plures deposuit abbates vel propter simoniam vel propter aliam vit infamiam14 the abbots of burgh ramsey and ely were three of nine so deposed the liber eliensis attributes richards deposition to the intrigues of the court the pope annulled the sentence in the following year this abbot proceeded with the building of the church and seems to have finished the norman transepts and choir and perhaps the whole of the norman tower he is however most worthy of note from having been the first to suggest the creation of the see of ely he submitted the idea to the king who was quite favourable and he then sent messengers to the pope to obtain his approval before this could be secured the abbot died but in little more than two years after his death the proposal was carried into effect richard was the last of the ten abbots hervey bishop of bangor had the management of the affairs of the abbey for the next two years his rigorous discipline at bangor had aroused very violent opposition which came at last to armed insurrection and the bishop had withdrawn to the kings court for safety when appointed administrator of the abbey at ely he exerted himself to bring to a successful conclusion the creation of the bishopric the consent of the bishop of lincoln to the subdivision of his diocese was secured by a grant of the manor of spaldwick at a council of london in 1108 the enormous size of the lincoln diocese was under consideration and ely seemed on every account to be the best place for the cathedral of a new diocese to be taken from it the pope was entirely favourable to the design though the letters announcing the popes consent were dated november 21st 1108 it was not till october 1109 that the king granted his charter for constituting the bishopric in this he nominated hervey to be the first bishop in accordance with the recommendation of the pope himself the monastery did not come to an end by the substitution of a bishop for an abbot but for the purposes of this handbook concerned as it is mainly with the fabric of the cathedral the remainder of the historical portion will be associated with the names of the bishopsnot that by any means the most important works connected with the church were due to the initiation of the bishops nor was the cost always or indeed generally defrayed by them the monastic body spent large sums upon the building as has been seen in the case of the octagon but these works are mostly to be credited to the whole body and except in a few cases which are duly noticed are not assigned specially to the prior who was the head of the house at the time illustration bishop alcocks chantry from the retrochoir footnotes 1 memorials of ely p 18 gloucester is

diocese felix had indeed first been buried at dunwich but probably from fear of the danes the body had been removed to soham but soham itself in its turn was utterly destroyed by the danes and the remains of the bishop became neglected in 1020 the abbot of ramsey obtained permission to move them to his abbey and while he was doing this the monks of ely set out with the intention of intercepting the convoy and securing the body for their own church a dense fog prevented the ely men from reaching the monks of ramsey 8 annals of england i p 115 9 the saxon version together with some valuable

chronicon angli petriburgense sub anno 1102 chapter v history of the see ely thus became a cathedralof the kind that was called conventual cathedrals no such cathedral had a dean and canons till the time of henry viii the prior and convent were the custodians of the fabric and perhaps to a certain extent they acted as the bishops council and the bishop as representing the abbot had the right to preside in the chapterhouse whenever he chose1 the bishop also had the power of appointing several of the officers of the monastery and of displacing them at ely the priors were appointed by the bishop until 1198 in 1197 the offices of bishop and prior were vacant at the same time and the convent was unable to elect a bishop without having a prior so the archbishop of canterbury authorised the monks to proceed to the election of a prior and it is believed that subsequent priors were all elected by the monks and not appointed by the bishop the first bishop as has been seen was hervey 11091131 bishop of bangor2 he had been consecrated in 1102 his ecclesiastical discipline in wales was very strict and he made many enemies and he thought to carry out his spiritual censures with the help of armed forces but insurrections arose in one of which his own brother and several of his company were slain upon this bishop hervey made his way to the english court where he remained until he was sent to take charge of ely monastery at the death of abbot richard he was bishop here for nearly twentytwo years and was most active and painstaking in managing the very difficult business of settling the affairs of the bishopric and monastery in such a way that justice was done to both he died in 1131 after two years nigel 11331169 was made bishop he was prebendary of s pauls and also treasurer to king henry i this latter office necessitated his continuous absence from his diocese and may also serve to explain the very active part he took in the civil wars he espoused the cause of the empress matilda and built a castle at ely as a military position where a good stand could be made against the partisans of stephen more than once he narrowly escaped being taken and when at first stephens cause prospered all bishop nigels estates and property were seized when the chances of war favoured matilda he recovered the isle of ely and was fully restored to his bishopric by this time he had had enough of fighting and made his peace with stephen but his troubles were not at an end as he was going to consult some friends who were with the empress upon a matter unconnected with politics he was nearly taken prisoner by a party of the kings forces losing all his baggage and everything he had with him being summoned to rome he was in his absence suspected of favouring the kings enemies and his possessions were again seized only with great difficulty and after paying a large fine did he obtain stephens pardon at one time he was suspended by the pope pro bonis ecclesise suse dispersis but the suspension was removed on condition that he restored the goods when king henry ii came to the throne nigel was made baron of the exchequer some have attributed to him the foundation of the hospital for canons regular dedicated to s john at cambridge an institution afterwards absorbed in lady margarets college of s john the evangelist he died in 1169 there was an interval of four years before a new bishop was appointed and it was more than five before geoffrey riddell 11741189 was consecrated he was one of the kings chaplains a baron of the exchequer and archdeacon of canterbury the delay in his consecration was due to a disagreement between king henry ii and his son henry who had actually been crowned the latter considering that he ought to have a voice in the appointment the dispute was not settled without an appeal to rome bishop riddell furthered the building of the church and embellished it in various ways he also recovered some property that had been taken away before consecration he had been compelled to profess publicly that he had had nothing to do with the murder of archbishop becket mortem s thom archiepiscopi neque verbo neque facto neque scripto scienter procuravit he became very wealthy he died in 1189 at winchester whither he had gone to welcome king richard not long after his death his tomb was violated and the episcopal ring on his finger purloined the violators were anathematised from the pulpit the fourth bishop was william longchamp 11891197 chancellor of england and subsequently papal legate when the king went abroad he was appointed to govern england south of the trent he behaved in this office with great insolence pride and oppression and having particularly offended john the kings brother he made an attempt to escape from the country in the disguise of a woman but he was detected at dover and thrown into prison being allowed after a time to go to normandy he there waited until the kings return by whom he was restored to favour he died in 1197 at poictiers and was buried there in a cistercian abbey his heart being brought to ely he was succeeded by eustace 11981215 archdeacon of richmond treasurer of york dean of salisbury and keeper of the great seal he was one of the bishops to whom was entrusted the invidious employment of publishing the excommunication of king john and putting the kingdom under an interdict for this in 1209 he was outlawed and had to leave the country upon the kings submission in 1213 he with archbishop stephen langton and three other bishops returned to england he built the galilee at the west end of the church he died in 1215 at reading robert of york was chosen by the monks to succeed him they had at first selected geoffrey de burgh but for some reason that does not appear they altered their minds before making their selection known robert got possession of the temporalities and even gave away preferments that were in the bishops gift for five years but the king never consented to his appointment nor was he ever consecrated he took the part of the french against the king who at last applied to the pope to nominate some one else to the see of ely

tried to annul his election but he proceeded to rome and was actually consecrated there by the pope it is in connection with his election that we learn that the custom of the monks was to depute the

years the next bishop robert orford 13021310 like his predecessor hugh belsham was consecrated at rome though not as he had been by the pope himself the archbishop of canterbury had refused his

visited ely in his time and while there settled the controversy between ely and s albans as to the true place where the body of the protomartyr of england was deposited the remains of s alban had been carried off to denmark by the danes after plundering the abbey raised to his honour and recovered by a trick at a later time fearing again an attack from the danes the abbot of s albans sent to ely a chest containing so he said the relics of the martyr for safe custody when the troubles were over the monks of ely sent back the chest but with other bones in it supposing that they had thereby secured the true relics for their own church so the abbot of s albans declared that they were not the true relics that he had sent to ely but that he had buried them in a fresh place in his own church the king in 1314 decided the matter in favour of s albans at the death of bishop keeton in 1316 the bishopric was conferred upon john hotham 13161337 chancellor of the exchequer bentham calls him

to escape to avignon then the seat of the pope here he had been consecrated and here while negotiations were proceeding for settling the dispute in 1361 he died and here he was buried this time the

london there was much dispute about the next bishop the monks chose fitzhugh bishop of london but he died the king then recommended the bishop of s davids but the monks preferred thomas bouchier bishop of worcester whom the king refused bouchier appealed to the pope who at first confirmed his election but the bishopelect was afraid to present the papal bull this was an opportunity for the king henry vi to gratify one of his numerous adherents of the french nation who had lost their all in that kingdom and followed his fortunes in this he accordingly obtained the popes consent to appoint lewis de luxemburg 14381443 archbishop of rouen to be administrator of the diocese of ely at the same time assigning him the 2000 a year due from the prior and convent to the king during a vacancy the bulls for bishop bouchiers translation from worcester were revoked this was in 1438 which is held to be the beginning of bishop luxemburgs tenure of the see but the spiritualities were not legally surrendered to him till the next year and even then it seems to have been only under the title of perpetual administrator of the see of ely and in formal documents some time later he still has

somersham palace and was a considerable benefactor to the collegiate church of manchester where he was ultimately buried although he left directions in his will to be buried at ely his numerous promotions are possibly due to the influence of his stepmother the famous lady margaret countess of richmond and derby the mother of king henry vii he was very little at ely and bore an indifferent moral character the quaint set of verses3 drawing his character says there was little priests metal in him that he was a goodly tall man as any in england that he was made bishop for his wisdom and

turner and he though of new college oxford had been master of s johns cambridge unless otherwise stated the bishops were buried at ely the original diocese of ely was enlarged in 1837 by the addition of the counties of huntingdon and bedford and the archdeaconry of sudbury footnotes 1 cathedrals of the old foundation were cathedrals from the first and had deans and chapters of secular canons those that were once conventual churches had no deans or canons till henry viii an easy way of identifying cathedrals of the old foundation is this if the nonresident canons have the title of prebendaries they are members of a cathedral of the old foundation the modern dignity of honorary canon was created in order that all other cathedrals might have a body of clergy corresponding to the prebendaries

craudens chapel photochrom co ltd photo chapter vi the precincts besides numerous remains of medival architecture to be found in the residences and private grounds of the cathedral clergy there are some buildings of great interest to the south of the cathedral the two most remarkable being the infirmary and prior craudens chapel of the former no more than the piers and arches are to be seen as the roof is gone and the whole has been converted into residences the latter is quite perfect the infirmary is in the same relative position to the church as at peterborough at the southeast the plan was that of an ordinary church with nave aisles and chancel but the chancel was the chapel the aisles were the quarters of the inmates and the nave was a common hall or ambulatory so complete was the resemblance to a church that the true purpose of this and other similar buildings elsewhere had been quite forgotten and it was left to professor willis to discover that the remains were not those of a disused church bentham1 has an engraving of the arches and clerestory divested of all the domestic additions which to a modern student of ecclesiastical architecture indicates at once a building of norman date which is described as an elevation of the remains of the old conventual church of ely built in the time of the heptarchy ad 673 and repaired in king edgars reign ad 970 in the plan given in the same plate an imaginary apse is marked out with dotted lines2 in the chapel is a groined roof and this belongs to the latter part of the twelfth century but the nave arches where are some very good and unusual mouldings have nothing of transitional work and in the absence of documentary evidence would be assigned to 1140 or 1150 the hall situated to the north of what would in a church be called the north aisle of the nave is the work of walsingham illustration plan of the infirmary as given in benthams history and antiquities prior craudens chapel is a most exquisite specimen of the decorated period designed by the same master mind that created the octagon and the ladychapel crauden was prior from 1321 to 1341 built as a private chapel it was at one time converted into a dwelling but is now restored to sacred uses as the chapel of the kings school it is situated to the south of the deanery it is of small dimensions being only thirtyone feet long and this is exactly double its breadth the vaulted roof springs from clustered shafts in the walls in the eastern half on each side are two tall windows of two lights with most graceful tracery at the east is a window of five lights of equally beautiful tracery filled with stained glass of which the five lower figures are ancient and said to have been brought from cologne the west window has four lights when professor willis was conducting some members of an architectural congress in 18603 over the monastic buildings on arriving at this beautiful little gem of architecture in the course of his remarks he pointed to the restorations that had taken place and found that they were good ones the actual masons lines having been taken in some instances in one or two cases where the work was destroyed the spaces had been filled up with plain block purposely to show where the masonry had been knocked away some curious tiling is to be seen on the altar platform there are figures of adam and eve and numerous unusual designs on no account should this chapel be left unvisited illustration ely porta the great gate of the monastery 1817 from stevensons supplement to bentham the great gateway of the abbey ely porta remains in a nearly perfect condition it was the place where the manor courts were held and was in course of erection when prior bucton died in 1397 from his successor in whose time it seems to have been completed it is sometimes called walpoles gate at one time a portion was devoted to the brewery and here the audit ale was brewed till so recently as dean goodwins time4 it is now used partly as a house for the porter and partly for the school the new buildings of the school just opposite are on the site of an ancient hostelry called the green man which was possibly the descendant of some medival lodginghouse to which pilgrims resorted5 between ely porta and the cathedral are to be seen many fragmentary remains of the old monastery some of norman date now forming parts of houses over the road to the west of these buildings there used to be a covered passage called the gallerya name still retained by the street itselfleading from the bishops palace to the cathedral access to this from the cathedral was in the western transept the writer has not been able to hear of any engraving or drawing of this the remains of the refectory and of the norman kitchen are in the deanery grounds the guesthouse is wholly absorbed in the deanery there is a picturesque entrance into the close on the north side from high street the buildings on each side of it and the room above now the muniment room are quite ecclesiastical though modernised and in part new the eastern portion occupies the site of the sextry footnotes 1 history 1771 plate iv 2 another instance of imperfect

visitor trustworthy guidebooks at once cheaper and more fully illustrated than any previous works of similar character each volume contains not only a complete history of the see and of the cathedral fabric but a critical and descriptive survey of the building in all its detail sufficiently accurate from the archaeological point of view to furnish a trustworthy record of the building in its past and present condition and not too technical in its language for the occasional use of the casual visitor brief biographical accounts of the bishops and other notable men connected with the diocese are also included the volumes are fully illustrated from modern photographs and drawings and contain also reproductions from old and in some cases rare prints for the purpose of tracing the gradual growth

visitants to any of our noble shrines who will not enjoy their visit the better for being furnished with one of these delightful books which can be slipped into the pocket and carried with ease and is yet distinct and legible a volume such as that on canterbury is exactly what we want and on our next visit we hope to have it with us it is thoroughly helpful and the views of the fair city and its noble cathedral are beautiful both volumes moreover will serve more than a temporary purpose and are trustworthy as well as delightfulnotes and queries we have so frequently in these columns urged the want of cheap wellillustrated and wellwritten handbooks to our cathedrals to take the place of the outofdate publications of local booksellers that we are glad to hear that they have been taken in hand by messrs george bell sonsst jamess gazette the volumes are handy in size moderate in price well illustrated and written in a scholarly spirit the history of cathedral and city is intelligently set forth and accompanied by a descriptive survey of the building in all its detail the illustrations are copious and well selected and the series bids fair to become an indispensable companion to the cathedral tourist in englandtimes they are nicely produced in good type on good paper and contain numerous illustrations are well written and very cheap we should imagine architects and students of architecture will be sure to buy the series as they appear for they contain in brief much valuable informationbritish architect each of them contains exactly that amount of information which the intelligent visitor who is not a specialist will wish to have the disposition of the various parts is judiciously proportioned and the style is very readable the illustrations supply a further important feature they are both numerous and good a series which cannot fail to be welcomed by all who are interested in the ecclesiastical buildings of englandglasgow herald those who either for purposes of professional study or for a cultured recreation find it expedient to do the english cathedrals will welcome the beginning of bells cathedral series this set of books is an attempt to consult more closely and in greater detail than the usual guidebooks do the needs of visitors to the cathedral towns the series cannot but prove markedly successful in each book a businesslike description is given of the fabric of the church to which the volume relates and an interesting history of the relative diocese the books are plentifully illustrated and are thus made attractive as well as instructive they cannot but prove welcome to all classes of readers interested either in english church history or in ecclesiastical architecturescotsman they have nothing in common with the almost invariably wretched local guides save portability and their only competitors in the quality and quantity of their contents are very expensive and mostly rare works each of a size that suggests a packingcase rather than a coatpocket the cathedral series are important compilations concerning history architecture and biography and quite popular enough for such as take any sincere interest in
