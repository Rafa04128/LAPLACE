maxims for health hints to persons of moderate fortune first published in the massachusetts journal furniture education of daughters travelling and public amusements philosophy and consistency reasons for hard times how to endure poverty appendix to the american frugal housewife carving index appendix it has become necessary to change the title of this work to the american frugal housewife because there is an english work of the same name not adapted to the wants of this country introductory chapter the true economy of housekeeping is simply the art of gathering up all the fragments so that nothing be lost i mean fragments of time as well as materials nothing should be thrown away so long as it is possible to make any use of it however trifling that use may be and whatever be the size of a family every member should be employed either in earning or saving money time is money for this reason cheap as stockings are it is good economy to knit them cotton and woollen yarn are both cheap hose that are knit wear twice as long as woven ones and they can be done at odd minutes of time which would not be otherwise employed where there are children or aged people it is sufficient to recommend knitting that it is an employment in this point of view patchwork is good economy it is indeed a foolish waste of time to tear cloth into bits for the sake of arranging it anew in fantastic figures but a large family may be kept out of idleness and a few shillings saved by thus using scraps of gowns curtains c in the country where grain is raised it is a good plan to teach children to prepare and braid straw for their own bonnets and their brothers hats where turkeys and geese are kept handsome feather fans may as well be made by the younger members of a family as to be bought the sooner children are taught to turn their faculties to some account the better for them and for their parents in this country we are apt to let children romp away their existence till they get to be thirteen or fourteen this is not well it is not well for the purses and patience of parents and it has a still worse effect on the morals and habits of the children begin early is the great maxim for everything in education a child of six years old can be made useful and should be taught to consider every day lost in which some little thing has not been done to assist others children can very early be taught to take all the care of their own clothes they can knit garters suspenders and stockings they can make patchwork and braid straw they can make mats for the table and mats for the floor they can weed the garden and pick cranberries from the meadow to be carried to market provided brothers and sisters go together and are not allowed to go with bad children it is a great deal better for the boys and girls on a farm to be picking blackberries at six cents a quart than to be wearing out their clothes in useless play they enjoy themselves just as well and they are earning something to buy clothes at the same time they are tearing them it is wise to keep an exact account of all you expendeven of a paper of pins this answers two purposes it makes you more careful in spending money and it enables your husband to judge precisely whether his family live within his income no false pride or foolish ambition to appear as well as others should ever induce a person to live one cent beyond the income of which he is certain if you have two dollars a day let nothing but sickness induce you to spend more than nine shillings if you have one dollar a day do not spend but seventyfive cents if you have half a dollar a day be satisfied to spend forty cents to associate with influential and genteel people with an appearance of equality unquestionably has its advantages particularly where there is a family of sons and daughters just coming upon the theatre of life but like all other external advantages these have their proper price and may be bought too dearly they who never reserve a cent of their income with which to meet any unforeseen calamity pay too dear for the whistle whatever temporary benefits they may derive from society selfdenial in proportion to the narrowness of your income will eventually be the happiest and most respectable course for you and yours if you are prosperous perseverance and industry will not fail to place you in such a situation as your ambition covets and if you are not prosperous it will be well for your children that they have not been educated to higher hopes than they will ever realize if you are about to furnish a house do not spend all your money be it much or little do not let the beauty of this thing and the cheapness of that tempt you to buy unnecessary articles doctor franklins maxim was a wise one nothing is cheap that we do not want buy merely enough to get along with at first it is only by experience that you can tell what will be the wants of your family if you spend all your money you will find you have purchased many things you do not want and have no means left to get many things which you do want if you have enough and more than enough to get everything suitable to your situation do not think you must spend it all merely because you happen to have it begin humbly as riches increase it is easy and pleasant to increase in hospitality and splendour but it is always painful and inconvenient to decrease after all these things are viewed in their proper light by the truly judicious and respectable neatness tastefulness and good sense may be shown in the management of a small household and the arrangement of a little furniture as well as upon a larger scale and these qualities are always praised and always treated with respect and attention the consideration which many purchase by living beyond their income and of course living upon others is not worth the trouble it costs the glare there is about this false and wicked parade is deceptive it does not in fact procure a man valuable friends or extensive influence more than that it is wrongmorally wrong so far as the individual is concerned and injurious beyond calculation to the interests of our country to what are the increasing beggary and discouraged exertions of the present period owing a multitude of causes have no doubt tended to increase the evil but the root of the whole matter is the extravagance of all classes of people we never shall be prosperous till we make pride and vanity yield to the dictates of honesty and prudence we never shall be free from embarrassment until we cease to be ashamed of industry and economy let women do their share towards reformationlet their fathers and husbands see them happy without finery and if their husbands and fathers have as is often the case a foolish pride in seeing them decorated let them gently and gradually check this feeling by showing that they have better and surer means of commanding respectlet them prove by the exertion of ingenuity and economy that neatness good taste and gentility are attainable without great expense the writer has no apology to offer for this cheap little book of economical hints except her deep conviction that such a book is needed in this case renown is out of the question and ridicule is a matter of indifference the information conveyed is of a common kind but it is such as the majority of young housekeepers do not possess and such as they cannot obtain from cookery books books of this kind have usually been written for the wealthy i have written for the poor i have said nothing about rich cooking those who can afford to be epicures will find the best of information in the seventyfive receipts i have attempted to teach how money can be saved not how it can be enjoyed if any persons think some of the maxims too rigidly economical let them inquire how the largest fortunes among us have been made they will find thousands and millions have been accumulated by a scrupulous attention to sums infinitely more minute than sixty cents in early childhood you lay the foundation of poverty or riches in the habits you give your children teach them to save everythingnot for their own use for that would make them selfishbut for some use teach them to share everything with their playmates but never allow them to destroy anything i once visited a family where the most exact economy was observed yet nothing was mean or uncomfortable it is the character of true economy to be as comfortable and genteel with a little as others can be with much in this family when the father brought home a package the older children would of their own accord put away the paper and twine neatly instead of throwing them in the fire or tearing them to pieces if the little ones wanted a piece of twine to play scratchcradle or spin a top there it was in readiness and when they threw it upon the floor the older children had no need to be told to put it again in its place the other day i heard a mechanic say i have a wife and two little children we live in a very small house but to save my life i cannot spend less than twelve hundred a year another replied you are not economical i spend but eight hundred i thought to myselfneither of you pick up your twine and paper a third one who was present was silent but after they were gone he said i keep house and comfortably too with a wife and children for six hundred a year but i suppose they would have thought me mean if i had told them so i did not think him mean it merely occurred to me that his wife and children were in the habit of picking up paper and twine economy is generally despised as a low virtue tending to make people ungenerous and selfish this is true of avarice but it is not so of economy the man who is economical is laying up for himself the permanent power of being useful and generous he who thoughtlessly gives away ten dollars when he owes a hundred more than he can pay deserves no praisehe obeys a sudden impulse more like instinct than reason it would be real charity to check this feeling because the good he does maybe doubtful while the injury he does his family and creditors is certain true economy is a careful treasurer in the service of benevolence and where they are united respectability prosperity and peace will follow odd scraps for the economical if you would avoid waste in your family attend to the following rules and do not despise them because they appear so unimportant many a little makes a mickle look frequently to the pails to see that nothing is thrown to the pigs which should have been in the greasepot look to the greasepot and see that nothing is there which might have served to nourish your own family or a poorer one see that the beef and pork are always under brine and that the brine is sweet and clean count towels sheets spoons c occasionally that those who use them may not become careless see that the vegetables are neither sprouting nor decaying if they are so remove them to a drier place and spread them examine preserves to see that they are not contracting mould and your pickles to see that they are not growing soft and tasteless as far as it is possible have bits of bread eaten up before they become hard spread those that are not eaten and let them dry to be pounded for puddings or soaked for brewis brewis is made of crusts and dry pieces of bread soaked a good while in hot milk mashed up and salted and buttered like toast above all do not let crusts accumulate in such quantities that they cannot be used with proper care there is no need of losing a particle of bread even in the hottest weather attend to all the mending in the house once a week if possible never put out sewing if it be impossible to do it in your own family hire some one into the house and work with them make your own bread and cake some people think it is just as cheap to buy of the baker and confectioner but it is not half as cheap true it is more convenient and therefore the rich are justifiable in employing them but those who are under the necessity of being economical should make convenience a secondary object in the first place confectioners make their cake richer than people of moderate income can afford to make it in the next place your domestic or yourself may just as well employ your own time as to pay them for theirs when ivoryhandled knives turn yellow rub them with nice sand paper or emery it will take off the spots and restore their whiteness when a carpet is faded i have been told that it may be restored in a great measure provided there be no grease in it by being dipped into strong salt and water i never tried this but i know that silk pocket handkerchiefs and deep blue factory cotton will not fade if dipped in salt and water while new an oxs gall will set any colorsilk cotton or woollen i have seen the colors of calico which faded at one washing fixed by it where one lives near a slaughterhouse it is worth while to buy cheap fading goods and set them in this way the gall can be bought for a few cents get out all the liquid and cork it up in a large phial one large spoonful of this in a gallon of warm water is sufficient this is likewise excellent for taking out spots from bombazine bombazet c after being washed in this they look about as well as when new it must be thoroughly stirred into the water and not put upon the cloth it is used without soap after being washed in this cloth which you want to clean should be washed in warm suds without using soap tortoise shell and horn combs last much longer for having oil rubbed into them once in a while indian meal and rye meal are in danger of fermenting in summer particularly indian they should be kept in a cool place and stirred open to the air once in a while a large stone put in the middle of a barrel of meal is a good thing to keep it cool the covering of oilflasks sewed together with strong thread and lined and bound neatly makes useful tablemats a warmingpan full of coals or a shovel of coals held over varnished furniture will take out white spots care should be taken not to hold the coals near enough to scorch and the place should be rubbed with flannel while warm spots in furniture may usually be cleansed by rubbing them quick and hard with a flannel wet with the same thing which took out the color if rum wet the cloth with rum c the very best restorative for defaced varnished furniture is rottenstone pulverized and rubbed on with linseed oil salvolatile or hartshorn will restore colors taken out by acid it may be dropped upon any garment without doing harm spirits of turpentine is good to take greasespots out of woollen clothes to take spots of paint c from mahogany furniture and to cleanse white kid gloves cockroaches and all vermin have an aversion to spirits of turpentine an ounce of quicksilver beat up with the white of two eggs and put on with a feather is the cleanest and surest bedbug poison what is left should be thrown away it is dangerous to have it about the house if the vermin are in your walls fill up the cracks with verdigrisgreen paint1 footnote 1 there are two kinds of green paint one is of no use in destroying insects lamps will have a less disagreeable smell if you dip your wickyarn in strong hot vinegar and dry it those who make candles will find it a great improvement to steep the wicks in limewater and saltpetre and dry them the flame is clearer and the tallow will not run britannia ware should be first rubbed gently with a woollen cloth and sweet oil then washed in warm suds and rubbed with soft leather and whiting thus treated it will retain its beauty to the last eggs will keep almost any length of time in limewater properly prepared one pint of coarse salt and one pint of unslacked lime to a pailful of water if there be too much lime it will eat the shells from the eggs and if there be a single egg cracked it will spoil the whole they should be covered with limewater and kept in a cold place the yolk becomes slightly red but i have seen eggs thus kept perfectly sweet and fresh at the end of three years the cheapest time to lay down eggs is early in spring and the middle and last of september it is bad economy to buy eggs by the dozen as you want them new iron should be very gradually heated at first after it has become inured to the heat it is not as likely to crack it is a good plan to put new earthen ware into cold water and let it heat gradually until it boilsthen cool again brown earthen ware in particular may be toughened in this way a handful of rye or wheat bran thrown in while it is boiling will preserve the glazing so that it will not be destroyed by acid or salt clean a brass kettle before using it for cooking with salt and vinegar skimmilk and water with a bit of glue in it heated scalding hot is excellent to restore old rusty black italian crape if clapped and pulled dry like nice muslin it will look as well or better than when new washleather gloves should be washed in clean suds scarcely warm the oftener carpets are shaken the longer they wear the dirt that collects under them grinds out the threads do not have carpets swept any oftener than is absolutely necessary after dinner sweep the crumbs into a dustingpan with your hearthbrush and if you have been sewing pick up the shreds by hand a carpet can be kept very neat in this way and a broom wears it very much buy your woollen yarn in quantities from some one in the country whom you can trust the threadstores make profits upon it of course it is not well to clean brass andirons handles c with vinegar it makes them very clean at first but they soon spot and tarnish rottenstone and oil are proper materials for cleaning brasses if wiped every morning with flannel and new england rum they will not need to be cleaned half as often if you happen to live in a house which has marble fireplaces never wash them with suds this destroys the polish in time they should be dusted the spots taken off with a nice oiled cloth and then rubbed dry with a soft rag feathers should be very thoroughly dried before they are used for this reason they should not be packed away in bags when they are first plucked they should be laid lightly in a basket or something of that kind and stirred up often the garret is the best place to dry them because they will there be kept free from dirt and moisture and will be in no danger of being blown away it is well to put the parcels which you may have from time to time into the oven after you have removed your bread and let them stand a day if featherbeds smell badly or become heavy from want of proper preservation of the feathers or from old age empty them and wash the feathers thoroughly in a tub of suds spread them in your garret to dry and they will be as light and as good as new new england rum constantly used to wash the hair keeps it very clean and free from disease and promotes its growth a great deal more than macassar oil brandy is very strengthening to the roots of the hair but it has a hot drying tendency which ne rum has not if you wish to preserve fine teeth always clean them thoroughly after you have eaten your last meal at night rags should never be thrown away because they are dirty moprags lamprags c should be washed dried and put in the ragbag there is no need of expending soap upon them boil them out in dirty suds after you have done washing linen rags should be carefully saved for they are extremely useful in sickness if they have become dirty and worn by cleaning silver c wash them and scrape them into lint after old coats pantaloons c have been cut up for boys and are no longer capable of being converted into garments cut them into strips and employ the leisure moments of children or domestics in sewing and braiding them for doormats if you are troubled to get soft water for washing fill a tub or barrel half full of ashes and fill it up with water so that you may have lye whenever you want it a gallon of strong lye put into a great kettle of hard water will make it as soft as rain water some people use pearlash or potash but this costs something and is very apt to injure the texture of the cloth if you have a strip of land do not throw away suds both ashes and suds are good manure for bushes and young plants when a white navarino bonnet becomes soiled rip it in pieces and wash it with a sponge and soft water while it is yet damp wash it two or three times with a clean sponge dipped into a strong saffron tea nicely strained repeat this till the bonnet is as dark a straw color as you wish press it on the wrong side with a warm iron and it will look like a new leghorn about the last of may or the first of june the little millers which lay motheggs begin to appear therefore brush all your woollens and pack them away in a dark place covered with linen pepper redcedar chips tobaccoindeed almost any strong spicy smellis good to keep moths out of your chests and drawers but nothing is so good as camphor sprinkle your woollens with camphorated spirit and scatter pieces of camphorgum among them and you will never be troubled with moths some people buy camphorwood trunks for this purpose but they are very expensive and the gum answers just as well the first young leaves of the common currantbush gathered as soon as they put out and dried on tin can hardly be distinguished from green tea cream of tartar rubbed upon soiled white kid gloves cleanses them very much bottles that have been used for rosewater should be used for nothing else if scalded ever so much they will kill the spirit of what is put in them if you have a greater quantity of cheeses in the house than is likely to be soon used cover them carefully with paper fastened on with flour paste so as to exclude the air in this way they may be kept free from insects for years they should be kept in a dry cool place pulverized alum possesses the property of purifying water a large spoonful stirred into a hogshead of water will so purify it that in a few hours the dirt will all sink to the bottom and it will be as fresh and clear as spring water four gallons may be purified by a teaspoonful save vials and bottles apothecaries and grocers will give something for them if the bottles are of good thick glass they will always be useful for bottling cider or beer but if they are thin french glass like claret bottles they will not answer woollens should be washed in very hot suds and not rinsed lukewarm water shrinks them on the contrary silk or anything that has silk in it should be washed in water almost cold hot water turns it yellow it may be washed in suds made of nice white soap but no soap should be put upon it likewise avoid the use of hot irons in smoothing silk either rub the articles dry with a soft cloth or put them between two towels and press them with weights do not let knives be dropped into hot dishwater it is a good plan to have a large tin pot to wash them in just high enough to wash the blades without wetting the handles keep your castors covered with blottingpaper and green flannel keep your saltspoons out of the salt and clean them often do not wrap knives and forks in woollens wrap them in good strong paper steel is injured by lying in woollens if it be practicable get a friend in the country to procure you a quantity of lard butter and eggs at the time they are cheapest to be put down for winter use you will be likely to get them cheaper and better than in the city market but by all means put down your winters stock lard requires no other care than to be kept in a dry cool place butter is sweetest in september and june because food is then plenty and not rendered bitter by frost pack your butter in a clean scalded firkin cover it with strong brine and spread a cloth all over the top and it will keep good until the jews get into grand isle if you happen to have a bit of saltpetre dissolve it with the brine dairywomen say that butter comes more easily and has a peculiar hardness and sweetness if the cream is scalded and strained before it is used the cream should stand down cellar over night after being scalded that it may get perfectly cold suet and lard keep better in tin than in earthen suet keeps good all the year round if chopped and packed down in a stone jar covered with molasses pick suet free from veins and skin melt it in water before a moderate fire let it cool till it forms into a hard cake then wipe it dry and put it in clean paper in linen bags preserve the backs of old letters to write upon if you have children who are learning to write buy coarse white paper by the quantity and keep it locked up ready to be made into writing books it does not cost half as much as it does to buy them at the stationers do not let coffee and tea stand in tin scald your wooden ware often and keep your tin ware dry when mattresses get hard and bunchy rip them take the hair out pull it thoroughly by hand let it lie a day or two to air wash the tick lay it in as light and even as possible and catch it down as before thus prepared they will be as good as new it is poor economy to buy vinegar by the gallon buy a barrel or half a barrel of really strong vinegar when you begin housekeeping as you use it fill the barrel with old cider sour beer or winesettlings c left in pitchers decanters or tumblers weak tea is likewise said to be good nothing is hurtful which has a tolerable portion of spirit or acidity care must be taken not to add these things in too large quantities or too often if the vinegar once gets weak it is difficult to restore it if possible it is well to keep such slops as i have mentioned in a different keg and draw them off once in three or four weeks in such a quantity as you think the vinegar will bear if by any carelessness you do weaken it a few white beans dropped in or white paper dipped in molasses is said to be useful if beer grows sour it may be used to advantage for pancakes and fritters if very sour indeed put a pint of molasses and water to it and two or three days after put a half pint of vinegar and in ten days it will be first rate vinegar barley straw is the best for beds dry corn husks slit into shreds are far better than straw straw beds are much better for being boxed at the sides in the same manner upholsterers prepare ticks for feathers brass andirons should be cleaned done up in papers and put in a dry place during the summer season if you have a large family it is well to keep white rags separate from colored ones and cotton separate from woollen they bring a higher price paper brings a cent a pound and if you have plenty of room it is well to save it a penny saved is a penny got always have plenty of dishwater and have it hot there is no need of asking the character of a domestic if you have ever seen her wash dishes in a little greasy water when molasses is used in cooking it is a prodigious improvement to boil and skim it before you use it it takes out the unpleasant raw taste and makes it almost as good as sugar where molasses is used much for cooking it is well to prepare one or two gallons in this way at a time in winter always set the handle of your pump as high as possible before you go to bed except in very rigid weather this keeps the handle from freezing when there is reason to apprehend extreme cold do not forget to throw a rug or horseblanket over your pump a frozen pump is a comfortless preparation for a winters breakfast never allow ashes to be taken up in wood or put into wood always have your tinderbox and lantern ready for use in case of sudden alarm have important papers all together where you can lay your hand on them at once in case of fire keep an old blanket and sheet on purpose for ironing and on no account suffer any other to be used have plenty of holders always made that your towels may not be burned out in such service keep a coarse broom for the cellar stairs woodshed yard c no good housekeeper allows her carpet broom to be used for such things there should always be a heavy stone on the top of your pork to keep it down this stone is an excellent place to keep a bit of fresh meat in the summer when you are afraid of its spoiling have all the good bits of vegetables and meat collected after dinner and minced before they are set away that they may be in readiness to make a little savoury mince meat for supper or breakfast take the skins off your potatoes before they grow cold vials which have been used for medicine should be put into cold ashes and water boiled and suffered to cool before they are rinsed if you live in the city where it is always easy to procure provisions be careful and not buy too much for your daily wants while the weather is warm never leave out your clothesline over night and see that your clothespins are all gathered into a basket have plenty of crash towels in the kitchen never let your white napkins be used there soap your dirtiest clothes and soak them in soft water over night use hard soap to wash your clothes and soft to wash your floors soft soap is so slippery that it wastes a good deal in washing clothes instead of covering up your glasses and pictures with muslin cover the frames only with cheap yellow cambric neatly put on and as near the color of the gilt as you can procure it this looks better leaves the glasses open for use and the pictures for ornament and is an effectual barrier to dust as well as flies it can easily be recolored with saffron tea when it is faded have a bottle full of brandy with as large a mouth as any bottle you have into which cut your lemon and orange peel when they are fresh and sweet this brandy gives a delicious flavor to all sorts of pies puddings and cakes lemon is the pleasantest spice of the two therefore they should be kept in separate bottles it is a good plan to preserve roseleaves in brandy the flavor is pleasanter than rosewater and there are few people who have the utensils for distilling peach leaves steeped in brandy make excellent spice for custards and puddings it is easy to have a supply of horseradish all winter have a quantity grated while the root is in perfection put it in bottles fill it with strong vinegar and keep it corked tight it is thought to be a preventive to the unhealthy influence of cucumbers to cut the slices very thin and drop each one into cold water as you cut it a few minutes in the water takes out a large portion of the slimy matter so injurious to health they should be eaten with high seasoning where sweet oil is much used it is more economical to buy it by the bottle than by the flask a bottle holds more than twice as much as a flask and it is never double the price if you wish to have freestone hearths dark wash them with soap and wipe them with a wet cloth some people rub in lampoil once in a while and wash the hearth faithfully afterwards this does very well in a large dirty family for the hearth looks very clean and is not liable to show grease spots but if you wish to preserve the beauty of a freestone hearth buy a quantity of freestone powder of the stonecutter and rub on a portion of it wet after you have washed your hearth in hot water when it is dry brush it off and it will look like new stone bricks can be kept clean with redding stirred up in water and put on with a brush pulverized clay mixed with redding makes a pretty rose color some think it is less likely to come off if mixed with skim milk instead of water but black lead is far handsomer than anything else for this purpose it looks very well mixed with water like redding but it gives it a glossy appearance to boil the lead in soft soap with a little water to keep it from burning it should be put on with a brush in the same manner as redding it looks nice for a long time when done in this way keep a bag for odd pieces of tape and strings they will come in use keep a bag or box for old buttons so that you may know where to go when you want one run the heels of stockings faithfully and mend thin places as well as holes a stitch in time saves nine pokeroot boiled in water and mixed with a good quantity of molasses set about the kitchen the pantry c in large deep plates will kill cockroaches in great numbers and finally rid the house of them the indians say that pokeroot boiled into a soft poultice is the cure for the bite of a snake i have heard of a fine horse saved by it a little salt sprinkled in starch while it is boiling tends to prevent it from sticking it is likewise good to stir it with a clean spermaceti candle a few potatoes sliced and boiling water poured over them makes an excellent preparation for cleansing and stiffening old rusty black silk green tea is excellent to restore rusty silk it should be boiled in iron nearly a cup full to three quarts the silk should not be wrung and should be ironed damp lime pulverized sifted through coarse muslin and stirred up tolerably thick in white of eggs makes a strong cement for glass and china plaster of paris is still better particularly for mending broken images of the same material it should be stirred up by the spoonful as it is wanted2 footnote 2 some think it an improvement to make whey of vinegar and milk and heat it well up with the eggs before the lime is put in i have heard of iron mended with it a bit of isinglass dissolved in gin or boiled in spirits of wine is said to make strong cement for broken glass china and seashells the lemon syrup usually sold at fifty cents a bottle may be made much cheaper those who use a great quantity of it will find it worth their while to make it take about a pound of havana sugar boil it in water down to a quart drop in the white of an egg to clarify it strain it add one quarter of an oz of tartaric acid or citric acid if you do not find it sour enough after it has stood two or three days and shaken freely add more of the acid a few drops of the oil of lemon improves it if you wish to clarify sugar and water you are about to boil it is well to stir in the white of one egg while cold if put in after it boils the egg is apt to get hardened before it can do any good those who are fond of soda powders will do well to inquire at the apothecaries for the suitable acid and alkali and buy them by the ounce or the pound according to the size of their families experience soon teaches the right proportions and sweetened with a little sugar or lemon syrup it is quite as good as what one gives five times as much for done up in papers the case is the same with rochelle powders when the stopper of a glass decanter becomes too tight a cloth wet with hot water and applied to the neck will cause the glass to expand so that the stopper may be easily removed glass vessels in a cylindrical form may be cut in two by tying around them a worsted thread thoroughly wet with spirits of turpentine and then setting fire to the thread court plaster is made of thin silk first dipped in dissolved isinglass and dried then dipped several times in the white of egg and dried when plain tortoiseshell combs are defaced the polish may be renewed by rubbing them with pulverized rottenstone and oil the rottenstone should be sifted through muslin it looks better to be rubbed on by the hand the jewellers afterwards polish them by rubbing them with dry rouge powder but sifted magnesia does just as welland if the ladies had rouge perhaps they would by mistake put it upon their cheeks instead of their combs and thereby spoil their complexions the best way to cleanse gold is to wash it in warm suds made of delicate soap with ten or fifteen drops of salvolatile in it this makes jewels very brilliant straw carpets should be washed in salt and water and wiped with a dry coarse towel they have a strong tendency to turn yellow and the salt prevents it moisture makes them decay soon therefore they should be kept thoroughly dry rye paste is more adhesive than any other paste because that grain is very glutinous it is much improved by adding a little pounded alum while it is boiling this makes it almost as strong as glue red ants are among the worst plagues that can infest a house a lady who had long been troubled with them assured me she destroyed them in a few days after the following manner she placed a dish of cracked shagbarks of which they are more fond than of anything else in the closet they soon gathered upon it in troops she then put some corrosive sublimate in a cup ordered the dish to be carried carefully to the fire and all its contents brushed in while she swept the few that dropped upon the shelf into the cup and with a feather wet all the cracks from whence they came with corrosive sublimate when this had been repeated four or five times the house was effectually cleared too much care cannot be taken of corrosive sublimate especially when children are about many dreadful accidents have happened in consequence of carelessness bottles which have contained it should be broken and buried and cups should be boiled out in ashes and water if kept in the house it should be hung up high out of reach with poison written upon it in large letters the neatest way to separate wax from honeycomb is to tie the comb up in a linen or woollen bag place it in a kettle of cold water and hang it over the fire as the water heats the wax melts and rises to the surface while all the impurities remain in the bag it is well to put a few pebbles in the bag to keep it from floating honey may be separated from the comb by placing it in the hot sun or before the fire with two or three colanders or sieves each finer than the other under it soap in the city i believe it is better to exchange ashes and grease for soap but in the country i am certain it is good economy to make ones own soap if you burn wood you can make your own lye but the ashes of coal is not worth much bore small holes in the bottom of a barrel place four bricks around and fill the barrel with ashes wet the ashes well but not enough to drop let it soak thus three or four days then pour a gallon of water in every hour or two for a day or more and let it drop into a pail or tub beneath keep it dripping till the color of the lye shows the strength is exhausted if your lye is not strong enough you must fill your barrel with fresh ashes and let the lye run through it some people take a barrel without any bottom and lay sticks and straw across to prevent the ashes from falling through to make a barrel of soap it will require about five or six bushels of ashes with at least four quarts of unslacked stone lime if slacked doable the quantity when you have drawn off a part of the lye put the lime whether slack or not into two or three pails of boiling water and add it to the ashes and let it drain through it is the practice of some people in making soap to put the lime near the bottom of the ashes when they first set it tip but the lime becomes like mortar and the lye does not run through so as to get the strength of it which is very important in making soap as it contracts the nitrous salts which collect in ashes and prevents the soap from coming as the saying is old ashes are very apt to be impregnated with it three pounds of grease should be put into a pailful of lye the great difficulty in making soap come originates in want of judgment about the strength of the lye one rule may be safely trustedif your lye will bear up an egg or a potato so that you can see a piece of the surface as big as ninepence it is just strong enough if it sink below the top of the lye it is too weak and will never make soap if it is buoyed up half way the lye is too strong and that is just as bad a bit of quicklime thrown in while the lye and grease are boiling together is of service when the soap becomes thick and ropy carry it down cellar in pails and empty it into a barrel cold soap is less trouble because it does not need to boil the sun does the work of fire the lye must be prepared and tried in the usual way the grease must be tried out and strained from the scraps two pounds of grease instead of three must be used to a pailful unless the weather is very sultry the lye should be hot when put to the grease it should stand in the sun and be stirred every day if it does not begin to look like soap in the course of five or six days add a little hot lye to it if this does not help it try whether it be grease that it wants perhaps you will think cold soap wasteful because the grease must be strained but if the scraps are boiled thoroughly in strong lye the grease will all float upon the surface and nothing be lost simple remedies cotton wool wet with sweet oil and paregoric relieves the earache very soon a

vegetables parsnips should be kept down cellar covered up in sand entirely excluded from the air they are good only in the spring cabbages put into a hole in the ground will keep well during the winter and be hard fresh and sweet in the spring many farmers keep potatoes in the same way onions should be kept very dry and never carried into the cellar except in severe weather when there is danger of their freezing by no means let them be in the cellar after march they will sprout and spoil potatoes should likewise be carefully looked to in the spring and the sprouts broken off the cellar is the best place for them because they are injured by wilting but sprout them carefully if you want to keep them they never sprout but three times therefore after you have sprouted them three times they will trouble you no more squashes should never be kept down cellar when it is possible to prevent it dampness injures them if intense cold makes it necessary to put them there bring them up as soon as possible and keep them in some dry warm place cabbages need to be boiled an hour beets an hour and a half the lower part of a squash should be boiled half an hour the neck pieces fifteen or twenty minutes longer parsnips should boil an hour or an hour and a quarter according to size new potatoes should boil fifteen or twenty minutes three quarters of an hour or an hour is not too much for large old potatoes commonsized ones half an hour in the spring it is a good plan to cut off a slice from the seed end of potatoes before you cook them the seed end is opposite to that which grew upon the vine the place where the vine was broken off may be easily distinguished by a provision of nature the seed end becomes watery in the spring and unless cut off it is apt to injure the potato if you wish to have potatoes mealy do not let them stop boiling for an instant and when they are done turn the water off and let them steam for ten or twelve minutes over the fire see they dont stay long enough to burn to the kettle in canada they cut the skin all off and put them in pans to be cooked over a stove by steam those who have eaten them say they are mealy and white looking like large snowballs when brought upon the table potatoes boiled and mashed while hot are good to use in making short cakes and puddings they save flour and less shortening is necessary it is said that a bit of unslacked lime about as big as a robins egg thrown among old watery potatoes while they are boiling will tend to make them mealy i never saw the experiment tried asparagus should be boiled fifteen or twenty minutes half an hour if old green peas should be boiled from twenty minutes to sixty according to their age string beans the same corn should be boiled from twenty minutes to forty according to age dandelions half an hour or three quarters according to age dandelions are very much improved by cultivation if cut off without injuring the root they will spring up again fresh and tender till late in the season beettops should be boiled twenty minutes and spinage three or four minutes put in no green vegetables till the water boils if you would keep all their sweetness when green peas have become old and yellow they may be made tender and green by sprinkling in a pinch or two of pearlash while they are boiling pearlash has the same effect upon all summer vegetables rendered tough by being too old if your wellwater is very hard it is always an advantage to use a little pearlash in cooking tomatoes should be skinned by pouring boiling water over them after they are skinned they should be stewed half an hour in tin with a little salt a small bit of butter and a spoonful of water to keep them from burning this is a delicious vegetable it is easily cultivated and yields a most abundant crop some people pluck them green and pickle them the best sort of catsup is made from tomatoes the vegetables should be squeezed up in the hand salt put to them and set by for twentyfour hours after being passed through a sieve cloves allspice pepper mace garlic and whole mustardseed should be added it should be boiled down one third and bottled after it is cool no liquid is necessary as the tomatoes are very juicy a good deal of salt and spice is necessary to keep the catsup well it is delicious with roast meat and a cupful adds much to the richness of soup and chowder the garlic should be taken out before it is bottled celery should be kept in the cellar the roots covered with tan to keep them moist green squashes that are turning yellow and striped squashes are more uniformly sweet and mealy than any other kind if the tops of lettuce be cut off when it is becoming too old for use it will grow up again fresh and tender and may thus be kept good through the summer it is a good plan to boil onions in milk and water it diminishes the strong taste of that vegetable it is an excellent way of serving up onions to chop them after they are boiled and put them in a stewpan with a little milk butter salt and pepper and let them stew about fifteen minutes this gives them a fine flavor and they can be served up very hot herbs all herbs should be carefully kept from the air herb tea to do any good should be made very strong herbs should be gathered while in blossom if left till they have gone to seed the strength goes into the seed those who have a little patch of ground will do well to raise the most important herbs and those who have not will do well to get them in quantities from some friend in the country for apothecaries make very great profit upon them

broth and stuffing it should be gathered in bud or blossom and dried in a tinkitchen at a moderate distance from the fire when dry it should be immediately rubbed sifted and corked up in a bottle carefully englishmallows steeped in milk is good for the dysentery cheap dyestuffs a few general rules are necessary to be observed in coloring the materials should be perfectly clean soap should be rinsed out in soft water the article should be entirely wetted or it will spot light colors should be steeped in brass tin or earthen and if set at all should be set with alum dark colors should be boiled in iron and set with copperas too much copperas rots the thread the apothecaries and hatters keep a compound of vitriol and indigo commonly called blue composition an ounce vial full may be bought for ninepence it colors a fine blue it is an economical plan to use it for old silk linings ribbons c the original color should be boiled out and the material thoroughly rinsed in soft water so that no soap may remain in it for soap ruins the dye twelve or sixteen drops of the blue composition poured into a quart bowl full of warm soft water stirred and strained if any settlings are perceptible will color a great many articles if you wish a deep blue pour in more of the compound cotton must not be colored the vitriol destroys it if the material you wish to color has cotton threads in it it will be ruined after the things are thoroughly dried they should be washed in cool suds and dried again this prevents any bad effects from the vitriol if shut up from the air without being washed there is danger of the texture being destroyed if you wish to color green have your cloth free as possible from the old color clean and rinsed and in the first place color it a deep yellow fustic boiled in soft water makes the strongest and brightest yellow dye but saffron barberry bush peach leaves or onion skins will answer pretty well next take a bowl full of strong yellow dye and pour in a great spoonful or more of the blue composition stir it up well with a clean stick and dip the articles you have already colored yellow into it and they will take a lively grass green this is a good plan for old bombazet curtains dessert cloths old flannel for covering a desk c it is likewise a handsome color for ribbons balm blossoms steeped in water color a pretty rosecolor this answers very well for the linings of childrens bonnets for ribbons c it fades in the course of one season but it is very little trouble to recolor with it it merely requires to be steeped and strained perhaps a small piece of alum might serve to set the color in some degree in earthen or tin saffron steeped in earthen and strained colors a fine straw color it makes a delicate or deep shade according to the strength of the tea the dry outside skins of onions steeped in scalding water and strained color a yellow very much like bird of paradise color peach leaves or bark scraped from the barberry bush colors a common bright yellow in all these cases a little piece of alum does no harm and may help to fix the color ribbons gauze handkerchiefs c are colored well in this way especially if they be stiffened by a bit of gumarabic dropped in while the stuff is steeping the purple paper which comes on loaf sugar boiled in cider or vinegar with a small bit of alum makes a fine purple slate color done in iron white maple bark makes a good lightbrown slate color this should be boiled in water set with alum the color is reckoned better when boiled in brass instead of iron the purple slate and the brown slate are suitable colors for stockings and it is an economical plan after they have been mended and cut down so that they will no longer look decent to color old stockings and make them up for children a pailful of lye with a piece of copperas half as big as a hens egg boiled in it will color a fine nankin color which will never wash out this is very useful for the linings of bedquilts comforters c old faded gowns colored in this way may be made into good petticoats cheap cotton cloth may be colored to advantage for petticoats and pelisses for little girls a very beautiful nankin color may likewise be obtained from birchbark set with alum the bark should be covered with water and boiled thoroughly in brass or tin a bit of alum half as big as a hens egg is sufficient if copperas be used instead of alum slate color will be produced teagrounds boiled in iron and set with copperas make a very good slate color logwood and cider in iron set with copperas makes a good black rusty nails or any rusty iron boiled in vinegar with a small bit of copperas makes a good blackblack inkpowder done in the same way answers the same purpose meat corned or salted hams c when you merely want to corn meat you have nothing to do but to rub in salt plentifully and let it set in the cellar a day or two if you have provided more meat than you can use while it is good it is well to corn it in season to save it in summer it will not keep well more than a day and a half if you are compelled to keep it longer be sure and rub in more salt and keep it carefully covered from cellarflies in winter there is no difficulty in keeping a piece of corned beef a fortnight or more some people corn meat by throwing it into their beef barrel for a few days but this method does not make it so sweet a little saltpetre rubbed in before you apply the common salt makes the meat tender but in summer it is not well to use it because it prevents the other salt from impregnating and the meat does not keep as well if you wish to salt fat pork scald coarse salt in water and skim it till the salt will no longer melt in the water pack your pork down in tight layers salt every layer when the brine is cool cover the pork with it and keep a heavy stone on the top to keep the pork under brine look to it once in a while for the first few weeks and if the salt has all melted throw in more this brine scalded and skimmed every time it is used will continue good twenty years the rind of the pork should be packed towards the edge of the barrel it is good economy to salt your own beef as well as pork six pounds of coarse salt eight ounces of brown sugar a pint of molasses and eight ounces of saltpetre are enough to boil in four gallons of water skim it clean while boiling put it to the beef cold have enough to cover it and be careful your beef never floats on the top if it does not smell perfectly sweet throw in more salt if a scum rises upon it scald and skim it again and pour it on the beef when cold legs of mutton are very good cured in the same way as ham six pounds of salt eight ounces of saltpetre and five pints of molasses will make pickle enough for one hundred weight small legs should be kept in pickle twelve or fifteen days if large four or five weeks are not too much they should be hung up a day or two to dry before they are smoked lay them in the oven on crossed sticks and make a fire at the entrance cobs walnutbark or walnutchips are the best to use for smoking on account of the sweet taste they give the meat the smallest pieces should be smoked fortyeight hours and large legs four or five days some people prefer the mutton boiled as soon as it is taken from the pickle before it is smoked others hang it up till it gets dry thoroughly and eat it in thin slices like hung beef when legs of meat are put in pickle the thickest part of the leg should be placed uppermost that is standing upright the same as the creature stood when living the same rule should be observed when they are hung up to dry it is essential in order to keep in the juices of the meat meat should be turned over once or twice during the process of smoking the oldfashioned way for curing hams is to rub them with salt very thoroughly and let them lay twentyfour hours to each ham allow two ounces of saltpetre one quart of common salt and one quart of molasses first baste them with molasses next rub in the saltpetre and last of all the common salt they must be carefully turned and rubbed every day for six weeks then hang them in a chimney or smokehouse four weeks they should be well covered up in paper bags and put in a chest or barrel with layers of ashes or charcoal between when you take out a ham to cut for use be sure and put it away in a dark place well covered up especially in summer some very experienced epicures and cooks think the oldfashioned way of preparing bacon is troublesome and useless they say that legs of pork placed upright in pickle for four or five weeks are just as nice as those rubbed with so much care the pickle for pork and hung beef should be stronger than for legs of mutton eight pounds of salt ten ounces of saltpetre and five pints of molasses is enough for one hundred weight of meat water enough to cover the meat wellprobably four or five gallons any one can prepare bacon or dried beef very easily in a common oven according to the above directions the same pickle that answers for bacon is proper for neats tongues pigs tongues are very nice prepared in the same way as neats tongues an abundance of them are sold for reindeers tongues and under that name considered a wonderful luxury neats tongue should be boiled full three hours if it has been in salt long it is well to soak it over night in cold water put it in to boil when the water is cold if you boil it in a small pot it is well to change the water when it has boiled an hour and a half the fresh water should boil before the halfcooked tongue is put in again it is nicer for being kept in a cool place a day or two after being boiled nearly the same rules apply to salt beef a six pound piece of corned beef should boil full three hours and salt beef should be boiled four hours the saltier meat is the longer it should be boiled if very salt it is well to put it in soak over night change the water while cooking and observe the same rules as in boiling tongue if it is intended to be eaten when cold it is a good plan to put it between clean boards and press it down with heavy weights for a day or two a small leg of bacon should be boiled three hours ten pounds four hours twelve pounds five hours all meat should boil moderately furious boiling injures the flavor buffalos tongue should soak a day and a night and boil as much as six hours choice of meat if people wish to be economical they should take some pains to ascertain what are the cheapest pieces of meat to buy not merely those which are cheapest in price but those which go farthest when cooked that part of mutton called the rack which consists of the neck and a few of the rib bones below is cheap food it is not more than four or five cents a pound and four pounds will make a dinner for six people the neck cut into pieces and boiled slowly an hour and a quarter in little more than water enough to cover it makes very nice broth a great spoonful of rice should be washed and thrown in with the meat about twenty minutes before it is done put in a little thickening and season with salt pepper and sifted summersavory or sage the bones below the neck broiled make a good mutton chop if your family be small a rack of mutton will make you two dinnersbroth once and mutton chop with a few slices of salt pork for another if your family consist of six or seven you can have two dishes for a dinner if you boil the whole rack for broth there will be some left for mince meat liver is usually much despised but when well cooked it is very palatable and it is the cheapest of all animal food veal liver is by some considered the best veal liver is usually two cents a pound beef liver is one cent after you have fried a few slices of salt pork put the liver in while the fat is very hot and cook it through thoroughly if you doubt whether it be done cut into a slice and see whether it has turned entirely brown without any red stripe in the middle season it with pepper and salt and butter if you live on a farm and have butter in plenty it should not be cooked on furiously hot coals as it is very apt to scorch sprinkle in a little flour stir it and pour in boiling water to make gravy just as you would for fried meat some think liver is better dipped in sifted indian meal before it is fried it is good broiled and buttered like a steak it should be cut into slices about as thick as are cut for steaks the heart liver c of a pig is good fried so is that of a lamb the latter is commonly called lambfry and a dinner may be bought for six or eight cents be sure and ask for the sweetbread for butchers are extremely apt to reserve it for their own use and therefore lambfry is almost always sold without it fry five or six slices of salt pork after it is taken out put in your lambfry while the fat is hot do it thoroughly but be careful the fire is not too furious as it is apt to scorch take a large handful of parsley see that it is washed clean cut it up pretty fine then pour a little boiling water into the fat in which your dinner has been fried and let the parsley cook in it a minute or two then take it out in a spoon and lay it over your slices of meat some people who like thick gravies shake in a little flour into the spider before pouring in the boiling water bones from which roasting pieces have been cut may be bought in the market for ten or twelve cents from which a very rich soup may be made besides skimming off fat for shortening if the bones left from the rump be bought they will be found full of marrow and will give more than a pint of good shortening without injuring the richness of the soup the richest piece of beef for a soup is the leg and the shin of beef the leg is on the hind quarter and the shin is on the fore quarter the leg rand that is the thick part of the leg above the bony parts is very nice for mince pies some people have an objection to these parts of beef thinking they must be stringy but if boiled very tender the sinews are not perceived and add in fact to the richness of a soup the thick part of a thin flank is the most profitable part in the whole ox to buy it is not so handsome in appearance as some other pieces but it is thick meat with very little bone and is usually two cents less in the pound than more fashionable pieces it is good for roasting and particularly for corning and salting the navel end of the brisket is one of the best pieces for salting or corning and is very good for roasting the rattle rand is the very best piece for corning or salting a bullocks heart is very profitable to use as a steak broiled just like beef there are usually five pounds in a heart and it can be bought for twentyfive cents some people stuff and roast it the chuck between the neck and the shoulder is a very good piece for roastingfor steaks or for salting indeed it is good for almost anything and it is cheap being from four to five cents a pound the richest tenderest and most delicate piece of beef for roasting or for steak is the rump and the last cut of the sirloin it is peculiarly appropriate for an invalid as it is lighter food than any other beef but if economy be consulted instead of luxury the round will be bought in preference to the rump it is heartier food and of course less can be eaten and it is cheaper in price the shoulder of veal is the most economical for roasting or boiling it is always cheap let veal bear what price it may two dinners may be made from it the shoulder roasted and the knuckle cut off to be boiled with a bit of pork and greens or to be made into soup the breast of veal is a favorite piece and is sold high the hindquarter of veal and the loin make two good roasting pieces the leg is usually stuffed the line has the kidney upon it the forequarter has the brisket on it this is a sweet and delicate morsel for this reason some people prefer the forequarter to any other part always buy a shoulder of pork for economy for roasting or coming to boil cut off the leg to be boiled many people buy the upper part of the sparerib of pork thinking it the most genteel but the lower part of the sparerib toward the neck is much more sweet and juicy and there is more meat in proportion to the bone the breast or shoulder of mutton are both nice either for roasting boiling or broth the breast is richer than the shoulder it is more economical to buy a forequarter of mutton than a hindquarter there is usually two cents difference per pound the neck of fat mutton makes a good steak for broiling lamb brings the same price either forequarter or hindquarter therefore it is more profitable to buy a hindquarter than a forequarter especially as its own fat will cook it and there is no need of pork or butter in addition either part is good for roasting or boiling the loin of lamb is suitable for roasting and is the most profitable for a small family the leg is more suitable for boiling than for anything else the shoulder and breast are peculiarly suitable for broth the part that in lamb is called the loin in mutton is called the chop mutton chop is considered very good for broiling pigs head is a profitable thing to buy it is despised because it is cheap but when well cooked it is delicious well cleaned the tip of the snout chopped off and put in brine a week it is very good for boiling the cheeks in particular are very sweet they are better than any other pieces of pork to bake with beans the head is likewise very good baked about an hour and a half it tastes like roast pork and yields abundance of sweet fat for shortening common cooking it is necessary to be very careful of fresh meat in the summer season the moment it is brought into the house it should be carefully covered from the flies and put in the coldest place in the cellar if it consist of pieces they should be spread out separate from each other on a large dish and covered if you are not to cook it soon it is well to sprinkle salt on it the kidney and fat flabby parts should be raised up above the lean by a skewer or stick and a little salt strewn in if you have to keep it over night it should be looked to the last thing when you go to bed and if there is danger it should be scalded veal veal should boil about an hour if a neckpiece if the meat comes from a thicker more solid part it should boil longer no directions about these things will supply the place of judgment and experience both mutton and veal are better for being boiled with a small piece of salt pork veal broth is very good veal soup should be slowly stewed for two hours seasoned the same as above some people like a little sifted summersavory six or seven pounds of veal will roast in an hour and a half fried veal is better for being dipped in white of egg and rolled in nicely pounded crumbs of bread before it is cooked one egg is enough for a common dinner calfs head calfs head should be cleansed with very great care particularly the lights the head the heart and the lights should boil full two hours the liver should be boiled only one hour it is better to leave the windpipe on for if it hangs out of the pot while the head is cooking all the froth will escape through it the brains after being thoroughly washed should be put in a little bag with one pounded cracker or as much crumbled bread seasoned with sifted sage and tied up and boiled one hour after the brains are boiled they should be well broken up with a knife and peppered salted and buttered they should be put upon the table in a bowl by themselves boiling water thickened with flour and water with butter melted in it is the proper sauce some people love vinegar and pepper mixed with the melted butter but all are not fond of it and it is easy for each one to add it for themselves beef beef soup should be stewed four hours over a slow fire just water enough to keep the meat covered if you have any bones left of roast meat c it is a good plan to boil them with the meat and take them out half an hour before the soup is done a pint of flour and water with salt pepper twelve or sixteen onions should be put in twenty minutes before the soup is done be careful and not throw in salt and pepper too plentifully it is easy to add to it and not easy to diminish a lemon cut up and put in half an hour before it is done adds to the flavor if you have tomato catsup in the house a cupful will make soup rich some people put in crackers some thin slices of crust made nearly as short as common shortcake and some stir up two or three eggs with milk and flour and drop it in with a spoon a quarter of an hour to each pound of beef is considered a good rule for roasting but this is too much when the bone is large and the meal thin six pounds of the rump should roast six quarters of an hour but bony pieces less it should be done before a quick fire the quicker beefsteak can be broiled the better seasoned after it is taken from the gridiron alamode beef tie up a round of beef so as to keep it in shape make a stuffing of grated bread suet sweet herbs quarter of an ounce of nutmeg a few cloves pounded yolk of an egg cut holes in the beef and put in the stuffing leaving about half the stuffing to be made into balls tie the beef up in a cloth just cover it with water let it boil an hour and a half then turn it and let it boil an hour and a half more then turn out the liquor and put some skewers across the bottom of the pot and lay the beef upon it to brown turn it that it may brown on both sides put a pint of claret and some allspice and cloves into the liquor and boil some balls made of the stuffing in it mutton and lamb six or seven pounds of mutton will roast in an hour and a half lamb one hour mutton is apt to taste strong this may be helped by soaking the meat in a little salt and water for an hour before cooking however unless meat is very sweet it is best to corn it and boil it fresh meat should never be put in to cook till the water boils and it should be boiled in as little water as possible otherwise the flavor is injured mutton enough for a family of five or six should boil an hour and a half a leg of lamb should boil an hour or little more than an hour perhaps put a little thickening into boiling water strain it nicely and put sweet butter in it for sauce if your family like broth throw in some clear rice when you put in the meat the rice should be in proportion to the quantity of broth you mean to make a large table spoonful is enough for three pints of water seasoned with a very little pepper and salt summersavory or sage rubbed through a sieve thrown in pork fresh pork should be cooked more than any other meat a thick shoulder piece should be roasted full two hours and a half and other pieces less in proportion the slight sickness occasioned by eating roasted pork may be prevented by soaking it in salt and water the night before you cook it if called to prepare it on short notice it will answer to baste it with weak brine while roasting and then turn the brine off and throw it away roast pig strew fine salt over it an hour before it is put down it should not be cut entirely open fill it up plump with thick slices of buttered bread salt sweetmarjoram and sage spit it with the head next the point of the spit take off the joints of the leg and boil them with the liver with a little whole pepper allspice and salt for gravy sauce the upper part of the legs must be braced down with skewers shake on flour put a little water in the drippingpan and stir it often when the eyes drop out the pig is half done when it is nearly done baste it with butter cut off the head split it open between the eyes take out the brains and chop them fine with the liver and some sweetmarjoram and sage put this into melted butter and when it has boiled a few minutes add it to the gravy in the drippingpan when your pig is cut open lay it with the back to the edge of the dish half a head to be placed at each end a good sized pig needs to be roasted three hours sausages three teaspoons of powdered sage one and a half of salt and one of pepper to a pound of meat is good seasoning for sausages mince meat there is a great difference in preparing mince meat some make it a coarse unsavory dish and others make it nice and palatable no economical housekeeper will despise it for broken bits of meat and vegetables cannot so well be disposed of in any other way if you wish to have it nice mash your vegetables fine and chop your meat very fine warm it with what remains of sweet gravy or roastmeat drippings you may happen to have two or three apples pared cored sliced and fried to mix with it is an improvement some like a little sifted sage sprinkled in it is generally considered nicer to chop your meat fine warm it in gravy season it and lay it upon a large slice of toasted bread to be brought upon the table without being mixed with potatoes but if you have cold vegetables use them beans and peas baked beans are a very simple dish yet few cook them well they should be put in cold water and hung over the fire the night before they are baked in the morning they should be put in a colander and rinsed two or three times then again placed in a kettle with the pork you intend to bake covered with water and kept scalding hot an hour or more a pound of pork is quite enough for a quart of beans and that is a large dinner for a common family the rind of the pork should be slashed pieces of pork alternately fat and lean are the most suitable the cheeks are the best a little pepper sprinkled among the beans when they are placed in the beanpot will render them less unhealthy they should be just covered with water when put into the oven and the pork should be sunk a little below the surface of the beans bake three or four hours stewed beans are prepared in the same way the only difference is they are not taken out of the scalding water but are allowed to stew in more water with a piece of pork and a little pepper three hours or more dried peas need not be soaked over night they should be stewed slowly four or five hours in considerable water with a piece of pork the older beans and peas are the longer they should cook indeed this is the case with all vegetables souse pigs feet ears c should be cleaned after being soaked in water not very hot the hoofs will then come off easily with a sharp knife the hard rough places should be cut off they should be thoroughly singed and then boiled as much as four or five hours until they are too tender to be taken out with a fork when taken from the boiling water it should be put into cold water after it is packed down tight boil the jellylike liquor in which it was cooked with an equal quantity of vinegar salt as you think fit and cloves allspice and cinnamon at the rate of a quarter of a pound to one hundred weight to be poured on scalding hot tripe tripe should be kept in cold water or it will become too dry for cooking the water in which it is kept should be changed more or less frequently according to the warmth of the weather broiled like a steak buttered peppered c some people like it prepared like souse gravy most people put a half a pint of flour and water into their tinkitchen when they set meat down to roast this does very well but gravy is better flavored and looks darker to shake flour and salt upon the meat let it brown thoroughly put flour and salt on again and then baste the meat with about half a pint of hot water or more according to the gravy you want when the meat is about done pour these drippings into a skillet and let it boil if it is not thick enough shake in a little flour but be sure to let it boil and be well stirred after the flour is in if you fear it will be too greasy take off a cupful of the fat before you boil the fat of beef pork turkeys and geese is as good for shortening as lard salt gravy to your taste if you are very particular about dark gravies keep your dredgingbox full of scorched flour for that purpose poultry there are various ways of deciding about the age of poultry if the bottom of the breast bone which extends down between the legs is soft and gives easily it is a sign of youth if stiff the poultry is old if young the legs are lighter and the feet do not look so hard stiff and worn there is more deception in geese than in any other kind of poultry the above remarks are applied to them but there are other signs more infallible in a young goose the cavity under the wings is very tender it is a bad sign if you cannot with very little trouble push your finger directly into the flesh there is another means by which you may decide whether a goose be tender if it be frozen or not pass the head of a pin along the breast or sides and if the goose be young the skin will rip like fine paper under a knife something may be judged concerning the age of a goose by the thickness of the web between the toes when young this is tender and transparent it grows coarser and harder with time in broiling chickens it is difficult to do the inside of the thickest pieces without scorching the outside it is a good plan to parboil them about ten minutes in a spider or skillet covered close to keep the steam in then put them upon the gridiron broil and butter it is a good plan to cover them with a plate while on the gridiron they may be basted with a very little of the water in which they were broiled and if you have company who like melted butter to pour upon the chicken the remainder of the liquor will be good use for that purpose an hour is enough for common sized chickens to roast a smart fire is better than a slow one but they must be tended closely slices of bread buttered salted and peppered put into the stomach not the crop are excellent chickens should boil about an hour if old they should boil longer in as little water as will cook them chickenbroth made like muttonbroth fricasseed chicken brown singe the chickens cut them in pieces pepper salt and flour them fry them in fresh butter till they are very brown take the chickens out and make a good gravy into which put sweet herbs marjoram or sage according to your taste if necessary add pepper and salt butter and flour must be used in making the gravy in such quantities as to suit yourself for thickness and richness after this is all prepared the chicken must be stewed in it for half an hour closely covered a pint of gravy is about enough for two chickens i should think a piece of butter about as big as a walnut and a tablespoonful of flour would be enough for the gravy the herbs should of course be pounded and sifted some who love onions slice two or three and brown them with the chicken some slice a half lemon and stew with the chicken some add tomatoes catsup fricasseed chicken white the chickens are cut to pieces and covered with warm water to draw out the blood then put into a stewpan with three quarters of a pint of water or veal broth salt pepper flour butter mace sweet herbs pounded and sifted boil it half an hour if it is too fat skim it a little just before it is done mix the yolk of two eggs with a gill of cream grate in a little nutmeg stir it up till it is thick and smooth squeeze in half a lemon if you like onions stew some slices with the other ingredients to curry fowl fry out two or three slices of salt pork cut the chicken in pieces and lay it in the stewpan with one sliced onion when the fowl is tender take it out and put in thickening into the liquor one spoonful of flour and one spoonful of currypowder well stirred up in water then lay the chicken in again and let it boil up a few minutes a half a pint of liquor is enough for one chicken about half an hours stewing is necessary the juice of half a lemon improves it and some like a spoonful of tomatoes catsup chicken broth cut a chicken in quarters put it into three or four quarts of water put in a cup of rice while the water is cold season it with pepper and salt some use nutmeg let it stew gently until the chicken falls apart a little parsley shred fine is an improvement some slice up a small onion and stew with it a few pieces of cracker may be thrown in if you like a common sized goose should roast full three quarters of an hour the oil that drips from it should be nearly all turned off it makes the gravy too greasy and it is nice for shortening it should first be turned into cold water when hardened it should be taken off and scalded in a skillet this process leaves it as sweet as lard ducks do not need to be roasted more than fifteen or twenty minutes butter melted in boiling flour and water is proper sauce for boiled lamb mutton veal turkeys geese chickens and fish some people cut up parsley fine and throw in some people like capers put in others heat oysters through on the gridiron and take them out of the shells and throw them into the butter a good sized turkey should be roasted two hours and a half or three hours very slowly at first if you wish to make plain stuffing pound a cracker or crumble some bread very fine chop some raw salt pork very fine sift some sage and summersavory or sweetmarjoram if you have them in the house and fancy them and mould them all together seasoned with a little pepper an egg worked in makes the stuffing cut better but it is not worth while when eggs are dear about the same length of time is required for boiling and roasting pigeons may be either roasted potted or stewed potting is the best and the least trouble after they are thoroughly picked and cleaned put a small slice of salt pork and a little ball of stuffing into the body of every pigeon the stuffing should be made of one egg to one cracker an equal quantity of suet or butter seasoned with sweetmarjoram or sage if marjoram cannot be procured flour the pigeons well lay them close together in the bottom of the pot just cover them with water throw in a bit of butter and let them stew an hour and a quarter if young an hour and three quarters if old some people turn off the liquor just before they are done and brown the pigeons on the bottom of the pot but this is very troublesome as they are apt to break to pieces stewed pigeons are cooked in nearly the same way with the omission of the stuffing being dry meat they require a good deal of butter pigeons should be stuffed and roasted about fifteen minutes before a smart fire those who like birds just warmed through would perhaps think less time necessary it makes them nicer to butter them well just before you take them off the spit and sprinkle them with nicely pounded bread or cracker all poultry should be basted and floured a few minutes before it is taken up the age of pigeons can be judged by the color of the legs when young they are of a pale delicate brown as they grow older the color is deeper and redder a nice way of serving up cold chicken or pieces of cold fresh meat is to make them into a meat pie the gizzards livers and necks of poultry parboiled are good for the same purpose if you wish to bake your meat pie line a deep earthen or tin pan with paste made of flour cold water and lard use but little lard for the fat of the meat will shorten the crust lay in your bits of meat or chicken with two or three slices of salt pork place a few thin slices of your paste here and there drop in an egg or two if you have plenty fill the pan with flour and water seasoned with a little pepper and salt if the meat be very lean put in a piece of butter or such sweet gravies as you may happen to have cover the top with crust and put it in the oven or bakekettle to cook half an hour or an hour according to the size of the pie some people think this the nicest way of cooking fresh chickens when thus cooked they should be parboiled before they are put into the pan and the water they are boiled in should be added a chicken pie needs to be cooked an hour and a half if parboiled two hours if not if you wish to make a pot pie instead of a baked pie you have only to line the bottom of a porridge pot with paste lay in your meat season and moisten it in the same way cover it with paste and keep it slowly stewing about the same time that the other takes in both cases it is well to lift the upper crust a little while before you take up the pie and see whether the moisture has dried away if so pour in flour and water well mixed and let it boil up potatoes should be boiled in a separate vessel if you have fear that poultry may become musty before you want to cook it skin an onion and put in it a little pepper sprinkled in is good it should be kept hung up in a dry cool place if poultry is injured before you are aware of it wash it very thoroughly in pearlash and water and sprinkle pepper inside when you cook it some people hang up poultry with a muslin bag of charcoal inside it is a good plan to singe injured poultry over lighted charcoal and to hold a piece of lighted charcoal inside a few minutes many people parboil the liver and gizzard and cut it up very fine to be put into the gravy while the fowls are cooking in this case the water they are boiled in should be used to make the gravy fish cod has white stripes and a haddock black stripes they may be known apart by this haddock is the best for frying and cod is the best for boiling or for a chowder a thin tail is a sign of a poor fish always choose a thick fish when you are buying mackerel pinch the belly to ascertain whether it is good if it gives under your finger like a bladder half filled with wind the fish is poor if it feels hard like butter the fish is good it is cheaper to buy one large mackerel for ninepence than two for four pence halfpenny each fish should not be put in to fry until the fat is boiling hot it is very necessary to observe this it should be dipped in indian meal before it is put in and the skinny side uppermost when first put in to prevent its breaking it relishes better to be fried after salt pork than to be fried in lard alone people are mistaken who think fresh fish should be put into cold water as soon as it is brought into the house soaking it in water is injurious if you want to keep it sweet clean it wash it wipe it dry with a clean towel sprinkle salt inside and out put it in a covered dish and keep it on the cellar floor until you want to cook it if you live remote from the seaport and cannot get fish while hard and fresh wet it with an egg beaten before you meal it to prevent its breaking fish gravy is very much improved by taking out some of the fat after the fish is fried and putting in a little butter the fat thus taken out will do to fry fish again but it will not do for any kind of shortening shake in a little flour into the hot fat and pour in a little boiling water stir it up well as it boils a minute or so some people put in vinegar but this is easily added by those who like it a common sized codfish should be put in when the water is boiling hot and boil about twenty minutes haddock is not as good for boiling as cod it takes about the same time to boil a piece of halibut which weighs four pounds is a large dinner for a family of six or seven it should boil forty minutes no fish put in till the water boils melted butter for sauce clams should boil about fifteen minutes in their own water no other need be added except a spoonful to keep the bottom shells from burning it is easy to tell when they are done by the shells starting wide open after they are done they should be taken from the shells washed thoroughly in their own water and put in a stewing pan the water should then be strained through a cloth so as to get out all the grit the clams should be simmered in it ten or fifteen minutes a little thickening of flour and water added half a dozen slices of toasted bread or cracker and pepper vinegar and butter to your taste salt is not needed four pounds of fish are enough to make a chowder for four or five people half a dozen slices of salt pork in the bottom of the pot hang it high so that the pork may not burn take it out when done very brown put in a layer of fish cut in lengthwise slices then a layer formed of crackers small or sliced onions and potatoes sliced as thin as a fourpence mixed with pieces of pork you have fried then a layer of fish again and so on six crackers are enough strew a little salt and pepper over each layer over the whole pour a bowlfull of flour and water enough to come up even with the surface of what you have in the pot a sliced lemon adds to the flavor a cup of tomato catsup is very excellent some people put in a cup of beer a few clams are a pleasant addition it should be covered so as not to let a particle of steam escape if possible do not open it except when nearly done to taste if it be well seasoned salt fish should be put in a deep plate with just water enough to cover it the night before you intend to cook it it should not be boiled an instant boiling renders it hard it should lie in scalding hot water two or three hours the less water is used and the more fish is cooked at once the better water thickened with flour and water while boiling with sweet butter put in to melt is the common sauce it is more economical to cut salt pork into small bits and try it till the pork is brown and crispy it should not be done too fast lest the sweetness be scorched out salted shad and mackerel should be put into a deep plate and covered with boiling water for about ten minutes after it is thoroughly broiled before it is buttered this makes it tender takes off the coat of salt and prevents the strong oily taste so apt to be unpleasant in preserved fish the same rule applies to smoked salmon salt fish mashed with potatoes with good butter or pork scraps to moisten it is nicer the second day than it was the first the fish should be minced very fine while it is warm after it has got cold and dry it is difficult to do it nicely salt fish needs plenty of vegetables such as onions beets carrots c there is no way of preparing salt fish for breakfast so nice as to roll it up in little balls after it is mixed with mashed potatoes dip it into an egg and fry it brown a female lobster is not considered so good as a male in the female the sides of the head or what look like cheeks are much larger and jut out more than those of the male the end of a lobster is surrounded with what children call purses edged with a little fringe if you put your hand under these to raise it and find it springs back hard and firm it is a sign the lobster is fresh if they move flabbily it is not a good omen fried salt pork and apples is a favorite dish in the country but it is seldom seen in the city after the pork is fried some of the fat should be taken out lest the apples should be oily acid apples should be chosen because they cook more easily they should be cut in slices across the whole apple about twice or three times as thick as a new dollar fried till tender and brown on both sideslaid around the pork if you have cold potatoes slice them and brown them in the same way puddings baked indian pudding indian pudding is good baked scald a quart of milk skimmed milk will do and stir in seven table spoonfuls of sifted indian meal a teaspoonful of salt a teacupful of molasses and a great spoonful of ginger or sifted cinnamon baked three or four hours if you want whey you must be sure and pour in a little cold milk after it is all mixed boiled indian pudding indian pudding should be boiled four or five hours sifted indian meal and warm milk should be stirred together pretty stiff a little salt and two or three great spoonfuls of molasses added a spoonful of ginger if you like that spice boil it in a tight covered pan or a very thick cloth if the water gets in it will ruin it leave plenty of room for indian swells very much the milk with which you mix it should be merely warm if it be scalding the pudding will break to pieces some people chop sweet suet fine and warm in the milk others warm thin slices of sweet apple to be stirred into the pudding water will answer instead of milk flour or batter pudding common flour pudding or batter pudding is easily made those who live in the country can beat up five or six eggs with a quart of milk and a little salt with flour enough to make it just thick enough to pour without difficulty those who live in the city and are obliged to buy eggs can do with three eggs to a quart and more flour in proportion boil about three quarters of an hour bread pudding a nice pudding may be made of bits of bread they should be crumbled and soaked in milk over night in the morning beat up three eggs with it add a little salt tie it up in a bag or in a pan that will exclude every drop of water and boil it little more than an hour no puddings should be put into the pot till the water boils bread prepared in the same way makes good plumpuddings milk enough to make it quite soft four eggs a little cinnamon a spoonful of rosewater or lemonbrandy if you have it a teacupful of molasses or sugar to your taste if you prefer it a few dry clean raisins sprinkled in and stirred up thoroughly is all that is necessary it should bake or boil two hours rennet pudding if your husband brings home company when you are unprepared rennet pudding may be made at five minutes notice provided you keep a piece of calfs rennet ready prepared soaking in a bottle of wine one glass of this wine to a quart of milk will make a sort of cold custard sweetened with white sugar and spiced with nutmeg it is very good it should be eaten immediately in a few hours it begins to curdle custard puddings custard puddings sufficiently good for common use can be made with five eggs to a quart of milk sweetened with brown sugar and spiced with cinnamon or nutmeg and very little salt it is well to boil your milk and set it away till it gets cold boiling milk enriches it so much that boiled skimmilk is about as good as new milk a little cinnamon or lemon peel or peach leaves if you do not dislike the taste boiled in the milk and afterwards strained from it give a pleasant flavor bake fifteen or twenty minutes rice puddings if you want a common rice pudding to retain its flavor do not soak it or put it in to boil when the water is cold wash it tie it in a bag leave plenty of room for it to swell throw it in when the water boils and let it boil about an hour and a half the same sauce answers for all these kinds of puddings if you have rice left cold break it up in a little warm milk pour custard over it and bake it as long as you should custard it makes very good puddings and pies birds nest pudding if you wish to make what is called birds nest puddings prepare your custardtake eight

apple pudding may be made by rolling out a bit of common piecrust and filling it full of quartered apples tied up in a bag and boiled an hour and a half if the apples are sweet it will take two hours for acid things cook easily some people like little dumplings made by rolling up one apple pared and cored in a piece of crust and tying them up in spots all over the bag these do not need to be boiled more than an hour three quarters is enough if the apples are tender take sweet or pleasant flavored apples pare them and bore out the core without cutting the apple in two pill up the holes with washed rice boil them in a bag tied very tight an hour or hour and a half each apple should be tied up separately in different corners of the pudding bag cherry pudding for cherry dumpling make a paste about as rich as you make shortcake roll it out and put in a pint and a half or a quart of cherries according to the size of your family double the crust over the fruit tie it up tight in a bag

pudding whortleberries are good both in flour and indian puddings a pint of milk with a little salt and a little molasses stirred quite stiff with indian meal and a quart of berries stirred in gradually with a spoon makes a goodsized pudding leave room for it to swell and let it boil three hours when you put them into flour make your pudding just like batter puddings but considerably thicker or the berries will sink two hours is plenty long enough to boil no pudding should be put in till the water boils leave room to swell plum pudding if you wish to make a really nice soft custardlike plum pudding pound six crackers or dried crusts of light bread fine and soak them over night in milk enough to cover them put them in about three pints of milk beat up six eggs put in a little lemonbrandy a whole nutmeg and about three quarters of a pound of raisins which have been rubbed in flour bake it two hours or perhaps a little short of that it is easy to judge from the appearance whether it is done the surest way of making a light rich plum pudding is to spread slices of sweet light bread plentifully with butter on each side of the slices spread abundantly raisins or currants nicely prepared when they are all heaped up in a dish cover them with milk eggs sugar and spice well beat up and prepared just as you do for custards let it bake about an hour one sauce answers for common use for all sorts of puddings flourandwater stirred into boiling water sweetened to your taste with either molasses or sugar according to your ideas of economy a great spoonful of rosewater if you have it butter half as big as a hens egg if you want to make it very nice put in a glass of wine and grate nutmeg on the top when you wish better sauce than common take a quarter of a pound of butter and the same of sugar mould them well together with your hand add a little wine if you choose make it into a lump set it away to cool and grate nutmeg over it hasty pudding boil water a quart three pints or two quarts according to the size of your family sift your meal stir five or six spoonfuls of it thoroughly into a bowl of water when the water in the kettle boils pour into it the contents of the bowl stir it well and let it boil up thick put in salt to suit your own taste then stand over the kettle and sprinkle in meal handful after handful stirring it very thoroughly all the time and letting it boil between whiles when it is so thick that you stir it with great difficulty it is about right it takes about half an hours cooking eat it with milk or molasses either indian meal or rye meal may be used if the system is in a restricted state nothing can be better than rye hasty pudding and west india molasses this diet would save many a one the horrors of dyspepsia cheap custards one quart of milk boiled when boiling add three table spoonfuls of ground rice or rice that is boiled mixed smooth and fine in cold milk and one egg beaten give it one boil up and sweeten to your taste peach leaves or any spice you please boiled in the milk common pies mince pies boil a tender nice piece of beefany piece that is clear from sinews and gristle boil it till it is perfectly tender when it is cold chop it very fine and be very careful to get out every particle of bone and gristle the suet is sweeter and better to boil half an hour or more in the liquor the beef has been boiled in but few people do this pare core and chop the apples fine if you use raisins stone them if you use currants wash and dry them at the fire two pounds of beef after it is chopped three quarters of a pound of suet one pound and a quarter of sugar three pounds of apples two pounds of currants or raisins put in a gill of brandy lemonbrandy is better if you have any prepared make it quite moist with new cider i should not think a quart would be too much the more moist the better if it does not spill out into the oven a very little pepper if you use corn meat or tongue for pies it should be well soaked and boiled very tender if you use fresh beef salt is necessary in the seasoning one ounce of cinnamon one ounce of cloves two nutmegs add to the pleasantness of the flavor and a bit of sweet butter put upon the top of each pie makes them rich but these are not necessary baked three quarters of an hour if your apples are rather sweet grate in a whole lemon pumpkin and squash pie for common family pumpkin pies three eggs do very well to a quart of milk stew your pumpkin and strain it through a sieve or colander take out the seeds and pare the pumpkin or squash before you stew it but do not scrape the inside the part nearest the seed is the sweetest part of the squash stir in the stewed pumpkin till it is as thick as you can stir it round rapidly and easily if you want to make your pie richer make it thinner and add another egg one egg to a quart of milk makes very decent pies sweeten it to your taste with molasses or sugar some pumpkins require more sweetening than others two teaspoonfuls of salt two great spoonfuls of sifted cinnamon one great spoonful of ginger ginger will answer very well alone for spice if you use enough of it the outside of a lemon grated in is nice the more eggs the better the pie some put an egg to a gill of milk they should bake from forty to fifty minutes and even ten minutes longer if very deep carrot pie carrot pies are made like squash pies the carrots should be boiled very tender skinned and sifted both carrot pies and squash pies should be baked without an upper crust in deep plates to be baked an hour in quite a warm oven cherry pie cherry pies should be baked in a deep plate take the cherries from the stalks lay them in a plate and sprinkle a little sugar and cinnamon according to the sweetness of the cherries baked with a top and bottom crust three quarters of an hour whortleberry pie whortleberries make a very good common pie where there is a large family of children sprinkle a little sugar and sifted cloves into each pie baked in the same way and as long as cherry pies apple pie when you make apple pies stew your apples very little indeed just strike them through to make them tender some people do not stew them at all but cut them up in very thin slices and lay them in the crust pies made in this way may retain more of the spirit of the apple but i do not think the seasoning mixes in as well put in sugar to your taste it is impossible to make a precise rule because apples vary so much in acidity a very little salt and a small piece of butter in each pie makes them richer cloves and cinnamon are both suitable spice lemonbrandy and rosewater are both excellent a wineglass full of each is sufficient for three or four pies if your apples lack spirit grate in a whole lemon custard pie it is a general rule to put eight eggs to a quart of milk in making custard pies but six eggs are a plenty for any common use the milk should be boiled and cooled before it is used and bits of stickcinnamon and bits of lemonpeel boiled in it sweeten to your taste with clean sugar a very little sprinkling of salt makes them taste better grate in a nutmeg bake in a deep plate about 20 minutes are usually enough if you are doubtful whether they are done dip in the handle of a silver spoon or the blade of a small knife if it come out clean the pie is done do not pour them into your plates till the minute you put them into the oven it makes the crust wet and heavy to be baked with an under crust only some people bake the under crust a little before the custard is poured in this is to keep it from being clammy cranberry pie cranberry pies need very little spice a little nutmeg or cinnamon improves them they need a great deal of sweetening it is well to stew the sweetening with them at least a part of it it is easy to add if you find them too sour for your taste when cranberries are strained and added to about their own weight in sugar they make very delicious tarts no upper crust rhubarb stalks or persian apple rhubarb stalks or the persian apple is the earliest in gradient for pies which the spring offers the skin should be carefully stripped and the stalks cut into small bits and stewed very tender these are dear pies for they take an enormous quantity of sugar seasoned like apple pies gooseberries currants c are stewed sweetened and seasoned like apple pies in proportions suited to the sweetness of the fruit there is no way to judge but by your own taste always remember it is more easy to add seasoning than to diminish it pie crust to make pie crust for common use a quarter of a pound of butter is enough for a half a pound of flour take out about a quarter part of the flour you intend to use and lay it aside into the remainder of the flour rub butter thoroughly with your hands until it is so short that a handful of it clasped tight will remain in a ball without any tendency to fall in pieces then wet it with cold water roll it out on a board rub over the surface with flour stick little lumps of butter all over it sprinkle some flour over the butter and roll the dough all up flour the paste and flour the rollingpin roll it lightly and quickly flour it again stick in bits of butter do it up flour the rollingpin and roll it quickly and lightly and so on till you have used up your butter always roll from you pie crust should be made as cold as possible and set in a cool place but be careful it does not freeze do not use more flour than you can help in sprinkling and rolling the paste should not be rolled out more than three times if rolled too much it will not be flaky common cakes in all cakes where butter or eggs are used the butter should be very faithfully rubbed into the flour and the eggs beat to a foam before the ingredients are mixed gingerbread a very good way to make molasses gingerbread is to rub four pounds and a half of flour with half a pound of lard and half a pound of butter a pint of molasses a gill of milk teacup of ginger a teaspoonful of dissolved pearlash stirred together all mixed baked in shallow pans twenty or thirty minutes hard gingerbread is good to have in the family it keeps so well one pound of flour half a pound of butter and sugar rubbed into it half a pound of sugar great spoonful of ginger or more according to the strength of the ginger a spoonful of rosewater and a handful of caraway seed well beat up kneaded stiff enough to roll out and bake on flat pans bake twenty or thirty minutes a cake of common gingerbread can be stirred up very quick in the following way rub in a bit of shortening as big as an egg into a pint of flour if you use lard add a little salt two or three great spoonfuls of ginger one cup of molasses one cup and a half of cider and a great spoonful of dissolved pearlash put together and poured into the shortened flour while it is foaming to be put in the oven in a minute it ought to be just thick enough to pour into the pans with difficulty if these proportions make it too thin use less liquid the next time you try bake about twenty minutes if by carelessness you let a piece of shortcake dough grow sour put in a little pearlash and water warm a little butter according to the size of the dough knead in a cup or two of sugar two cups unless it is a very small bit two or three spoonfuls of ginger and a little rosewater knead it up thoroughly roll it out on a flat pan and bake it twenty minutes every thing mixed with pearlash should be put in the oven immediately cup cake cup cake is about as good as pound cake and is cheaper one cup of butter two cups of sugar three cups of flour and four eggs well beat together and baked in pans or cups bake twenty minutes and no more tea cake there is a kind of tea cake still cheaper three cups of sugar three eggs one cup of butter one cup of milk a spoonful of dissolved pearlash and four cups of flour well beat up if it is so stiff it will not stir easily add a little more milk cider cake cider cake is very good to be baked in small loaves one pound and a half of flour half a pound of sugar quarter of a pound of butter half a pint of cider one teaspoonful of pearlash spice to your taste bake till it turns easily in the pans i should think about half an hour election cake oldfashioned election cake is made of four pounds of flour three quarters of a pound of butter four eggs one pound of sugar one pound of currants or raisins if you choose half a pint of good yeast wet it with milk as soft as it can be and be moulded on a board set to rise over night in winter in warm weather three hours is usually enough for it to rise a loaf the size of common flour bread should bake three quarters of an hour sponge cake the nicest way to make sponge cake or dietbread is the weight of six eggs in sugar the weight of four eggs in flour a little rosewater the whites and yolks should be beaten thoroughly and separately the eggs and sugar should be well beaten together but after the flour is sprinkled it should not be stirred a moment longer than is necessary to mix it well it should be poured into the pan and got into the oven with all possible expedition twenty minutes is about long enough to bake not to be put in till some other articles have taken off the first few minutes of furious heat wedding cake good common wedding cake may be made thus four pounds of flour three pounds of butter three pounds of sugar four pounds of currants two pounds of raisins twentyfour eggs half a pint of brandy or lemonbrandy one ounce of mace and three nutmegs a little molasses makes it dark colored which is desirable half a pound of citron improves it but it is not necessary to be baked two hours and a half or three hours after the oven is cleared it is well to shut the door for eight or ten minutes to let the violence of the heat subside before cake or bread is put in to make icing for your wedding cake beat the whites of eggs to an entire froth and to each egg add five teaspoonfuls of sifted loaf sugar gradually beat it a great while put it on when your cake is hot or cold as is most convenient it will dry in a warm room a short distance from a gentle fire or in a warm oven loaf cake very good loaf cake is made with two pounds of flour half a pound of sugar quarter of a pound of butter two eggs a gill of sweet emptings half an ounce of cinnamon or cloves a large spoonful of lemonbrandy or rosewater if it is not about as thin as goad white bread dough add a little milk a common sized loaf is made by these proportions bake about three quarters of an hour a handy way to make loaf cake is to take about as much of your white bread dough or sponge as you think your pan will hold and put it into a pan in which you have already beat up three or four eggs six ounces of butter warmed and half a pound of sugar a spoonful of rosewater little sifted cinnamon or cloves the materials should be well mixed and beat before the dough is put in and then it should be all kneaded well together about as stiff as white bread put in half a pound of currants or raisins with the butter if you choose it should stand in the pan two or three hours to rise and be baked about three quarters of an hour if the pan is a common sized breadpan if you have loaf cake slightly injured by time or by being kept in the cellar cut off all appearance of mould from the outside wipe it with a clean cloth and wet it well with strong brandy and water sweetened with sugar then put it in your oven and let the heat strike through it for fifteen or twenty minutes unless very bad this will restore the sweetness caraway cakes take one pound of flour three quarters of a pound of sugar half a pound of butter a glass of rosewater four eggs and half a teacup of caraway seedthe materials well rubbed together and beat up drop them from a spoon on tin sheets and bake them brown in rather a slow oven twenty minutes or half an hour is enough to bake them doughnuts for doughnuts take one pint of flour half a pint of sugar three eggs a piece of butter as big as an egg and a teaspoonful of dissolved pearlash when you have no eggs a gill of lively emptings will do but in that case they must be made over night cinnamon rosewater or lemonbrandy if you have it if you use part lard instead of butter add a little salt not put in till the fat is very hot the more fat they are fried in the less they will soak fat pancakes pancakes should be made of half a pint of milk three great spoonfuls of sugar one or two eggs a teaspoonful of dissolved pearlash spiced with cinnamon or cloves a little salt rosewater or lemonbrandy just as you happen to have it flour should be stirred in till the spoon moves round with difficulty if they are thin they are apt to soak fat have the fat in your skillet boiling hot and drop them in with a spoon let them cook till thoroughly brown the fat which is left is good to shorten other cakes the more fat they are cooked in the less they soak if you have no eggs or wish to save them use the above ingredients and supply the place of eggs by two or three spoonfuls of lively emptings but in this case they must be made five or six hours before they are cookedand in winter they should stand all night a spoonful or more of ne rum makes pancakes light flip makes very nice pancakes in this case nothing is done but to sweeten your mug of beer with molasses put in one glass of ne rum heat it till it foams by putting in a hot poker and stir it up with flour as thick as other pancakes fritters flatjacks or fritters do not differ from pancakes only in being mixed softer the same ingredients are used in about the same quantities only most people prefer to have no sweetening put in them because they generally have butter sugar and nutmeg put on them after they are done excepting for company the nutmeg can be well dispensed with they are not to be boiled in fat like pancakes the spider or griddle should be well greased and the cakes poured on as large as you want them when it is quite hot when it gets brown on one side to be turned over upon the other fritters are better to be baked quite thin either flour indian or rye is good sour beer with a spoonful of pearlash is good both for pancakes and fritters if you have any cold rice left it is nice to break it up fine in warm milk put in a little salt after you have put milk enough for the cakes you wish to make a half pint or more stir in flour till it is thick enough to pour for fritters it does very well without an egg but better with one to be fried like other flatjacks sugar and nutmeg are to be put on when they are buttered if you like short cake if you have sour milk or buttermilk it is well to make it into short cakes for tea rub in a very small bit of shortening or three tablespoonfuls of cream with the flour put in a teaspoonful of strong dissolved pearlash into your sour milk and mix your cake pretty stiff to bake in the spider on a few embers when people have to buy butter and lard short cakes are not economical food a half pint of flour will make a cake large enough to cover a common plate rub in thoroughly a bit of shortening as big as a hens egg put in a teaspoonful of dissolved pearlash wet it with cold water knead it stiff enough to roll well to bake on a plate or in a spider it should bake as quick as it can and not burn the first side should stand longer to the fire than the last indian cake indian cake or bannock is sweet and cheap food one quart of sifted meal two great spoonfuls of molasses two teaspoonfuls of salt a bit of shortening half as big as a hens egg stirred together make it pretty moist with scalding water put it into a well greased pan smooth over the surface with a spoon and bake it brown on both sides before a quick fire a little stewed pumpkin scalded with the meal improves the cake bannock split and dipped in butter makes very nice toast a richer indian cake may be made by stirring one egg to a half pint of milk sweetened with two great spoonfuls of molasses a little ginger or cinnamon indian stirred in till it is just about thick enough to pour spider or bakekettle well greased cake poured in covered up baked half an hour or three quarters according to the thickness of the cake if you have sour milk or buttermilk it is very nice for this kind of cake the acidity corrected by a teaspoonful of dissolved pearlash it is a rule never to use pearlash for indian unless to correct the sourness of milk it injures the flavor of the meal nice suet improves all kinds of indian cakes very much two cups of indian meal one tablespoonful molasses two cups milk a little salt a handful flour a little saleratus mixed up thin and poured into a buttered bakekettle hung over the fire uncovered until you can bear your finger upon it and then set down before the fire bake half an hour bread yeast c it is more difficult to give rules for making bread than for anything else it depends so much on judgment and experience in summer bread should be mixed with cold water during a chilly damp spell the water should be slightly warm in severe cold weather it should be mixed quite warm and set in a warm place during the night if your yeast is new and lively a small quantity will make the bread rise if it be old and heavy it will take more in these things i believe wisdom must be gained by a few mistakes six quarts of meal will make two good sized loaves of brown bread some like to have it half indian meal and half rye meal others prefer it one third indian and two thirds rye many mix their brown bread over night but there is no need of it and it is more likely to sour particularly in summer if you do mix it the night before you bake it you must not put in more than half the yeast i am about to mention unless the weather is intensely cold the meal should be sifted separately put the indian in your breadpan sprinkle a little salt among it and wet it thoroughly with scalding water stir it up while you are scalding it be sure and have hot water enough for indian absorbs a great deal of water when it is cool pour in your rye add two gills of lively yeast and mix it with water as stiff as you can knead it let it stand an hour and a half in a cool place in summer on the hearth in winter it should be put into a very hot oven and baked three or four hours it is all the better for remaining in the oven over night flour bread should have a sponge set the night before the sponge should be soft enough to pour mixed with water warm or cold according to the temperature of the weather one gill of lively yeast is enough to put into sponge for two loaves i should judge about three pints of sponge would be right for two loaves the warmth of the place in which the sponge is set should be determined by the coldness of the weather if your sponge looks frothy in the morning it is a sign your bread will be good if it does not rise stir in a little more emptings if it rises too much taste of it to see if it has any acid taste if so put in a teaspoonful of pearlash when you mould in your flour be sure the pearlash is well dissolved in water if there are little lumps your bread will be full of bitter spots about an hour before your oven is ready stir in flour into your sponge till it is stiff enough to lay on a well floured board or table knead it up pretty stiff and put it into well greased pans and let it stand in a cool or warm place according to the weather if the oven is ready put them in fifteen or twenty minutes after the dough begins to rise up and crack if the oven is not ready move the pans to a cooler spot to prevent the dough from becoming sour by too much rising common sized loaves will bake in three quarters of an hour if they slip easily in the pans it is a sign they are done some people do not set a soft sponge for flour bread they knead it up all ready to put in the pans the night before and leave it to rise white bread and pies should not be set in the oven until the brown bread and beans have been in half an hour if the oven be too hot it will bind the crust so suddenly that the bread cannot rise if it be too cold the bread will fall flour bread should not be too stiff some people like one third indian in their flour others like one third rye and some think the nicest of all bread is one third indian one third rye and one third flour made according to the directions for flour bread when indian is used it should be salted and scalded before the other meal is put in a mixture of other grains is economical when flour is high dyspepsia breadthe american farmer publishes the following receipt for making bread which has proved highly salutary to persons afflicted with that complaint vizthree quarts unbolted wheat meal one quart soft water warm but not hot one gill of fresh yeast one gill of molasses or not as may suit the taste one teaspoonful of saleratus this will make two loaves and should remain in the oven at least one hour and when taken out placed where they will cool gradually dyspepsia crackers can be made with unbolted flour water and saleratus to make rice breadboil a pint of rice soft add a pint of leaven then three quarts of the flour put it to rise in a tin or earthen vessel until it has risen sufficiently divide it into three parts then bake it as other bread and you will have three large loaves heating ovens must be regulated by experience and observation there is a difference in wood in giving out heat there is a great difference in the construction of ovens and when an oven is extremely cold either on account of the weather or want of use it must be heated more economical people heat ovens with pine wood fagots brush and such light stuff if you have none but hard wood you must remember that it makes very hot coals and therefore less of it will answer a smart fire for an hour and a half is a general rule for common sized family ovens provided brown bread and beans are to be baked an hour is long enough to heat an oven for flour bread pies bear about as much heat as flour bread pumpkin pies will bear more if you are afraid your oven is too hot throw in a little flour and shut it up for a minute if it scorches black immediately the heat is too furious if it merely browns it is right some people wet an old broom two or three times and turn it round near the top of die oven till it dries this prevents pies and cake from scorching on the top when you go into a new house heat your oven two or three times to get it seasoned before you use it after the wood is burned rake the coals over the bottom of the oven and let them lie a few minutes those who make their own bread should make yeast too when bread is nearly out always think whether yeast is in readiness for it takes a day and night to prepare it one handful of hops with two or three handsful of malt and rye bran should be boiled fifteen or twenty minutes in two quarts of water then strained hung on to boil again and thickened with half a pint of rye and water stirred up quite thick and a little molasses boil it a minute or two and then take it off to cool when just about lukewarm put in a cupful of good lively yeast and set it in a cool place in summer and warm place in winter if it is too warm when you put in the old yeast all the spirit will be killed in summer yeast sours easily therefore make but little at a time bottle it when it gets well a working it keeps better when the air is corked out if you find it acid but still spirited put a little pearlash to it as you use it but by no means put it into your bread unless it foams up bright and lively as soon as the pearlash mixes with it never keep yeast in tin it destroys its life there is another method of making yeast which is much easier and i think quite as good stir rye and cold water till you make a stiff thickening then pour in boiling water and stir it all the time till you make it as thin as the yeast you buy three or four table spoons heaping full are enough for a quart of water when it gets about cold put in half a pint of lively yeast when it works well bottle it but if very lively do not cork your bottle very tight for fear it will burst always think to make new yeast before the old is gone so that you may have some to work with always wash and scald your bottle clean after it has contained sour yeast beware of freezing yeast milk yeast is made quicker than any other a pint of new milk with a teaspoonful of salt and a large spoon of flour stirred in set by the fire to keep lukewarm will make yeast fit for use in an hour twice the quantity of common yeast is necessary and unless used soon is good for nothing bread made of this yeast dries sooner it is convenient in summer when one wants to make biscuits suddenly a species of leaven may be made that will keep any length of time three ounces of hops in a pail of water boiled down to a quart strain it and stir in a quart of rye meal while boiling hot cool it and add half a pint of good yeast after it has risen a few hours thicken it with indian meal stiff enough to roll out upon a board then put it in the sun and air a few days to dry a piece of this cake two inches square dissolved in warm water and thickened with a little flour will make a large loaf of bread potatoes make very good yeast mash three large potatoes fine pour a pint of boiling water over them when almost cold stir in two spoonfuls of flour two of molasses and a cup of good yeast this yeast should be used while new preserves c economical people will seldom use preserves except for sickness they are unhealthy expensive and useless to those who are well barberries preserved in molasses are very good for common use boil the molasses skim it throw in the barberries and simmer them till they are soft if you wish to lay by a few for sickness preserve them in sugar by the same rule as other preserves melt the sugar skim it throw in the barberries when done soft take them out and throw in others a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit is the rule for all preserves the sugar should be melted over a fire moderate enough not to scorch it when melted it should be skimmed clean and the fruit dropped in to simmer till it is soft plums and things of which the skin is liable to be broken do better to be put in little jars with their weight of sugar and the jars set in a kettle of boiling water till the fruit is done see the water is not so high as to boil into the jars when you put preserves in jars lay a white paper thoroughly wet with brandy flat upon the surface of the preserves and cover them carefully from the air if they begin to mould scald them by setting them in the oven till boiling hot glass is much better than earthen for preserves they are not half as apt to ferment currant jelly currant jelly is a useful thing for sickness if it be necessary to wash your currants be sure they are thoroughly drained or your jelly will be thin break them up with a pestle and squeeze them through a cloth put a pint of clean sugar to a pint of juice and boil it slowly till it becomes ropy great care must be taken not to do it too fast it is spoiled by being scorched it should be frequently skimmed while simmering if currants are put in a jar and kept in boiling water and cooked before they are strained they are more likely to keep a long time without fermenting currant wine those who have more currants than they have money will do well to use no wine but of their own manufacture break and squeeze the currants put three pounds and a half of sugar to two quarts of juice and two quarts of water put in a keg or barrel do not close the bung tight for three or four days that the air may escape while it is fermenting after it is done fermenting close it up tight where raspberries are plenty it is a great improvement to use half raspberry juice and half currant juice brandy is unnecessary when the abovementioned proportions are observed it should not be used under a year or two age improves it raspberry shrub raspberry shrub mixed with water is a pure delicious drink for summer and in a country where raspberries are abundant it is good economy to make it answer instead of port and catalonia wine put raspberries in a pan and scarcely cover them with strong vinegar add a pint of sugar to a pint of juice of this you can judge by first trying your pan to see how much it holds scald it skim it and bottle it when cold coffee as substitutes for coffee some use dry brown bread crusts and roast them others soak rye grain in rum and roast it others roast peas in the same way as coffee none of these are very good and peas so used are considered unhealthy where there is a large family of apprentices and workmen and coffee is very dear it may be worth while to use the substitutes or to mix them half and half with coffee but after all the best economy is to go without french coffee is so celebrated that it may be worth while to tell how it is made though no prudent housekeeper will make it unless she has boarders who are willing to pay for expensive cooking the coffee should be roasted more than is common with us it should not hang drying over the fire but should be roasted quick it should be ground soon after roasting and used as soon as it is ground those who pride themselves on firstrate coffee burn it and grind it every morning the powder should be placed in the coffeepot in the proportions of an ounce to less than a pint of water the water should be poured upon the coffee boiling hot the coffee should be kept at the boiling point but should not boil coffee made in this way must be made in a biggin it would not be clear in a common coffeepot a bit of fishskin as big as a ninepence thrown into coffee while it is boiling tends to make it clear if you use it just as it comes from the saltfish it will be apt to give an unpleasant taste to the coffee it should be washed clean as a bit of cloth and hung up till perfectly dry the white of eggs and even egg shells are good to settle coffee rind of salt pork is excellent some people think coffee is richer and clearer for having a bit of sweet butter or a whole egg dropped in and stirred just before it is done roasting and ground up shell and all with the coffee but these things are not economical except on a farm where butter and eggs are plenty a half a gill of cold water poured in after you take your coffeepot off the fire will usually settle the coffee if you have not cream for coffee it is a very great improvement to boil your milk and use it while hot chocolate many people boil chocolate in a coffeepot but i think it is better to boil it in a skillet or something open a piece of chocolate about as big as a dollar is the usual quantity for a quart of water but some put in more and some less when it boils pour in as much milk as you like and let them boil together three or four minutes it is much richer with the milk boiled in it put the sugar in either before or after as you please nutmeg improves it the chocolate should be scraped fine before it is put into the water tea young hyson is supposed to be a more profitable tea than hyson but though the quantity to a pound is greater it has not so much strength in point of economy therefore there is not much difference between them hyson tea and souchong mixed together half and half is a pleasant beverage and is more healthy than green tea alone be sure that water boils before it is poured upon tea a teaspoonful to each person and one extra thrown in is a good rule steep ten or fifteen minutes pickles muskmelons should be picked for mangoes when they are green and hard they should be cut open after they have been in salt water ten days the inside scraped out clean and filled with mustardseed allspice horseradish small onions c and sewed up again scalding vinegar poured upon them when walnuts are so ripe that a pin will go into them easily they are ready for pickling they should be soaked twelve days in very strong cold salt and water which has been boiled and skimmed a quantity of vinegar enough to cover them well should be boiled with whole pepper mustardseed small onions or garlic cloves ginger and horseradish this should not be poured upon them till it is cold they should be pickled a few months before they are eaten to be kept close covered for the air softens them the liquor is an excellent catsup to be eaten on fish put peppers into strong salt and water until they become yellow then turn them green by keeping them in warm salt and water shifting them every two days then drain them and pour scalding vinegar over them a bag of mustardseed is an improvement if there is mother in vinegar scald and strain it cucumbers should be in weak brine three or four days after they are picked then they should be put in a tin or wooden pail of clean water and kept slightly warm in the kitchen corner for two or three days then take as much vinegar as you think your pickle jar will hold scald it with pepper allspice mustardseed flagroot horseradish c if you happen to have them half of them will spice the pickles very well throw in a bit of alum as big as a walnut this serves to make pickles hard skim the vinegar clean and pour it scalding hot upon the cucumbers brass vessels are not healthy for preparing anything acid red cabbages need no other pickling than scalding spiced vinegar poured upon them and suffered to remain eight or ten days before you eat them some people think it improves them to keep them in salt and water twentyfour hours before they are pickled if you find your pickles soft and insipid it is owing to the weakness of the vinegar throw away the vinegar or keep it to clean your brass kettles then cover your pickles with strong scalding vinegar into which a little allspice ginger horseradish and alum have been thrown by no means omit a pretty large bit of alum pickles attended to in this way will keep for years and be better and better every year some people prefer pickled nasturtionseed to capers they should be kept several days after they are gathered and then covered with boiling vinegar and bottled when cold they are not fit to be eaten for some months martinoes are prepared in nearly the same way as other pickles the salt and water in which they are put two or three days previous to pickling should be changed every day because martinoes are very apt to become soft no spice should be used but allspice cloves and cinnamon the martinoes and the spice should be scalded in the vinegar instead of pouring the vinegar over the martinoes beer beer is a good family drink a handful of hops to a pailful of water and a halfpint of molasses makes good hop beer spruce mixed with hops is pleasanter than hops alone boxberry feverbush sweet fern and horseradish make a good and healthy dietdrink the winter evergreen or rheumatism weed thrown in is very beneficial to humors be careful and not mistake killlamb for winterevergreen they resemble each other malt mixed with a few hops makes a weak kind of beer but it is cool and pleasant it needs less molasses than hops alone the rule is about the same for all beer boil the ingredients two or three hours pour in a halfpint of molasses to a pailful while the beer is scalding hot strain the beer and when about lukewarm put a pint of lively yeast to a barrel leave the bung loose till the beer is done working you can ascertain this by observing when the froth subsides if your family be large and the beer will be drank rapidly it may as well remain in the barrel but if your family be small fill what bottles you have with it it keeps better bottled a raw potato or two cut up and thrown in while the ingredients are boiling is said to make beer spirited ginger beer is made in the following proportionsone cup of ginger one pint of molasses one pail and a half of water and a cup of lively yeast most people scald the ginger in half a pail of water and then fill it up with a pailful of cold but in very hot weather some people stir it up cold yeast must not be put in till it is cold or nearly cold if not to be drank within twentyfour hours it must be bottled as soon as it works table beer should be drawn off into stone jugs with a lump of white sugar in each securely corked it is brisk and pleasant and continues good several months potato cheese is much sought after in various parts of europe i do not know whether it is worth seeking after or not the following is the receipt for makingselect good white potatoes boil them and when cold peel and reduce them to a pulp with a rasp or mortar to five pounds of this pulp which must be very uniform and homogeneous add a pint of sour milk and the requisite portion of salt knead the whole well cover it and let it remain three or four days according to the season then knead it afresh and place the cheeses in small baskets when they will part with their superfluous moisture dry them in the shade and place them in layers in large pots or kegs where they may remain a fortnight the older they are the finer they become this cheese has the advantage of never engendering worms and of being preserved fresh for many years provided it is kept in a dry place and in well closed vessels general maxims for health rise early eat simple food take plenty of exercise never fear a little fatigue let not children be dressed in tight clothes it is necessary their limbs and muscles should have full play if you wish for either health or beauty avoid the necessity of a physician if you can by careful attention to your diet eat what best agrees with your system and resolutely abstain from what hurts you however well you may like it a few days abstinence and cold water for a beverage has driven off many an approaching disease if you find yourself really ill send for a good physician have nothing to do with quacks and do not tamper with quack medicines you do not know what they are and what security have you that they know what they are wear shoes that are large enough it not only produces corns but makes the feet misshapen to cramp them wash very often and rub the skin thoroughly with a hard brush let those who love to be invalids drink strong green tea eat pickles preserves and rich pastry as far as possible eat and sleep at regular hours wash the eyes thoroughly in cold water every morning do not read or sew at twilight or by too dazzling a light if farsighted read with rather less light and with the book somewhat nearer to the eye than you desire if nearsighted read with a book as far off as possible both these imperfections may be diminished in this way clean teeth in pure water two or three times a day but above all be sure to have them clean before you go to bed have your bedchamber well aired and have fresh bed linen every week never have the wind blowing directly upon you from open windows during the night it is not healthy to sleep in heated rooms let children have their bread and milk before they have been long up cold water and a run in the fresh air before breakfast too frequent use of an ivory comb injures the hair thorough combing washing in suds or ne rum and thorough brushing will keep it in order and the washing does not injure the hair as is generally supposed keep childrens hair cut close until ten or twelve years old it is better for health and the beauty of the hair do not sleep with hair frizzled or braided do not make children crosseyed by having hair hang about their foreheads where they see it continually hints to persons of moderate fortune first published in the massachusetts journal when clouds are seen wise men put on their cloaksshakspeare furniture the prevailing evil of the present day is extravagance i know very well that the old are too prone to preach about modern degeneracy whether they have cause or not but laugh as we may at the sage advice of our fathers it is too plain that our present expensive habits are productive of much domestic unhappiness and injurious to public prosperity our wealthy people copy all the foolish and extravagant caprice of european fashion without considering that we have not their laws of inheritance among us and that our frequent changes of policy render property far more precarious here than in the old world however it is not to the rich i would speak they have an undoubted right to spend their thousands as they please and if they spend them ridiculously it is consoling to reflect that they must in some way or other benefit the poorer classes people of moderate fortunes have likewise an unquestioned right to dispose of their hundreds as they please but i would ask is it wise to risk your happiness in a foolish attempt to keep up with the opulent of what use is the effort which takes so much of your time and all of your income nay if any unexpected change in affairs should deprive you of a few yearly hundreds you will find your expenses have exceeded your income thus the foundation of an accumulating debt will be laid and your family will have formed habits but poorly calculated to save you from the threatened ruin not one valuable friend will be gained by living beyond your means and old age will be left to comparative if not to utter poverty there is nothing in which the extravagance of the present day strikes me so forcibly as the manner in which our young people of moderate fortune furnish their houses a few weeks since i called upon a farmers daughter who had lately married a young physician of moderate talents and destitute of fortune her father had given her at her marriage all he ever expected to give her viz two thousand dollars yet the lower part of her house was furnished with as much splendor as we usually find among the wealthiest the whole two thousand had been expended upon brussels carpets alabaster vases mahogany chairs and marble tables i afterwards learned that the more useful household utensils had been forgotten and that a few weeks after her wedding she was actually obliged to apply to her husband for money to purchase baskets iron spoons clotheslines c and her husband made irritable by the want of money pettishly demanded why she had bought so many things they did not want did the doctor gain any patients or she a single friend by offering their visiters water in richlycut glass tumblers or serving them with costly damask napkins instead of plain soft towels no their foolish vanity made them less happy and no more respectable had the young lady been content with kidderminster carpets and tasteful vases of her own making she might have put one thousand dollars at interest and had she obtained six per cent it would have clothed her as well as the wife of any man who depends merely upon his own industry ought to be clothed this would have saved much domestic disquiet for after all human nature is human nature and a wife is never better beloved because she teases for money education of daughters there is no subject so much connected with individual happiness and national prosperity as the education of daughters it is a true and therefore an old remark that the situation and prospects of a country may be justly estimated by the character of its women and we all know how hard it is to engraft upon a womans character habits and principles to which she was unaccustomed in her girlish days it is always extremely difficult and sometimes utterly impossible is the present education of young ladies likely to contribute to their own ultimate happiness or to the welfare of the country there are many honorable exceptions but we do think the general tone of female education is bad the greatest and most universal error is teaching girls to exaggerate the importance of getting married and of course to place an undue importance upon the polite attentions of gentlemen it was but a few days since i heard a pretty and sensible girl say did you ever see a man so ridiculously fond of his daughters as mr he is all the time with them the other night at the party i went and took anna away by mere force for i knew she must feel dreadfully to have her father waiting upon her all the time while the other girls were talking with the beaux and another young friend of mine said with an air most laughably serious i dont think harriet and julia enjoyed themselves at all last night dont you think nobody but their brother offered to hand them to the supperroom that a mother should wish to see her daughters happily married is natural and proper that a young lady should be pleased with polite attentions is likewise natural and innocent but this undue anxiety this foolish excitement about showing off the attentions of somebody no matter whom is attended with consequences seriously injurious it promotes envy and rivalship it leads our young girls to spend their time between the public streets the ball room and the toilet and worst of all it leads them to contract engagements without any knowledge of their own hearts merely for the sake of being married as soon as their companions when married they find themselves ignorant of the important duties of domestic life and its quiet pleasures soon grow tiresome to minds worn out by frivolous excitements if they remain unmarried their disappointment and discontent are of course in proportion to their exaggerated idea of the eclat attendant upon having a lover the evil increases in a startling ratio for these girls so injudiciously educated will nine times out of ten make injudicious mothers aunts and friends thus follies will be accumulated unto the third and fourth generation young ladies should be taught that usefulness is happiness and that all other things are but incidental with regard to matrimonial speculations they should be taught nothing leave the affections to nature and to truth and all will end well how many can i at this moment recollect who have made themselves unhappy by marrying for the sake of the name of being married how many do i know who have been instructed to such watchfulness in the game that they have lost it by trumping their own tricks one great cause of the vanity extravagance and idleness that are so fast growing upon our young ladies is the absence of domestic education by domestic education i do not mean the sending daughters into the kitchen some half dozen times to weary the patience of the cook and to boast of it the next day in the parlor i mean two or three years spent with a mother assisting her in her duties instructing brothers and sisters and taking care of their own clothes this is the way to make them happy as well as good wives for being early accustomed to the duties of life they will sit lightly as well as gracefully upon them but what time do modern girls have for the formation of quiet domestic habits until sixteen they go to school sometimes these years are judiciously spent and sometimes they are half wasted too often they are spent in acquiring the elements of a thousand sciences without being thoroughly acquainted with any or in a variety of accomplishments of very doubtful value to people of moderate fortune as soon as they leave school and sometimes before they begin a round of balls and parties and staying with gay young friends dress and flattery take up all their thoughts what time have they to learn to be useful what time have they to cultivate the still and gentle affections which must in every situation of life have such an important effect on a womans character and happiness as far as parents can judge what will be a daughters station education should be adapted to it but it is well to remember that it is always easy to know how to spend riches and always safe to know how to bear poverty a superficial acquaintance with such accomplishments as music and drawing is useless and undesirable they should not be attempted unless there is taste talent and time enough to attain excellence i have frequently heard young women of moderate fortune say i have not opened my piano these five years i wish i had the money expended upon it if i had employed as much time in learning useful things i should have been better fitted for the cares of my family by these remarks i do not mean to discourage an attention to the graces of life gentility and taste are always lovely in all situations but good things carried to excess are often productive of bad consequences when accomplishments and dress interfere with the duties and permanent happiness of life they are unjustifiable and displeasing but where there is a solid foundation in mind and heart all those elegancies are but becoming ornaments some are likely to have more use for them than others and they are justified in spending more time and money upon them but no one should be taught to consider them valuable for mere parade and attraction making the education of girls such a series of mantraps makes the whole system unhealthy by poisoning the motive in tracing evils of any kind which exist in society we must after all be brought up against the great cause of all mischiefmismanagement in education and this remark applies with peculiar force to the leading fault of the present day viz extravagance it is useless to expend our ingenuity in purifying the stream unless the fountain be cleansed if young men and young women are brought up to consider frugality contemptible and industry degrading it is vain to expect they will at once become prudent and useful when the cares of life press heavily upon them generally speaking when misfortune comes upon those who have been accustomed to thoughtless expenditure it sinks them to discouragement or what is worse drives them to desperation it is true there are exceptions there are a few an honorable few who late in life with roman severity of resolution learn the longneglected lesson of economy but how small is the number compared with the whole mass of the population and with what bitter agony with what biting humiliation is the hard lesson often learned how easily might it have been engrafted on early habits and naturally and gracefully grown with their growth and strengthened with their strength yet it was but lately that i visited a family not of moderate fortune but of no fortune at all one of those people who live nobody knows how and i found a young girl about sixteen practising on the piano while an elderly lady beside her was darning her stockings i was told for the mother was proud of bringing up her child so genteelly that the daughter had almost forgotten how to sew and that a woman was hired into the house to do her mending but why said i have you suffered your daughter to be ignorant of so useful an employment if she is poor the knowledge will be necessary to her if she is rich it is the easiest thing in the world to lay it aside if she chooses she will merely be a better judge whether her work is well done by others that is true replied the mother and i always meant she should learn but she never has seemed to have any time when she was eight years old she could put a shirt together pretty well but since that her music and her dancing and her school have taken up her whole time i did mean she should learn some domestic habits this winter but she has so many visiters and is obliged to go out so much that i suppose i must give it up i dont like to say too much about it for poor girl she does so love company and she does so hate anything like care and confinement now is her time to enjoy herself you know let her take all the comfort she can while she is single but said i you wish her to marry some time or other and in all probability she will marry when will she learn how to perform the duties which are necessary and important to every mistress of a family oh she will learn them when she is obliged to answered the injudicious mother at all events i am determined she shall enjoy herself while she is young and this is the way i have often heard mothers talk yet could parents foresee the almost inevitable consequences of such a system i believe the weakest and vainest would abandon the false and dangerous theory what a lesson is taught a girl in that sentence let her enjoy herself all she can while she is single instead of representing domestic life as the gathering place of the deepest and purest affections as the sphere of womans enjoyments as well as of her duties as indeed the whole world to her that one pernicious sentence teaches a girl to consider matrimony desirable because a good match is a triumph of vanity and it is deemed respectable to be well settled in the world but that it is a necessary sacrifice of her freedom and her gayety and then how many affectionate dispositions have been trained into heartlessness by being taught that the indulgence of indolence and vanity were necessary to their happiness and that to have this indulgence they must marry money but who that marries for money in this land of precarious fortunes can tell how soon they will lose the glittering temptation to which they have been willing to sacrifice so much and even if riches last as long as life the evil is not remedied education has given a wrong end and aim to their whole existence they have been taught to look for happiness where it never can be found viz in the absence of all occupation or the unsatisfactory and ruinous excitement of fashionable competition the difficulty is education does not usually point the female heart to its only true restingplace that dear english word home is not half so powerful a talisman as the world instead of the salutary truth that happiness is in duty they are taught to consider the two things totally distinct and that whoever seeks one must sacrifice the other the fact is our girls have no home education when quite young they are sent to schools where no feminine employments no domestic habits can be learned and there they continue till they come out into the world after this few find any time to arrange and make use of the mass of elementary knowledge they have acquired and fewer still have either leisure or taste for the inelegant everyday duties of life thus prepared they enter upon matrimony those early habits which would have made domestic care a light and easy task have never been taught for fear it would interrupt their happiness and the result is that when cares come as come they must they find them misery i am convinced that indifference and dislike between husband and wife are more frequently occasioned by this great error in education than by any other cause the bride is awakened from her delightful dream in which carpets vases sofas white gloves and pearl earrings are oddly jumbled up with her lovers looks and promises perhaps she would be surprised if she knew exactly how much of the fascination of being engaged was owing to the aforesaid inanimate concern be that as it will she is awakened by the unpleasant conviction that cares devolve upon her and what effect does this produce upon her character do the holy and tender influences of domestic love render selfdenial and exertion a bliss no they would have done so had she been properly educated but now she gives way to unavailing fretfulness and repining and her husband is at first pained and finally disgusted by hearing i never knew what care was when i lived in my fathers house if i were to live my life over again i would remain single as long as i could without the risk of being an old maid how injudicious how shortsighted is the policy which thus mars the whole happiness of life in order to make a few brief years more gay and brilliant i have known many instances of domestic ruin and discord produced by this mistaken indulgence of mothers i never knew but one where the victim had moral courage enough to change all her early habits she was a young pretty and very amiable girl but brought up to be perfectly useless a rag baby would to all intents and purposes have been as efficient a partner she married a young lawyer without property but with good and increasing practice she meant to be a good wife but she did not know how her wastefulness involved him in debt he did not reproach though he tried to convince and instruct her she loved him and weeping replied i try to do the best i can but when i lived at home mother always took care of everything finally poverty came upon him like an armed man and he went into a remote town in the western states to teach a school his wife folded her hands and cried while he weary and discouraged actually came home from school to cook his own supper at last his patience and her real love for him impelled her to exertion she promised to learn to be useful if he would teach her and she did learn and the change in her habits gradually wrought such a change in her husbands fortune that she might bring her daughters up in idleness had not experience taught her that economy like grammar is a very hard and tiresome study after we are twenty years old perhaps some will think the evils of which i have been speaking are confined principally to the rich but i am convinced they extend to all classes of people all manual employment is considered degrading and those who are compelled to do it try to conceal it a few years since very respectable young men at our colleges cut their own wood and blacked their own shoes now how few even of the sons of plain farmers and industrious mechanics have moral courage enough to do without a servant yet when they leave college and come out into the battle of life they must do without servants and in these times it will be fortunate if one half of them get what is called a decent living even by rigid economy and patient toil yet i would not that servile and laborious employment should be forced upon the young i would merely have each one educated according to his probable situation in life and be taught that whatever is his duty is honorable and that no merely external circumstance can in reality injure true dignity of character i would not cramp a boys energies by compelling him always to cut wood or draw water but i would teach him not to be ashamed should his companions happen to find him doing either one or the other a few days since i asked a grocers lad to bring home some articles i had just purchased at his masters the bundle was large he was visibly reluctant to take it and wished very much that i should send for it this however was impossible and he subdued his pride but when i asked him to take back an empty bottle which belonged to the store he with a mortified look begged me to do it up neatly in a paper that it might look like a small package is this boy likely to be happier for cherishing a foolish pride which will forever be jarring against his duties is he in reality one whit more respectable than the industrious lad who sweeps stores or carries bottles without troubling himself with the idea that all the world is observing his little unimportant self for in relation to the rest of the world each individual is unimportant and he alone is wise who forms his habits according to his own wants his own prospects and his own principles travelling and public amusements there is one kind of extravagance rapidly increasing in this country which in its effects on our purses and our habits is one of the worst kinds of extravagance i mean the rage for travelling and for public amusements the good old home habits of our ancestors are breaking upit will be well if our virtue and our freedom do not follow them it is easy to laugh at such prognosticsand we are well aware that the virtue we preach is considered almost obsoletebut let any reflecting mind inquire how decay has begun in all republics and then let them calmly ask themselves whether we are in no danger in departing thus rapidly from the simplicity and industry of our forefathers nations do not plunge at once into ruingovernments do not change suddenlythe causes which bring about the final blow are scarcely perceptible in the beginning but they increase in numbers and in power they press harder and harder upon the energies and virtue of a people and the last steps only are alarmingly hurried and irregular a republic without industry economy and integrity is samson shorn of his locks a luxurious and idle republic look at the phrasethe words were never made to be married together every body sees it would be death to one of them and are not we becoming luxurious and idle look at our steamboats and stages and taverns there you will find mechanics who have left debts and employment to take care of themselves while they go to take a peep at the great canal or the operadancers there you will find domestics all agog for their wagesworth of travelling why should they look out for a rainy day there are hospitals enough to provide for them in sickness and as for marrying they have no idea of that till they can find a man who will support them genteelly there you will find mothers who have left the children at home with betsey while they go to improve their minds at the mountain house or the springs if only the rich did this all would be well they benefit others and do not injure themselves in any situation idleness is their curse and uneasiness is the tax they must pay for affluence but their restlessness is as great a benefit to the community as the motions of prince esterhazy when at every step the pearls drop from his coat people of moderate fortune have just as good a right to travel as the wealthy but is it not unwise do they not injure themselves and their families you say travelling is cheap so is staying at home besides do you count all the costs the money you pay for stages and steamboats is the smallest of the items there are clothes bought which would not otherwise be bought those clothes are worn out and defaced twenty times as quick as they would have been at home children are perhaps left with domestics or strangers their health and morals to say the least under very uncertain influence your substance is wasted in your absence by those who have no selfinterest to prompt them to carefulness you form an acquaintance with a multitude of people who will be sure to take your house in their way when they travel next year and finally you become so accustomed to excitement that home appears insipid and it requires no small effort to return to the quiet routine of your duties and what do you get in return for all this some pleasant scenes which will soon seem to you like a dream some pleasant faces which you will never see again and much of crowd and toil and dust and bustle i once knew a family which formed a striking illustration of my remarks the man was a farmer and his wife was an active capable woman with more of ambition than sound policy being in debt they resolved to take fashionable boarders from boston during the summer season these boarders at the time of their arrival were projecting a jaunt to the springs and they talked of lake george crystals and canadian music and english officers and dark blue ontario with its beautiful little brood of lakelets as wordsworth would call them and how one lady was dressed superbly at saratoga and how another was scandalized for always happening to drop her fan in the vicinity of the wealthiest beaux all this fired the quiet imagination of the good farmers wife and no sooner had the boarders departed to enjoy themselves in spite of heat and dust and feverandague than she stated her determination to follow them why have we not as good a right to travel as they have said she they have paid us money enough to go to niagara with and it really is a shame for people to live and die so ignorant of their own country but then we want the money to pay for that stock which turned out unlucky you know oh that can be done next summer we can always get boarders enough and those that will pay handsomely give the man a mortgage of the house to keep him quiet till next summer but what will you do with the children sally is a very smart girl i am sure she will take as good care of them as if i were at home to make a long story short the farmer and his wife concluded to go to quebec just to show they had a right to put themselves to inconvenience if they pleased they went spent all their money had a watch stolen from them in the steamboat were dreadfully seasick off point judith came home tired and dusty found the babe sick because sally had stood at the door with it one chilly damp morning while she was feeding the chickens and the eldest girl screaming and screeching at the thoughts of going to bed because sally in order to bring her under her authority had told her a frightful rawheadandbloodybones story the horse had broken into the garden and made wretched work with the vegetables and fifty pounds of butter had become fit for the greasepot because the hoops of the firkin had sprung and sally had so much to do that she never thought of going to see whether the butter was covered with brine after six or eight weeks the children were pretty well restored to orderly habits and the wife being really a notable and prudent woman resolved to make up for her lost butter and vegetables by doing without help through the winter when summer came they should have boarders she said and sure enough they had boarders in plenty but not profitable ones there were forty cousins at whose houses they had stopped and twenty people who had been very polite to them on the way and it being such a pleasant season and travelling so cheap everyone of these people felt they had a right to take a journey and they could not help passing a day or two with their friends at the farm one after another came till the farmer could bear it no longer i tell you what wife said he i am going to jail as fast as a man can go if there is no other way of putting a stop to this ill sell every bed in the house except the one we sleep on and sure enough he actually did this and when the fortyfirst cousin came down on a friendly visit on account of what her other cousins had told her about the cheapness of travelling she was told they should be very happy to sleep on the floor for the sake of accommodating her for a night or two but the truth was they had but one bed in the house this honest couple are now busy in paying off their debts and laying by something for their old age he facetiously tells how he went to new york to have his watch stolen and his boots blacked like a looking glass and she shows her lake george diamond ring and tells how the steamboat was crowded and how afraid she was the boiler would burst and always ends by saying after all it was a toil of pleasure however it is not our farmers who are in the greatest danger of this species of extravagance for we look to that class of people as the strongest hold of republican simplicity industry and virtue it is from adventurers swindlers broken down tradersall that rapidly increasing class of idlers too genteel to work and too proud to begthat we have most reason to dread examples of extravagance a very respectable tavernkeeper has lately been driven to establish a rule that no customer shall be allowed to rise from the table till he pays for his meal i know it is rude to give such orders to honest men said he and three years ago i would as soon cut off my hand as have done it but now travelling is so cheap that all sorts of characters are on the move and i find more than half of them will get away if they can without paying a cent with regard to public amusements it is still worse ropedancers and operadancers and all sorts of dancers go through the country making thousands as they go while from high to low there is one universal despairing groan of hard times dreadful gloomy times these things ought not to be people who have little to spend should partake sparingly of useless amusements those who are in debt should deny themselves entirely let me not be supposed to inculcate exclusive doctrines i would have every species of enjoyment as open to the poor as to the rich but i would have people consider well how they are likely to obtain the greatest portion of happiness taking the whole of their lives into view i would not have them sacrifice permanent respectability and comfort to present gentility and love of excitement above all i caution them to beware that this love of excitement does not grow into a habit till the fireside becomes a dull place and the gambling table and the barroom finish what the theatre began if men would have women economical they must be so themselves what motive is there for patient industry and careful economy when the savings of a month are spent at one trip to nahant and more than the value of a much desired but rejected dress is expended during the stay of a new set of comedians we make a great deal of talk about being republicans if we are so in reality we shall stay at home to mind our business and educate our children so long as one or the other need our attention or can suffer by our neglect philosophy and consistency among all the fine things mrs barbauld wrote she never wrote anything better than her essay on the inconsistency of human expectations everything says she is marked at a settled price our time our labor our ingenuity is so much ready money which we are to lay out to the best advantage examine compare choose reject but stand to your own judgment and do not like children when you have purchased one thing repine that you do not possess another which you would not purchase would you be rich do you think that the single point worth sacrificing everything else to you may then be rich thousands have become so from the lowest beginnings by toil and diligence and attention to the minutest articles of expense and profit but you must give up the pleasures of leisure of an unembarrassed mind and of a free unsuspicious temper you must learn to do hard if not unjust things and as for the embarrassment of a delicate and ingenuous spirit it is necessary for you to get rid of it as fast as possible you must not stop to enlarge your mind polish your taste or refine your sentiments but must keep on in one beaten track without turning aside to the right hand or the left but you say i cannot submit to drudgery like this i feel a spirit above it tis well be above it then only do not repine because you are not rich is knowledge the pearl of price in your estimation that too may be purchased by steady application and long solitary hours of study and reflection but says the man of letters what a hardship is it that many an illiterate fellow who cannot construe the motto on his coach shall raise a fortune and make a figure while i possess merely the common conveniences of life was it for fortune then that you grew pale over the midnight lamp and gave the sprightly years of youth to study and reflection you then have mistaken your path and ill employed your industry what reward have i then for all my labor what reward a large comprehensive soul purged from vulgar fears and prejudices able to interpret the works of man and god a perpetual spring of fresh ideas and the conscious dignity of superior intelligence good heaven what other reward can you ask but is it not a reproach upon the economy of providence that such a one who is a mean dirty fellow should have amassed wealth enough to buy half a nation not in the least he made himself a mean dirty fellow for that very end he has paid his health his conscience and his liberty for it do you envy him his bargain will you hang your head in his presence because he outshines you in equipage and show lift up your brow with a noble confidence and say to yourself i have not these things it is true but it is because i have not desired or sought them it is because i possess something better i have chosen my lot i am content and satisfied the most characteristic mark of a great mind is to choose some one object which it considers important and pursue that object through life if we expect the purchase we must pay the price there is a pretty passage in one of lucians dialogues where jupiter complains to cupid that though he has had so many intrigues he was never sincerely beloved in order to be loved says cupid you must lay aside your aegis and your thunderbolts you must curl and perfume your hair and place a garland on your head and walk with a soft step and assume a winning obsequious deportment but replied jupiter i am not willing to resign so much of my dignity then returned cupid leave off desiring to be loved these remarks by mrs barbauld are full of sound philosophy who has not observed in his circle of acquaintance and in the recesses of his own heart the same inconsistency of expectation the same peevishness of discontent says germanicus there is my dunce of a classmate has found his way into congress and is living amid the perpetual excitement of intellectual minds while i am cooped up in an ignorant country parish obliged to be at the beck and call of every old woman who happens to feel uneasy in her mind well germanicus the road to political distinction was as open to you as to him why did you not choose it oh i could not consent to be the tool of a party to shake hands with the vicious and flatter fools it would gall me to the quick to hear my opponents accuse me of actions i never committed and of motives which worlds would not tempt me to indulge since germanicus is wise enough to know the whistle costs more than it is worth is he not unreasonable to murmur because he has not bought it matrona always wears a discontented look when she hears the praises of clio i used to write her composition for her when we were at school together says she and now she is quite the idol of the literary world while i am never heard of beyond my own family unless some one happens to introduce me as the friend of clio why not write then and see if the world will not learn to introduce clio as the friend of matrona i write not for the world i could not endure to pour my soul out to an undiscerning multitude i could not see my cherished thoughts caricatured by some soulless reviewer and my favorite fancies expounded by the matteroffact editor of some stupid paper why does matrona envy what she knows costs so much and is of so little value yet so it is through all classes of society all of us covet some neighbors possession and think our lot would have been happier had it been different from what it is yet most of us could obtain worldly distinctions if our habits and inclinations allowed us to pay the immense price at which they must be purchased true wisdom lies in finding out all the advantages of a situation in which we are placed instead of imagining the enjoyments of one in which we are not placed such philosophy is rarely found the most perfect sample i ever met was an old woman who was apparently the poorest and most forlorn of the human speciesso true is the maxim which all profess to believe and which none act upon invariably viz that happiness does not depend on outward circumstances the wise woman to whom i have alluded walks to boston from a distance of twentyfive or thirty miles to sell a bag of brown thread and stockings and then patiently foots it back again with her little gains her dress though tidy is a grotesque collection of shreds and patches coarse in the extreme why dont you come down in a wagon said i when i observed that she was soon to become a mother and was evidently wearied with her long journey we hant got any horse replied she the neighbors are very kind to me but they cant spare theirn and it would cost as much to hire one as all my thread will come to you have a husbanddont he do anything for you he is a good man he does all he can but hes a cripple and an invalid he reels my yarn and specks the childrens shoes hes as kind a husband as a woman need to have but his being a cripple is a heavy misfortune to you said i why maam i dont look upon it in that light replied the threadwoman i consider that ive great reason to be thankful he never took to any bad habits how many children have you six sons and five darters maam six sons and five daughters what a family for a poor woman to support its a family surely maam but there ant one of em id be willing to lose they are as good children as need to beall willing to work and all clever to me even the littlest boy when he gets a cent now and then for doing a chore will be sure and bring it to maam do your daughters spin your thread no maam as soon as they are old enough they go out to sarvice i dont want to keep them always delving for me they are always willing to give me what they can but it is right and fair they should do a little for themselves i do all my spinning after the folks are abed dont you think you should be better off if you had no one but yourself to provide for why no maam i dont if i hadnt been married i should always have had to work as hard as i could and now i cant do more than that my children are a great comfort to me and i look forward to the time when theyll do as much for me as i have done for them here was true philosophy i learned a lesson from that poor woman which i shall not soon forget if i wanted true hearty well principled service i would employ children brought up by such a mother reasons for hard times perhaps there never was a time when the depressing effects of stagnation in business were so universally felt all the world over as they are nowthe merchant sends out old dollars and is lucky if he gets the same number of new ones in return and he who has a share in manufactures has bought a bottle imp which he will do well to hawk about the street for the lowest possible coin the effects of this depression must of course be felt by all grades of society yet who that passes through cornhill at one oclock and sees the bright array of wives and daughters as various in their decorations as the insects the birds and the shells would believe that the community was staggering under a weight which almost paralyzes its movements everything is so cheap say the ladies that it is inexcusable not to dress well but do they reflect why things are so cheap do they know how much wealth has been sacrificed how many families ruined to produce this boasted result do they not know enough of the machinery of society to suppose that the stunning effect of crash after crash may eventually be felt by those on whom they depend for support luxuries are cheaper now than necessaries were a few years since yet it is a lamentable fact that it costs more to live now than it did formerly when silk was nine shillings per yard seven or eight yards sufficed for a dress now it is four or five shillings sixteen or twenty yards will hardly satisfy the mantuamaker if this extravagance were confined to the wealthiest classes it would be productive of more good than evil but if the rich have a new dress every fortnight people of moderate fortune will have one every month in this way finery becomes the standard of respectability and a mans cloth is of more consequence than his character men of fixed salaries spend every cent of their income and then leave their children to depend on the precarious charity and reluctant friendship of a world they have wasted their substance to please men who rush into enterprise and speculation keep up their credit by splendor and should they sink they and their families carry with them extravagant habits to corrode their spirits with discontent perchance to tempt them into crime i know we are extravagant said one of my acquaintance the other day but how can i help it my husband does not like to see his wife and daughters dress more meanly than those with whom they associate then my dear lady your husband has not as much moral dignity and moral courage as i thought he had he should be content to see his wife and daughters respected for neatness good taste and attractive manners this all sounds very well in talk replied the lady but say what you will about pleasing and intelligent girls nobody will attend to them unless they dress in the fashion if my daughters were to dress in the plain neat style you recommend they would see all their acquaintance asked to dance more frequently than themselves and not a gentleman would join them in cornhill i do not believe this in so extensive a sense as you do girls may appear genteelly without being extravagant and though some fops may know the most approved color for a ribbon or the newest arrangement for trimming i believe gentlemen of real character merely notice whether a ladys dress is generally in good taste or not but granting your statement to be true in its widest sense of what consequence is it how much will the whole happiness of your daughters life be affected by her dancing some fifty times less than her companions or wasting some few hours less in the empty conversation of coxcombs a man often admires a style of dress which he would not venture to support in a wife extravagance has prevented many marriages and rendered still more unhappy and should your daughters fail in forming good connexions what have you to leave them save extravagant habits too deeply rooted to be eradicated think you those who now laugh at them for a soiled glove or an unfashionable ribbon will assist their poverty or cheer their neglected old age no they would find them as cold and selfish as they are vain a few thousands in the bank are worth all the fashionable friends in christendom whether my friend was convinced or not i cannot say but i saw her daughters in cornhill the next week with new french hats and blonde veils it is really melancholy to see how this fever of extravagance rages and how it is sapping the strength of our happy country it has no bounds it pervades all ranks and characterizes all ages i know the wife of a pavier who spends her three hundred a year in outward adorning and who will not condescend to speak to her husband while engaged in his honest calling mechanics who should have too high a sense of their own respectability to resort to such pitiful competition will indulge their daughters in dressing like the wealthiest and a domestic would certainly leave you should you dare advise her to lay up one cent of her wages these things ought not to be every man and every woman should lay up some portion of their income whether that income be great or small how to endure poverty that a thorough religious useful education is the best security against misfortune disgrace and poverty is universally believed and acknowledged and to this we add the firm conviction that when poverty comes as it sometimes will upon the prudent the industrious and the wellinformed a judicious education is allpowerful in enabling them to endure the evils it cannot always prevent a mind full of piety and knowledge is always rich it is a bank that never fails it yields a perpetual dividend of happiness in a late visit to the almshouse at we saw a remarkable evidence of the truth of this doctrine mrs was early left an orphan she was educated by an uncle and aunt both of whom had attained the middle age of life theirs was an industrious wellordered and cheerful family her uncle was a man of sound judgment liberal feelings and great knowledge of human nature this he showed by the education of the young people under his care he allowed them to waste no time every moment must be spent in learning something or in doing something he encouraged an entertaining lively style of conversation but discountenanced all remarks about persons families dress and engagements he used to say parents were not aware how such topics frittered away the minds of young people and what inordinate importance they learned to attach to them when they heard them constantly talked about in his family sunday was a happy day for it was made a day of religious instruction without any unnatural constraint upon the gayety of the young the bible was the text book the places mentioned in it were traced on maps the manners and customs of different nations were explained curious phenomena in the natural history of those countries were read in a word everything was done to cherish a spirit of humble yet earnest inquiry in this excellent family mrs remained till her marriage in the course of fifteen years she lost her uncle her aunt and her husband she was left destitute but supported herself comfortably by her own exertions and retained the respect and admiration of a large circle of friends thus she passed her life in cheerfulness and honor during ten years at the end of that time her humble residence took fire from an adjoining house in the night time and she escaped by jumping from the chamber window in consequence of the injury received by this fall her right arm was amputated and her right leg became entirely useless her friends were very kind and attentive and for a short time she consented to live on their bounty but aware that the claims on private charity are very numerous she with the genuine independence of a strong mind resolved to avail herself of the public provision for the helpless poor the name of going to the almshouse had nothing terrifying or disgraceful to her for she had been taught that conduct is the real standard of respectability she is there with a heart full of thankfulness to the giver of all things she is patient pious and uniformly cheerful she instructs the young encourages the old and makes herself delightful to all by her various knowledge and entertaining conversation her character reflects dignity on her situation and those who visit the establishment come away with sentiments of respect and admiration for this voluntary resident of the almshouse what a contrast is afforded by the character of the woman who occupies the room next hers she is so indolent and filthy that she can with difficulty be made to attend to her own personal comfort and even the most patient are worn out with her perpetual fretfulness her mind is continually infested with envy hatred and discontent she thinks providence has dealt hardly with her that all the world are proud and ungrateful and that every one despises her because she is in the almshouse this pitiable state of mind is the natural result of her education her father was a respectable mechanic and might have been a wealthy one had he not been fascinated by the beauty of a thoughtless idle showy girl whom he made his wife the usual consequences followedhe could not earn money so fast as she could spend it the house became a scene of discord the daughter dressed in the fashion learned to play on the piano was taught to think that being engaged in any useful employment was very ungenteel and that to be engaged to be married was the chief end and aim of woman the father died a bankrupt the weak and frivolous mother lingered along in beggary for a while and then died of vexation and shame the friends of the family were very kind to the daughter but her extreme indolence her vanity pertness and ingratitude finally exhausted the kindness of the most generous and forbearing and as nothing could induce her to personal exertion she was at length obliged to take shelter in the almshouse here her misery is incurable she has so long been accustomed to think dress and parade the necessary elements of happiness that she despises all that is done for her comfort her face has settled into an expression which looks like an imbodied growl every body is tired of listening to her complaints and even the little children run away when they see her coming may not those who have children to educate learn a good lesson from these women those who have wealth have recently had many and bitter lessons to prove how suddenly riches may take to themselves wings and those who certainly have but little to leave should indeed beware how they bestow upon their children the accursed inheritance of indolent and extravagant habits appendix to the american frugal housewife those sentences marked with a star relate to

poultry see page 53 carving written for the american frugal housewife to carve a turkeyfix the fork firmly on one side of the thin bone that rises in the centre of the breast the fork should be placed parallel with the bone and as close to it as possible cut the meat from the breast lengthwise in slices of about half an inch in thickness then turn the turkey upon the side nearest you and cut off the leg and the wing when the knife is passed between the limbs and the body and pressed outward the joint will be easily perceived then turn the turkey on the other side and cut off the other leg and wing separate the drumsticks from the legbones and the pinions from the wings it is hardly possible to mistake the joint cut the stuffing in thin slices lengthwise take off the neckbones which are two triangular bones on each side of the breast this is done by passing the knife from the back under the bladepart of each neckbone until it reaches the end by raising the knife the other branch will easily crack off separate the carcass from the back by passing the knife lengthwise from the neck downward turn the back upwards and lay the edge of the knife across the backbone about midway between the legs and wings at the same moment place the fork within the lower part of the turkey and lift it up this will make the backbone crack at the knife the croup or lower part of the back being cut off put it on the plate with the rump from you and split off the sidebones by forcing the knife through from the rump to the other end the choicest parts of a turkey are the sidebones the breast and the thighbones the breast and wings are called light meat the thighbones and sidebones dark meat when a person declines expressing a preference it is polite to help to both kinds a sirloin of beefplace the curving bone downward upon the dish cut the outside lengthwise separating each slice from the chinebone with the point of the knife some people cut through at the chine slip the knife under and

easy take off the merrythought the neckbones and separate the legbones from the legs and the pinions from the wings the best parts are the breast the thighbones and the fleshy parts of the wings a pigif the pig be whole cut off the head and split it in halves along the backbone separate the shoulders and legs by passing the knife under them in a circular direction the best parts are the triangular piece of the neck the ribs legs and shoulders a fillet of vealthis is the thick part of the leg and is to be cut smooth round and close to the bone some prefer the outside piece a little fat cut from the skirt is to be served to each plate muttona saddle of mutton is the two loins together and the backbone running down the middle to the tail slices are to be cut out parallel to the
