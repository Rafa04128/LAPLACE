enlarging by artificial light chapter vi dodging vignetting composite printing and the use of bolting silk chapter vii the reduction and toning of bromide prints and enlargements chapter i varieties of bromide papers and how to choose among them what is bromide paper it is simply paper coated with gelatinobromide of silver emulsion similar to that which when coated on glass or other transparent support forms the familiar dryplate or film used in negativemaking the emulsion used in making bromide paper however is less rapid less sensitive than that used in the manufacture of plates or films of ordinary rapidity hence bromide paper may be manipulated with more abundant light than would be safe with plates it is used for making prints by contact with a negative in the ordinary printing frame and as the simplest means for obtaining enlarged prints from small negatives sometimes bromide paper is spoken of as a development paper because the pictureimage does not print out during exposure but requires to be developed as in negativemaking the preparation of the paper is beyond the skill and equipment of the average photographer but it may be readily obtained from dealers in photographic supplies what are the practical advantages of bromide paper in the first place it renders the photographer independent of daylight and weather as far as making prints is concerned it has excellent keeping qualities ie it does not spoil or deteriorate as readily as other printing papers even when stored without special care or precaution its manipulation is extremely simple and closely resembles the development of a negative it does not require a special sort of negative but is adapted to give good prints from negatives widely different in quality it is obtainable in any desired size and with a great variety of surfaces from extreme gloss to that of rough drawing paper it offers great latitude in exposure and development and yields even in the hands of the novice a greater percentage of good prints than any other printing paper in the market it offers a range of tone from deepest black to the most delicate of platinotype grays which may be modified to give a fair variety of color effects where this is desirable it affords a simple means of making enlargements without the necessity of an enlarged negative it gives us a ready means of producing many prints in a very short time or if desired we may make a proof or enlargement from the negative fresh from the washing tray and finally if we do our work faithfully and well it will give us permanent prints the bromide papers available in this country at present are confined to those of the eastman kodak company the defender photo supply company and j l lewis the last handling english papers only better papers could not be desired broadly speaking all bromide papers are made in a few welldefined varieties in considering the manipulation of the papers made by a single firm therefore we practically cover all the papers in the market as a matter of convenience then we will glance over the different varieties of bromide paper available as represented by the eastman papers with the understanding that what is said of any one variety is generally applicable to papers of the same sort put out by other manufacturers first we have the standard or ordinary bromide paper made for general use this comes in five different weights a a thin paper with smooth surface useful where detail is desirable b a heavier paper with smooth surface for large prints or for illustration purposes and c a still heavier paper with a rough surface for broad effects and prints of large size bb heavy smooth double weight cc heavy rough double weight each of these varieties may be had in two grades according to the negative in hand or the effect desired in the print viz hard for use with soft negatives where we desire to get vigor or contrast in the print and soft for use with hard negatives where softness of effect is desired in the print for general use the soft grade is preferable although it is advisable to have a supply of the hard paper at hand as useful in certain classes of work the tones obtainable on the standard paper range to pure black and are acceptable for ordinary purposes for pictorial work or special effects other papers are preferable platinobromide paper gives delicate platinotype tones and where negative paper and manipulation are in harmony the prints obtained on this paper will be indistinguishable from good platinotypes in quality and attractiveness this paper comes in two weights platino a a thin paper suitable for small prints and having a smooth surface useful for detailgiving and platino b a heavy paper with rough surface peculiarly suited for large contact prints or enlargements both varieties are obtainable in hard or soft grades characterized as above matte enamel medium weight enameled medium weight velvet medium weight royal bromide is a capital paper in its proper place ie for prints not smaller than 8 10 inches and then only when breadth of effect is desired in the picture it is a very heavy creamcolored paper rough in texture and giving black tones by development but designed to give sepia or brown tones on a tinted ground by subsequent toning with a bath of hypo and alum this paper also may be had in two grades for hard or soft effects it is further adapted for being printed on through silk or bolting cloth this modification adding to the effect of breadth ordinarily given by the paper itself i have seen prints on this paper which were altogether pleasing but subject and negative should be carefully considered in its use rough buff papers are very similar in character monox bromide made by the defender photo supply company is obtainable in six surfaces no 3 monox rough no 4 monox gloss no 5 monox matte no 6 monox lustre no 7 monox buff heavy rough the barnet bromide papers comprising ten different varieties differing in weight and surface texture but very similar to the kinds already described are imported by j l lewis new york as a suggestion to the reader desiring to have at hand a stock of bromide papers i would advise platino a or a similar soft paper for prints under 5 7 inches matteenamel for soft effects or a similar paper as an alternative platino c and royal bromide for soft effects or similar papers for prints 8 10 inches or larger and for enlargements to these might be added a package of standard b and another of one of the above varieties for hard effects to complete a supply for general purposes the beginner however will do well to avoid the indiscriminate use of several varieties of paper although he is advised to get information of all the different varieties in the market it is better to select that variety which is best suited to the general character of ones negatives and work and to master that before changing to another it is true that an expert can get more good prints on bromide paper from a given number of bad negatives than another expert can get with the same negatives and any other printing paper but it is also true that for the best results on bromide paper the variety of paper used should be suitable for the negative it will be found however that this word suitable covers in bromide printing a much wider range than is offered by many printing papers in fact there are only two sorts of negatives which will not yield desirable prints on bromide paper first an exceedingly weak thin negative lacking in contrast and altogether flat and second a very dense negative in which the contrasts are hopelessly emphatic even in such cases however it may be possible to modify the negatives and so get presentable prints the ideal negative for contact printing on bromide paper is one without excessive contrasts on the one hand and without excessive flatness on the other a moderately strong negative such as will require from three to five minutes in the sunlight with a print out paper fairly describes it in other words the negative should be fully exposed and so developed that there is a fair amount of density in the shadows i have never been able with bromide paper to get the detail in the shadows of underexposed negatives such as we see in a good print made on glossy printout paper for this reason the use of bromide papers with underexposed negatives is not advisable but there are a great many negatives which while unsuitable as they come from the drying rack can be easily adapted to the process by slight modifications a very dense negative for instance may be reduced either with the ferricyanide of potash or persulphate of ammonia reducer and a thin negative with proper graduations can frequently be intensified to advantage in the print while as has been said there is great latitude in the matter of the negative this latitude should only be availed of when necessary local reduction or intensification of the negative is seldom necessary as better results can usually be obtained with bromide paper by dodging in the printing chapter ii the question of light and illumination thus far we have gained a general understanding of the different papers and the characteristics desirable in negatives before we take up the actual manipulation of bromide paper there are a few elementary principles bearing on the important detail of illumination which we must master these may necessitate a little thinking but a practical grasp of them will make our afterwork much easier and ensure that fairly good prints from poor negatives will be the rule instead of the exception in the first place we have often read that a strong light overcomes contrasts while a weak light increases them yet how many of us realize when we come to make prints by any process exactly what this means in other words how many of us apply the rule in everyday practice it is very easy to see what is meant by the rule if we will take an ordinary negative such as a landscape with clear sky and hold it first six inches from a gasflame and then six feet it will be found in the first case that the sky portion is translucent while the clear glass will of course be clear in the second the sky will be opaque and the clear glass still clear the contrasts have been rendered greater by removing the negative further from the lightsource as this is true in the extreme case given so it is true in a smaller degree where the distances are only slightly varied as well as where we deal with the graded portions of the negative instead of with only clear glass and the densest portions it is this fact that we utilize in bromide printing and it is because we have such unlimited control over the strength of our light that it is possible with it to get equally good prints from a wide range of negatives it is very much simpler and more practicable to regulate the strength of the light by increasing or diminishing its distance than by interposing sheets of paper ground glass or opal as is occasionally done with other processes the necessity however for occasionally changing the strength of our light in this manner may seem to introduce an element of uncertainty into the problem of exposure but there is another rule which brings it back again to simplicity itself and enables us to quickly calculate equivalent exposures at varying distances from the lightsource this rule is the intensity of illumination varies inversely as the square of the distance from the source of light for instance if a given negative requires five seconds exposure at one foot from the light it will have an equivalent exposure if exposed for twenty seconds at two feet the square of one being one and of two being four it remains then only to apply these two rules to our actual work with bromide paper the shadows in a certain negative will receive full exposure say in eight seconds at one foot from the light but the high lights of the negative are so dense that no light will penetrate them at that distance from the light in that length of time hence a stronger light must be used or the action of the same light continued for a longer time but the latter will not do since the effect would be to overexpose the shadows hence knowing that a strong light overcomes contrasts we move the negative to the distance of six inches where the rule tells us the equivalent exposure will be onefourth that at twelve inches in this case two seconds here the shadows get no more light but it is possible that the high lights of the negative will be penetrated by reason of the additional force of the light on the other hand we have a thin flat negative requiring for the shadows two seconds exposure at one foot from the light knowing that a weak light increases contrasts we move the negative three feet from the light and instead of two give eighteen seconds exposure the rule telling us that this is equivalent thus we are enabled to regulate the strength of our light to suit the character of our negative but a standard distance of one foot will not suit with all kinds of lights or with all sizes of negatives if for instance our light is a welsbach burner giving an intense and comparatively white light we will find that a normal negative will print too flat if exposed at one foot in such a case two or even three feet would be a better standard experience with our light will however furnish the best standard always taking a standard negative for the tests illustration fig 1 the size of the negative also has its influence on the unit of exposure for instance we may have a halfinch oilburner in which case we would probably have to expose a standard negative at four inches in order to get the proper contrasts but this is out of the question with a negative of 5 7 or over as a reference to the diagram fig 1 will clearly show here we find that while the centre of a negative is four inches from the light the extreme edges will be over five inches from it the rule as to intensities telling us that the light at the edges will be only 1625 of that at the centre this would result in a marked falling off of light at the corners and would necessitate a constant motion of the printing frame throughout exposure which is not wholly satisfactory the remedy would be to use a stronger light at a greater distance but another reference to fig 1 will show that if a 5 7 negative be held at seven inches from the light the difference will be only as 49 is to 56 which can in practice be disregarded though it would be better to have it even less hence we see that it is never safe to have our unit less than the baseline of our plate and it is better to have it even greater as we will frequently be obliged to halve the distance to overcome contrasts it follows from this that the larger our negatives the stronger must be our light now all of these considerations may make very dry reading but the reader who has followed them closely will see how vital they are to successful work it should not be thought however that every exposure on bromide paper must involve an arithmetical calculation on the contrary once the proper distance from the light for the normal negative has been ascertained it will be found that nine negatives out of ten will require no change in the distance from the source of light this of course presuming that we classify our negatives and enlarge from those of the same quality at the same time one great objection to the use of bromide paper is that it must be handled in a darkroom but this objection is not as serious as it may seem an ordinary living room at night furnishes a delightful place in which to make prints if we handle our solutions with reasonable care the ruby glass can be removed from the darkroom lamp and the orange glass used alone but in this case as indeed with the ruby light care must be taken to guard against too much light development should be conducted at a distance of several feet from the light and when almost completed the tray can be brought close under the light to enable the worker to stop it at exactly the right moment ordinary bromide paper is about as sensitive as the process or slow dry plate or the average lanternslide plate and requires as much care as either but not nearly so much as the most rapid dry plates if fogging is noticed of course additional precautions should be taken at once chapter iii contact printing on bromide paper nothing more than will be found in an ordinary darkroom will be found necessary in bromide printing by contact unless it be some arrangement for determining readily the distance of the negative from the source of light for this purpose and with an oillamp use a board a foot wide and about three feet long placed on the developing bench against the base of the darkroom lamp it should be marked with black lines six inches apart see fig 2 illustration fig 2 greater uniformity in lighting will be gained if a piece of white cardboard be placed immediately behind the flame some lamps have reflectors in which case the card is unnecessary provided that they reflect the light uniformly otherwise such reflectors are worse than useless having arranged the needful apparatus to our satisfaction the last preparatory step before manipulation is the making up of a developer almost any of the modern developers pyro excepted will give good results with bromide paper in every package of paper will be found the developers advised by the manufacturer of the paper used invariably there is among these a formula for ferrous oxalate developer this is probably the best of all developers for pure black tones but i cannot advise the novice to take it up in the early stages of his work with bromide paper when this developer is used an acid clearing bath is necessary and this invites complications which may be disastrous to the prints when experience has been gained and a large number of prints are to be made at one time it will be found advantageous as working longer with greater efficiency and more uniformity than some of the other developers it is troublesome to prepare and does not keep well apart from which there is the disadvantage that it does not permit of control in development in as large a measure as other developers a reliable metol and hydroquinone formula is as follows thoroughly dissolve metol 14 ounce hydroquinone 14 ounce in water 80 ounces add sulphite of soda cryst 4 ounces and carbonate of soda cryst 212 ounces bottled in 4ounce vials and well corked this developer retains its working power indefinitely for normal exposures i take 2 ounces of the above and add to it 2 ounces of water this will suffice for the development of three 8 10 sheets of paper or their equivalent in smaller sheets it is not wise to attempt to make it do more as greenish tones will result for the same reason contrary to common opinion i do not advise the addition of potassium bromide to the developer it does not improve the developer and may do harm an excellent developer which must be used freshly mixed and may be made up in a moment is as follows take 112 ounces of a 25 per cent solution of sodium sulphite dry amidol 30 grains 5 to 10 drops of a 10 per cent solution of potassium bromide and dilute with 412 ounces of water a supply of new developer should be added as this is seen to become exhausted other developing formulae could be given but these two will be found to fill all requirements if properly compounded and intelligently used the greatest difficulty in developing bromide paper is to get rich black tones when desired but this can be completely overcome by using entirely fresh developer from time to time and never overworking the developer whatever it may be as compared with the paper developer is cheap and it is poor economy to save on the latter except in rare instances the developer is better without any modifications whatever in case of overexposure either general or partial the developer after having been diluted as stated should be again diluted with its bulk of water this gives blacker tones and more depth and life to the shadows when through inadvertence we underexpose a print it may frequently be saved after partial development in the weak solution by flooding with a strong undiluted developer the temperature of the developer is of the greatest importance in summer the aim should be to keep it approximately at 65 degrees fahr in winter 70 degrees but it should never be allowed to go over the latter this can readily be accomplished by placing the graduate in a receptacle containing icewater in summer or hot water in winter the paper is first opened at a safe distance from the darkroom light and it is well at first to cut up one sheet into several slips to use as teststrips if any difficulty is found in determining which is the sensitive side it will be well to throw a piece of the paper on a plane surface when it will be seen that it has a slight tendency to curl the concave is the sensitive side taking a standard negative we first take one of the testslips and place it upon the negative so that it covers a portion containing both high lights and shadows with an oillamp having a 1inch burner expose the teststrip behind the negative in the printing frame at one foot for ten seconds close the lamp and flood the exposed strip with the developer the image should appear in a few seconds and if properly exposed development will be completed in from one to two minutes usually one rinse for a moment and place the strip in a fixing bath made up by dissolving 3 ounces of hypo in 16 ounces of water after a few moments examine the strip in full light and see whether the contrasts are right if so expose a full sheet of paper this time rinsing the exposed sheet before development to avoid the formation of airbubbles if the contrasts are too great try a strip at six inches from the light and two and a half seconds exposure if still too great use a stronger light or try a longer exposure and use a very dilute developer if still too great the negative is hopeless and should be reduced unless dodging will help it as set out further on it will be noticed that this method calls for a oneminute development this is desirable for several reasons first because it gives a unit and assists us in determining the correct exposure of other negatives and second because it is a comparatively short development and yet gives sufficient time after the image has acquired the proper depth to pour off the developer and flush with water thus stopping development it also leaves sufficient margin in the event of over or underexposure with one minute as the unit overexposure will result in a fully developed image in say thirty seconds this print we could save but if our unit were thirty seconds it would be extremely difficult to save a print which had completed development in fifteen seconds the chances are that the development would go on to a ruinous extent before we could pour off the developer and flood the print or that it would go on even after the water was poured on it moreover in case of underexposure two minutes would not be so very tiresome but four minutes would besides which we would risk straining the print by such prolonged development while i am not prepared to assert it as a rule yet it has been my experience that the time of development varies almost inversely with the length of exposure so that if the teststrip concludes development in half a minute with ten seconds exposure i give the next five seconds exposure in the expectation that it will take a minute to develop this assists greatly in lessening the number of teststrips required to ascertain the correct exposure of a given negative should we wish to see a proof before the negative is dry it is taken from the fixing bath and well rinsed though not necessarily thoroughly washed it is then placed face up in a tray of water on which we place face down a sheet of bromide paper the two are removed together and squeezed lightly into contact to remove air bubbles the back of the negative is then wiped to remove superfluous water and an exposure of several times the normal given preferably the normal exposure at half the standard distance from the light the paper is then removed and developed as usual in this way it is possible to show a print in fifteen or twenty minutes after the exposure of the plate was made the purpose of the rinsing before development is to avoid the possibility of airbells the paper should be rinsed in cold water as warmish water will cause airbells instead of preventing them this rinsing can be dispensed with if thought desirable the rinsing after development is for the purpose of stopping development immediately and also in order that the prints may not go into the fixing bath full of developer as staining would be likely to result in such case with the iron oxalate developer an acid rinsing bath is necessary but it is not necessary with any of the other developers the fixing is important as upon this depends in a large measure the permanence of the prints the bath should be freshly made up 3 ounces of hyposulphite of soda to 16 ounces of water prints are placed in this bath face down and one under instead of on top of another the tray should be occasionally rocked with a fresh bath prints will fix in ten minutes but where many prints are made at one time it will be well to use a second fixing bath the emulsion of an unfixed print will appear a yellowish tinge in the unfixed portions when examined by transmitted light but this is not an easy or certain test it is better to make absolutely certain of thorough fixing by continued immersion occasional rocking and where many prints are made a second bath the fixing bath should not be allowed to get too warm in hot weather blistering staining and frilling will result in such a case and i have known a print which was left in a warm fixing bath for an hour or more to be reduced beyond redemption with freshly made hypo baths at a suitable temperature there is absolutely no danger of the paper frilling or blistering the final washing must be thorough as the hypo is difficult to eliminate from both the emulsion and the paper care must be taken to see that the prints are well separated while washing this ensures uniform washing it frequently happens that a negative may require more or less dodging in printing with bromide paper this is particularly easy we will take the simple case of a negative with dense sky which will not print out in the ordinary way all that we need in this case is a piece of paper cut roughly to the sky line and kept moving during part of the exposure over the part which is to be held back if necessary cut down the light in order to prolong the exposure or expose at a greater distance from the light one or more teststrips will be required for this purpose in order to ascertain the relative times of exposure a modification of this method is when a small portion of the negative only needs extra printinga face or hand for instance here we take a piece of paper a little larger than the negative and cut a small hole in it moving it in front of the light so as to throw the latter only upon the portions needing the extra printing still another modification is where a portion only needs holding back here we use a small piece of paper or cardboard stuck on a knitting needle moving the latter so that it will not intercept the light too long at one place in all these and similar instances which will occur to the reader the dodging should be done during the first part of the exposure the subsequent exposure seems to obliterate traces of such dodging better than when it is done at the end of the exposure just as in cloudprinting better results are achieved by printing the sky first and the foreground afterward it is quite possible to make bromide negatives in the camera they have their advantages in classes of work not requiring the finest definition are much lighter cheaper more easily stored and less liable to breakage or other mishaps they are best made on a thin smooth paper a soft paper being better than the hard they are placed in the plateholder by means of the ordinary cut film holder the exposure required is ascertained by a trial or two but roughly speaking is about onetwentieth that of a rapid plate after development in the usual wayit being carried only a little further than usualand after fixing washing and drying the paper negative can be spotted or retouched after which it is waxed chapter iv enlargingdaylight methods in taking up enlarging a full knowledge of what has been said as to the manipulation of bromide paper will be necessary as the principles governing exposure apply here as in contact printing errors being even more serious owing to the greater waste of material for the illuminant used in enlarging we may employ either daylight or artificial light the former is cheap but variable the first cost of the latter is quite a little sum but the light is uniform a daylight enlarging apparatus can be made for a dollar or two and hence is within the reach of all and if the process be given up the loss is not serious if the cost is of little or no moment very serviceable enlarging cameras can be bought for about twentyfive dollars such a camera is adapted for reducing as well as enlarging and so will be found useful for lantern slide making copying etc as a matter of fact few things are as useful to the amateur as a good enlarging outfit we will first consider enlarging by daylight with homemade apparatus for this purpose a room with at least one window will be needed it should preferably be convenient to the darkroom if the window of this room commands a view unobstructed by buildings trees or the like so much the better i personally prefer a south light with this one can get soft enlargements from the most contrasty negatives while by shielding the negatives from the direct rays of the sun we can work from negatives which are quite flat and lacking in contrasts illustration fig 3 but whatever the room chosen all windows but the one at which we are to work must be blocked up this can be done by heavy dark curtains or by specially constructed frames covered with lighttight material and made to fit closely in the windows if there are any transoms these should likewise be covered white light entering under the doors can be shut out by placing a rug along the bottom of the door care must be taken that the windowframes fit closely as the light from openings at the windows would soon fog a sheet of bromide paper if it fell upon it even for a few moments illustration fig 4 assuming that the room chosen can be made practically lighttight we will need some arrangement to hold the negative the details of a box for this purpose can best be shown by a diagram fig 3 abcd is a strong and neatly made box open at both ends and about two inches larger each way than the largest negative from which enlargements are to be made e represents a section of a board which forms part of a window frame a general view of which is given in fig 4 reverting to fig 3 f is an opening cut in the side of the negative box two inches or a little less from the back of the box ad and wide enough to admit the free passage of a negative in a kit or other holder on the inside of the box are tacked strips gggg to serve as a guide to the kit when placing it in the box an opening similar to f should be made in the other side of the box to permit lateral adjustments when we come to use the apparatus besides enabling us to put the negative in or withdraw it from either side a convenient modification of the strips g is found by placing the front ones a short distance further forward to wit toward bc as they are shown in the cut fig 3 and tacking to them a piece of watch spring h this then serving both as a guide and as a means of pressing the kit or negative holder against the other strips gg fig 5 illustration fig 5 j is a sheet of groundglass which is tacked over the opening when the box is firmly set in the board e it is well to have this groundglass fixed in place so that it can be readily removed if desired illustration fig 6 the necessity for having the box at least two inches larger each way than the largest negative from which enlargements are to be made is shown in fig 6 here ab represents the negative in place ca db and eg represent rays of light entering the box it will be seen that the rays ca and db strike the groundglass at an angle but nevertheless at an angle which results in their passing through it in a considerable degree they strike the negative ab but if the negative were the full size of the box to wit fg it will be seen that while the section ab would be fully lighted the sections af and bg would receive no oblique rays at all and hence the negative would not be even approximately uniformly lighted this point is too often overlooked in the construction of apparatus of this character but is necessary in all cases of daylight enlarging and especially when direct sunlight is used now with the negative box in place some arrangement must be made for holding the lens which can be the lens used for making the negative this for enlargements of a fixed size from negatives of a given size can be accomplished by simply extending the section bggc fig 3 to a proper distance and placing the lens in the end of it but this permits too little opportunity for adjustments and is not advisable a double box one sliding within the other would be better but still not quite satisfactory it is far better to adapt ones camera to the apparatus and this can always be done it being very simple with a reversible back camera which can be backed right up to the opening and more difficult but always possible with others fig 7 shows the entire apparatus in place and the manner in which it is used ab is the window board c is the negative box d is the camera adjusted to the latter e is the enlarging screen on an easel to hold the bromide paper and f is the reflector the screen on the easel can be made either to rest on the floor or on a table it can be made to run on a track or otherwise and it can also be made so as to admit of either vertical or lateral adjustment or both or it can be nothing more than an ordinary box set on a table but however constructed it must be considerably larger than the largest sheet of bromide paper which is to be used thus allowing for nearly all necessary adjustments of the paper it is preferably covered with white paper or fine blotter to aid in focusing the reflector f is considerably larger than the negativebox and adjusted at an angle which will reflect the light from the sky or sun evenly upon the ground glass it is best covered with good white blotting paper g is a hood which i have found useful in sunlight enlarging especially in summer when the sun is almost overhead it is placed on the outside of the windowframe some distance above the groundglass and shields the latter from the direct rays of the sun which would otherwise cause uneven illumination owing to their too great obliquity the direct sun on the white reflector will give a light of high intensity in winter however when the sun is low it will fall directly on the groundglass and this if the negative box be constructed as advised is not objectionable but on the contrary an advantage in fig 4 the opening fghi represents a sheet of ruby glass and can be screened while focusing if found to interfere with the workers convenience in that operation illustration fig 7 the apparatus as sketched will suffice for all ordinary work modifications of it will depend upon the ingenuity of the man who attempts to design or construct one it should be noted that the distance of the groundglass from the negative has its influence in the strength of the light and it is better to have this distance not over two inches if less than one inch however the diffusion of light is not so good when the light is weak the groundglass can be removed entirely the negative will thus be viewed directly against the white reflector very strong negatives giving undue contrasts may also be dealt with in this way or if the light is too strong for flat negatives the reflector can be removed entirely or to the same end a sheet of yellow glass can be substituted for the groundglass thus increasing contrasts in fact a very useful and easily arranged modification of the negativebox consists of an opening in the top of the box inside the room through which can be dropped an extra sheet of groundglass or opal to cut down the light or of yellow glass to increase contrast this opening should be at the point k fig 3 i have referred to a kit as being the proper arrangement for holding the negative this after much tribulation in working with homemade contrivances i have found to be the best arrangement they come a size or two larger than the negative with which they are to be used and can easily be cut down to the proper dimensions with it also other kits to hold smaller negatives can readily be used it is also simple with them to fasten the negatives in place if they extend beyond the box on either side so much the better greater lateral adjustment can then be made the negative box fig 3 is best painted dead black inside in the section gbcg and white in the section aggd the reasons for this will be obvious at a glance in enlarging from films it is well to place them between two sheets of glass of proper size and fasten the whole in the kit or negativeholder for this purpose use thin glass without flaws or scratches if the films are smaller than the opening in the kit it is well to paste a black mat on one of the glasses when after proper adjustment the film will remain in place between the two glasses with very little pressure enlarged negatives are very easily made with the apparatus described a contact positive can be made preferably on carbon transparency tissue and from this the enlargement made or an enlarged positive made first and from this a contact negative the latter plan is preferable since it admits of retouching on both positive and negative slow plates should be used throughout for those who do not care to go to the expense of experimenting with large plates i would suggest that good contact positives be first made and from these negatives on bromide paper standard a soft these negatives are treated as already described the best positive for this purpose is a thin one with full gradations of tone from clear high light to deep shadow without veil or fog but free from any suspicion of flatness chapter v enlarging by artificial light the apparatus for enlarging with artificial light is as has been stated more expensive than that for use with daylight the negative box and screen however remain as given but we need in addition two extra pieces a lightbox and a pair of condensing lenses the form of lightbox presupposes the choice of illuminant and in this there is a wide range suffice it to say that a kerosene lamp with one or more oneandahalf inch burners will be found suitable for very small work or weak negatives for larger work or stronger negatives a stronger light will be needed of these the first in point of strength is the arclight which is too strong for ordinary negatives to be enlarged not more than fourfold on ordinary bromide paper used with any of the slower papers it will be found very serviceable and satisfactory next comes the limelight which has pretty much the same advantages and disadvantages after these come acetylene a gas giving an intense light of high actinic power this is within the reach of nearly all as a firstclass generator costs only about twelve dollars and the uses of the gas are manifold the same generators and burners can be used with a projecting lantern and will be found far more satisfactory than oil acetylene burners can be had in various sizes ranging in power from thirty to several hundred candlepower the carbide from which the gas is generated is not expensive and costs only a few cents each time the machine is loaded by an adjustment attached to the generator the gas is kept at a constant pressure and hence the light is unusually steady all in all this light has many advantages after it in strength comes the welsbach burner suitable for those having gas in the house after this comes the ordinary gasburner and then oil the reader knowing now what will be required of his light can take his choice perhaps the simplest form of lightbox is where the light is placed in one room and the enlarging done in an adjoining one the light being admitted through a suitable opening this prevents the possibility of stray light reaching the paper and is productive of no additional heat in a room presumably already hot enough if this is not feasible a lightbox must be constructed as these vary so much in material and design and must be altered with different forms of light in use i will merely state the requirements first of these is that it must be lighttight and second that it must have adequate ventilation and be fireproof following these in importance there should be a simple arrangement for looking at the light from time to time to see that it is burning properly and some means for readily attending to it if it is not having the lightbox the burners must be placed in it properly here the shortest way out of the difficulty is to go to an expert if electricity is used go to an electrical supply house if gas go to a gasfitter as will be seen later the flame itself must be placed in a certain relation to other portions of the apparatus and provision must be made accordingly in looking over the magazines and annuals we will now and then see some new method given for illuminating evenly the back of a negative in enlarging or reduction the most of these the writer has tried but he has never found one of them which could be relied upon to give even reasonable satisfaction if the light is apparently evenly diffused it is too weak if strong enough it is not evenly diffused hence i will recommend nothing short of a pair of condensing lenses as these have been proved by experience to be satisfactory in every respect if properly handled and cared for the diameter of these must be slightly greater than the diagonal of the largest negative from which enlargements are to be made these can be bought in pairs mounted or unmounted at about the following prices diameter focus pair of lenses per single lens inches inches mounted unmounted 4 512 or 612 400 125 412 512 or 612 600 150 5 612 750 175 6 8 1200 300 8 12 3200 750 9 14 4000 1000 the prices asked for condensers vary considerably in different pricelists they can often be had at secondhand at a decided saving of expense if it is desired to save the additional cost of the mounted condensing lenses they can be comparatively easily mounted by anyone at all familiar with tools in the following manner a piece of quarterinch pine or poplar is cut to a square about an inch larger than the diameter of the lenses in the center of this is sawed out a circular opening the exact size of the lens in another board of the same dimensions is cut a circle a quarter of an inch less in diameter these boards are placed together with the grain running in opposite directions to prevent warping and the lens kept in place by a wire bent in a circle and clamped in place so as to hold the lens or other similar arrangement see fig 8 the other lens is mounted in the same way the two are mounted with their convex sides facing each other and a slight distance apart it is better to place between them a thin sheet of finely ground glass as this overcomes the bad effects of slight flaws in the lenses which are not uncommon the combination is then boxed up illustration fig 8 having now our lightbox condensers negative box camera and screen they are next arranged in the order shown by fig 9 a long table especially constructed for the purpose makes the best base for this purpose in putting the apparatus together there are several points to be noticed first the planes of the lenses negative projecting lenses and screen must all be parallel second the centers of all these should be in a single straight line and third either the light or the condensers should be so mounted as to easily slide backward or forward since every time the projecting lens is racked backward or forward it necessitates a corresponding motion of the condensers to or from the light illustration fig 9 in constructing the apparatus for use with condensers and artificial light the same provision should be made in the negative box for inserting a piece of colored or ground glass as was made in the daylight apparatus when the diameter of the condensers is but little greater than the diagonal of the negative it will be necessary to have the latter quite close to the former as the cone of light from the condensers has its apex at the lens and hence if the negative in such a case is at a distance from the condensers the corners will receive no light reference to fig 9 will show this plainly for this and other reasons it is always best to have the condensers of ample size for a given negative in fact before beginning to make enlargements the worker should work with one good negative until he finds out exactly what lightintensity is best suited to it this will then serve as a standard for all other negatives of the same general grade and variations of the light can be made as required for particular negatives or where the extent of enlargement is materially changed for various purposes in using the daylight apparatus which we will now consider the negative is placed in the holder opposite the center of the groundglass upside down and facing into the work room the room is darkened and lens uncapped an image more or less blurred will appear on the screen if the enlarged picture is to be only slightly larger than the negative the lens must be racked out until its distance from the negative is but little less than its distance from the screen to make the enlargement greater we simply rack back the lens and move the screen further off there are tables which show exactly the distance which the lens must be from the negative and screen in order to get an enlargement of a given size the table here inserted covers the ordinary requirements and may be of service

is assumed that the photographer knows exactly what the focus of his lens is and that he is able to measure accurately from its optical center the use of the table will be seen from the following illustration a photographer has a carte to enlarge to four times its size and the lens he intends employing is one of 6 inches equivalent focus he must therefore look for 4 on the upper horizontal line and for 6 in the first vertical column and carry his eye to where these two join which will be at 30712 the greater of these is the distance the sensitive plate must be from the center of the lens and the lesser the distance of the picture to be copied in practice it is convenient after having once found the focus for a given enlargement from a given negative with the lens in use to mark on the base of the apparatus the point to which the lens has been extended then in making future enlargements of the same size it is only necessary to set the lens at that point and move the easel backward or forward until an approximate focus is obtained when the image will be of the proper size on the screen as an approximate guide it is sufficient to know that the nearer the lens is to the negative the greater will be the enlargement as may be seen in fig 7 if a piece of thin cardboard or a sheet of paper cut to the exact size of the enlargement desired is placed upon the easelscreen little difficulty will be experienced in getting an enlarged image of the proper size and correctly focused it is advisable to focus the enlargement with the largest aperture of the lens if the lens when working at its largest aperture covers the plate from which the enlargement is being made it will give proper definition over the enlargement with a lens of the better sort of course the definition will be equally good whether a large or small aperture is used but with a lowpriced lens it is better to stop down to no 8 f113 or no 16 f16 to avoid spherical aberration stopping the lens down increases the time of exposure and enables one to have greater control over the operation of exposing the paper permitting time to shade or locally increase the exposure at any portion of the image this is sometimes useful but as a general thing stopping the lens down is not advisable as interfering with ones judgment in calculating exposures for various negatives having secured the image correct in size and focus place thumbtacks at all four sides of the sheet of paper or card used to focus the image these will serve as a guide to the placing of the sensitive paper adjust the lens stop as desired and cap the lens leaving the room totally dark save for such safe light as we may have for working place the bromide paper on the screen using the thumbtacks as a guide to the correct position in this in making his first enlargements the beginner should avail himself of the help of teststrips these should be about one inch wide and the length of the paper the exposure depends on a number of factors among which are light negative focal length of lens size of enlargement stops sensitiveness of paper developer temperature of developer and length of development the first experiment had best therefore be made on a purely arbitrary basis for which we will take ten seconds pinning a teststrip on the screen we uncap the lens and with a piece of cardboard shade twothirds of the strip during five seconds move the cardboard and give the next section five seconds making ten for the first then remove the cardboard entirely and give five seconds more making fifteen for the first ten for the second and five for the third now develop the strip if the fifteen seconds portion finishes development in less than one minute and the ten takes approximately a minute we will know that our basis was correct but if all three were overexposed or underexposed as shown by one minutes development we can expose the next teststrip accordingly in determining the correct exposure the method already set forth for contact exposures is a reasonably good one if the paper with a given exposure takes half the proper time to develop halve the next exposure if double the time or more double it more could be said on the subject of exposure and possibly to advantage for instance there are tables showing the exact relation of exposure to the number of times of enlargement but complicated calculations in the darkroom are troublesome and a teststrip is simpler after a while one gets the ability to determine the approximate exposure required by looking at the enlarged image on the screen correcting slight errors by length of development and greater ones by modifying the developer by diluting or strengthening it should be remembered however that in judging exposure by reference to the screen we must consider the high lights as well as the shadows it is in the high lights that we need the detail if we are to have soft pictures if this detail in the high lights is plentiful and clear we may know that our light is strong enough for a very short exposure if it is very faint we will have to give a long exposure and use diluted developer to save the overexposed shadows on the other hand if the image on the screen is a flat one we may know that our light is too strong for the negative and it must be modified by removing the reflector or by interposing ground or yellow glass and if neither of these suffice we can simply lay the negative aside for a dark day when the light will be very much weaker frequently all necessary contrasts can be obtained by the use of the hard paper before referred to as underexposure tends to increase contrasts we should also give the minimum exposure in the case of flat negatives abandoning for a time our standard oneminute development as will be seen by this time there are many wrinkles about using bromide paper and it will be found that new ones appear at every seance in the enlarging room but why is it that so many of our enlargements are black in the shadows and chalky in the high lights why simply because our light is too weak for our negative we forget that if we cannot modify our negative we must modify our light it is this characteristic of the bromide enlargement which has prevented the process from enjoying the popularity it deserves and i sometimes wonder whether this chalkiness is due to the use of the north light chapter vi dodging vignetting composite printing and the use of bolting silk of all printing processes bromide enlarging offers the best opportunities for successful dodging and modification we can cut our light down and take all the time we want or we can take as little time as we want a hand a finger a slip of paper or anything within reach will suffice to shade the light just as we want it in this connection it is well to always hold the shade nearer the lens than the easel as greater diffusion results and there is less danger of sharp lines in shading a foreground to bring up a dense sky first make a teststrip or two noting how long the shading is carried on and how long the light is allowed to act on the whole if the sky is then over or underprinted we can modify it in the enlargement proper the best arrangement for vignetting in enlarging is a piece of cardboard the size of the negative with an opening cut out at the proper place and about the size of the portion of the negative to be vignetted this is held near the lens and moved backward and forward between the latter and the screen the opening showing larger as we near the lens and smaller as we recede from it very tasteful vignettes can be made in this way a favorite method of the writers is to use a sheet of bromide paper preferably that with rough surface and print on it a small vignette of a portion of a negative these sheets being of a uniform size are then bound in book form and make very attractive souvenirs variety can be added to the collection by printing some of the pictures through a mat fastened on the screen over the paper when of course they are bounded by straight sharp lines double printing in enlarging is not at all difficult assuming that teststrips have been made determining the proper exposure for each negative i will briefly outline the process taking a landscape negative with clear sky in which we wish to print clouds we first tack on the screen a sheet of paper the size of our bromide and after properly adjusting and focusing it trace with a pencil the outline of the skyline we then remove the foreground negative and after tracing cut out a mask conforming to the size and shape of the foreground cutting away the sky we now put in the box the sky negative and readjust our sheet of paper until after proper focusing the desired portion of the sky occupies the portion reserved for it leaving the thumbtacks as a guide when we put our bromide on the screen now using the sheet of paper as a guide place on the edges of the bromide paper two little pencil marks to show how far we shall shade the lower portion of the paper our mask being the size of the foreground negative it is now only necessary to hold it at the proper distance from the lens to have its edge conform to the skyline when enlarged but this would leave a sharp line if held exactly at that point so using the pencil marks on the margin as a guide we slowly raise and lower the mask very slightly and just sufficient to cause an agreeable blending of the sky into nothing the proper exposure given we cap the lens remove the paper and insert the foreground negative now we must again adjust our sheet of plain paper until the sky line marked on it coincides with the skyline on the screen leaving thumbtacks as usual registry being thus secured we simply expose the foreground and develop the composite print needless to say our clouds must be lighted from the same general direction as the landscape but if in the negative they are not so lighted it can be reversed in the holder and will then print properly in almost all cloud printing the tendency is to give undue prominence to the clouds by printing the sky to too deep a tone this besides making the blending very noticeable at the horizon results in unnatural effects and should be avoided if the sky portion of the landscape negative is thin it might print slightly and spoil the effect of the clouds this can be overcome by using a weaker light in enlarging where this is not desirable a mask can be cut for the sky portion and used slightly while the foreground is being printed by using it a very little during the first part of the exposure the tint will be overcome while objects projecting above the horizon will be sufficiently printed it will be found easier no doubt to print the landscape first and sky afterwards but this does not result in good work the landscape should invariably be printed after the sky portion bolting silk enlargements were for a time very popular sometimes they were artistic then everyone began making them too often from unsuitable negatives and they fell into disrepute this method of enlarging is in fact suitable for very few negatives and only where broad effects of light and shade are desired to cut up a spotty negative with a succession of lines does not necessarily give a broad effect in the picture but for softening down heavy masses of shadows and blending them harmoniously with masses of light or half light the process is without an equal the bolting silk can be bought by the square yard of dealers in photographic supplies and should be stretched evenly over a frame made of quarter and halfinch wood being tacked between the two strips this frame can be easily adjusted to fit over the paper on the screen by using the side bringing the cloth within a quarter of an inch of the paper the lines are more evident which is not so objectionable for very large work but for the softest effects reverse the frame and use it at half an inch from the paper in this way we get a soft diffusion of the lines and much greater general softness it should never be used nearer than a quarter of an inch as the lines then become too evident and hence fail in the effect desired the bolting silk comes in three grades fine medium and coarse the medium is the best for general work it should not however be used for sizes under 8 10 the interposition of the cloth requires about onehalf additional exposure focusing of course must be done without the frame in place the bolting silk should only be used with paper which is to be toned to some color other than black as there is something incongruous in its use with black tones few branches of photographic work outside of negativemaking are as fascinatingly interesting as the making of enlarged prints on bromide paper from small negatives every amateur has negatives worthy of enlargement in his collection and the process is so simple as to be within the capacity of the amateur who is still in his first year in photography its practice will stimulate his interest and help him in all his other photographic work especially will it help him in picturemaking the merits and defects of composition being a hundred fold more plainly evident in an enlargement than in the small print from the handcamera negative moreover in its essentials bromide enlarging calls for no special equipment other than the ordinary hand or viewcamera and a darkroom or other convenient workroom from which all white light can be excluded on occasion chapter vii the reduction and toning of bromide prints the subsequent manipulations with bromide paper do not differ materially from those with negatives the support being paper of course makes some difference and the fact that while in the negative we aim to get printing density and printing color only in the positive we aim to please the eye makes another but generally speaking it may be said that whatever we can do with the negative we can do with bromide paper that is in so far as the emulsion itself is concerned the first operation to be taken up is the reduction of prints which are too dark this can best be effected just after the prints come from the hypo a few grains of red prussiate of potash are dissolved in a suitable quantity of water the latter being barely tinged not of a strong yellow color if the print is too dense throughout it can be immersed without previous washing in this solution reduction should take place gradually and this is best accomplished with a weak reducer if the tray be rocked gently the reduction will be quite uniform if however only a portion of the print needs reduction this can be effected by applying the ferricyanide solution locally with a brush or bit of absorbent cotton extreme care is needed in this operation in this way unduly deep shadows can be softened veiled high lights brightened or almost any modification obtained which may be deemed desirable when reduction is almost completed quickly rinse the print in running water and then wash thoroughly if the print has been dried it is only necessary to soak it for a few moments in a fresh fixing bath when the ferricyanide can be applied as before latterly the toning of bromide prints has become popular there are many methods and innumerable formulae here we shall concern ourselves with the sulphide method which best fulfills the three chief requirements namely 1 certainty of results 2 the use of few baths 3 the production of permanent prints processes which as regards color vigor etc are beyond the control of the worker are of very little practical use equally so if the toning involves a whole string of operations the final outcome of which is usuallya spoilt print and lastly a process whichhowever satisfactory it may be in other respectsimpairs the undoubted permanency of a blackdeveloped print is not one worthy of adoption in one or two other respects processes vary chiefly as regards the depth or intensity which the print must have in order to produce the most satisfactory result when toned thus prints to be toned with uranium require to be distinctly on the pale side whilst those for sulphide toning are best a little vigorous one or two other methods on the other hand require the use of the costly gold or platinum salts the latter except under exceptional circumstances are far better employed in the legitimate form of platinotype or other platinum paper bromide prints toned with platinum will probably cost more and will never have the absolute permanence peculiar to the platinum print placed in rough order of merit the processes available are sulphide toning hypoalum toning is a cheaper slower and not quite so effective form of this method whilst the thio processes represent sulphide toning at its best copper toning toning by redevelopment these methods differ not only in the results which they give but also as regards the perfection with which each attains its particular effect on the principle of the lady in the play who spoke the absolute truth under the circumstances each may claim to be included among the really serviceable processes in the sulphide process the image which in a blackdeveloped print consists of metallic silver in fine division is converted into silver sulphide a substance which in the ordinary way is also black but when produced in a fine condition on a photographic print is brown to sepia color silver sulphide is a most permanent substance therefore a sulphidetoned print should be permanent too a conclusion which is fully borne out in practice a sulphidetoned print is at least as permanent as the bromide from which it is made the image of the latter is susceptible to practically only one agent likely to come in contact with it namely sulphur fumes from burning gas which partially sulphurize it and give rise to iridescent markings resembling those due to stale paper now as the sulphidetoned print is the result of this sulphurizing process carried out with intention to a state of completeness the result should beand proves to be in practiceimmune to this one cause of defacement in converting the silver image into one of silver sulphide the method is to first act on bleach the silver image with some reagent which will change it into a compound of silver susceptible to the action of sulphide iodine has been used for this giving an image of silver iodide bromine gives one of silver bromide a mixture of potass bichromate and hydrochloric acid gives silver chloride as does also a solution of chlorine though in the former case the presence of the chromium compounds affects the color obtained but the best of the lot is a solution of the two substances potassium ferricyanide and potassium bromide which forms an image of silver ferrocyanide and silver bromide both of these are converted into silver sulphide when treated with a solution of sodium sulphide in the case of the hypoalum process in which the prints are toned direct without bleaching in a mixture of hypo and alum the image is also changed into silver sulphide but only to a partial extent theoretically the method is not so good as sulphide proper it is much more inconvenient in practice except on a commercial scale while the results cannot be said to quite equal those by the sulphide process as regards permanency so much by way of theory we will now give the formulae for the two solutions required in the sulphide process the first of these is the bleach or oxidizing mixture of bromide and ferricyanide within reasonable limits the proportions of these salts and the quantity of each in the solution does not matter very much each chemical can if desired be kept in a separate solution if care be taken to keep the mixture in the darkthat is in a cupboard where it will not be exposed constantly to daylight the ferricyanide suffers in time by exposure to daylight but as both it and the bromide are comparatively cheap and serve for a large number of prints there is no need to take excessive care the ferricyanidebromide mixture however keeps very much better than a plain solution of ferricyanide alone formulae which place the salts in separate solutions are a mistake as good a formula as any is potass ferricyanide 300 grains potass bromide 100 grains water 20 ounces ammonium bromide may be used in place of the potassium salt in the above formula the difference is not marked but the ammonium compound tends to give a somewhat warmer brown or sepia in the case of many formulae it will be noticed that equal quantities of bromide and ferricyanide are recommended although as just stated variations in the formula are not at all marked in their effects a proportion of bromide over onequarter of the ferricyanide does tend towards the yellowish color of which complaints are now and again heard i want to make it clear that the opportunities for going wrong with the bleacher are very small indeed without encouraging the reader to be careless let it be said that any old formula of ferricyanide and bromide for the bleacher will prove successful not so however in the case of the sulphide solution which requires to be very carefully made up and used sulphide not sulphite the material for the toning or darkening of the bleached print is the chemical substance sodium sulphide of the formula na2s9h2o this is purchased as small crystals which greedily absorb water and rapidly become almost liquid if not properly corked not that this totally unfits the sulphide for use sulphide which has gone liquid will at all times be found to work perfectly but it is of course open to suspicion and in any case it is not possible to know what is the strength of a solution made up with such a supply for this reason it is best to make up the sulphide into solution of 20 per cent strength and add this to water to make the toning bath and it is here that a caution must be noted the weak working solution which is only about 1 to 2 per cent strength keeps very badly indeed and should be made up fresh from the stock solution at the time of toning each batch of prints this is one of the most necessary items to bear in mind in using the sulphide process sodium sulphide is sold in various degrees of purity and the label on the bottle is not always in exact correspondence with the condition of the substance inside but the two forms which must be adhered to for sulphide toning are the ordinary pure and the pure for analysis the former can be obtained from any reliable drug store or photographic dealer it comes in small lumps yellowish to greenish in color when dissolved in water the solution will be yellow and will usually show a deposit which must be filtered off this sulphide will give tones which are sepia brown with most papers in the case of the pureforanalysis sulphide which is the recrystallized variety the salt will be pure white and will form a quite colorless and clear solution in water the tone given by this kind of sulphide is usually of a more purplish color the distinct difference between the two commercial varieties of sulphide should not be overlooked as it allows the worker to modify the process usefully when dealing with papers differing as all papers do to a slight extent in their adaptability to sulphide toning the purer form has certainly much better keeping properties than the other but either if made up in 20 per cent solution keeps for a month or two at leastwhich is enough for all purposes the chief difference between the two is noticed in the diluted or working solutions that of the purest sulphide may be kept and used again though it is not really good policy to do so the supply of sulphide should therefore be dissolved as soon as purchased as follows stock sulphide solution20 per cent sodium sulphite 4 ounces water to make 20 ounces the actual toning solution is made up at the time of treating the prints by mixing the above stock with water as follows sulphide toning bathstock 20 per cent solution 3 ounces water to make 20 ounces this makes a bath which contains about one per cent real sulphide corresponding with about a 3 per cent solution of the sulphide as purchased if the bath is much weaker the tone obtained is usually not quite so good while if it is stronger there is danger of the prints blistering while toning or afterward in the washing water indeed some papers need to be toned in a weaker bath and require also to be fixed in an alumhypo fixing bath see later so that the strength of the toning bath given above may be taken as the maximum and used at half or onethird strength as circumstances show to be necessary and to repeat the caution once more the toning bath is to be thrown away as soon as the prints have been passed through it with these points in our mind as to the making up of the solution we can come to the process proper the prints require to be well washed and free from hypo before being placed in the bromideferricyanide bleacher because any hypo in conjunction with the ferricyanide will form the wellknown farmers reducer and cause patchiness of the prints it is immaterial whether the prints are taken direct through the toning process or dried in the meantime some workers contend that the toning process is more regular if the prints are dried before bleaching in either case immersion in the bleacher will cause the fully developed bromide to disappear leaving only a faint brown image behind in some cases the image is fainter than in others the difference appearing to depend chiefly on the developer employed developers with a liability to stain will give prints which do not bleach out so completely as those made with cleaner working developers but in all cases two to three minutes action of the bleaching solution will be ample if all pure black is not gone in this time it is a sign that the bleach is becoming exhausted the prints should be kept constantly on the move whilst in the solution and turned over and over to ensure equal action they are then given quite a brief rinse in running waterhalf a minute to a minuteand then transferred to the sulphide solution where they should darken to the full brown or sepia tone in a few seconds it is well always to leave them here for twice to three times the period required to give the full tone a wash of half an hour will remove the salts left in the film granted that bleacher and sulphide are in proper working order there is one further factor in the making of sepia prints which is of vital importance and that is the proper preparation of the print itself a good sulphide tone presupposes a good black and white bromide not only that defects in the bromide which may lie latent while the print is untoned come to light in the sulphide bath this applies to uneven fixation due to omission to keep prints moving in the hypo bath and fingering of the surface while as regards the original development of the print making the best of a wrong exposure will not do when sulphide toning is in view a print that is forced by long development will suffer in tone the result being colder and less satisfactory as regards vigor full exposure and development which is complete in the normal time for a perfect black print are the conditions for a good sepia tone and when a batch of prints is being put through it is well to take steps to preserve a uniform time of development in order to secure an identical tone throughout there are many different formulas for the uranium toning of bromide prints and i suppose that most of them have given good results with the workers who published their methods of those which i have tried however none has yielded the results which i have been enabled to obtain from my own formulamy own in that i arrived at it by patient experimenting it may be that this formula is not wholly original with myself at any rate i do not claim anything for it except that it works with me better than others i have tried the requirements for toning bromide prints with uranium are 1 ounce of uranium nitrate 1 ounce of potassium ferricyanide the red crystals 12 pound bottle of acetic acidc p glacial preferred water a supply of blotting paper to be kept exclusively for this purpose and a few absolutely and chemically clean trays the expense attached to these toning processes is slight uranium nitrate costs from forty to sixty cents per ounce and an ounce will last a long time potassium ferricyanide costs about twenty cents per pound and a pound is ample for a lifetime glacial acetic acid is a little more costly but a halfpound bottle will prove a good investment it is used also as the reader will recall in making acid hypo for acid fixing to prepare the toning baths dissolve the ounce of uranium nitrate in 10 ounces of water the water should be distilled if this is easily obtainable and the solution should be kept in an orangeglass bottle or an ordinary bottle protected from light by a nonactinic paper wrapping dissolve the ounce of potassium ferricyanide in 10 ounces of water keep this also in an orangeglass bottle well corked there are many cautions about this particular salt and it has been said that it will not keep in solution in my practice i find no difficulty whatever in the use of a solution six months old despite the difficulties mentioned in the textbooks to tone the bromide prints first note that the prints should have been developed and fixed and washed just as usual it is necessary that prints to be toned shall contain no trace of hypo to secure this the prints should be specially prepared for toning by being again thoroughly washed as any hypo remaining in the print will cause spots and streakiness with care at this stage the toning will give clean and bright prints which should be as permanent as the original bromide print i cannot give the reason why but as a general rule bromide prints tone better if the print has been dried after washing and rewet just before toning there may be a chemical reason for this but i am inclined to think that it is a physical one viz that the emulsion is softer after its first washing than after having been dried and wet so that it allows toning solution to get into the film more quickly this naturally results in more rapid toning and quick toning does not yield as good prints as a slower and more gradual building up of the color image having the print ready for toning as here outlined take 1 dram of the uranium solution add 12 dram of acetic acid and then 5 ounces of water in a separate graduate put 1 dram of ferricyanide solution and 5 ounces of water just before toning pour these two solutions together into the third graduate and use immediately to proceed lay the rewetted print face up in a clean tray and flow the freshly made toning bath the two solutions combined over the print the print and tray must be kept in motion by gentle rocking during the toning operation the toning solution tends to throw a red precipitate as it works this precipitate should not be permitted to settle on the face of the print some workers tone their prints face down but i do not advocate this as it is important to take the print from the toning bath at just the right moment and as the toning process is short six or seven minutes is usually sufficient even for the deepest red you need to watch the print all the time in the toning operation note that a constant quiet motion of the tray to keep the solution moving over the print is essential to success i have already given in an earlier paragraph the order in which the colors come but that order was for a normal print some prints behave differently and it is in the control of these unavoidable variations with different prints that skill and success come a print of a halftone subject against a jetblack background a portrait for instance will hardly follow the normal order in the appearance of colors this because the halftones will be brown and even redbrown before the toning solution has changed the dense black deposit of the background at all if the toning was stopped at this stage some very pretty effects in double toning might result from this explanation of the toning process the discerning reader will perceive the need for caution in selecting the best kind of a print for uranium toning thus a print which has a baldheaded sky will tone only in the body of the print but if there is any tint at all to the sky it also will tone giving an effect not much to be desired except for sunset or sunrise pictures if white highlights are desired in the toned print they must be white originally and not the least bit fogged as doubletoned effects in a print are not usually desirable those prints having deep black shadows or dark masses will be avoided the best kind of print for this method of toning is one fully exposed and slightly underdeveloped since when the uranium does take hold of the shadows it makes for an increase of contrast experience is the best teacher and i could not begin to describe in detail what the reader can himself ascertain from a few experiments some prints needing contrast should be carried far in the toning solution others not needing contrast will give better results if they are toned only through the browns and so on the reader who can spend a saturday afternoon with a few bromide prints varying in character will learn more from his experimenting than i could tell him in many pages for these experiments waste or imperfect black prints can be used with practical economy the chief object being to watch the progress of toning and chemical changes when the desired tone is reached remove the print from the toning solution and wash quickly and well in running water for fifteen minutes if washed too long the color of the print will fade and a dead and lifeless print will result if not washed long enough the yellow of the ferricyanide will remain in the print robbing its gradations of brightness and purity of color and impairing the permanency of the print a big advantage in this method of toning is its wonderful adaptability there is no hard and fast rule as to the proportion of the chemicals to the bulk of water used try two drams of each of the two solutions then three drams of each but watch that the print does not get beyond you in toning the only practical difference in my formula and others that i have seen is that i make my stock solution weaker than that ordinarily advised and use less of it to a certain amount of water because i prefer slow toning and the accompanying ease of control which the flashinthepan formula does not admit quick toning like quick development tends to block the shadows in the print and if you once get bronzed shadows the print is practically hopeless not quite ruined however as a bath in a 5 per cent solution of sodium carbonate will discharge the color and then if the print is faded it may be redeveloped in an alkaline developer such as metolhydro but before it is retoned the print must be thoroughly washed as the presence of sodium carbonate does not permit the toning solution to do its work finally i may say that while a bath of acetic acid and water is often advised to stop the toning action in this method i have never found it necessary all the thin varieties of bromide paper curl badly in drying if they are to be kept unmounted it is well to immerse them in water to which has been added a few drops of glycerine this will ensure their lying flat after drying a solution of 2 ounces of glycerine in 25 ounces of water is advised when it is desired to make bromides on heavy rough paper remain flat after drying for book illustration and similar purposes if one is trying to rush through a bromide print it can be trimmed while wet by placing it on a sheet of stiff paper and cutting through both the paper will be found to cockle the mounts badly in drying aside from the glue mountant formula for which accompanies the paper i know no preventive except to mount the prints while dry with the dry mounting tissue as the paper when wet stretches one way considerably as much as a third of an inch on a ten or twelveinch length provision must be made in trimming especially if mounts with centers of a given size are used the paper being covered with an emulsion which in warm weather is very soft while wet mounting is somewhat more difficult than with some of the other papers my method is to mount not more than half a dozen at once placing them face down one on top of the other on a glass or ferrotype plate blotting off the surface water and spreading the paste over the top one in the usual way i place this on the mount and then stretch over it smoothly a damp handkerchief or piece of very thin rubber cloth rubbing the print down with my hands seldom using the squeegee and then very lightly by this method abrasion of the surface seldom results and airbells are unknown owing to the strong contracting power of the paper in drying the mounting paste must be used freely especially at the edges of the print apart from the methods of procedure here given there are innumerable modifications covering every detail of contact printing and enlarging on bromide paper most of these have been given careful trial as published but few have
