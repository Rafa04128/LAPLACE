sons new york and london the knickerbocker press 1906 copyright 1906 by g p putnams sons preface for years the makers of this book have spent the summer time in wandering about the french country led here by the fame of some old monument or there by an incident of history they have found the real unspoiled france often unexplored by any except the french themselves and practically unknown to foreigners even to the ubiquitous maker of guidebooks for weeks together they have travelled without meeting an englishspeaking person it is therefore not surprising that they were unable to find in any convenient form in english a book telling of the cathedrals of the south which was at once accurate and complete for the cathedrals of that country are monuments not only of architecture and its history but of the history of peoples the psychology of the christianising and unifying of the barbarian and the galloroman and many things besides epitomised perhaps in the old words the struggle between the world the flesh and the devil in french works on cathedrals are numerous and exhaustive but either so voluminous as to be unpractical except for the specialistas the volumes of violletleducor so technical as to make each cathedral seem one in an endless monotonous procession differing from the others only in size style and age this is distinctly unfair to these old churches which have personalities and idiosyncrasies as real as those of individuals it has been the aim of the makers of this book to introduce in photograph and in storynot critically or exhaustively but suggestively and accuratelythe cathedral of the mediterranean provinces as it exists today with its peculiar characteristics of architecture and history they have described only churches which they have seen they have verified every fact and date where such verification was possible and have depended on local tradition only where that was all which remained to tell of the past and they will feel abundantly repaid for travel research and patient exploration of towers crypts and archives if the leisurely traveller on pleasure bent shall find in these volumes but a hint of the interest and fascination which the glorious architecture the history and the unmatched climate of the southland can awaken for unfailing courtesy and untiring interest for free access to private as well as to ecclesiastical libraries for permission to photograph and copy for unbounding hospitality and the retelling of many an old legend their most grateful thanks are due to the catholic clergy from archbishop to cur and vicar for rare old bits of information for historical verification and for infinite pains in accuracy of printed matter they owe warm thanks to mrs wilbur rose to miss frances kyle and to mrs william h shelmire jr for criticism and training in the art of photographing they owe no less grateful acknowledgment to mr john g bullock and mr charles r pancoast e w r v h f

if it is only by an effort that we appreciate the valour of columbus in the xv century his secret doubts his temerity how much fainter is our conception of the heroism of the early mediterranean navigators steam has destroyed for us the awful majesty of distance and we can never realise the immensity of this great sea to the ancients to virgil the adventures of the pious neas were truly heroic the western shores of the mediterranean were then the end of the earth and even during the first centuries of our own era he who ventured outside the straits of gibraltar tempted either providence or the devil and was very properly punished by falling over the edge of the earth into everlasting destruction why asks a medival textbook of science is the sun so red in the evening and this convincing answer follows because he looks down upon hell for centuries before the christian era the south of france with spain lay in the unknown west end of the sea along its eastern shores lay civilisations hoary with age carthage to the south was moribund greece was living on the prestige of her glorious past while rome was becoming allpowerful legend tells that adventurous phoenicians and greeks discovered the french coasts that nmes was founded by a tyrian hercules and marseilles about 600 bc by a phoenician trader who married a chiefs daughter and settled at the mouth of the rhone but these early settlements were merely isolated towns which were not interdependentscarcely more than trading posts it was rome who took southern gaul unto herself and after roman fashion built cities and towns and coordinated them into wellregulated provinces and it is with roman rule that the connected history of gaul begins from the outset we meet one basic fact so difficult to realise when france is considered as one country the essential difference between the north and the south csar found in the south a partial roman civilisation ready for his organisation and old flourishing cities like narbonne aix and marseilles in the north he found the people advanced no further than the tribal stage and parisnot even paris in namewas a collection of mud huts which from its strategic position he elevated into a camp the two following centuries the height of roman dominion in france accentuated these differences the north was governed by the romans never assimilated nor civilised by them the south eagerly absorbed all the culture of the imperial city her religions and her pleasures her beautiful temples and great amphitheatres finally her morals and effeminacy till in the ii century of our era anyone living a life of luxurious gaiety was popularly said to have set sail for marseilles to this day the south boasts that it was a very part of rome and rome was not slow to recognise the claim gallic poets celebrated the glory of augustus a gaul was the master of quintilian and antoninus pius although born in the imperial city was by parentage a native of nmes illustration carcassonne the invulnerable not to the rude north but to this society so pagan so pleasureloving came the first missionaries of the new christian faith to meet in the arenas of gaul the fate of their fellowbelievers in rome to hide in subterranean caves and crypts to endure to persist and finally to conquer in the iii and iv centuries many of the great bishoprics were founded avignon narbonne lyons arles and saintpaultrois chteaux among others but these same years brought political changes which seemed to threaten both church and state roman power was waning tribes from across the rhine were gathering massing in northern gaul and its spirit was antagonistic to the contentment of the rich mediterranean provinces the tribes were brave ruthless and barbarous peace was galling to their uncontrollable restlessness the galloromans were artistic literary idle and luxurious they fell first to milder but heretical foes then to the fierce but orthodox frank and the story of succeeding years was a chronicle of wars like a great swarm of locusts the saracensconquerors from india to spaincame upon the south they took narbonne nmes and even carcassonne the invulnerable they besieged toulouse and almost destroyed bordeaux other cities perhaps as great as these were razed to the very earth and even their names are now forgotten europe was menaced the south of france was all but destroyed again the frank descended and like a great wind blowing clouds from a stormy sky charles martel swept back the arabs and saved christianity before 740 he had returned a third time to the south not as a deliverer but for pure love of conquest and by dismantling nmes destroying the maritime cities of maguelonne and agde and taking the powerful strongholds of arles and marseilles he paved the way for his great descendant who nominally united all france but charlemagnes empire fell in pieces and as carlovingian had succeeded merovingian so in 987 capetian displaced the weak descendants of the mighty head of the holy roman empire the map changed with bewildering frequency and in these changes the noblesmore stable than their kingsgrew to be the real lords of their several domains history speaks of france from clovis to the revolution as a kingdom but even later than the first crusade the kingdom lay somewhere between paris and lyons the royal domain not france as we know it now the duchy of aquitaine the duchy of brittany burgundy the counties of toulouse provence champagne normandy and many smaller possessions were as proudly separate in spirit as norway and sweden and often as politically distinct as they from denmark in the midst of these times of turmoil the church had steadily grown every change however fatal to north or south brought to her new strength confronted with cultured paganism in the first centuries the blood of her martyrs made truly fruitful seed for her victories and later facing paganism of another wilder race she triumphed more peacefully in the one supreme conversion of clovis and the devotion and interest which from that day grew between church and king gradually made her the greatest power of the country after the decline of roman culture the church was the one intellectual almost peaceful and totally irresistible force the great lords scorned learning an abbot quaintly voicing the churchs belief said that every letter writ on paper is a sword thrust in the devils side when there was cessation of war the occupation of men from clovis time throughout medivalism was gone they could not read they could not write the joy of hunting was in time exhausted they were restless lost the justice meted out by the great lords was too often the right of might but at the council of orlans in 511 a church was declared an inviolable refuge where the weak should be safe until their case could be calmly and righteously judged the beneficent care of the church cannot be overestimated between 500 and 700 she had eightythree councils in gaul and scarcely one but brought a reforma real amelioration of hardships something of the general organisation of her great power in those rude times deserves more than the usual investigation even in its small place in the cathedrals and cloisters of the south of france it is an interesting bit of church politics and psychology the ecclesiastical tradition of france goes back to the very first years of the christian era lazarus mary magdalene martha and mary the mother of james are only a few of those intimately connected with christ himself who are believed to have come into gaul and in their efforts to systematically and surely establish christianity to have founded the first french bishoprics this is tradition but even the history of the ii century tells of a venerable martyred bishop of lyons a disciple of that polycarp who knew saint john and in the iii century gaul added no less than fourteen to the sees she already had enthusiastic tradition aside it is evident that the missionary ardour of the gallic priests was intense and the glory of their early victories belongs entirely to a branch of the church known as the secular clergy illustration the tower of an early maritime cathedralagde the other great branch the religious orders were of later institution from the oriental deserts of the thebaid where saint anthony had early practised the austerities of monkish life saint martin drew his inspiration for the monasticism of the west but it was not until the last of the iv century that he founded near poitiers the first great monastery in france the success of this form of pious life if not altogether edifying was immediate devotional excesses were less common in the temperate climate of france than under the exciting oriental sun yet that most bizarre of eastern fanatics the pillar saint had at least one disciple in gaul hethe good brother wulfailichbegan the life of sanctity by climbing a column near trves and prepared himself to stand on it barefooted through winter and summer till presumably angels should bear him triumphantly to heaven but the west is not the east and the good bishops of the neighbourhood drew off instead of waiting at the pillar as an exalted emperor had humbly stood beneath that of saint simeon stylites far from being awestruck they were scandalised and they forced wulfailich to descend from his eminence and destroyed it this is one of the first gallic instances of the antagonisms between the secular and the regular branches of the reverend clergy within the french church from early times these two great forces were arrayed marching toward the same great endbut never marching together it is claimed they were and are inimical in theory in ideal nothing could be further from truth they were in fact sometimes unfriendly and more often than not mutually suspicious for the great abbot inevitably lived in a bishops see and with human tempers beneath their churchly garb abbot and bishop could not always agree now the bishop was lord of the clergy supreme in his diocese but should he call to account the lowest friar of any monastery my lord abbot replied that he was answerable only to the pope and retired to his vexatious imperium in imperio the beginning of the vi century saw much that was irregular in monastic life the whole country was either in a state of war or of unrestful expectation of war many abbeys were yet to be established many merely in process of foundation wandering brothers were naturally beset by the dangers and temptations of an unsettled life and if history may be believed fell into many irregularities and even shamed their cloth by licentiousness into this disorder came the great and holy benedict the learnedly ignorant the wisely unlearned the true organiser of western monachism under his wise rules the abbey of the vi century was transformed it became not only a place of prayer and meditation but a refuge against barbarism in all its forms and this home of books and knowledge had departments of all kinds and its dependencies formed what we would call today a model farm there were to be found examples of activity and industry for the workman the common tiller of the soil or the landowner himself it was a school continues thierry not of religion but of practical knowledge and when it is considered that there were two hundred and thirtyeight of such schools in clovis day the power of the orders though late in coming will be seen to have grown as great as that of the bishops from these two branches sprang all that is greatest in the ecclesiastical architecture of france as their strength grew their respective churches were built and today as a sign of their dual power we have the abbey and the cathedral the bishops church had its prototype in the first christian meeting places in rome and was planned from two basic ideasthe part of the roman house which was devoted to early christian service and the growing exigencies of the ritual itself at the very first of the christian era converts met in any room but these little groups so soon grew to communities that a larger place was needed and the basilica of the house became the general and accepted place of worship the basilica was composed of a long hall sometimes galleried and a hemicycle and its general outline was that of a letter t into this purely secular building christian ceremonials were introduced the hemicycle became the apse the gallery a clerestory the hall a central nave here the paraphernalia of the new church were installed the altar stood in the apse and between it and the nave on either side a pulpit or readingdesk was placed bishop and priests sat around the altar the people in the nave this disposition of clergy people and the furniture of the sacred office is essentially that of the cathedral of today there were however many amplifications of the first type the basilica form t was enlarged to that of a cross and increasingly beautiful architectural forms were evolved among the first was the tower of the early italian churches this single tower was doubled in the french romanesque often multiplied again by gothic builders and in byzantine churches increased to seven and even nine domes transepts were added and as one by one the arts came to the knowledge of the middle ages and the renaissance each was pressed into the service of the cathedral builders the interior became so beautiful with carvings windows of marvellously painted glass rich tapestries and frescoes that the ritual seemed yearly more impressive and aweinspiring the old squat exterior of early days was forgotten in new height and majesty and the cathedral became the dominant building of the city although the country was early christianised and on the map of merovingian france nearly all the present cathedral cities of the mediterranean were seats of bishoprics we cannot now see all the successive steps of the church architecture of the south the main era of the buildings which have come down to us is the xixiv centuries of earlier types and stages little is known little remains illustration a nave of the earlier stylearles in general gallic churches are supposed to have been basilican with all the poverty of the older style charlemagnes architects with san vitale in mind gave a slight impetus in the faraway chapel at aixlachapelle and gregory of tours tells us that bishop perpetuus built a glorious church at tours but his description is meagre after a few mathematical details he returns to things closer to his heartthe churchs atmosphere of holiness the emblematic radiance of the candles light the ecstasy of worshippers who seemed to breathe the air of paradise and saint gregorys is the religious uncritical spirit of his day whose interest was in ecclesiastical establishment rather than ecclesiastical architecture churches there were in numbers but they were not architectural achievements their building was like the planting of the flag they were new outposts signs of an advance of the faith with this missionary spirit in the church with priests still engaged in christianising and monks in establishing themselves on their domains with a very general ignorance of art with the absorbing interest of the powerful and great in warfare and the very great struggle among the poor for existence architecture before the x century had few students or protectors france had neither sufficient political peace nor ecclesiastical wealth for elaborate church structures no head either of church or state had taste and time enough to inaugurate such works many causes have combined to destroy such churches as then existed if they escaped the rasings and fires of a siege they were often destroyed by lightning or decayed by years and some of the fragments which endured to the xiii century were torn down to make room for more beautiful buildings it was the xi and xii centuries which saw the important beginnings of the great cathedrals of both north and south these were the years when religion was the dominant idea of the western worldwhen everything even warfare was pressed into its service instead of devastating their own and their neighbours country christian armies were devastating the holy land doing to the infidel in the name of their religion what he in the name of his had formerly done to them the capture of jerusalem had triumphantly ended the first crusade the church was everywhere victorious and the pope in actual fact the mightiest monarch of the earth these were the days when peter the hermits cry god wills it aroused the world and aroused it to the most diverse accomplishments one form of this activity was church building but there were other causes than religion for the general magnificence of the effort among these was communal pride the interesting halfforgotten motive of much that is great in medival building the medivalism of the old writers seems an endless pageant in which indefinitely gorgeous armies march up the hill and then march down again in newer histories this has disappeared in the long struggle of one class with another and in neither do we reach the individual nor see the daily life of the people who are the backbone of a nation yet these are the people we must know if we are to have a right conception of the cathedrals place in the living interest of the middle ages for the bishops church was in every sense a popular church the abbey was built primarily for its monks and the abbeychurch for their meditation and worship the french cathedral was the peoples it was built by their money not money from an abbeycoffer it did not stand as the cathedral of england majestic and apart in a scholarly close it was in the open square of the city markets and fairs were held about it the doors to its calm and rest opened directly on the busiest everyday bustle it is not a mere architectural relic as its building was never a mere architectural feat it is the symbol of a past stage of life a majestic part of the picture we conjure before our minds eye when we consider medivalism illustration a nave of the later stylerodez such a picture of a city of another country and of the late middle ages exists in the drama of richard wagners meistersinger and his nuremberg of the xvi century with changes of local colour is the type of all medival towns general travel was unknown the activity of the great roads was the march of armies the roving of marauders the journeys of venturesome merchants or wellarmed knights not only roads but even streets were unsafe at night and after the sun had set he who had gone about freely and carelessly during the day remained at home or ventured out with much caution when armies camped about her walls the city was doubtless much occupied with outside happenings but when the camp broke up and war was far away her shoemaker made his shoes her goldsmith fine chains and trinkets her merchants traded in the marketplace their interests were in street brawls romancings new privileges the work or the feast of the dayin a word towntopics yet being as other men the burghers also were awakened by the energy of the age and instead of wasting it in adventures and wars their interest took the form of an intense local pride narrow but with elements of grandeur seldom selfish but civic this absence of the personal element is nowhere better illustrated than in cathedral building of all the really great men who planned the cathedrals of france almost nothing is known and by searching little can be found out who can give a dead date much less a living fact concerning the life of that gervais who conceived the great gothic height of narbonne who can tell even the name of him who planned the sombre battlemented walls of agde or of that great man who first saw in poetic vision the delicate choir of saintnazaire in carcassonne artists have a wellpreserved personalitycathedralbuilders none robert of luzarches who conceived the parthenon of all gothic architecture and the man who planned stately sens and the richness of canterbury are as unknown to us as the quarries from which the stones of their cathedrals were cut it is not the cathedral built by robert of luzarches belonging to amiens as it is the assumption by rubens belonging to antwerp it is scarcely the cathedral of its patron saint firmin it is the cathedral of amiens illustration the delicate choir of saintnazairecarcassonne we hear many learned disquisitions on the decay of the art of church building lack of time in our rushing age lack of patience decline of religious zeal or change in belief these are some of the popular reasons for this architectural degeneracy strange as it may seem none of these have had so powerful an influence as the invention of printing the first printingpress was made in the middle of the xv centuryafter the conception of the great cathedrals in an earlier age when the greatest could neither read nor write and manuscripts even in monasteries were rare sculpture and carving were the laymans books and cathedrals were not only places of worship they were the peoples religious libraries where literature was cut in stone in the north the most unique form of this literature was the drama of the breton calvaries which portrayed one subject and one onlythe life and passion of christ taken from prophecy tradition and the gospels cathedrals both north and south used the narrative form they told story after story and their makers showed an intimate knowledge of biblical lore that would do credit to the most ardent theological student at nmes by no means the richest church in carvings there are besides the last judgment and the reward of the evil and the righteouswhich even a superficial christian should knowmany of the stories of the book of genesis at arles there is the dream of jacob the dream of joseph the annunciation the nativity purification massacre of the innocents the flight into egypt almost a bible in stone in these days of books and haste few would take the trouble to study such sculptured tales but their importance to the unlettered people of the middle ages cannot be overestimated and the incentive to magnificence of artistic conception was correspondingly great the main era of cathedral building is the same all over france but with the general date all arbitrary parallel between north and south abruptly ends the north began the evolution of the gothic a new form indigenous to its soil the south continued the romanesque her evolution of a transplanted style and long knew no other she had grown accustomed to give northwardnot to receive and it was the reign of saint louis before she began to assimilate the architectural ideas of the isle de france and to build in the gothic style it was admiration for the newer ideals which led the builders of the south to change such of their plans as were not already carried out and to try with these foreign and beautiful additions to give to their churches the most perfect form they could conceive and thus from a web of fate in which as in all destinies is the spinning of many threads came the cathedrals and cloisters of the south are they greater than those of the north are they inferior to them it is best said comparison is idle who shall decide between the firtrees and the olivesbetween the beautiful order of a northern forest and the strange astounding luxuriance of the southern tangle which is the better choicethe welltold tale of the cathedrals of the north with their procession of kingly visitors or the almost untold story of the cathedrals of the south where history is still legend tradition romancethe story of fanatic fervour and still more fanatic hate illustration a cloister of the southelne ii architecture in provence languedoc and gascony no better place can be found than the mediterranean provinces to consider the origins of the earliest southern style here romanesque cathedrals arose in the midst of the vast ruins of imperial antiquity here they developed strange similarities to foreign styles domes suggesting the east greek motives recalling byzantium and details reminiscent of syria and here is the battlefield for that great army who decry or who defend roman influences some would have us believe that the romanesque dome is expatriated from the east others that it is naturalised others that it is native the plan of the romanesque dome differs very much from that of the byzantine yet the general conception seems eastern if conceivable in the oriental mind why not in that of the west and yet in spite of some native peculiarities of structure why should not the general idea have been imported who shall decide in a book such as this mooted questions which involve such multitudinous detail and such unprovable argument cannot be discussed it is unreasonable to doubt however that roman influences dominated the south herself a product of roman civilisation and as in the curious ineradicable tendency of the south toward heresy we more than suspect a subtle infiltration of greek and oriental perversions so in architecture it is logical to infer that mediterranean traders crusaders and perhaps adventurous architects who may have travelled in their wake brought rumours of the buildings of the east which were adopted with original or necessary modifications violletleduc in summing up this much discussed question has written that in the romanesque art of the west side by side with persistent latin traditions a byzantine influence is almost always found evidenced by the introduction of the cupola in the lamentable absence of records of the majority of cathedrals reasonings of origin must be inductive and more or less imaginative and have no legitimate place in the scope of a book which aims to describe the existing conditions and proven history of southern cathedrals illustration a romanesque aislearles quicherat who has had much to say upon architectural subjects defines the romanesque as an art which has ceased to be roman although it has much that is roman and that is not yet gothic although it already presages the gothic this is not a very helpful interpretation romanesque as it exists in france today is generally of earlier building than the gothic it is an older and far simpler style it was not a quick brilliant outburst like the gothic but a long and slow evolution and it has therefore deliberation and dignity not the spontaneity of northern creations strength and at times great vigour but not munificence not the lavishness of art and wealth and adornment of which the younger style was prodigal few generalisations are flawless but it may be truly said that romanesque cathedrals are lacking in splendour and it will be found in a large majority of cases that they are also without the impressiveness of great size that they are almost devoid of shapely windows or stained glass of notable carvings or richness of decorative detail their art is a simple art a sober art and in its nearest approach to opulencethe sculptured portals of sainttrophime of arles or saintgillesdelanguedocthere is still a reserved rather than an exuberant and uncontrolled display of wealth illustration the sculptured portals of sainttrophimearles by what simple superficial sign can this architecture be recognised by those who are to see it for the first time it exists everywhere and always in southern france but side by side with the encroachments and additions of other styles how can it be easily distinguished quicherat writes that the principal characteristic of the romanesque is la vote and the great rounded tunnel of the roofing is a distinction which will be found in no other form but the easiest of superficial distinctions is the archshape which in portal window vaulting or tympanum is round wherever the arcaded form is usedalways round with this suggestion of outline and the universal principles of the style simplicity and dignity and absence of great ornamentation the untechnical traveller may distinguish the romanesque of the south and if he be akin to the traveller who tells these cathedral tales the interest and fascination which the old architecture awakes will lead him to discover for himself the many differences which are evident between the ascetic strength of the one and the splendour and brilliance of the other sidenote provence illustration a gothic aislemende the three provinces which compose the south of france are provence languedoc and gascony and of these provence is architecturally and historically the first to claim our interest during the era of colonisation it was the most thoroughly romanised and in the early centuries of christianity the first to fall completely under the systematic organisation of the church it has a large group of very old cathedrals and is the best studyground for a general scrutiny and appreciation of that style which the builders of the south assimilated and developed until as it were they naturalised it and made it one of the two greatest forms of architectural expression provence does not contain the most impressive examples of romanesque two abbeys of the far norman north are more finished and harmonious representations of the art and languedoc in the basilica of saintsernin of toulouse has a nobler interior than any in the midi and many other churches of languedoc and gascony are most interesting examples of a style which belonged to them as truly as to provence yet it is in this province that the romanesque is best studied for here the great internecine strugglesboth political and religiousof the middle ages were not as devastating as in languedoc and gascony provence was a sunny land where sonnets flourished more luxuriantly than did holy inquisition her churches have therefore been preserved in their original form in greater numbers than those of the two other provinces they are of all types of romanesque all stages of its growth from the small and simple cathedrals which were built when ecclesiastical exchequers were not overflowing to the greater ones which illustrate very advanced and dignified phases of architectural development and as a whole they exhibit the normal proportion of failure and success in an effort toward an ideal sidenote languedoc lon renier the learned lecturer of the collge de france says it is remarkable that the changes the elaborations the modifications of the architecture given by rome to all countries under her domination were conceived in the provinces long before they were reproduced in italy rome gave no longer she received a transfusion of a new blood more vital and more rich in languedoc the greater number of monuments of this ancient architecture have been destroyed and those of their outgrowth the later romanesque were so repeatedly mutilated that the cathedrals of this province present even a greater confusion of originalities restorations and additions than those of provence to a multitude of dates must be added corresponding differences in style each school of architecture naturally considered that it had somewhat of a monopoly of good taste and beauty or at least that it was an improvement on the manner which preceded it and it would have been too much to expect in ages when anachronisms were unrecognised that churches should have been restored in their consonant original style architects of the gothic period were unable to resist the temptation of continuing a romanesque nave with a choir of their own school and builders of the xviii century went still further and added a showy louis xv faade to a modest romanesque cathedral some churches built in times of religious storm and stress show the preoccupation of their patrons or the lack of talent of their constructors others belong to bishoprics that were much more lately constituted than the sees of provence and in these cases the new prelate chose a church already begun or completed and compromised with the demands of episcopal pomp by an addition usually of different style the numerous changes political and religious of the medivalism of languedoc had such considerable and diverse influence on the architecture of the province that it is not possible as in provence to trace an uninterrupted evolution of one style the languedocian is generally a later builder than the provenal he is bolder having the romanesque and the gothic as choice he chose at will and seemingly at random he had spontaneity enthusiasm verve and when no accepted model pleased his taste he recreated after his own liking languedoc has therefore a delightful quality that is wanting in provence and in her greater cathedrals there is often an originality that is due to genius rather than to eccentricity there is delicate gothic at carcassonne lofty gothic at narbonne sainteccile of albi is fortified gothic built in brick the interior of saintsernin of toulouse is an apotheosis of the austere romanesque and saintetienne of agde is a gratifying type of the maritime church of the midi illustration corresponding differences in stylecarcassonne this cathedral of the sea is a fitting example of a peculiar type of architecture which exists also in provencea succession of fortresschurches that extend along the mediterranean from spain to italy like the peaks of a mountain chain nothing can better illustrate the continuous warrings and raidings in the south of france than these strange churches and their many fortified counterparts inland in both languedoc and gascony castles and walled towns were not sufficient to protect the southerner from invasions and incursions his churches and cathedrals even to the xiv century were strongholds more suitable for menatarms than for priests and seemingly dedicated to some wargod rather than to the gentle virgin mother and the martyrsaints under whose protection they nominally dwelt although most interesting the military church of the interior is seldom the bishops church the maritime church on the contrary is nearly always a cathedral with strangely curious legends and episodes the french coast of the mediterranean was the scene of continuous pillage huns normans moors saracens unknown pirates and freebooters of all nationalities found it very lucrative and convenient to descend on a seaboard town and escape as they had come easily their boats loaded with booty as late as the xii century writes barr ferree buccaneers gained a livelihood by preying on the peaceful and unoffending inhabitants of the villages and cities the cathedrals as the most important buildings and the most conspicuous were strongly fortified both to protect their contents and to serve as strongholds for the citizens in case of need in these churches therefore architecture assumed its most utilitarian form and buildings are real fortifications with battlemented walls strong and heavy towers and small windows and are provided with the other devices of romanesque architecture of a purely military type illustration fortified gothic built in brickalbi time has dealt hardly with them the kingly power being entrenched in paris developed from the isle de france the wealth that once enriched the fertile lands of the south moved northwards and the great commercial cities of the north became the most important centres of activity then the southern towns began to decline and the buildings which remain to represent most perfectly the churchfortress are not those of provence which are patched and restored but those of languedoc agde and maguelonne and elne of the nearby country of rousillon illustration a church fortressmaguelonne sidenote gascony gascony the last of the southern provinces and the farthest from rome had great prosperity under imperial dominion many patricians emigrated there roads were built commerce flourished and as in provence and languedoc towns grew into large and wellestablished cities christianity made a comparatively early conquest of the province and at the beginning of the iv century eleven suffragan bishoprics had been established under the archbishopric of eauze gascony has many old cathedral cities and has had many ancient cathedrals but after the fall of the roman empire in the v century a series of wars began which destroyed not only the christian architecture but almost every trace of roman wealth and culture little towers remain supposed shrines of mercury protector of commerce and travel pieces of statues are found but the temples the amphitheatres the forums have disappeared and even more completely the rude christian churches of that early period although the province has no mediterranean coast and could not be molested by the marauders of that busy sea it lay directly upon the route of armies between france and spain and it is no gasconading to say that it was for centuries one of the greatest battlefields of the south vandals visigoths franks saracens normansgascons against carlovingians north against south all had burned raided and destroyed gascony before the xi century it is not surprising then that there are found fewer traces of antiquity here than in provence and languedoc even the few names of decimated cities which survived designated towns on new sites eauze formerly on the glise lay long in ruins and was finally rebuilt a kilometre inland lectoure and auch had long since retired from the river gers and taken refuge on the hills of their present situations while other cities fell into complete ruin and forgetfulness illustration stately gothic splendourcondom the year 1000 which followed these events was that of the predicted and expected end of the world the extravagances of christians at that time are well known the gifts of all property that were made to the church the abandonment of worldly pursuits the terrors of many the anxiety of the calmest the emotional excesses which led people to live in trees that they might be near to heaven when the great trump should soundmundi fine appropinquante but the trumpet did not sound and raoul glaber a monk of the xi century writes that all over italy and the gaul of his day there was great haste to restore and rebuild churches a general rivalry between towns and between countries as to which could build most remarkably this activity says quicherat may show a desire to renew alliance with the creator it certainly proves that the generation of the year 1000 had fresh and new architectural ideas this was the period of recuperation and rebuilding for gascony the monks of the viii ix and x centuries had devoted themselves with zeal and success to the cultivation of the soil they had acquired fertile fields and desiring peace they had placed themselves in positions where their strength would defend them when their holy calling was not respected these monasteries were places of refuge and soon gave their name and their protection to the towns and villages which began to cluster about them except the declining settlements of roman days gascony had few towns in the x century and many of her most important cities of today owe their foundation their existence and their prosperity to these benedictine monasteries eauze regained its life after the establishment of a convent and in the xi xii and xiii centuries the abbots of cteaux bishops and even lords of the laity occupied themselves in the creation of new cities many of the towns of medival creation possessed broad municipal and commercial privileges they grew to the importance of communes and bishoprics and some even styled themselves republics although these were times of much rebuilding restoring and carrying out of older plans of ecclesiastical architecture the xi and xii centuries were none the less filled with innumerable private wars and in 1167 began the bloody and persistent struggle with england the city of aire was at one time reduced to twelve inhabitants and the horrors of the medival siege were more than once repeated in these wars cathedrals as well as towns and their inhabitants were scarred and wounded hardly had these dissensions ended in 1494 when the wars of religion commenced under charles ix and gascony was again one of the most terrible fields of battle here the demoniac enthusiasm of both sides exceeded even the terrible exhibitions of languedoc the royal family of navarre was openly protestant and contributed more than any others to the military organisations of their faith jeanne dalbret in 1566 wishing to repay intolerance with intolerance forbade religious processions and church funerals in navarre the people rose and the next year the queen was forced to grant toleration to both religions later the king of france entered the field and sent an army against the barnaise huguenots jeanne in reprisal called to her aid montmorency and with a thoroughness born of pious zeal and hatred each army began to burn and kill all monasteries all churches were looted by the protestants all cities taken by montluc head of the catholics were sacked tarbes was devastated by the one rabestans by the other and the cathedral of pamiers was ruined with the massacre of saint bartholomew in 1572 the struggle began again and the league flourished in all its malign enthusiasm such disorder as was introduced says a writer of the period such pillage has never been seen since war began officers soldiers followers and volunteers were so overburdened with booty as to be incommoded thereby and after this brigandage the peasants hereabouts bigorre abandoned their very farms from lack of cattle and the greater number went into spain during long centuries of such religious and political devastation the architectural energy of gascony was expended in replacing churches which had been destroyed and were again to be destroyed or injured it would be unfair to expect of this province the great magnificence which its brave cheerful and extravagant little people believe it once possessed or to look amid such unrest for the calm growth of any architectural style it is a country of few cathedrals of curious churches built for war and prayer and of such occasional outbursts of magnificence as is seen in the romanesque portal of saintpierre of moissac and in the stately gothic splendour of the cathedrals at condom and at bayonne it is a country where cathedrals are surrounded by the most beautiful of landscapes and where each has some legend or story of the english the league of the black prince or the lionhearted of henry iv still adored or of simon de montfort still execrated where the towns are truly historic and the mountains truly grand provence i the cathedrals of the sea sidenote marseilles perhaps a phoenician settlement certainly a carthaginian mart later a grecian city and in the final years of the pagan era possessed by the romans no city of france has had more diverse influences of antique civilisation than marseilles none responded more proudly to its ancient opportunities and not only was it commercially wealthy and renowned but so rich in schools that it was called another a new athens it was also the port of an adventurous people who founded nice antibes la ciotat and agde and explored a part of africa and northern europe and at the fall of the roman empire it became by very virtue of its riches and safe harbour the envy and the prey of a succession of barbaric and infidel invaders in the middle ages it had all the vicissitudes of wars and sieges to which a great city could be subjected it had a viscount and from very early days a bishop it was at one time part of the kingdom of arles and later it recognised the suzerainty of the counts of provence when these lords were warring or crusading it took advantage of their absence or their troubles and governed itself through its consuls became a provenal republic after the type of the italian cities and other towns of the mediterranean country treated with the italian republics on terms of perfect equality and although finally annexed to france by the wily louis of the madonnas its people were continually haunted by memories of their former independence and not only struggled for municipal rights and liberties but took sides for or against the most powerful monarchs of continental history as if they had been a resourceful country rather than a city it succored the league defied henry iv and richelieu and treating kings in trouble as cavalierly as declining counts marseilles tried at the death of henry iii to secede from france and recover its autonomy under a consul charles de cazaulx promptly defeated it still continued to think independently and struggle as best it might for freedom of administration and although from the time of pompey to that of louis xiv it has had an ineradicable tendency to stand against the government it has survived the results of all its contumacies its plagues wars and sieges and the destructiveness of its phase of the revolution when it had a terror of its own notwithstanding modern rivals in the mediterranean marseilles is today one of the largest and most prosperous of french cities built in amphitheatre around the bay it is beautiful in general view its streets bustle with commercial activity and its vast docks swarm with workmen the storms of the past have gone over marseilles as the storms of nature over its sea have been as passionate and have left as little trace instead of temples forum and arena there are the palais de longchamps the palais de justice and the christian arch of triumph instead of the muddy and unhealthy alleyways of medivalism there are broad streets and wide boulevards and in spite of its antiquity marseilles is a city of today in monuments aspect spirit and even in class distinction here writes edmond about are only two categories of people those who have made a fortune and those who are trying to make one and the principal inhabitants are parvenus in the most honourable sense of the word illustration entrevaux people gather around the mailcoach as it makes its daily halt before the drawbridge illustration the new cathedralmarseilles in the most honourable sense of the word the cathedral of marseilles is also typical of the city parvenue its first stone was placed by prince louis napoleon in 1852 and as the modern has overgrown the classic and medival greatness of marseilles so the new majeure has eclipsed if it has not yet entirely replaced the old cathedral and except the stern abbeychurch of saintvictor an almost solitary relic of true medival greatness it is the finest church of the city the new cathedral and the old stand side by side the one strong and whole the other partly torn down scarred and maimed as a veteran who has survived many wars even in its ruin it is an interesting type of the maritime provenal church but so pitiably overshadowed by its successor that the charm of its situation is quite lost and few will linger to study its three small naves the defaced fresco of the dome or even the little chapel of saintlazare all white marble and carving and small statues scarcely more than a shallow niche in the wall but daintily proportioned and a charming creation of the renaissance fewer still of those who pause to study what remains of the old majeure will stay to reconstruct it as it used to be and realise that it had its day of glory no less real than that of the new church which replaces it in its stead saintmartins and saintcannats sometimes called the preachers have been temporarily used for the bishops services but now that the greater church the assumption of the blessed virgin mary has been practically completed it has assumed once and for all the greater rank and a cathedral of marseilles still stands on its terrace in full view of the sea tradition has it that a temple of baal once stood on this site and later a temple to diana that lazarus came in the i century converted the pagan marseillais and built a christian cathedral here a more critical tradition says that saint victor first came as missionary bishop and builder all these vague memories of conversion more or less accurate all the legends of an humble and struggling christianity seem buried by this huge modern mass it is not a church struggling and militant but the church established and triumphant it is a vast building over four hundred and fifty feet long preceded by two domed towers its transepts are surmounted at the crossing by a huge dome whose circumference is nearly two hundred feet a smaller one over each transept arm and others above the apsidal chapels the exterior is built with alternate layers of green florentine stone and the white stone of fontvieille and the style of the church variously called french romanesque byzantine and neobyzantine is very oriental in its general effect an arcade between the two towers forms a porch the entrance to the interior whose central nave stretches out in great spaciousness the lateral naves in contrast are exceedingly narrow and have high galleries supported by large monolithic columns these naves are prolonged into an ambulatory each of whose chapels in consonance with the cathedrals colossal proportions is as large as many a church the building stone of the interior is grey and pink with white marble used decoratively for capitals and bases and these combinations of tints which would seem almost too delicate too effeminate for so large a building are made rich and effective by their very mass the gigantic sizes which the plan exacts all that artistic conception could produce has been added to complete an interior that is entirely oriental in its luxury of ornamentation halforiental in style and without that sober majesty which is an inherent characteristic of the most elaborate styles native to western christianity under the gilded dome is a rich baldaquined high altar and through the whole church there is a magnificence of mosaics of mural paintings and of stained glass that is sumptuous mosaics line the arches of the nave and the pendentives and form the flooring and in the midst of this richness of colour the grey pillars rise one after the other in long shadowy perspective like the trees of a stately grove in planning this new provenal cathedral its architects did not attempt to reproduce either exactly or in greater perfection any maritime type which its situation on the mediterranean might have suggested nor were they inspired by any of the models of the native style and perhaps to the captious mind its most serious defect is that its building has destroyed not only an actual portion of the old majeure but an historic interest which might well have been preserved by a wise restoration or an harmonious rebuilding and yet with the large palace of the archbishop on the port de la joliette nearby the statue of a devoted and loving bishop in the open square and the majestic cathedral of saintemariemajeure itself the episcopacy of marseilles has all the outward and visible signs of strength and glory and power sidenote toulon toulon although a foundation of the romans owes its rank today to henry iv to richelieu and to louis xivs busy architect vauban it is the gibraltar of france a bright bustling modern city saintemariemajeure one of its oldest ecclesiastical names is a title which belonged to churches of both the xi and xii centuries but in the feats of architectural gymnastics to which their remains have been subjected and in the wars and vicissitudes of provence these buildings have long since disappeared a few stones still exist of the xi century structure void of form or architectural significance and the ancient name of saintemariemajeure now protects a cathedral built in the most depressing style of the industrious philistines of the xvii and xviii centuries it is not a provenal nor a truly maritime church it is not a fortress nor a defence nor a work of any architectural beauty it has blatancy size pretensiona profusion of rich incongruities and although religiously interesting from its chapels and shrines it is architecturally obtrusive and monstrous the vagaries of the architects who began in 1634 to construct the present edifice are well illustrated in the changes of plan to which they subjected this unfortunate church the length became the breadth the isolated chapel of the virgin part of the main building the choir another chapel and the high altar was removed from the eastern to the northern end where a new choir had been built for its reception this confusion of plan was carried out with logical confusion of style and detail the faade has corinthian columns of the xvii century the nave is said to be transition gothic the choir is decorated with mural paintings and the high altar a work of rvoil adds to the banalities of the xvii and xviii centuries a rich incongruity of which the xix has no reason to be proud the whole interior is so full of naves of unequal length and radiating chapels of arches of differing forms tastes and styles that it defies concise description and is unworthy of serious consideration provence has modest cathedrals of small architectural significance but except sainterparate of nice it has none so chaotic and commonplace as saintemariemajeure of toulon sidenote frjus frjus which claims to be the oldest city in france was one of the numerous trading ports of the phoenician and later during the period of her civic grandeur an arsenal of the roman navy her most interesting ruins are the coliseum the theatre the old citadel and the aqueduct suggestions of a really great city of the longgone past frjus lost prestige with the decadence of the empire and after a destruction by the saracens in the x century nature gave the blow which finally crushed her when the sea retreated a mile and her old roman lighthouse was left to overlook merely a long stretch of barren sandy land owing to this stranded inland position she has escaped both the dignity of a modern seaport and the prostitution of a rivieran resort and is a little dead city the seat of an ancient provenal cathedral of the sea this cathedral is largely free from xvii and xviii century disfigurements and the pity is that having escaped this a french churchs imminent peril it should have become so built around that the character of the exterior is almost lost the faade is severely plain an uninteresting rebuilding of 1823 but the carved wood of its portals is beautiful the towers as in other maritime cathedrals of provence recall the perils and dangers of their days and these towers of frjus although none the less practically defensive have a more churchly appearance than those of antibes grasse and vence over the vestibuled entrance rises the western tower its heavy rectangular base is the support of a superstructure which was replaced in the xvi century by one more in keeping with conventional ecclesiastical models then the windows of the base whose rounded arches are still traceable were walled in and the new octagonal stage with high windows of its own was completed by a tilecovered spire the more interesting tower is that which surmounts the apse this was the lookout facing the sea the really vital defence of the church its upper room was a storage place for arms and ammunition and on the side which faces the city was open with a broad pointed arch above the tower ends in machiolated battlements and presents a very strong and stern front seaward perhaps no stronger but more artistic and grim than towers of other provenal cathedrals the entrance of the church is curiously complicated to the left is the little baptistery directly before one a narrow stairway which leads to the cloister and on the right a lowarched vestibule which opens into the nave of the cathedral the interior of saintetienne is dark and somewhat gloomy but that is an inherent trait of a fortresschurch for every added inch of windowopening brought an ell of danger the nave is unusually low and broad and its buttressed piers are of immense weight ending severely in a plain moulded band on these great piers rest the crossvaults of the roof and the broad arches of the wall the north aisle disproportionately narrow is a later addition behind the altar is a true provenal apse shallow and rectangular and beyond its rounded roof opens the smaller halfdome architecturally this is an interesting interior but the traveller who has not time to spend in musings will fail to see it in its original intentioncold severely plain heavy with perhaps too many archlines but sober and simple a futile wooden wainscot now surrounds the church and breaks its wall space liberal coats of whitewash conceal the building material and taking from the church the severity of its stone give it an appearance of poor deprecatory bareness illustration the desecration of the little cloisterfrjus near the entrance of the cathedral is its most ancient portion the baptistery formerly a building apart but now an integral part of the church itself it is perhaps the most interesting christian monument in frjus a reminder of those early centuries when in france as in italy the little baptistery was the popular form of christian architectural expression here it has the very usual octagonal shape the arches are upheld by grayish columns of granite with capitals of white marble and in the centre stands the font between the columns are small recesses alternately rectangular and semidomed and above all is a modern dome and lantern structurally interesting and reminiscent of the stately baptistery of aix the effect of this little chamber like the churchs interior is marred by the whitewashes from whose industrious brushes nothing but the grayish columns have escaped and here again the traveller who would see the builders work free from the disfigurements of time must pause and imagine yet even imagination seems powerless before the desecration of the little cloister charming it must have been to have entered its quiet walks with their slender columns of white marble to have seen the quaint old well in the little sunlit close now between the slender columns boards have been placed which shut out light and sun the traveller sat down on an old wheelbarrow waiting till he could see in the dim and misty light all around him was forgetfulness of the cloisters holy uses signs of desecration and neglect one end of the cloisterwalk was a thoroughfare where the wheelbarrow had worn its weary way and even in the deserted corners there was the dust and dirt of a workaday world the beautiful little capitals of the slender columns rose from among the boards clipped and worn above he dimly saw the curious wooden ceiling which would seem to have taken the place of the usual stone vaulting through chinks of the plankwall he caught glimpses of a little close and at length having seen the most melancholy of cathedrals of the sea in its disguise of whitewash decay and misuse he went his way sidenote antibes that part of the southern coast of france called the riviera seems now only to evoke visions of the most beautiful banality of a life more artificial than the stagewhich at least aims to present realitytransplanted to a scene of such incomparable loveliness that nature herself adds a new and exquisite sumptuousness to the luxury of civilisation the riviera means a land of many follies and every viceeach folly so delicious each vice so regal they seem to be sought and desired of all men where else can be seen in such careless magnificence dukes of russia with their polish of manner and their veiled insolence englishmen correct and blas americans a bit vociferous and truly amused great ladies of all ages and manners adventurers high and low and the beautiful sparkling women of no name bravely dressed and barbarously jewelled such is the riviera of today the life imposed upon it by hordes of foreign idlers in a land whose warmth and luxuriance may have lent itself but too easily to the vicious and frivolous pleasures for which they have made it notorious but a land which has no native history that is effeminate nor any so unworthy as its exotic present the riviera may be nice beaulieu and their like but the provenal mediterranean and its neighbouring territory have been the fatherland of warriors in real mail and of princes of real power of the emperor pertinax of pagan times of those who fought successfully against mahmoud and tergament and of many knights of malta long the forlorn hope of christendom discreetly hidden from vulgar eyes that delight in the architecture of the modern caravanserai are the ruins of these older daysamphitheatres fountains temples and aqueducts of the romans the castles abbeys and cathedrals of medival times here are the larger number if not the most interesting of those curious churches of the sea which protected the french townsman of the mediterranean coast from the rapacity of searovers and pirates and many more orthodox enemies of the middle ages from the great beauty of its situation the small city of antibes is at once a type of the old rgime and of the new lying on the sea with a background of snowcapped mountains it has not entirely escaped the fate of nice neither has it yet lost all its old provenal characteristics it is a pathetic compromise between the quaint reality of the old and the blatancy of the new the little parish church is of the very far past having lost its cathedral rank over six hundred years ago to saintemarie in grasse a town scarcely younger than its own it is the type of the church of this coast with its unpretentious smallness its strength and its disfiguring restorations and it is especially in comparison with vence and grasse of small architectural interest the faade and the double archway which connects the church and the tower are of the unfortunate xviii century the older exterior is monotonous and the interior an unpleasing confusion of forms illustration the military omenthe tower antibes the real interest of the little cathedral is its ancient military strength neither very grand nor very imposing but very real to the enemy who hundreds of years ago hurled himself against the hard plain stones from this viewpoint the mannered faade and the inharmonious interior matter but little toward the foe whose sail might have arisen on the horizon at any moment the protecting church presented the heavy rounded walls and safely narrowed windows of its three apses and behind them the military omen of the severe rectangular tower high in every one of its four sides seaward and landward was a window from which many a watcher must have looked and strained anxious eyes this is the significance of the little seaside cathedral this the story its tower suggests and now when the sea is sailed by peaceful ships and the cathedral only a place of pious worship the tower with its gaping windows is the only salient reminder of the ancient dignity of the church the reminder to an indifferent generation of the days when antibes fulfilled to christians the promise of her old pagan name antipolis sentinel of the perilous sea sidenote nice the situation of its cathedral reveals a nice of which but little is written the city of a people who live in the service of those whose showy new villas and hotels stretch along the promenades and lie dotted on the hills in the nice of all the world besides this exotic city there is the nice of the niois a small district of dark crowded streets that are too full of the sordid struggles of competing workpeople to be truly picturesque here in the xvi century when the citadel of nice was enlarged and the cathedral of saintemariedelassomption destroyed the church of sainterparate was rebuilt and succeeded to the episcopal rank standing on a little open square surrounded by small shops and the poor homes of tradesfolk it seems in every sense a church of the people here the native niois gay industrious mercurial and dispossessed of his town may feel truly at home finished in the most exuberant rococo style it is an edifice from which all architectural or religious inspiration is conspicuously absent it is a revel of luxurious bad taste a cathedral in provence a cathedral by the sea but neither provenal nor maritimerather a product of that italian taste which has so profoundly vitiated both the morals and the architecture of all the riviera ii cathedrals of the hilltowns sidenote carpentras carpentras is a busy provincial town the terminus of three diminutive railroads and of many little lumbering dustcovered stages it stands high on a hill and from the boulevards dusty promenades under luxuriant shadetrees which circle the town as its walls formerly did there is an extended view over the pretty hills and valleys of the neighbouring country at one end of the town the hospital rises an immense bare and imposing edifice of the xviii century built by a trappist bishop and at the other is the orange gate the last tower of the old fortifications between these historic buildings and the encircling boulevards are the narrow streets and irregular uninteresting buildings of the city itself it is strange indeed that so isolated a place which seems only a big bustling countrytown should have been of importance in the middle ages and that bits of its stirring history must have caused all orthodox europe to thrill with horror stranger still would be the forgetfulness of modern writers by whom carpentras is seldom mentioned were it not that the citys real history is that of the church political a story of strange manners and happenings rather than a step in the vital evolution towards our own time in the middle ages carpentras was an episcopal city the capital of the county venaissin governed by wealthy powerful and ambitious bishops who took no small interest in worldly aggrandisement passing by gift to the papacy after the sudden death of clement v it was selected as the place of the conclave which was to elect his successor the members were assembled in the great episcopal palace when bertrand de goth a nephew of the dead pope claiming to be an ally of the french prelates against the italians in the conclave arrived from a successful looting of the papal treasury at montreux to pillage in carpentras he and his mercenaries massacred the citizens and burned the cathedral the episcopal palace caught fire and their eminencesin danger of their liveswere forced to squeeze their sacred persons through a hole which their followers made in the palace wall and fly northward this unfortunate raid left carpentras with many ruins and a demolished cathedral deserted by those in whose cause she had unwittingly suffered the new pontiff was safely elected in lyons and upon his return to the papal seat of avignon he administered carpentras by a rector and it continued as it had been before the political capital of the county during the reigns of succeeding popes it was apparently undisturbed by dangerous honours until the accession of the antipope benedict xiii so great was this prelates delight in the city that he reserved to himself the minor title of her bishop rebuilt her walls and was the first patron of the present and very orthodox cathedral saintsiffrein by a curious destiny the church had this false prelate not only as its first patron but as its first active supporter and in 1404 he sent artaud archbishop of arles in his name to lay its first stone wars and rumours of wars soon possessed the province benedict fled and through unrest and lack of money the work of cathedral building was greatly hindered in the meantime the ruins of the former cathedral seem to have been gradually disintegrating and in 1829 the last of its cloister was destroyed to be replaced by prison cells and now only the choir dome and a suggestion of the nave exist partly forming the present sacristy from these meagre remains and from writings of the time it may be fairly inferred that saintpierre was a cathedral of the type of avignon and cavaillon and the old marseillaise church of la majeure and that architecturally considered it was a far more important structure than saintsiffrein with this depressing knowledge in mind the traveller was confronted with a sight as depressingthe present cathedral itself fortunately churches of a period antedating the xvii century are seldom so uninteresting nothing more meagre nor dreary can be conceived than the faade with its three poor characterless portals they open on a large vaulted hall with chapels in its six bays and a small and narrow choir the principal charm of the interior is negative its dim misty light by concealing a mass of tasteless decorations and the poverty and bareness of the whole architectural scheme gives to the generous height and size of the room an atmosphere of subdued and mysterious spaciousness the south door is the one bit of this gothic which passes the commonplace set in a poor plain wall the portal has a graceful symmetry of design and its few carved details probably limited by the artistic power of its builder are so simple and chaste that they do not inevitably suggest poverty of conception the tympanum holds an exotic detail a defaced and insignificant fresco of the coronation of the virgin and on the pier which divides the doorway stands a very charming statue of our lady of snows blessing those who enter beneath her outstretched hands this simple portal and indeed the whole church is a significant example of provenal gothic a style so foreign to the genius of the province that it could produce only feeble and attenuated examples of the art compared with its northern prototypes it is surprisingly tentative and awkward unaccustomed hands seem to have built it after most primitive conceptions sidenote digne well outside the alpine city of digne and almost surrounded by graves stands a small and ancient church which is seldom opened except for the celebration of masses for the dead coffinrests stand always before the altar and enough chairs for the few that mourn there are old candlesticks for the tapers of the churchs poor and hidden in the shadows of the doors a few broken crosses that once marked graves placed tenderly perhaps above those who were alive some years ago and who now rest forgotten on battered wood one can still read a babys age an old mans record and the letters r i p in this strange melancholy destiny of notredamedubourg there seems to be a peculiar fitness the mutability of time forgetfulness and at length neglect which death suggests are brought to mind by this old church once the cathedral of digne but no longer cathedral it stands almost alone in spite of its honours and its venerable age after the desecration by the huguenots its episcopal birthright was given to a younger and a larger church the city has moved away and clusters about its new cathedral saintjrome and notredamedubourg is no longer on a busy street but near the dusty highroad amid the quiet of the country and the hills parts of its crypt and tower may antedate 900 but the church itself was rebuilt in the xii and xiii centuries the course of time has brought none of the incongruities which have ruined many churches by the socalled restorations of the last three hundred years and although its simple romanesque is sadly unrepaired it is a delight to come into the solitude and find an unspoiled example of this stanch old style illustration the interior of notredamedubourgdigne the romanesque shows forth its great solidity in the exterior of its churches and nowhere more than in dignes deserted cathedral flat buttresses line the walls the transepts are square and plain and on either side the faade wall is upheld by a formidable support this severity of line is not greatly modified by the deep recesses of a few windows nor is the towerwhich lost its spire three hundred years agoof less sober construction less solidly built below the overhanging eaves of a miserable roof and the curious line of the nave vault which projects through the wall is a round window with a frame of massive rolls and hollows and below this again under a narrow sloping covering is the deep arch of the cathedrals porch this in its prime must have been the churchs ornamental glory beneath the outer arch which is continued to the buttresses by halfarches are the great rollmouldings that twist backward to a plain tympanum capitals still support these massive curves of stone but the niches in which the columns formerly stood are empty and grinning lions lying on the ground no longer support the larger columns of the plain arch all stands in solemn decay the traveller entered a battered brassnailed door and saw before him the stretch of a single empty nave a choir beneath whose lower vault are three small windows and on either side the archways which he knew must lead to narrow transepts in the south side plain rounded windows give a glimmering light and over each projects an arch the modest decoration of the walls far above rises the tunnelvault whose sheer height is grandly dignified the arches rest on roughly carved capitals and the outer rectangle of the piers is displaced for half a column the rehearsal of these most simple details seems but the writing of the letter which killeth and not the portrayal of the spirit that seems to live within these walls details which seem so poorly few when read are nobly so when seen this small old church has a true religious stateliness and it seemed as if a priest should bring the sanctuarylight which says the lord is in his holy temple saintjrome was built between 1490 and 1500 a hundred years before its episcopal elevation and forms a most complete antithesis to notredamedubourg which it supplanted in 1591 where notredame is small saintjrome is large where the old church is simple the newer one is either pretentious or sumptuous and where the one is romanesque the other is gothic the present cathedral stands on the heights of the city and from one side or another its clean straight walls can be seen in all their large angularity and absence of architectural significance towers rise conventionally above the faade and a big broad flight of white stone steps leads to three modern portals that have been built in an economical imitation of the sculptured richness of the xiii century the interior also gothic has neither clerestory nor triforium and its naves are covered by a vaulting which springs broadly from the round supporting piers the conception is not noble it has no simplicity and no more of spiritual suggestion than a madonna of titian but the space of the nave is so largely generous and the new polychrome so richly toned that the church has majesty of space and harmony deep lights and subdued colourings it is large and sumptuous with the munificence of a veronese canvas a singular and most curious contrast to the cold severity of its outer walls illustration the interior has neither clerestory nor triforiumdigne before the high altar of this church lies buried one whose spirit suggests the christ a bishop yet a simple priest whose life deserves more words than does the whole of saintjrome once his cathedralchurch he was a cur of brignoles one of those keen yet simplehearted and hardworking priests who often bless provenal towns he had no great ambitions no patronage no ties except a faroff brother who was an upstart general of that most upstart emperor napoleon one day while the priest was pottering in his little gardenas provenal curs love to dig and worka letter was handed him marked thirty sous of postage due he was outraged his shining old soutane fell from the folds in which he had prudently tucked it he shrugged his shoulders and protesteda great expense indeed for a trivial purpose where should he find another thirty sous for his poor he never wrote letters therefore by no argument of any school of logic could he be compelled to receive them obviously this was not for him the unexpected letter was one for which his brother had asked and which napoleon had signed a decree which made him bishop long afterwards this simple saintly prelate saved a man from crime and history relates that this same man died at waterloo as a good and faithful soldier fighting for the fatherland his benefactor that loyal servant of christ and his church soon followed him in death and unlike many a saint whom this earth forgets his memory lives on not only in the little city of the snowclad alps but in the hearts of those who read of his good deeds for monseigneur miollis of digne is truly monseigneur bienvenu of les misrables and only the soldier of waterloo was glorified in jean valjean sidenote forcalquier if it is difficult to picture sleepy stately aix as one of the most brilliant centres of medival europe and the garrisoned castle of tarascon filled with the gay courtiers and fair ladies of king rens court it will be almost impossible to walk in the smaller provenal cities and see in imagination the cavalcades of mailed soldiers who clattered through the streets on their way to the castle of some nearby hilltop my lord proudly distinguishable by his mount or the length of his plume a delicate countess languishing between the curtains of her litter or a more sprightly one who rode her palfrey and smiled on the staring townsfolk it is almost impossible to conceive that the four daughters of raymond brenger a queen of the romans of france of naples and of england were brought up in the castle of the little hillside hamlet of saintmaime dauphin provence is quiet rural provincial a land of markets busy country inns and farms not of modern greatness nor of modern renown its children are a fine and busy race no less strong and fine than in the lands more stirring times but they live their years of greatness in other more progressive parts of france and the provenal genius which remains very native to the soil is broadly known to fame as french like some rich old wine hidden in the cellars of the few provence lies safely ensconced behind avignon and arles and only the epicures of history penetrate her hills her medival ruins seem to belong to a past almost as dead and ghostly as her roman days and to realise her middle ages one must leave the busy people in the town below climb one of the hills and sitting beside the crumbling walls of some great tower or castle watch the hot sun setting behind the low mountains and lighting in a glow the bare walls of some other ruined stronghold on a neighbouring height the shadows creep into the valleys the rocks grow grey and cold and the clusters of trees beside them become darkly mysterious then far beneath a white thread seems to appear beginning at the valleys entrance and twisting along its length until it disappears behind another hill this is the road and by the time the eye has followed its long course daylight has grown fainter then provence takes on a longlost splendour to those who care to see cavalcades of soldiers or of hunters come home along the road castles become whole and frowning the dying sun casts its light through their gaping windowholes as light of nightly revels used to shine and a phantom medivalism appears one of the powerful families of the country the counts of forcalquier sprang from the house of brenger in the xi century and a hundred and fifty years later grown too great were crushed by the haughty parent house more than one hill of eastern provence has borne their tall watchtowers more than one village owed them allegiance and a large town in the hills was their capital and bore their name and yet not a ruined tower that overlooks the provenal mountains not a village gate or castlemanosque or old saintmaimebut speaks more vividly of the old counts than does forcalquier formerly their city now a mere country town which has lost prestige with its increasing isolation many of its inhabitants by plagues and wars and almost all of its picturesque medivalism through the destructiveness of sieges long before this day of contented stagnancy in 1061 when forcalquier fortified growing and important claimed many honours bishop grard caprrius of sisteron had given the city a provost and a chapter and created the church of saintmary cocathedral with that of notredame of sisteron not contented with this honour forcalquier demanded and received a bishopric of her own her hill was then crowned by a citadel her cathedral stood nearby her walls were intact now the citadel is replaced by a peaceful pilgrims chapel the walls are gone saintmary ruined in the siege of 1486 is recalled only by a few weedcovered stumps and bits of wall and its title was given to notredame in the lower part of the town no cathedral is a sadder example of architectural failure than notredame of forcalquier because it has so many of the beginnings of real beauty and dignity so many parts of real worthiness that have been unfortunately combined in a confused and discordant whole if of all little cities of provence forcalquier is one of the least unique and least holding its cathedral is also one of the least satisfying it is not beautiful in situation nor in its own essential harmony and the fine but tantalising perspectives of its interior may be found again in happier churches the exterior shows to a superlative degree that general tendency of provenal exteriors to be without definite or logical proportions a large square tower heavier than that of grasse served as a lookout a tall thin little turret served as a belfry in the faade there is a gothic portal which notwithstanding its entire mediocrity is the chief adornment of the outer walls they are irregular and uncouth to a degree and their only interesting features are at the eastern end here the smaller older apses on either side betray the churchs early origin the central apse evidently of the same dimensions as the romanesque one originally designed was rebuilt in severe rudimentary gothic looking at this shallow apse alone and following its plain lines until they meet those of the big tower there is a straight simplicity that is almost finebut this is one mere detail in a large and barren whole and the cathedralseeker turns to the nearest entrance illustration a large square tower served as a lookoutforcalquier illustration a suggestive view from the side aisleforcalquier the first glimpse of the interior is so relieving that one is not quick to notice its lack of architectural unity the few windows give a soft light and the brown of the stone has a mellowness that is both rich and reposeful if the cathedral could have been finished in the style of the first bays of the nave it would have been a nobly dignified example of the romanesque could it have been rebuilt in the slender gothic of the last bay it would have been an exquisite example of provenal gothic rather largely planned its old form of tunnel vaulting and the fine curve of its nave arches and heavy piers are in violent contrast to the gothic bay with its pointed arch its clustered columns and carved capitals which even with the shallow choir and its long slim windows is too slight a portion of the cathedral to have independence or real beauty from its ritualistic position it is the culminating point of the church and its discord with the romanesque is unpleasantly insistent the side aisles which were built in the xvii century are low agreeable walks ending in the chapels of the smaller apses they are neither very regular nor very significant but they give the church pleasant size and perspectives and by avoiding the unduly large and shining modern chandeliers which hang between the nave arches one gets from these side aisles the suggestive views which show only too well what true and good architectural ideas were brought to confusion in the rebuilding the additions and the restorations of the centuries in painting anachronisms may be quaint or even amusing but in architecture they are either grotesque or tragic and in a church of such fine suggestiveness as notredame at forcalquier one is haunted by lingering regrets for what might and should have been sidenote vence a founder of the french academy and one of its first immortal forty was antoine godeau the idol of the htel rambouillet his mind was formed as it were by one of the most clever women of that brilliantly foolish coterie he sang frivolous sonnets to a beautiful redhaired mistress whom he sincerely admired and when he entered holy church none of his charming friends believed that he would do more than modify the proper and agreeable conventionalities of his former life they thought that he would add to the grace of his worldly manner the suavity of the ecclesiastic that he would choose a pulpit of paris and that sitting at his feet they could enjoy the elegant phrases with which he would embellish a refined and delicately attenuated religion but an aged prelate of the far south judged the new priest differently he had sounded the heart of the man who at the age of thirty had quietly renounced a flattering admiring world and his dying prayer to richelieu was that godeau should succeed him in the see of vence the keen worldly wisdom of the cardinal confirmed the old bishops more spiritual insight and godeau was named bishop of the neighbouring grasse far away in his mountaincity of flower gardens and sweet odours the new bishop wrote to his parisian friends that for his part he found more thorns than orangeblossoms the calvinists from the rock of antibes openly defied him in spite of the vehement opposition of their chapters and against his will the bishoprics of grasse and vence were united and he was made the bishop of the two warring discontented sees he was stoned at vence and even his colleague in temporal power the marquis of villeneuve showed himself as insolent as he dared at length the king came to his aid and being given his choice of the sees godeau immediately left the perfumed wench as he called grasse and chose to live and work among his onetime enemies of vence this gentle and courageous prelate is typical of the long line of wise men who ruled the church in the tight little city of the provenal hills from saint vran the wonderworker and saint lambert the tender nurse of lepers to the end they were men noted for bravery goodness and learning and it was not till the revolution that one was foundand fittingly the lastwho hating the oath and fearing the guillotine fled his see this city of good bishops was founded in the dim pagan past of gaul from a rocky hilltop its inhabitants had watched the burning of their first valleytown and they founded the second vence on that height of safety to which they had escaped with their lives here far above the aurelian road the gallic tribes had a strong and isolated camp then the prying romans found them out and priests of mars and cybele replaced those of the cruder native gods and they in turn gave way to the apostle of the christians where a temple stood a church was built and unlike many early saints who looked upon old pagan images as homes of devils and broke them into a thousand pieces with holy wrath and words of exorcism the prelate of vence buried an image of a vanquished god under each and every pillar of his church in sign of christian triumph these early days of the faith were days of growth for the little city and she prospered in her medivalism high on her hill she was too difficult of access to suffer greatly from marauding foes and hidden from the sea she did not excite the cupidity of the mediterranean rovers when antibes and nice were sacked her little ledge of rock was safe and people crowded thick and fast behind her walls until no beehive swarmed so thick with bees as her few streets with citizens here were arts and occupations burghers and charters riches and liberties here came the renaissance and vence had eager if not famous sculptors painters and organbuilders and a family of artists whom even the dilettante francis i deigned to patronise such memories of a busy energetic past seem fairytales to those who walk today about the dark and narrow streets of vence she scarcely has outgrown her ancient walls her civic life is dead and in her virtual isolation from the modern world she lives a dreary quiet old age the old cathedral notredame lies in the heart of the town and takes one back along the years far past the renaissance to those grim medival days when even churches were places of defence it is a low unimpressive building said to have been built on the site of the roman temple in the iv century enlarged or rebuilt in the x century it was then long and narrow a latin cross but in the xii century deep dark bays were added in the xv tribunes were built the form of the apse was changed to an oval and it was decorated in an inharmonious style and a hundred years ago the nave vault was rebuilt in an ellipse illustration the old round arch of the bishops palacevence in the side wall there is a low portal of a late decadent style which opens on the little square but there is no real faade and to see the church the traveller passed under the old round arch of the bishops palace through a small damp street to another tinier square where the apse and tower stand the little cathedralchurches of provence are always simply built but here a rectangle a low gabled roof a small roundheaded window in the wall would have been architectural bareness if a high straight tower had not crowned it all this crenellated tower is a true type of its time square yet slim and strong and crudely graceful as some tall young poplar of the plains beneath in the xi and xii centuries its early days it was the citys lookout families lived high up in its walls and the traveller could imagine in this little old deserted square the crowds who gathered round the towers base and called for news of enemies and battle as moderns gather about the more prosaic bulletin of printed news he could see them surging peering up and from above he almost heard the watchers cry theyre coming onwith the great answering howl beneath and the rush to arms or they pass us by and then what breaking into little laughing groups what joy what dancing and what praying that lasted far into the evening hours illustration the low broad arches and the great supporting pillarsvence the traveller came back in thought to modern times and went into the church that church of five low naves and many restorations that product of most diverse fancies it is painted in lugubrious white and its pillars have false bases in a palpable imitation of veined red marble its pure and early form the latin cross is gone its fine old stalls are hidden in a gallery and at the altar corinthian columns desecrate its ancient romanesque yet in spite of the incongruities the atmosphere of the church is truly that of its dim past there are the low broad arches the great supporting pillars that are massive buttresses there is the simple practicality of a style that aimed at a protecting strength rather than at any art of beauty there is the semidarkness of the small safe windows and the little guarded space where the praying few increased a thousandfold in times of danger this is in spite of all defects the small provenal church where in days of peace cloudy incense slowly circled round the shadowy forms of chanting priests and where in times of war a crowd of frightened women and their children prayed in safety for the men who sallied forth to fight in their defence sidenote grasse he who is unloving of the past may well rush by its treasures in a puffing automobile he who is bored by olden thoughts can hurry on by rail but the man who wishes to know the old hilltowns of france to see them as they seemed to their makers and realise their onetime magnificence and strength must walk from one town to the next and climb their steep heights must see great towers rise before him great walls loom above him and realise how grandly strong these places were when it was man to man and sword to sword strength against strength he must arrive dustcovered at the cities gates or drive into their narrow streets on the small coach which still passes throughfor they are of the times when great men rode and peasants walked and steam was all unknown then he will realise how very large the world once was how far from town to town and once within those high protecting walls he will understand why the citizen of medival days found in his town a world sufficient to itself and why he was so often well content to spend his life at home the power and the force of an isolated selfconcentrated interest is well illustrated in the history of the free cities of the middle ages and grasse may be counted one of these counts she had in name but the brengers and queen jeanne had granted her charters which she had the power to keep she was once wealthy enough to declare war with pisa and in the xii century the leaders of her selfgovernment were consuls by the grace of god alone therefore when antibes continued to be greatly menaced by blasphemous pirates the bishopric was removed to grasse rich strong and safe behind the hills where it endured from 1244 through all the perils of the centuries until by a penstroke napoleon wiped it out in 1801 illustration higher than them all stands the cathedralgrasse to come to grasse on foot or in the stage will well repay the traveller of oldfashioned moods and fancies afar her houses seem to crowd together as they used to crowd within the walls her red roofs rise fantastically one above the other and higher than them all stands the cathedral with its firm square tower such must have been old grasse perched on the summit of her hill but once inside the town these illusions cease here are the hotels and the casino of a thermal station and the factories of a new world the traveller finds that the broad upper boulevards are filled with tourists and smart english visitors and in the narrow streets pert factoryhands come noisily from work still he climbs on toward the cathedral through tortuous streets and little alleyways and in the gloomiest of them all there is no odour of a stale antiquity but the perfume of a gardenfull of roses of a thousand orangeblossoms and of locusts honeysweet and he begins to think himself enchanted he feels the dark old houses are unreal as if instead of cobblestones beneath his feet there must be the soft and tender grass of araby the blest such is the magic of a trade the perfume industry of grasse that for so many hundreds of years has made her meanest streets full of refreshing fragrance breathless from the climb the traveller stepped at length into the little square before a most ungainly cathedral chiefly built in the xii century it may have been but so bedizened by the renaissance that its heavy old provenal walls and massive pillars seem to exist merely as supports for additions or unreasonable decorations of a poor italian style a certain monseigneur of the xvii century rebuilt the choir in a deep rectangular form another prelate enlarged the church proper and ruined it by constructing a tribune over the aisles and desiring the revenues of a new burialplace he ordered vauban to accomplish the daring construction of a crypt still another bishop with like architectural tastes built a large new chapel which opens from the south aisle and with these additions and xviii century changes in the faade the original style of the church was obscured in spite of the pitiful remains of dignity which its three aisles its firm old pillars and its height still give to the interior it is as a whole so mean a building that it has fittingly lost the title of cathedral illustration the pont davignon iii riverside cathedrals sidenote avignon everything which surrounds the cathedral of avignon its situation its city its history is so full of romance and glamour that it is only after very sober second thought one realises that the church itself is the least of the papal buildings which majestically overtower the rhone or of those royal ruins which face them as proudly on the opposite bank of the river yet no church in provence is richer in tradition and in history more romantic than tradition the foundation of this church goes back to the first avignon a small colony of riverfishermen which gave way before the romans who established a city avernio on the great rocky hill two hundred feet above the rhone some hundreds of years later the first christian missionaries to gaul landed near the mouth of this rivermary the mother of james saint sara the patron of gypsies lazarus his sister martha and saint maximin before these stormtossed saints lay the fair and pagan country of provence the scene of their future mission and if tradition is to be further believed each went his way to work mightily for the sacred cause maximin lived in the town that bears his name lazarus became the first bishop of marseilles and saint martha ascended the rhone as far as avignon and built near the site of the present cathedral an oratory in honour of the virgin then living on the earth two early churches of which this chapel was perhaps a part were destroyed in the saracenic sieges of the viii century an inscription in the porch of the present cathedral records the very interesting medival account of its rebuilding and reconsecration nearly a hundred years later it was so runs the tale the habit of a devout woman to pray in the church every night and after the cathedral had been finished by the generous aid of charlemagne she happened there at midnight and witnessed the descent of christ in wondrous shining light there at the high altar surrounded by ministering angels he dedicated the cathedral to his mother our lady of cathedrals and so it has been called to the present day if it is an impossible and ungrateful task to disprove that the reconstruction or at least the refounding of this cathedral was the work of charlemagne so munificent a patron and dutiful a son of the church to prove it is equally impossible a martyrology of the xi century speaks of a dedication in 1069 but as this ceremony had been preceded by another extensive rebuilding and was followed by many other changes the oldest portions of the present church are to be most accurately ascribed to the xi xii and xiv centuries the additions of the centuries following the papal return to rome have greatly changed the appearance of the church a large chapel built in 1506 gives almost a northern nave in 1671 archbishop ariosto thought the interior would be gracefully improved by a renaissance gallery which should encircle the entire nave from one end of the choir to the other to accomplish this new work the old main piers below the gallery were cut away the wall arches were changed and columns and piers almost entirely new arose to support a shallow gracefully balustraded balcony and its bases of massive carving nine years later a new archbishop added to the north side a square xvii century chapel richly ornamental in itself but entirely out of harmony with the fundamental style of the church other chapels less distinguished which have been added from time to time line the nave both north and south and all are excrescent to the original plan of the exterior only the faade retains its primitive character the sidewalls entirely featureless as has been well said reflect only the various periods of the chapels which have been added to the cathedral and the apse was rebuilt in 1671 in a heavy uninteresting form illustration the interior has a shallow gracefully balustraded balconyavignon these additions superimposed ornamentations and rebuildings together with the very substantial substructure of the primitive cathedral form today a small church of unimpressive conglomerate style and except for its history unnoteworthy it is therefore a church whose interest is almost wholly of the past and the traveller goes back in imagination century after century to the era of papal residency when the cathedral was not only ecclesiastically important but architecturally in its best and purest form this church which clement v found on his removal to avignon and which may still be easily traced was of the simple primitive provenal style no dates of that period are sufficiently accurate to rely upon but its interest lies not so much in chronology as in its portrayal of the general type the interior is the usual little hall church of the xi century with its aisleless nave of five bays and plain piers supporting a tunnelled roof with double vault arches beyond the last bay over the choir is the cathedrals octagonal dome and from the rounded windows of its lantern comes much of the light of the interior which is sombre and without other windows of importance the faade is architecturally one of the most significant parts of the church above the portal the wall is supported on either side by plain heavy buttresses and directly continued by the solid bulk of the tower in 1431 this tower replaced the original one which fell in the earthquake of 1405 it is conjecturally similar a heavy rectangle which quite overweighs the church plain with its stiff pilasters and two stories of rounded windows without grace or proper proportion but pleasing by the unblemished severity of its lines above the balustrade with which the tower may be properly said to terminate the religious art of the xix century has erected as its contribution to the cathedral a series of steps an octagon and a colossal malproportioned statue of the virgin these additions are inharmonious and the finest part of the faade is the porch so classic in detail that it was formerly supposed to be roman a work of the emperor constantine like the rest of the church its general structure is plain and somewhat severe with small richly carved details in this instance closely corinthian the rounded portal of entrance is an entablature enclosed as it were by two supporting columns and above in the pointed pediment is a circular opening curiously foreshadowing that magnificent development of the norththe rosewindow passing through the vestibule whose tunnelvault supports the tower the minor portal appears almost a replica of the outer door and the whole forms an unusual mode of entrance graceful in detail ponderous in general effect far behind the tower of the faade rises the last significant feature of the exterior the little lantern it is an octagon with doric and corinthian motifs continuing the essential characteristics of the interior and exceedingly typical of provence illustration the porch so classic in detailavignon from an old print into this church with its few unusually classic details its provenal simplicity its very modest size and plainness the munificence of papal pomp was introduced this was in 1308 an era of papal storm and stress not ten years before boniface viii with the tradition of canossa spurring his haughty ambitions had launched a bull against philip iii whom he knew to be a bad king and whom he was to find an equally bad rebellious christian god said the prelate from rome has constituted us though unworthy above kings and kingdoms to seize destroy disperse build and plant in his name and by his doctrine therefore do not persuade thyself that thou hast no superior and that thou art not subject to the head of the ecclesiastical hierarchy he who thinks thus is insensate he who maintains it is infidel past indeed was the time of henry of germany long past the proud day when a pope received an emperor who knelt and waited in the snow philip burned the bull and to prevent other like fulminations sent an agent into italy gathering a band he found the aged pontiff at anagni his birthplace seated on a throne crowned with the triple crown the cross in one hand and in the other saint peters keys the terrible keys of heaven and hell they called on him to abdicate but boniface thought of christ his lord and cried out in defiant answer here is my neck here is my head betrayed like jesus christ if i must die like him i will at least die pope for reply sciarra colonna one of his own roman counts struck him in the face buffeted by a noble and openly defied by a king boniface died of shame and anger a month later this same king rejoiced if nothing more at the death of the popes successor and in the dark forests of saintjeandangly philip bargained and sold the great tiara to a gascon archbishop who if villani speaks truly threw himself at the royal feet saying it is for thee to command and for me to obey such will ever be my disposition as was not unnatural the will of the french king was that the pope should remain within the zone of royal influence so clement lived at bordeaux and at poitiers and finally retired to the county of venaissin which the holy see possessed by right and established the pontifical court at avignon this transfer of the papal residence to avignon has left many and deep traces on the history of french catholicism the holy see was no longer far remote the french ecclesiastic desirous of promotion had no dangerous mountains to traverse no strange city to enter no foreign pontiff to besiege ignorant or indifferent to his claims the next successor of saint peter would logically be a frenchman and there was not only a possibility but a probability for every man of note that he might be either the occupant of the sacred chair or its favoured supporter so avignon became a city of priests as rome had been before her and as france was the richest country in europe and the church regally wealthy splendour luxury and constant religious spectacles rejoiced the city and bishop archbishop and abbot brazenly neglecting the duties of their sees lived here and were seldom in residence every one had a secret ambition of such a situation the popes were not slow to reap the benefits difference of wealth which brought difference of position counted much and was keenly felt abbots of smaller monasteries found themselves inferior to bishops especially in freedom from papal interference while from the inherent wealth and power of their foundations the heads of the great monasteries ranked sometimes with archbishops sometimes even with cardinals the pope had the right to elevate an abbey or a priory into a bishopric and those who could offer the gratification or the provocative might reasonably hope for the desired elevation which at once increased their local importance belittled a neighbouring diocese and freed them to some extent from the direct intermeddling of the pope the applications for such an increase of power became numerous and by 1320 a number of benedictine abbeys had been made bishoprics their creation greatly decreased the direct and intimate power of the papacy but temporarily increased the papal treasury and john xxii who left ten million pieces of silver and fifteen million in gold with his florentine bankers seems to have thought philosophically after us the deluge illustration notredamedesdomsavignon another favourite diplomatic and financial device which was invented by these famous popes of avignon was the system of the commende which enabled relatives of nobles and all those whom it was desirable to placate not alone ecclesiastics but mere laymen and bloody barons to become commendatory abbots or commendatory priors and to receive at least onethird of the monasterys revenues without being in any way responsible for the monasterys welfare this care was left to a prior or a subprior a sort of clerical administrator who crippled in means and in influence was sometimes unable sometimes unwilling to carry out the duties and beneficences of past ages and who was always the victim of a great injustice the depths of uselessness to which this infamous practice reduced monastic establishments may be inferred when it is remembered that before the xviii century the famous abbey of la baume had had thirteen commendatory abbots and that the bastards of louis xiv were commendatory priors in their infancy the popes found the commende useful not only as a means of income but as a methodat once secure and lucrativeof gaining to their cause the great feudal lords of france and making the power of these lords an added buffer as it were between avignon and the grasping might of the french kings for although the popes were under the special protection of the kings it was as sheep under the special protection of a shearer and they found that they must protect themselves against a too special and royal fleecing for they did not always agree that tis as goodly a match as match can be to marry the church and the fleurdelis should either mate astraying go then eachtoo latewill own twas so illustration the tower of philip the fairvilleneuvelesavignon haunted by the humiliation of their heavensent power caged in babylonish captivity it is conceivable that the popes were too occupied or perhaps too distracted to object to the unsuitable modesty of notredamedesdoms when a pope swept forth from his cathedral newcrowned to give urbis et orbi his first pontifical benediction his eye glanced it is true on the crowds prostrate before him before the church awed and breathless but it fell lingeringlyit was irresistibly drawnacross the swift rhone to the town of the kings who had defied his power to the royal city of villeneuve and to the strong tower of philip the fair standing proudly in the sunlight would it be thought strange if their thoughts wandered or if the portraits of the french popes which hang about the cathedral walls at avignon show more worldly preoccupation than is becoming to the successors of saint peter and vicars of christ little indeed in the days of their residency did the popes add to notredamedesdoms a fragile slender marvel of gothic architecture the tomb of john xxii was placed in the nave before the altar and a monument to benedict xii was raised in the church but their holinesses incited others in avignon to good works so successfully that rabelais laughingly called it the ringing city of churches convents and monasteries the bells of saintpierre saintsymphorien saintagricol sainteclaire and saintdidier chimed with those of chapels and religious foundations the grey penitents black penitents and white penitents priests and nuns walked the streets and avignon grew truly papal clement v and his successors proceeded to the safeguarding of their temporal welfare in truly noble fashion and scarcely fifty years later they had become so well pleased with their new residence that the magnificent clement vi refused to leave in spite of the supplications of petrarch and rienzi and a whole deputation of romans during the reign of this pontiff the papal court became one of the gayest in christendom clement was frankly joyously voluptuous and his life seems one moving pageant in which luxurious banquets beautiful women and ecclesiastical pomps succeeded each other the lovely countess of turenne sold his preferments and benefices the immense treasure of john xxii was his and he showered such benefits on a grateful family that of the five cardinals who accompanied his corpse from avignon one was his brother one his cousin and three his nephews and that the huguenots who violated his tomb at lachaisedieu should have used his skull as a winecup seems an horrible but not an unfitting mockery it was in vain that petrarch hotly wrote the pope keeps the church of jesus christ in shameful exile the desire for return to rome had passed avignon was not an original nor a plenary possession of the holy fathers but the fairest inheritance of the brengers and it was from that family that half of the city had to be wrestedor obtained now the lords of provence were kings of naples and sicily and therefore vassals of the holy see for when the normans took these southern states from the greeks and thereby incurred the jealousy of all italy they had warily placed themselves under the protection of the pope and agreed to hold their new possessions as a papal investiture it happened at this time that the vassal of the pope in naples and in sicily was the beauteous reino joanno the heiress of provence what she was no writer could describe in better words than these with extreme beauty with youth that does not fade red hair that holds the sunlight in its tangles a sweet voice poetic gifts regal peremptoriness a gallic wit genuine magnanimity and rhapsodical piety with strange indecorum and bluntness of feeling under the extremes of splendour and misery just such a lovely perverse bewildering woman was she great granddaughter of raymondbrenger fourth count of provencethe pupil of boccaccio the friend of petrarch the enemy of saint catherine of siena the most dangerous and most dazzling woman of the xiv century so typically provenal was this queens nature that had she lived some centuries later she might have been mirabeaus sister the same terrible gift of familiarity the same talent of finding favour and swaying popular assemblages the same sensuousness bold courage and great generosity were found in this early orphaned thrice widowed heiress of provence to this day the memory of the reino joanno lives in her native land associated with numbers of towers and fortresses the style of whose architecture attests their origin under her reign it says much for her personal fascinations that far from being either cursed or blamed she is still remembered and praised the ruins of gremaud tour drainmont of guillaumes and a castle near roccaspervera all bear her name at draguignan and flagose they tell you her canal has supplied the town with water for generations in the esterels the peasants who got free grants of land still invoke their benefactress at saintvallier she is blessed because she protected the hamlet near the siagne from the oppression of the chapters of grasse and lrins at aix and avignon her fame is undying because she dispelled some robberbands at marseilles she is popular because she modified and settled the jurisdiction of viscounts and bishops go up to grasse and in the big square where the trees throw a flickering shadow over the streettraders you will see built in a vaulted passage a flight of stone steps steps which every barefoot child will tell you belong to the palace of la reino joanno walls have been altered gates have disappeared but down those timeworn steps once paced the liege lady of provence the incomparable fair mischief whose guilt must ever remain one of the enigmas of history this enigma has strange analogies to one which has puzzled and impassioned the writers of many generations the mystery of that other fair mischief of a later century mary queen of scots like mary jeanne was accused of the murder of her young husband and being pressed by the vengeance of his brotherno less a person than the king of hungaryshe decided to retreat to her native provence and appeal to the pope her gallant and not overscrupulous suzerain jeanne landed at ponchettes continues the writer who has so happily described her and the consuls came to assure her of their devotion i come replied the heiress whose wit always suggested a happy phrase to ask for your hearts and nothing but your hearts as she did not allude to her debts the populace threw up their caps the prince de monaco just cured of his wound at crcy placed his sword at her service and the baron de bnil redhanded from a cruel murder besought her patronage which perhaps from a fellowfeeling she promised with great alacrity at grasse she won all hearts and made many more promises and finally arriving at avignon she found clement covetous of the city and welldisposed to her yet morality obliged him to ask an explanation of her recent change of husbands and before three cardinals whom he appointed to be her judges the queen pleaded her own cause not a blush tinged her cheek no tremor altered her melodious voice as she stood before the redrobed princes of the church and narrated in fluent latin the story of the assassination of andrew the death of her child and her marriage with the murderer louis of tarento who stood by her side the wily pope noted behind her the proud provenal nobles the villeneuves and dagoults the de baux and the lescaris who brought the fealty of the hillcountry and who did not know that having already sold her jewels to the jews their fair queen was covenanting with the pope for avignon the formal trial ended the pontiff solemnly declared the queen to be guiltlessand she granted him the city for eighty thousand pieces of gold illustration the great palaceavignon clement enjoyed ownership in the same agreeable manner as his predecessors without the untying of pursestrings perhaps he used the purses contents for the more pressing claim of the great palace of which he built so large a part perhaps he handed it still filled to innocent vi who built the famous fortifications of avignon and protected himself against the marauding white companies perhaps it was still untouched when bertrand du guesclin and his grand company stood before the gate and demanded benediction absolution and two hundred thousand pounds what the pope is said to have cried must we give absolution which here in avignon is paid for and then give money tooit is contrary to reason du guesclin replied to the bearer of these words here are many who care little for absolution and much for moneyand urban yielded gregory xi the last of the french popes returned to rome and at his death the great schism followedclement vii in avignon was recognised by france spain scotland sicily and cyprus urban vi in rome by italy austria and england the county venaissin was ravaged by wars and the pests that come in their train at length the avignonnais who had not enjoyed greater peace under their anointed rulers than under worldling counts rose against pierre de luna the antipope benedict xiii who fled from that time no pontiff entered the gates and the city was administered by papal legates in later days in spite of the sacred character of its rulers and his own undoubted orthodoxy louis xiv seized avignon several times and louis xv in unfilial vengeance for the excommunication of the duke of parma took possession of the city but it was not until after the beginning of the french revolution in 1791 that the avignonnais themselves arose chased the vicelegate of the pope from the city and appealed for union with france and it was at this period that the chapel of saintemarthe the cloister and the chapter house were swept away thus ended the temporal power of the papacy in france planned for worldly profit and carried out with many sordid compromisesa residency unnoted for great deeds or noble intentions and whose close marked the great schism today papal avignon is become french avignon a pleasant city where the provenal sun is hot and where the mistral whistles merrily above the banks of the rhone the simple cathedral stands with its priests still garbed in papal red its host still carried under the white papal panoply here also is the great palace of the popes which is indeed says froissart the strongest and most magnificent house in the world and yet its grim walls suggest neither peace nor rest and to him who recalls this great impressive pile tells neither of glories nor of triumphs bands of unbelieving pastoureaux marched toward it soldiers of the white companies and soldiers of du guesclin gazed mockingly at it it was the prison of rienzi and the home of the harassed popes who had ever before them just across the river the menacing tower of that fair king who had led them into babylonish captivity sidenote vaison on the banks of a pleasant little river among the provenal hills is vaison one of the ancient gallic towns which became entirely romanised and many illustrious families of the empire had summer villas there as at arles and orange barbarians of one epoch or another have devastated vaison of all her antique treasures except the remains of an amphitheatre on the puymin hill germanic tribes who swooped down in early centuries destroyed her villas and her greater buildings and vandals of a later day have scattered her sculptures and her tablets here and there some are in the galleries of avignon a belus the only one found in france was sent to the museum of saintgermain and in the multitude of treasures in the british museum the most beautiful of all her statues a diadumenus is artistically lost in the days when it still adorned the city during the reign of the emperor gallienus vaison was christianised by saint ruf her bishopric was founded and in 337 the first general council of the church held in gaul assembled here another council in the v century and still another in the vi are proof of her continued importance illustration on the banks of a pleasant little river is vaison illustration the ruined castle of the counts of toulousevaison among the first of galloroman cities she was also among the first to suffer chrocus and his horde who sacked orange seized her bishop and murdered him and alains vandals and burgundians following in their wake brought disaster after disaster to the cities lying near the rhone vaison by miracle did not lose her prestige in the x and xi centuries she built her fine cathedral with its cloisters and in 1179 she was still great enough to excite the covetousness of raymond vi count of toulouse this magnificent and ambitious prince built a castle on a height above the city and as he had before terrorised my lord bishop of carpentras so now he seized the anointed person of brenger de reilhane who was not only vaisons bishop but her temporal prince as well brenger was a sufficiently powerful personage to make an outcry which reechoed throughout christendom the pope and the emperor came to his aid and in the abbey church of saintgillesdugard raymond vi did solemn penance and before receiving absolution was publicly struck by the papal legate with a bundle of birch rods above the bishops palace the great castle still loomed in menace but on that day brenger de reilhane triumphed and vaison was at peace it was a peace which presaged her quiet uneventful downfall for other interests were growing stronger in the country other cities grew where she stood still and in the xiv century when avignon became the seat of papal power vaison had passed from the worlds history her bishopric endured till 1801 but her doings are worthy only of provincial chronicles and today she is but a little country town served by the stagecoach she still lies on both banks of the river the high city with long rows of deserted houses climbs the side of the steep hill and is dominated by the ruins of the great castle which richelieu destroyed the lower city which is the busier of the two lies on the opposite bank and on its outskirts in a little gardenclose almost surrounded by the fields is the cathedralsolitary lonely and old illustration the whole apseendvaison illustration the south wall which is clearly seen from the roadvaison the decoration of the exterior is slight a dentiled cornice and a graceful foliated frieze extend along the top of the sidewalls which although most plainly built are far from being severely angular or gaunt and have a quaint and pleasing harmony of line the west front is so featureless that it scarcely deserves the title of faade the south wall which is clearly seen from the road has a small portal and plain buttresses that slope at the top the central apse is rectangular and heavy the little southern apse is short and round and that of the north is tall and thin as a pepperbox behind them rise the pointed roof of the nave and the heavy tower the whole apseend is constructed in most picturesque irregularity and the new red of the rooftiles and sombre grey of the old stone add greatly to its charm unlike many churches of its period notredame of vaison is threeaisled slender narrow naves whose tunnel vaults are not extremely lofty end in small circular apses the nave is a short one of three irregular bays and over the last which precedes the choir is the little eightsided dome which instead of projecting above the roof is curiously placed a little lower than the tunnel vaulting of the other bays the high altar which originally belonged to an older church is well placed in the simple choir for it belongs in style if not in actual fact to the first centuries of the faith and in the semidarkness behind the altar the old episcopal throne still stands against the apses wall in memory of the custom of the churchs early days the low arches of the aisles the dim lighting of the church its simple ornaments of classic bands and little capitals its slight irregularities of form and carvings make an interior of fine and strong antique simplicity a little door in the north wall leads to the cloisters which are happily in a state of complete restoration and not as a modern writer has described them practically a ruin the wall which overlooks them has an inscription that adjures the canons to bear with patience the north aspect of their cells the short walks have tunnel vaults with crossvaults in the corners and in parts of the north aisle great piers and small firm columns support the outer arches and on the exterior of the cloister the little arches of the columns are enclosed in a large round arch many of the capitals are uncarved some of the piers have applied columns but many are ornamented in straight cut lines on one side two bays open to the ground forming an entranceway into the pretty close where the bushy tops of a few tall trees cast flickering shadows on the surrounding walls and the little grassy square illustration two bays open to the groundvaison illustration the great piers and small firm columnsvaison the cloister is small and simple in its rather heavy grace noise and unrest seem far from it and underneath its solid rounded vault is peace and shelter from the world and in its firm solidity of architecture there is the spirit of a perfect quiet a tranquil charm which must insensibly have calmed many a restless spirit that chafed beneath the churchly frock and fled within its walls for refuge and for helpful meditation few provenal cathedrals have the interest of vaison and its cloister lying in the forgotten valley of the ouvze in an oldfashioned town all its surroundings speak of the past and its atmosphere is quite unspoiled the church itself has been spared degenerating restorations and although it has no sumptuousness as at marseilles no grandeur as at arles no stirring history as the churches that lay near the sea although it is one of the smallest and most venerable of them all no cathedral of the southland has so great an architectural dignity and merit with so ancient and so quaint a charm sidenote arles in the midst of the wealth of antique ruins near the theatre the coliseum and the forum of this little rome of the gauls stands a noble monument of the ruder ages of christianity the cathedral sainttrophime here saint augustine apostle to england was consecrated here three general councils of the church were held here the donatists were doomed to everlasting fire and here the emperor constantine from his summer palace on the rhone must have come to assist at mass the building in which these solemn scenes of the early church were enacted soon disappeared and was replaced by the present one whose older walls rvoil attributes to the ix century the present cathedrals first documentary date is 1152 in the era of the republic of arles the name of saintetienne was changed and the body of sainttrophime carried in state from the ruined church of the aliscamps was buried under a new altar and he was solemnly proclaimed the patron of the richest and most majestic church in all provence illustration in the midst of the wealth of antique ruinsarles illustration the faade of sainttrophimearles nearly eight hundred years later a traveller stood before the portal of this church in the midst of his delighted study he suddenly felt the attraction of a pair of watchful eyes and turned to find a peasant woman gazing fixedly at him in her strange fascination she had placed beside her on the ground two huge melons and a mammoth cabbage and her wizened hands were folded before her sundayfashion she was a little witch of a woman old and bent and brown yes my good gentleman she said i have been looking at youfive whole minutes of the clock and much good it has done me in these days of books and such fine learning there is not enough time spent before our door and i who pass by it every day year in year out i have watched well and only two except yourself have ever studied it the foreigners come with red books and look at them more than at the door itselfthey stay perhaps three minutes and go off shaking their wise heads our people passing every day see but a door a place for going in and coming out she paused for breath and what do you see asked the traveller you ask me she smiled wisely but you know since you are standing here and looking too listen and her old eyes began to gleam ill tell you of a time before you were born i was a child then and we marched here every sunday other little girls and myself and we stood before this door and the nunsit was often sister mary dolorosatold us the stories of these stones see here is our lord who loves all mankind but has to judge us tooand there is sainttrophime but i cannot read monsieur an old peasant woman has no time for such fine things and you will laugh at me for telling you what you have in your booksbut i have them all here here in my heart and many a time i too come to refresh my old memory and to pray those pictures tell great lessons to those that have eyes to see them well welladay i must pick up my melons and begone for i have taken up your time and said too much but you will excuse it in an old woman who is good for little else than talking now they parted in true french fashion with expressions of mutual esteem and the traveller turned to the portal which was still fulfilling its ancient mission of teaching and of making beautiful the house of god applied to a severe faade typical of the plainness of provenal outer walls this is one of the noblest works of medivalism the richest and most beautiful portal of the south of france and no others in the midi except those of saintgillesdugard and moissac are worthy of comparison with it in boldness and intellectuality of conception it excels many of the northern works and equals the finest of them for the builder of the northern portal seems to have held closely to one architectural form the beautiful convention of the gothic style and within that door he placed in a more or less usual way the subjects which the church had sanctioned in nearly every case the treatment of the subject is subordinated to the general architectural plan and symmetry at sainttrophime there was the limit of space the axiom that a door must be a door and doubtless many allowable subjects but within these necessary bounds the unknown sculptor recognised few conventionalities the usual place for the portrayal of the last judgment the tympanum was too small for his conception of the scene the pier that divides his doorway was not built to support the statue of the churchs patron saint he had a multitude of fancies and instead of curbing them in some beautiful conventionality of form as one feels great northern builders often did this artist made a frame within which his ideas found free play and forcing conventionality to its will his genius justified itself for not only is the portal as a whole full of dignity and true symmetry but its details are thoughtfully worked out they show with the old scholastic form of his faith the grasp of the unknown masters mind the intellectuality of his symbolism and few portals grow in fascination as this one few have so interesting an originality illustration right detail portalarles in design it is simple in execution incomparably rich the principal theme of the last judgment has christ seated on a throne as the central figure and about him are the symbols of the four evangelists this is the treatment of the tympanum underneath patriarchs saints just and condemned form the beautiful frieze the apostles are seated and to their left is an angel guarding the gates of paradise against two bishops and a crowd of laymen who have yet to fully expiate their sins in purgatory behind them naked with their feet in the flames are those condemned to everlasting hell and still beyond is a lower depth where souls are already halfconsumed in hideous fires on the apostles extreme right is the beginning of our human history the temptation of adam and eve and marching toward the holy men on this same side is the long procession of those redeemed from adams fall clothed in righteousness an angel goes before them and hands a small childa ransomed soulto abraham isaac and jacob the end panels treat the last phases of the dominant themea mammoth angel in the one weighs the souls of the dead and an equally aweinspiring devil in the other is preparing to cast two of the lost into a sea of fire the remainder of the portal tells of many subjects and represents much of the theological symbolism of its time light graceful columns with delicately foliated capitals and bases rich with meaning sculptures divide the lower spaces into niches and in these niches stand statues of apostles and of saints each having his story each his peculiar attributes and about these chief figures are carved rich designs strange animals and numberless short stories of the bible above there is a small subsidiary frieze below the pedestals which tell the tale of those who stand upon them the figures have life and meaning if not a true plasticity and in this portal there is instruction variety and majesty wealth of allegory and subtle symbols for those who love religious mysteries and splendour of sculpture for those who come in search of art there are those to whom a simple beauty does not appeal after the richness of the portals carving the interior of sainttrophime is to them far too plain in futile comparison with the cloisters grace it is found too severe and one author has written that only when the refulgence of a mediterranean sun glances through a series of long lances then and then only does the cathedral of sainttrophime offer any inducement to linger within its nonimpressive walls it may not be denied that together with nearly all the cathedrals of provence this interior has suffered from the addition of inharmonious styles the most serious of these is its gothic choir of the xv century which a certain cardinal louis allemand applied to the narrower romanesque naves with irregular ambulatory chapels of various sizes and a general incongruity of plan this construction has no architectural importance except that of a prominent place in the churchs worship the remaining excrescences gothic chapels ionic pilasters elliptical tribune and the like are happily hidden along the side aisles or in the transepts and during the restoration of rvoil the naves were relieved of the disfiguring improvements of the xvii century and stand today in much of their fine old simplicity beyond the fifth bay and rising in the tower is the dome of dignified provenal form that rests on the lower arches of the crossing small clerestory windows cast sheets of pale light on the plain piers rectangular and heavy that rise to support a tunnel vault and divide the church into three naves of great and slender height the stern ascetic style of the xi and xii centuries has given the nave piers mere small plain bands as capitals and for churchly decoration has allowed only a moulding of acanthus leaves placed high and unnoticed at the vaultings base there is no pleasing detail and no charming fancy but a fine exquisite loftiness a faultless balance of proportion are in this severe interior and its solemn and majestic beauty is not surpassed in the southern romanesque illustration left detail portalarles beyond the south transept a short passage and a few steps lead to the cloisters the most famous of provence perhaps of france large graceful and magnificent in wealth of carving they have yet none of the poetic charms that linger around many a smaller cloister the vaultings are not more beautiful than other vaults less known although they have the help of the great piers the little slender columns seem too light to support so much expanse of roof and even the churchs tower square and high looks dwarfed when seen across the close the very spaciousness is solitary and the long vista of the walks conduces to vague wonderings rather than to peaceful hours of thought it has not the dreamy solitude of vaison nor the bright beauty of elnes little close nor any of the sunny cheerfulness that brightens the decaying walls of cahors illustration through the cloisterarchesarles the marvel of these cloisters is the sculptured decorations of their piers and columns those of the xii century are the richest but each of the later builders seems to have vied as best he might in wealth of conception and in lavishness of detail with those who went before and even in enforced rebuilding the addition of the gothic to the romanesque has not destroyed the harmony of the effect in all the sculptors schemes the outer of the double columns were given foliated patterns or a few simple symbols and the outer of the piers were channelled and conventionally cut and although the fancy of the sculptor is marvellously subtle and full of grace his greatest art was reserved for the capitals of the inner columns and the inner faces of the piers which meditating priests would see and study the symbolism authorised by holy church the history of precursors of our lord the incidents of his life and the more dramatic doings of the saints all these are carved with greatest love of detail and of art and in them the least arduous priest could find themes for a whole year of meditation the least enthusiastic of travellers a thousand quaint and interesting fancies and imaginations it is not so much the beauty of the whole effect that is entrancing in these cloisters nor that most subtle influence the good or evil spirit of a past which lingers round so many ancient spots as that medival thought and medival genius that found expression in these myriad fine examples of the sculptors

mecca of those who love to study people and customs for in spite of the railroad and the consequent influx of foreign french it has preserved the old grcoromansaracenic type which has made its beautiful women so justly famous and underneath its provenal gaieties their classic origins may easily be traced one should see the roman theatre the solitary aliscamps by moonlight the busy market in

bullbaitings neverending dances and sweet pleasures sidenote entrevaux the most celebrated fortified town in france is the cit of carcassonne yet even in the days of its practical strength it was scarcely a type it was rather a marvel a wonderthe fairest maid of languedoc the invincible and now the citadel is almost deserted the inhabitants are so few that weeds grow in their streets and one who walks there in the still midday feels that all this completion of architecture these walls perfect in every stone may be an enchanted vision a mirage he more than half believes that the cool of the sunset will dispel the illusion and he will find himself on a pleasant little hill of languedoc looking down upon the commonplace lower city of carcassonne at entrevaux there is no suggestion of illusion this is not a showplace that once was real it is one of a hundred little agglomerations of the french middle ages they had no great name to uphold no riches to expend in impregnable walls and towers they clung fearfully together for selfpreservation built ramparts that were as strong as might be and dared not laugh at the fortunes of war except that there is safety outside the walls and a tiny post and telegraph office within they are now as they were in those dangerous days the fortress of carcassonne is dead but in the back country of provence entrevaux is living and scarcely a jot or tittle of its medivalism is lost among high rocks that close around it on every side where according to the season the chalvagne trickles or plunges into the river var and dominated by a fort that perches on a sharp peak is the strangest of old provenal towns illustration the gothic walk cloisterarles the founding of the tiny episcopal city was after this wise toward the close of the xiv century in a time of plagues jewish persecutions the growth of heresies and the uncurbed ravages of freebooters the city of glandves seat of an ancient bishopric was destroyed the living remnant abandoned its desolate ruins searching for a stronger safer home they chose a site on the left bank of the var and commenced the building of entrevaux the bishop accompanied his flock and although he retained the old title of glandves in memory of the antiquity of the see and its lost city the cathedralchurch was established at entrevaux the first edifice saintmartins built shortly after the founding of the town has long been destroyed and the second begun in 1610 to the honour of the assumption of the blessed virgin mary held episcopal rank until the see was disestablished by the great concordat although this cathedral was built in the xvii century a date perilously near that of decadence in french ecclesiastical architecture it was situated in so obscure a corner of provence that its plan was unaffected by innovating ideas it is of the old native type a building of stout walls and heavy buttresses a single tower square and straight and a tunnelvaulted room the place of congregation this interior with no beautiful details that may not be found in other churches has as many of the defects of the italian school as the treasury could affordmarble columns frescoes gilding and other rococo decorations which show that the people of entrevaux had no higher and no better tastes than those of nice and that the old simple purity of the churchs form was rather a matter of ignorance or necessity than of choice the attraction of the episcopal church pales before the quaint delight of the episcopal city and it is as part of the general civic defence that it shares in the interest of entrevaux illustration this interiorentrevaux illustration the romanesque walk cloisterarles illustration one of three small drawbridgesentrevaux illustration the portcullisentrevaux leaving the train at the nearest railroad station the traveller followed the winding var and he had scarcely walked four miles when he saw across the river the sharp peak with its fort and the long lines of walls that zigzag down the hillside till they reach the crowded roofs that are clustered closely in charming irregularity near the bank along the waters edge the only part of the town that is not protected by rocks and hills there is another line of stout walls and two heavy jutting bastions from a medival point of view entrevaux looks strong indeed the only means of entrance now as in those olden days is by one of three small drawbridges and so narrow is every street of the town that no wagon is allowed to cross for if it made the passage of the bridge it would be caught hard and fast between the houses as the traveller put foot on the drawbridge he felt as though he were a petty trader or wandering minstrel or some other figure of the middle ages entering for a few hours traffic or a noondays rest and when he paused under the low arch of the portcullisgate people stared at him as they do at a stranger in little faroff towns once inside he turned into a street and was immediately obliged to step into a doorway for a man leading a horse was approaching and they needed all its breadth houses several stories high bordered these incredibly dark narrow ways and some of the upper windows had the diminutive balconies so dear to the south it was a bright hot day but the sun seldom peeped into these streets and in the shops the light was dull at midday as he thought of the men and women of medivalism who did not dare to wander in the fields beyond the town because their safety lay within its ramparts suddenly the little public squares of walled towns appeared in all the real significance of their light and breadth and sunshine space is precious in entrevaux and open places are few there is one where the hotels and cafs are found another across the drawbridge behind the cathedraltower and a tiny one before the church itself this is the most curious of them all for far from being a place de la cathdrale it is a true place darmes near the portals on whose wooden doors the mitre and insignia of papal favour are carved a few steps lead to a narrow ledge where archers could stand and shoot from the loopholes in the walls as the traveller sat on this ledge and wondered what scenes had been enacted here how many deadly shots had sped from out the holes what crowds of excited townsfolk had gathered in the church what grave words of exhortation and of blessing had been spoken from the altar or the threshold by anxious prelate robed and mitred for the mass of supplication to a god of battles an humble funeral appeareda priest a peasant bearing a black wooden cross with the name of the deceased painted on it a ropebound coffin carried by hot and sorrowing women and a little procession of friends the pomps and vanities of the past disappeared as a mist from the travellers mind and he saw entrevaux as it really is without the comforts of this worlds goods without the greatness of a bishopric a small provenal village whose perfection of quaintnessso charming to him who passes onmeans hardship and discomfort to those who have been born and must live and die there illustration a fort that perches on a sharp peakentrevaux illustration a true place darmesentrevaux and yet so potent is that charm when the traveller recrossed the drawbridge and looked up at the sharp teeth of the portcullis that may still fall and bite when he had passed out on the highroad and turned again and again to watch the fading sunlight on the tangled mass of roofs the illusion had returned the bastions stood out in bold relief the church tower with its crenellated top stood out against the rocky peaks the sun fell suddenly behind the hill and the traveller felt himself again a minstrel wandering in a medival night illustration the long lines of walls that zigzag down the hillsideentrevaux sidenote sisteron the traveller is curiousfrankly curious almost every time that he enters a cathedral his memory recalls the words of renan these splendid marvels are almost always the blossoming of some little deceit and after he has feasted his eye he thinks of history and of details and of renan prejudiced but wellinformed and wonders what was here the little deceit at grasse he had longed for the papers a certain lawyer has which tell much of the citys life a hundred and fifty years ago and at sisteron he sat by the durance wondering how he could induce a kind and good old lady of a remote corner of provence to lend him an ancient manuscript which even the gentle cur said she obstinately refused to impart blessed are they who can be satisfied with guidebooks as his friends who had visited avignon and arles tarascon and the saintesmariesdelamer and had seen provence to their entire edification while he was merely peering about notredamedesdoms and the fort saintandr of a more indolent and leisurely turn of mind he suffersand perhaps justlythe penalty of his joyous idleness for even lawyers and good ladies with hidden papers are rare revolutionary sieges fires and a wise discretion have led to the destroying of many a fine old page and it is often in vain one goes to these decaying cities of provence we see he said gesticulating dejectedly we see their towers and their walls but if we say we know that place how many times do we deceive ourselves it is too often as though we claimed to know the life and thought and passions of a man from looking on his grave butto consider what we may know sisteron is an old roman city most strongly and picturesquely built in a narrow defile of the durance on one side the river is the high bare rock of la baume on the other a higher rock where houses supporting each other by outstretched buttresses seem to cling to the sheer hillside as shrubs in mountain crevasses and are dominated and protected by a large and formidable fortresscastle that crowns the very top of the peak the town walls are almost gone the fortress is abandoned since the revolution there are no longer bishops in sisteron but the old town has lost little of its warlike and romantic atmosphere of days when it commanded an important pass and when the way across the durance was guarded by a drawbridge and a big portcullis that now stands in rusty idleness illustration the church tower stood out against the rocky peaksentrevaux it is claimed that the bishopric of this stronghold was founded in the iv century and grew and flourished mightily until the bishop dwelt securely on his rock his brother of gap had a box on the opposite bank the convent of the little dominican sisters was further up the river and besides this busy ecclesiastical life there was the world of burghers in the town and its convent of ursulines here came once upon a time a sprightly lady who added a thousand lively interests this was louise de cabris sister of the great mirabeau who when a mere girl had been married to the marquis de cabris part knave part fool the vices of de cabris sometimes ended in attacks of insanity his marriage with one who united the violence of the mirabeaus to the license of the vassans was unfortunate and after louise began to reign in the big dark house of the cours of grasse life never lacked for incidents matters were not mended by the arrival of her brother twentyfour and wild and supposed to be living under a lettre de cachet in the sleepy little town of manosque the two were soon embroiled in so outrageous a scandal that their father who loved a quarrel for its own sake sided with the prosecution and declaring that no children like his had ever been seen under the sun took out a lettre de cachet for louise who was sent up to sisteron where he requested her to repent of her sins at leisure in the convent of the ursulines inheriting a brilliant restless wit and unbridled morals her life with the stupid vicious marquis had not improved her natural disposition and she soon set sisteron agog on pretence of business all the lawyers flocked to see her and with no pretence at all the garrison flocked in their train when the ursulines ventured to remonstrate she diverted them with such anecdotes of gay adventure as were never found between the pages of their prayerbooks finally the whole town was divided into two camps her foes called her a viper and many an eye peered into the dark streets many a head was judiciously hidden behind bowed shutters to see who went toward the convent till by wit and scheming and after some months of most surprising incident louise carried her point left the good ursulines to a wellmerited repose and returned to the castle of mirabeauto laugh at the townsfolk of sisteron illustration the cathedral is near the heavy round towers of the outer rampartssisteron illustration the bridge across the durancesisteron when in the city the prelates occupied their castle of the citadel with the high lookouts and defences far from their cathedral which is in the lower town near the heavy round towers of the ramparts this church which has been very slightly and very judiciously restored is of unknown date probably of the xii century it is faithful to the native architectural tradition and in some details more interesting than many of the provenal cathedrals its exterior is small and low there are the familiar friendly little apses of the romanesque near them above the east end of the north aisle the squat tower with a modest modern spire and at its side above the roofline is the octagon that stands over the dome all this structure is unaffectedly simple the walls and buttresses which enclose the aisles are plain and it is only by comparison with this architectural puritanism that the faade may be considered ornate near the top of its wall which is supported by sturdy piers are three round windows with deep splayed frames the largest of them is directly above the high slender portal that is somewhat reminiscent of the italian influence so elaborately marked further up the valley at embrun the rounded arch of the doorway and its pointed gable are repeated on either side in a halfarch and halfgable an allegorical animal in relief stands above the central arch and a few columns with delicate capitals complete the adornment of the entranceway which in spite of being the most decorative part of the church is most discreet nine steps lead down into an interior that is small very usually planned and much defaced by xvii century giltyet is essentially dignified and impressive eliminate the tawdry altars take away the stucco saints and painted virgins let the chapels be mere shadowy corners in the dark perspective and the little church appears like the meetingplace of the faithful of an early christianity its nave and each of the narrow side aisles rise to round tunnelvaults there are but five bays and the last is covered by a small octagonal dome the whole church is built of a dark stone that is almost black its lighting is very dim and centres in the little apses where the holiest statues stand and the most sacred rites are celebrated and the worshippers shrouded in twilight have more of the atmosphere of mystery than is usual in the cathedrals of provence the subtle influence of quiet shadowy darkness that is so potent in the churches of the spanish borderland illustration entrances to two narrow streetssisteron many will pass through sisteron and enjoy its rugged strength its sunlit days its narrow streets and the peaks that stand out in solemn sternness against the dark blue sky at night notredamedepomeriis has none of the salient beauty of any of these and to appreciate its ancient charm it must not be forgotten that the provenal cathedral has not the distinction of size or the elaboration of the greater cathedrals of gascony that it is far removed from the fine originalities of languedoc that it is conventional and as it were clannish and that its highest dignity is in a simple quiet that is never awefull there is in truth more than one church of this country that needs the embellishment of its history to make it truly interesting but notredame of sisteron is not of these it is not the big empty shell of carpentras nor the little rough cathedral of orange it is the smaller more perfect one of finer inspiration which the many will pass by the few enjoy iv cathedrals of the valleys sidenote orange lying on the rhone and almost surrounded by the papal venaissin is a tiny principality of less than forty thousand acres this small state has given title to more than one distinguished european who never entered its borders and who was alien to it not only in birth but in language and family so great was the fame of its rulers that this small isolated strip of land suffered for their principles and probably owes to them much of its devastation in the terrible wars of religion from the wellknown convictions of the princes of orange the country was always counted a refuge for heretics of all shades and in 1338 they were in sufficient force to demolish the tower of the cathedral later in history charles ix declared william of nassau an outlaw and his principality confiscate and in 1571 there was a three days massacre of protestants in spite of this horrid orgy the reformers rose again in might and soon prevented all celebration of catholic rites refugees fleeing from the dragonnades of dauphin and of the cvennes poured into the principality and when the princes of orange were strong enough to protect their state its catholics lived restricted lives but when the protestant power waned kings and captains of france raided the land in the name of the church and at the death of william of orange king of england louis xiv seized the capital of the state razed its great palace and its walls and after the treaty of utrecht had awarded the principality to the french crown treated the defenceless huguenots with the same impartial cruelty he had meted to their fellowbelievers in other parts of the kingdom oranges changes in religious fate are not unlike those of nmes with this essential difference that here catholicism has conquered triumphantly where ten worship in the little protestant temple a thousand throng to the mass both in history and its monumental roman ruins the capital of this province orange is one of the richest cities of the southland but its cathedral is very poor and mean the plan is one of the simplest of the provenal conceptions a hall basilica archologically interesting but in its present state of patch and repair architecturally commonplace and unbeautiful in spite of protestant attacks and catholic restorations the xi century type has been maintained a rectangle whose plain double arches support a tunnel vault and divide the interior into four bays the piers are heavy and severe and between them are alcoves used as chapels the choir narrower than the nave is preceded by the usual dome and beyond it is a little unused apse concealed from the rest of the interior by a wall unimportant windows built with distinctly utilitarian purpose successfully light this small simple room and no kindly shadow hides its bareness or diminishes the unhappy effect of the paintings which disfigure the walls the cathedrals exterior is so surrounded by irregular old houses that the traveller had discovered it with some difficulty it has little that is worthy of description and after having entered by a conspicuously poor renaissance portal only to go out under an uninteresting modern one he found himself lost in wonder that the cathedralbuilders of notredamedenazareth should have utterly failed in a town which offered them such inspiring suggestions as the great arch of triumph and the still greater imperial theatre besides all the other remains of roman antiquity which long after the building of notredame the practical maurice of orange demolished for the making of his medival castle sidenote cavaillon it was growing dusk of a spring evening when the traveller arrived at cavaillon and wandered about the narrow streets and came upon the cathedral glimpses of an interesting dome and a turrettower had appeared once or twice above the housetops leading him on with freshened interest and there was still light enough for many first impressions when he arrived before the low cloisterdoor but here was no place for peaceful meditation an old woman coiffed and bent brushed past him as she entered a chair in each hand and as he effaced himself against the church wall a younger woman went by also chairladen two or three others came talking eagerly little girls in all stages of excitement ran in and out and little boys came and went divided between assumed carelessness and a feeling of unusual responsibility then a priest appeared on the threshold not in meditation but on business another old and heavy and panting hurried in and through the cloisterdoor monsieur le cur breviary in hand prayed watchfully a little fellow running fell down and the priest sprang to lift him the child was too small not to wish to cry but too much in haste to stop for tears the priest watched him with a kindly shrug and a smile as he ran onthere was no time for laughing or crying there was time for nothing but the mysterious matter in hand what is it the traveller finally asked ah monsieur tomorrow is the day of the first communion we all have just prayed just confessed in the church and our parents are arranging their places for tomorrow there will be crowdseverybody you too monsieur are coming perhaps the mass is at halfpast six such was the living interest of the place that the traveller moved away without any very clear architectural impression of the cathedral except of the curiously narrow bellturret and of the height of the dome he did not see the early mass but toward ten wandered again to the cathedral and entered the cloisterdoor it was a lowvaulted sombre little cloister which all the chattering animated crowds could not brighten formerly two sides were gated off and priests alone walked there the other sides were public passageways to the church now only the iron grooves of the gates of separation remain and the four walks were thronged with people little girls in the white dresses of their first communion veiled and crowned with roses were hurrying to their places an old grandmother with her arm around one of the little communicants knelt by a column gazing up to the virgin of the cloisterclose proud and anxious parents led their children into church and friends met and kissed on both cheeks in one corner an old woman was driving a busy trade in pennyworths of barley candy diminutive altarboys in white lace cassocks and red furtrimmed capes offered religious papers for sale it was a harvest day for beggars and for the love of the good god many a sou was given into feeble dirty hands illustration it was a lowvaulted sombre little cloister cavaillon for a time the traveller walked about the cloister so tiny and worn a cloister that on any other day it must have seemed melancholy indeed so low a vaulting is not often found massive and rounded and seeming to press lowering above the head the columns which help to support its weight are short and heavy and thick so worn that their capitals are sometimes only suggestive and sometimes meaningless on one side the carving is distinctly corinthian on another altogether lacking between the columns one could glance into a close so small that ten paces would measure its length it was a charming little spot all filled with flowers and plants that told of some ones constant tender care from above the nodding flowers and leaves rose the statue of the madonna and the child the tolling bell called laggards to mass with them the traveller entered the church and found it so crowded that it was only after receiving many knocks from incoming children and sundry blows on the head and shoulders from ladies who carried their chairs too carelessly after minutes of time and a store of patience that he finally reached a haven a corner of the chapel of saintvran there under the care of the cathedrals patron he escaped further injuries and assisted at a long interesting ceremony mass had already begun but the voice of the priest and the answering organ were lost in the movement of excited friends the murmur of questions and the clatter of nailed shoes on the stone floor a suisse halberd in hand and gorgeous in tricornered hat and the red and gold of office kept the aisleways open with firm but kind insistence and the priests who were directing the children in the body of the church were wise enough to overlook the disorder which was not irreverence but interest for days everybody had been thinking of this ceremony everybody wanted good places but few found them for the little nave of the church was chiefly given up to the communicants they sat on long benches facing each other the boys sixty or seventy of them were nearest the altar the girls even more numerous nearest the door a young priest walked between the rows of boys and the old panting father directed the girls the whole interior of the church at whose consecration no less a prelate than pope innocent iv had presided is small and its plan is essentially of the provenal type the high tunnel vault rests like that of orange on double arches and as the nave is very narrow and its light very dim the church seems lofty sombre and impressive with a very serious dignity which its detail fails to carry out the chapels which lie between the heavy buttresses are dim recesses which increase the darkened effect of the interior of the ten only three differ essentially from the general plan and although of the xvii century their style is so severe and they are so illlighted that they do not greatly debase the church the choir is entered from under a rounded archway and its dome is loftier than the nave and much more beautiful than the semidome of the apse whose roof in these practical modern times has been windowed that which almost destroys the effect of the churchs fine lines and would be intolerable in a stronger light is the mass of gilt and polychrome with which the interior is covered the altars are monstrously showy the walls and buttresses are coloured and even the interesting sculptured figures beneath the corbels have been carefully tinted the dead arise with appropriate mortuary pallor the halo of christ is pure gold and all the draperies of god and his saints are in true primary shadings from the contemplation of this misuse of paint and of a sadly misplaced inner porch of the xvii century the travellers attention was recalled to the old priest his hand was raised the eye of every little girl was fixed on him and instantly in their soft shrill voices they began the verse of a hymn the traveller glanced down the nave every boy was on his feet white ribbons hanging bravely from the right arm the crown of thorns correctly held in one whitegloved hand a crucifix fastened with a bow of ribbon to the coat lapel every eye was on the young priest who also raised his hand then they sang as the girls had sung and with a right lusty will and then under the guiding hands both boys and girls sang together there was a silence when their voices died away and from the altar a deep voice slowly chanted ite missa est and the high mass of the first communion day was over outside little country carts stood near the church and fathers and brothers in blue blouses were waiting for the little communicants who had had so long and so exciting a morning walking about with the crowds the traveller saw an exterior whose faade was plainly commonplace and whose bare lateral walls were patched and crowded by other walls finally he came upon the apse the most interesting part of the churchs exterior and he leaned against a caf wall and looked across the little square externally the apse of saintvran has five sides and each side seems supported by a channelled column the capitals of these columns are carved with leaves or with leaves and grotesques on them round arches rest and above is a narrow foliated cornice in relieving contrast to the artificial classicism of the renaissance of the interior the feeling of this apse is quite truly ancient and pagan and it is not less unique nor less charming because it is placed against a plain uninteresting wall the eye travelling upward above the choirdome meets the lantern with its rounded windows and pointed roof and by its side the high little bellturret which completes a curious exterior an exterior which is interesting and even beautiful in detail but irregular and heterogeneous as a whole the cathedral of cavaillon is one of many possibilities although small like those of its provenal kindred it has more dignity than orange more simplicity of interior line than the present avignon and it is to be regretted that it should have suffered no less from restoration than from old age illustration the cathedrals tower and turretcavaillon sidenote apt few of the cathedralchurches of the midi are without holy relics but none is more famous more revered and more authentic a place of pilgrimage than the basilica of apt it came about in this way says local history when martha lazarus and the holy marys of the gospels landed in france they brought with them the venerated body of saint anne the virgins mother and lazarus being a bishop kept the holy relic at his episcopal seat of marseilles persecutions arose and dangers innumerable and for safetys sake the bishop removed saint annes body to apt and sealed it secretly in the wall for centuries christians met and prayed in the little church unconscious of the wonderworking relic hidden so near them and it was only through a miracle in charlemagnes time and some say in his presence that the holy body was discovered this is the history which a sacristan recites to curious pilgrims as he leads them to the subcrypt the subcrypt of sainteanne one of the earliest of galloroman churches is not more than a narrow aisle its low vault seems to press over the head the air is damp and chill and the one little candle which the patient sacristan moves to this side and to that shows the plain unornamented stonework and the undoubted masonry of roman times it was part of the aqueduct which carried water to the theatre in imperial days and had become a chapel in the primitive christian era at the end which is curved as a choir is a heavy stone used as an altar and high in the wall is the niche where the body of the churchs patron lay buried for those hundreds of years it is a gloomy celllike place most curious and most interesting and as the traveller saw faith in the earnest gaze of some of his fellowvisitors and doubt in the smiles of others he wondered what ancient ceremonials secret masses or secret prayers had been said in this tiny chamber and what rows of phantomlike worshippers had filed in and out the dark corridor directly above is the higher upper crypt of the church a diminutive but true choir with its tiny altar and ambulatorya jewel of the romanesque heavy and plain and beautifully proportioned with columns and vaulting in perfect miniature this from its absolute purity of style is the most interesting part of the church and being a crypt it is also the most difficult to see in vain the sacristan ran from side to side with his little candle in vain the traveller gazed and peeredthe little church was full of shadows and mysteries dark and lost under the weight of the great choir above illustration the main body of the churchapt even the main body of the church above ground is dimly lighted by small rounded windows above the arches of the nave and from the dome of saint annes chapel doubtless on sundays after high mass when the great doors are opened the merry sun of provence casts its cheerful rays far up the nave but this is a church which is the better for its shadows a romanesque aisle of the ix or x century built by that same bishop alphant who had seen the construction of the little crypt church a central nave of the xi century romanesque in conception and a north aisle of poor provenal gothic make a large but inharmonious interior restoration following restoration chapels of the xviii century new vaultings debased and conglomerate gothic and spectacular decorations of gilded wood have destroyed the architectural value and real beauty of the cathedrals interior yet in the dim light which is the light of its everyday life the great height of the church and its sombre massiveness are not without impressiveness the exterior dominates the city but it is so hopelessly confused and commonplace that its natural dignity is lost the heavy arch which supports the clock tower forms an arcade across a narrow street and makes it picturesque without adding dignity to the church itself the walls are unmeaning often hidden by buildings and there is not a portal worthy of description there is the dome of saint annes chapel with a huge statue of the patron and the lantern of the central dome ending in a pointed roof but each addition to the exterior seems only an ignorant or a spiteful accentuation of the general architectural confusion to the faithful catholic the interest of sainteanne of apt lies in its wonderful and glorious relics here are the bodies of saint elazer and sainte delphine his wife a couple so pious that every morning they dressed a statue of the infant jesus and every night they undressed it and laid it to rest in a cradle there is also the rosary of sainte delphine whose every bead contained a relic and before the revolution there were other treasures innumerable during many years apt has been the pilgrimshrine of the faithful and great and small offerings of many centuries have been laid before the miracleworking body of the virgins sainted mother illustration the virgin and saint anne by benzoni the most famous of those who came praying and bearing gifts was anne of austria whose petition for the gift of a son an heir for france was granted in the birth of louis xiv in gratitude the queen enriched the church by vestments wrought in thread of gold and many sacred ornaments and at length she commanded mansart to replace the little chapel in which she had prayed by a larger and more sumptuous one a somewhat uninteresting structure in the showy style of the xvii century which is now the restingplace of saint anne in this chapel is the most beautiful of the churchs treasures which strange to say is a piece of modern sculpture given by the present monseigneur of avignon it is small and badly placed on a marble altar of discordant toning with a draped curtain of red giltfringed velvet for its background yet in spite of these inartistic surroundings it has lost none of its tender charm seated with a scroll on her knees the aged mother is earnestly teaching the young virgin who stands close by her side the slender old hand with its raised forefinger emphasises the lesson and the loving expression of the wrinkled ascetic face the attentiveness of the virgin and her slim young figure make a touching picture and a beautiful example of the power of the modern chisel yet faith in shrines and miraculous power is not in this xx century as pure nor as universal as in the days of the past and faith in provenal apt which possesses so large a part of the saints body is not as simple and therefore not as strong as in breton auray which has but a part of her finger republicanism in the south country is not too friendly to the church kings and queens no longer come with prodigal gifts and sainteanne of apt has not the peasant strength of sainteanne of auray and in spite of the great feastday of july in spite of aptoisian pride in spite of the devotion and prayers of faithful worshippers the cathedral of apt is a church of past rather than of present glories sidenote riez just as the churchbells were chiming the morning angelus and the warm sun was rising on a day of the early fall a traveller drove out of old manosque he had no guntherefore he had not come for the hunting he had no brassbound black boxes and therefore could not be a commis what he might be he well knew was troubling the brain of the broadbacked man sitting before him who with many a longdrawn ououuu was driving a fat little horse but native courtesy conquered natural curiosity and they drove in silence to the long fine bridge that spans the river of evil repute parliament mistral and durance are the three scourges of provence at that time of year however the durance usually looks peaceable and harmless enough half its great bed is dry and pebbly and the water that rushes under the big arches of the bridge is not great in volume but the size and strength of the bridge itself and certain huge rocks placed for a long distance on either side of the road are significant of floods and of the spring awakening of the monstrous river that like doctor jekyll and mr hyde has two lives illustration saintmartindebrmes with its high slim tower illustration the fortified monastery of the templarsnear groux the road wound about the low hills of the alps past a massive fortified monastery of the templars whose windows gape in ruin past saintmartindebrmes with its high slim crenellated watchtower past many quiet little villages where in the old times taine says good people lived as in an eagles nest happy as long as they were not slainthat was the luxury of the feudal times between these villages lay vast groves of the greygreen olivetrees large flourishing farms and further still the bleak mountains of the lower alps it was toward them the driver was turning for rising above a smiling little valley surrounded by fields of ripened grain lay riez a donjon stands above a broken wall on the hillside houses cluster around a churchs spire and alone on the top of the hill stands the little chapel of saintmaxime the only relic of the great seminary that was destroyed by the revolutionists of 89 here after the destruction of one of the several cathedrals of riez the bishop celebrated masses but the little chapel was never consecrated a cathedral it has been recently restored and rebuilt in an uninteresting stylethe exterior is bare to ugliness the interior so painted that the six old roman columns which support the choir are overwhelmed by the banality of their surroundings the plateau on which the chapel is built is now almost bare olivetrees grow to its edges and there is no trace of the seminary that was once so full of active life the traveller sitting in the shade of the few pinetrees looked over the broad view toward the peaks whose bare rocks rise with awful sternness and the little hills that stand between them and the valley till finally his eyes wandered to the town beneath and the firm broad roads which approach it from every direction for riez although in the lost depths of provence far from railways and tourists is a beehive of industry largely supplying the necessities of these secluded little towns its hatmaking rope factories and tanneries are quite important the shops of its main streets are not without a tempting attractiveness and there is all the provincial stateliness of saintremy with much less stagnancy riez was the albece reiorum apollinarium in the colonia julia reiorum of the romans but there are very few traces of the city with this highsounding name the whole atmosphere of the little town is xii century two of its old gates part of the wall and the crenellated tower still stand with ruined convents and monasteries of capuchins cordeliers and ursulines and it may be inferred from the remains of the bishops palace and the broad promenade which was one of its avenues and from the episcopal chteau at montagnac that ecclesiastical state was not less worthily upheld at riez than in the other sees of the south of france many difficulties however had beset the cathedralbuilding prelates their first church notredamedusige dating partly from the foundation of the see in the iv century partly from the x and xii centuries was destroyed by storm and flood and its site near the treacherous little river being considered too perilous a new cathedral of notredamedusige and saintmaxime was begun and it was then that the bishops celebrated temporarily at saintmaximes on the hill during the revolution the see was suppressed the church has been much rebuilt and changed so that only a tower which is part of the present notredamedusige and the traces of the earliest foundation near the little colostre remain to tell of the different cathedrals of riez illustration the tower of notredamedusigeriez near the site of the oldest church is one of the few monuments of a very early christianity which have escaped the perils of time it is of unknown date and although it is said to have been part of the cathedral which stood between it and the river it appears to have been always an independent and separate building the peasants say that in the memory of their forefathers it was used as a chapel they call it indefinitely the pantheon the temple or the chapel of saintclair but it was almost certainly a baptistery of that curious and beautiful type which was abandoned so early in the evolution of christian architecture illustration nothing could be more quaintly old and modest than the baptisteryriez following the road which his innkeeper pointed out the traveller became so absorbed in the busy movement of the communal threshingground the arrival of the yellow grain the women who were wielding pitchforks and the horses moving in circles with solemn rhythm that he nearly passed a low building the object of his search nothing could be more quaintly old and modest than the baptistery of riez it is a small square building of rough cemented stone whose stucco has worn away the roof is tiled and from out a flattened dome blades of grass sprout sparsely a tiny bellturret and an arch in the front wall complete the ornamentation of this humble diminutive bit of architecture and except that it is different from the usual provenal manner of construction one would pass many times without noticing it illustration between the columns an altar has been placedbaptistery riez walking down the steps which mark the differences that time has made in the levels of the ground and entering a small octagonal hall one of the most interesting interiors of provence meets the eye each of its four sides writes jules de laurire which correspond to the angles of the outer square has a semicircular apse built in the walls themselves the eight columns placed in a circle about the centre of the edifice divide it into a circular nave and a central rotunda and support eight arches which in turn support an octagonal drum and above this is the dome this room is of simple and charming architectural conception and even in melancholy ruin it has much beauty it gains in comparison with the reconstructed baptisteries of provence for something of a primitive character has been preserved to which such modern altars and xvii century trappings as those of aix and frjus are fatal under the heavy dust there is visible an unhappy coating of whitewash traces of a fire still blacken the walls fragments of roman sculpture are scattered about and between the columns a pagan altar has been placed for safekeeping the columns themselves are of pagan construction and as they differ somewhat in size and capitals it is not improbable that they came from the ruins of several of the great public buildings of riez at the time of the baptisterys construction the barbaric invasion had begun and these roman monuments may have been in ruins but in any case it was a pious and justifiable custom of christians to take from pagan structures standing or fallen stones and pillars that would serve for building churches to the one true god the pillars procured for this laudable purpose at riez with their beautiful carved capitals gave the little baptistery its one decoration and far from disturbing the simplicity of its style they add a slenderness and height and harmony to a room which without them would be too stiffly bare in the rotunda which they form excavations have brought to light a baptismal pool and conduits which brought to it sufficient quantities of water for the immersionwhole or partialthat was part of the baptismal service of the early church but the archological work has abruptly ceased and it is to be deeply regretted that here in this deserted place where the church desires no present restorations in accordance with particular rites or modern styles of architecture there should not be a complete rehabilitation a baptistery restored to the actual state of its own era illustration the beautiful granite columnsriez wandering across the fields with the reconstructive mania strong upon him the traveller came across the beautiful granite columns which with their capitals bases and architraves of marble are the last standing monument of riezs roman greatness fragments of sculpture bits of stone set in her walls exist in numbers but they are too isolated too vague to suggest the lost beauty and grandeur which these lonely columns express he gazed at them in wonder was he stepping where once had been a grand and busy forum was he looking at the temple of some great roman god the voices of the threshers sounded cheerily the provenal sun shone bright and warm but one of the greatest of mysteries was before himthe silent mystery of a dead past that had once been a living present he sat by the river and tossed pebbles into its shallow waters the slanting rays of the sun gave the columns delicate tints old yellows and greys and violets and at length as evening fell they seemed to grow higher and whiter in the paler light until they looked like lonely funereal shafts recalling to the memory of forgetful man riezs longdead greatness sidenote senez in the comfortable civilisation of france the stagecoach usually begins where the railroad ends and however remote a destination or tedious a journey an ultimate and safe arrival is reasonably certain this was the reflection which cheered the traveller when he began to search for senez an ancient city of the romans which was christianised in the early centuries and enjoyed the rank of bishopric until the revolution of 89 in spite of this dignified rank and the tenacity of an ancient foundation it lies so far from modern ken that even worthies who live fifty miles away could only say that senez is not much of a place but it doubtless may be found tenperhaps fifteenor even twenty kilometres behind the railroad if monsieur alighted at barrme probably the mail for senez would be left there too and where letters go some man or beast must carry them and one could always follow with these vague directions the traveller set gaily out for barrme where a greater than he had spent one bleak march night on the anxious journey from elba to paris the town shows no trace of napoleons hurried visit it looks a mere sleepy hamlet and when the traveller left the train he had already decided to push his journey onward to senez a man stepped up in answer to his inquiry certainly there was a way to get there the mailcoach started in an hour and a hotel a very good hotelnot parisian perhaps but hot food a bottle of good wine and a clean bed could one desire more on this earth the traveller thought not and left the stationto stand transfixed before the most melancholy conveyance that ever bore the highsounding name of mailcoach a little wagon in whose interior six thin persons might have crowded old windows shaking in their frames the remains of a coat of yellow paint and in front a seat which a projecting bit of roof protected from the sunthis was the mailcoach of senez drawn by a dejected small brown mule ragged with age and a gaunt white horse who towered above him to complete the equipage this melancholy pair were hitched with ropes in due course of time the driver came hooked an ancient tin box marked lettres to the dashboard threw in a sackingbag and cap in hand invited the traveller to mount with him where there was air the long whip cracked authoritatively the postilion a beautiful black dog jumped to the roof and the mailcoach of senez with rattle and creak started on its scheduled run houpl thou bag of lazy bones done up in a brown skin hol thou whited sepulchre thinkest thou i will get out and carry thee take this and that illustration the mailcoach of senez on either side the whip hit the road ferociously but the old beasts of burden shook their philosophic heads and slowly jogged on knowing well they would not be touched the hot sun of provence which drinks a river as man drinks a glass of wine shone on the long white route nationale that stretched out in wellkept monotony through a valley which might well have been named desolation on either hand rose mountains that were great masses of bare seared rocks showing the ravages of forgotten glaciers the soil that once covered them lay at their feet scarcely a shrub pushed out from the crevices and even along the road the few thin poplars found the poorest of nourishment crossing a small bridge there came into view an ancient village a mere handful of clustered wooden roofs irregular broken and decayed it was a city in the days when we were romans said the courier and they say that there are treasures underneath our soil but who can tell when people talk so much and certainly two sous earned above ground buy hotter soup than one can gain in many a search for twenty francs below he whipped up for a suitable and striking entry into town turned into a lane and with much show of difficulty in reining up stood before the hotel the traveller having descended entered a room that might have been the subject of a quaint dutch canvas he saw a low ceiling smoky walls long rows of benches a sanded floor and pineboard tables that stretched back to an open door and through the open door the pot swinging above the embers of the kitchen fire the mistress of the inn a strong whitehaired woman of seventy came hurrying in to greet her guest it was late she said and quickly put a basin full of water a new piece of soap and a fresh towel on a chair near the kitchen door and as the traveller prepared himself for dinner he heard the crackling of fresh boughs upon the fire and the cheerful singing of the pot little lamps were lighted and when he came to his tables end he found good country wine and a steaming cabbagesoup others came in to dine and smoke and talk and later from his bedroom window he saw their ghostly figures moving up and down the unlighted streets and heard them say goodnight the inndoor was noisily and safely barred and when the retreating footsteps and the voices had died away the quiet of the dark remained unbroken until a watchman with flickering lantern passed and cried aloud alls well illustration the open squaresenez next morning the sun shone brightly on senez and the traveller hurried to the open square a horse carrying a farmers boy meandered slowly by a chicken picked here and there and water trickled slowly from the tiny faucet of the village fountain illustration the palace of its prelatessenez in this quiet spot near the lonely desolation of the hills is the cathedral the palace of its prelates which is opposite is now a farmhouse where hayricks stand in the front yard and windows have been walled up because provenal winds are cold and glass is dear illustration the cathedralsenez looking at this residence one would think that the last bishops of senez were insignificant priests steeped in country wine and country stagnancy but such a supposition is very far from true for we know that in the xviii century jean soannen bishop of the city was called before a council at embrun to answer a charge of resistance to the farfamed bull unigenitus and so strong were his convictions and so great his loyalty to his conscience that he resisted the council as well as the bull and was deprived of his see as a jansenist and recalcitrant and exiled to the abbey of lachaisedieu in quiet senez there must always have been time for reflection and one can imagine the bitter struggle of this brave man as he walked the rooms of the palace as he crossed and recrossed the small square to the cathedral one can imagine his wrestling with god and his conscience every time that he celebrated a mass for the people before the cathedrals altar one can understand the bitter fight between two high ideals irreconcilable in his lifethat of work in gods vineyard or of doctrinal purity as he saw it he had to choose between them this bishop of senez and when he left the town to answer the summons of the council at embrun his heart must have been sore within him he must have said farewell to many things few decisions can be more serious than the renunciation of family and home for the service of god few more solemn than the struggles between the flesh and the spirit but no more pathetic picture can exist than that sad figure of jean soannen for he had renounced family and the world and for the sake of accepted truth which was false to him endured helpless solitary insignificance under the espionage of suspicious and unfriendly monks the traveller remembered his tomb that tomb in a small chapel near the foot of the staircase in the famous abbey faraway and sighing hoped that in his mournful exile the bishop may have realised that they also serve who only stand and wait the bull unigenitus which caused his downfall is believed to have caused during the last years of louis xivs bigotry the persecution of thirty thousand respectable intelligent and orderly frenchmen de noailles several bishops and the parliament of paris refused to accept it though they stopped short of open rebellion and even fnlon submitted rather than acceded to it this famous and vexatious document was an unhappy emanation of pope clement xiii hard pressed by his faithful supporters the jesuits he promulgated it in 1713 and it condemns with great explicitness one hundred and one propositions which are taken from quesnels jansenistic rflexions morales sur le nouveau testament the jesuits held the jansenists in a horror which the jansenists reciprocated the pope owed almost too heavy a debt of gratitude to the order of saint ignatius and was constrained to repay but the bull instead of procuring peace brought the greatest affliction and desolation of mind to his holiness and when later the french envoy asked him why he had condemned such an odd number of propositions the pope seizing his arm burst into tears ah monsieur amelot monsieur amelot what would you have me do i strove hard to curtail the list but pre le tellierlouis xivs last confessor and a devoted jesuithad pledged his word to the king that the book contained more than one hundred errors and with his foot on my neck he compelled me to prove him right i condemned only one more the cathedral of senez is an humble village church where frank and simple poverty exists with the remains of ancient splendour it is small as are all churches of its style and although it does not lack a homely dignity it is a modest work of xii century romanesque and the sonorous title of its consecration in 1242 the assumption of the blessed virgin mary suggests an impressiveness which the cathedral never had two heavy buttresses that support the faade wall are reminiscent of the more majestic notredamedubourg of digne and on them rest the ends of a pointed gableroof between these buttresses the wall is pierced by a long and graceful roundarched window and below the window is the single pointed portal whose columns are gone and whose delicate foliated carvings and mouldings are sadly worn away a sundial painted on the wall tells the time of day and at the gables sharpest point a saucy little angel with a trumpet in his mouth blows with the wind illustration the cathedralsenez entering the little portal the traveller saw the poor wooden benches of the congregation massed together and beyond them the stalls of longdeparted canons in front of these old stalls stood the churchs latest luxury a melodeon and above them hung the tapestries of its richer past tapestries also beautify the choirwalls and on either side are the narrow transepts and the apses of a good old style there are also poor and tawdry altars which stand in strange pitiable contrast with the old walls and the fine tunnel vaulting the dignified architecture of the past illustration tapestries beautify the choir wallssenez leaving the interior where a solitary peasant knelt in prayer the traveller saw sidewalls bare as the mountains round about the squat tower that rises just above the roof and coming to the apseend he found the presbytery garden from the garden beyond the fallen gate he saw the church as the cur saw it the three round apses with their little columns the smaller decorative arches of the cornices the pointed roof and between branches full of apple blossoms the softened lines of the low square tower here trespassing the cur found him and after they had walked about the town and talked the whole day long of the great world which lay so far beyond they went into the little garden as the sun was going down and fell to musing over coffee cups the priest was first to speak perhaps buried under those old church walls lie proofs of our early history the stones of some old temple or statues of its gods for we were once sanitium a roman city in a country of six roman roads perhaps all around us were great monuments of pagan wealth a mausoleum near these bare old rocks like that which stands in loneliness near saintremy villas baths or triumphal arches the keen eyes softened as he continued in gentle irony down in this little valley of the asse de blieux our town seems far away from any scene in which the great ones of earth took part although i know that it is true it often seems to me a legend that the gay and gallant francis i rushing to a mad war stopped on his way to injure us and that four hundred years ago a band of huguenots raved around our old cathedral and tried to pull it to the ground and do you think it can be true the traveller asked that bishops held mysterious prisoners in that tower for most dreary lengths of time illustration between branches full of appleblossoms the church as the cur saw itsenez the cur smiled and shook his white head that is a story which the peasants tellan old tradition of the land it may be true since priests are mortal men and doubtless dealt with sinners he smiled indulgently through the many years i have been here i have often wondered about all these things but it is seldom i can speak my thoughts sometimes when i am here alone i lose the sense of present things and seem to see the phantoms of the past then the dusk comes on as it is coming now the night blots senez from my sight as fate has blotted out its record from historyand i realise that our human memory is in vain sidenote aix the old cathedral of saintsauveur at aix is not one of those rarely beautiful churches where a complete and restful homogeneity delights the eye nor is it a church of crude and shocking transitions it is rather a wellarranged museum of ecclesiastical architecture where in sufficient historical continuity and harmony many provenal conceptions are found and the evolution of provenal architecture may be very completely followed as in all collections the beauty of saintsauveur is not in a general view or in any glance into a long perspective but in a close and loving study of the details it encloses and so charming so really beautiful are many of the diverse little treasures of aix that such study is better repaid here than in any other provenal cathedral for this is one of the largest cathedrals of the province and the buildings which form the ecclesiastical group are most complete with its baptistery cloister church and archepiscopal palace it is not only of many epochs and styles but of many historical uncertainties and the hypotheses of its construction are enough to daze the most hardened archologist illustration the south aisleaix the oldest part of the cathedral is the baptistery and the date of its origin is unknown much of its character was lost in a restoration of the xvii century but its old round form the magnificent roman columns of granite and green marble said to have been part of the temple to apollo give it an atmosphere of dignity and an ancient charm that even the xvii centuryso potent in architectural evilwas unable to destroy illustration the romanesque portal in 1060 after the destructive vicissitudes of the early centuries archbishop rostaing dhyres issued a pastoral letter appealing to the faithful to aid him in the rebuilding of a new cathedral and it may be reasonably supposed that the nave which is at present the south aisle the baptistery and the cloisters were the buildings that were dedicated less than fifty years later they are the only portions of the church which can be ascribed to so early a period and with the low door of entrance the single nave and the adjoining cloisterwalk they constitute the usual plan of xi century romanesque considering this as the early church in almost original form it will be seen that the portal is a very interesting example of the provenal use not only of roman suggestion but of the actual fragments of roman art which had escaped the invader that the south aisle in itself a completed interior bears a close resemblance to avignon and that the cloister although now very worn and even defaced must have been one of the quaintest and most delicate as it is one of the tiniest in provence three sides of its arcades support plain buildings of a later date the fourth stands free as if in ruin little coupled columns some slenderly circular some twisted and some polygonal rest on a low wall piers very finely and differently carved are at each of the arcade angles the little capitals of the columns were once beautifully cut and even the surfaces of the arches have small foliated disks and rosettes and are finished in roll and hollow unfortunately a very large part of this detailwork is so defaced that its subjects are barely suggested some are so eaten away that they are as desolate of beauty as the barren little quadrangle and the whole cloister seems to have reached the brink of that pathetic old age which shakespeare has described and that another step in the march of time would leave it sans everything illustration the cloisteraix about two hundred years later in 1285 the archbishop of aix found the cathedral too unpretending for the rank and dignity of the see and he began the gothic additions like many another prelate his ambitions were larger than his means and the history of saintsauveur from the xiii to the xix century is that ofttold tale of new indulgences offered for new contributions halts and delays in construction emptied treasuries and again appeals and fresh efforts the beginnings of the enlarged cathedral were architecturally abrupt the old nave becoming the south aisle was connected with the new by two small openings it retained much of its separateness and in spite of added chapels much actual isolation the gothic nave the north aisle and its many chapels the apse and the transepts whose building and reconstruction stretched over the long period between the xiii and xvii centuries are comparatively regular uniform and uninteresting the most ambitious view is that of the central nave whose whole length is so little broken by entrances to the side aisles that it seems almost solidly enclosed by its massive walls here in gothic bays are found those rounded longitudinal arches which belong to the romanesque and to some structure whose identity is buried in the mysterious past the choir with its long narrow windows and clusters of columnettes is very pleasing and its seven sides foreign to provence remind one of italian and spanish constructive forms and take ones memory on strange jaunts to the faraway frari in venice and the colder abbey of london from the choir of saintsauveur two chapels open and one of them is a charming bit of architecture a replica in miniature of the motherapse itself the paintings of this motherapse are neutral its glass has no claim to sumptuousness and the stalls are very unpretending but above them hang tapestries ascribed to matsys splendid hangings of the flemish school that were once in old saint pauls with these beautiful details the rich treasuretrove of the interior is exhausted and one passes out to study the details of the exterior the cathedrals single tower which rises behind the faade line was one of the parts that was longest neglectedperhaps because a tower is less essential to the ritual than any other portion of an ecclesiastical building begun in 1323 the work dragged along with many periods of absolute idleness until 1880 when a balustrade with pinnacles at each angle was added to the upper octagonal stage and the building of the tower was thus ended the octagon with its narrow windows rests on a plain square base that is massively buttressed it is a pleasant rather than a remarkable tower and ones eye wanders to the more beautiful faade here encased by severely plain supports is one of the most charming portals of provenal gothic decorated buttresses stand on either side of a large shallow recess which has a high and pointed arch and in the centre a slim pier divides the entranceway into two parts prefiguring the final division of the just and the unjust a multitude of finely sculptured statues were formerly hidden in niches under graceful canopies and in the hundred little nooks and corners which lurk about true gothic portals standing apostles and seated patriarchs baby cherubs peering out and the more dramatic composition of the tympanumthe transfigurationall lent a dignity and wealth to saintsauveur unfortunately many of these sculptures were torn from their crannies in the great revolution and it is only a few of the heavenly hoststhe gracious madonna saint michael and the prophetsthat remain as types of those that were so wantonly destroyed the low empty gables that sheltered lost statues their slender tapering turrets and the delicate outer curve of the arch are of admirable if not imposing composition the portals wooden doors protected by plain casings abound in carvings partly renaissance partly gothic the sibyls and prophets stand under canopies surrounded by foliage fruits and flowers or isolated from each other by little buttresses or pilasters this gothic portal quite outshines in its graceful elaboration the smaller door which stands near it in the simpler and not less potent charm of the romanesque and side by side these portals offer a curiously interesting comparison of the essential differences and qualities of their two great styles if the romanesque of saintsauveur is far surpassed at arles and digne and sisteron nowhere in provence has gothic richer details and if the noblest of provenal creations must be sought in other little cities the lover of architectural comparisons of details of the many lesser things rather than of the harmony of a single whole will linger long in aix illustration the cathedralaix the old city itself shows scarcely a trace of the many historic dramas of which it

a few unformed fragments of the great temple of apollo remain in the walls of saintsauveur the earliest cathedral saintemariedelaseds has entirely disappeared the old thermal springs are enclosed by modern buildings and only the statue of the good king ren and the church of the knights of malta give to aix a faint atmosphere of its past distinction who would dream that here were the homes of the elegant and lettered courtiers of king rens brilliant capital who would think that this town was the earliest roman settlement in gaul the aqu sexti of baths temples theatres and great wealth aix is a stately town a provincial capital which balzac might well have describedwith old quiet streets that are a little dreary with a fine avenue shaded by great trees in whose shadows a few fountains trickle with lines of little stages that come each day from the countrya city whose life is as far in spirit from the nearby modernity of marseilles as it is from that of paris as quaintly and delightfully provincial as that other little provenal city the tarascon of king ren and of tartarin languedoc i cathedrals of the cities sidenote nmes entering languedoc from the valley of the rhone the cathedrallover is doomed to disappointment in the city of nmes all that intense intramural life of the middle ages seems to have passed this city by and its traces which he is so eager to find prove to be neither notable nor beautiful illustration an amphitheatre which rivals the art of the coliseumnmes the great past of nmes is of a more remote antiquity than the cathedral building ages a small but exquisite temple a nymphum baths parts of a fine portal roman walls and an amphitheatre which rivals the art of the coliseumthese are the ruins of nmean greatness she was essentially a city of the romans and that even today she has not lost the memory of her glorious antiquity was well illustrated in 1874 when the nmois with much pomp and civic pride unveiled a statue to their fellowcountryman the emperor antoninus pius these are the memories in which nmes delights yet her history of later times if not glorious is full of strange and curious interest like all the ancient cities of the south she fell into the hands of many a wild and alien foe and at length in 737 charles martel arrived at her gates grossly ignorant of art no thing of beauty that stood in his path escaped fire and axe and smokemarks along the arena walls show today how narrowly they escaped the irreparable destruction which had wiped out the forum the capitol the temple the baths and all the magnificence of roman narbonne to both the early and the later middle ages roman remains had scarcely more meaning than they had for the franks the delicate temple of trajans wife scorned for its pagan associations was used as a stable a storehouse and purified by proper ceremonials it even became a christian church the amphitheatre has had a still stranger destiny to a medival viscount it was naturally inconceivable as a place of amusement and as naturally he saw in its walls a stronghold where he could live as securely as ever lord in castle as a fortress which successfully defied charles martel it was a place of no mean strength and in 1100 it had become a veritable hornets nest buzzing with warriors a few years before pope urban ii had landed at maguelonne and ridden to clermont to preach the first crusade on his return he stopped at nmes and held a council for the same holy purpose raymond de saintgilles count of toulouse and overlord of nmes travelled there to meet the sovereign pontiff and amid the wonderful ferment of enthusiasm which the holy war had aroused the south was pledged anew to this romantic and warlike phase of the cause of christ trencavel viscount of nmes loyal to god and his suzerain followed raymond to palestine its natural protectors gone the city formed a defensive association called the chevaliers of the arena as its name implies this curious fraternity was composed of the soldiers of the ancient amphitheatre like many others of the time it was semimilitary semireligious its members bound by many solemn oaths and ceremonies and thus by the eccentricity of fate this old pagan playground became a fortress consecrated to christian defence the scene of many a solemn mass the divisions in the christian faith which followed so closely the fervours of the crusades were most disastrous to nmes from the xiii until the xvii centuries wars of religion were interrupted by suspicious and unheeded truces and these in turn were broken by fresh outbursts of embittered contest an ally of the new crusaders in simon de montforts day nmes became largely protestant in the xvi century and in 1567 as if to avenge the injuries their ancestors had formerly inflicted on the albigenses the nmois sacked their bishops palace and threw all the catholics they could find down the wells of the town this celebration of saint michaels day was repaid at the massacre of saint bartholomew the wise edict of nantes brought a truce to these hostilitiesits revocation new persecutions and flights a hundred years later the huguenots were again in force and aided by the unrest of the revolution successfully massacred the catholics of the city and during the white terror of 1815 the catholics arose and avenged themselves with equal vigour when it is remembered that this savage and vindictive spirit has characterised the nmois of the last six hundred years it is scarcely surprising that they should prefer to dwell on the remote antiquity of their city rather than on the unedifying episodes of her christian history between the glories of her paganism and the disputes of christians the faith has struggled and survived but in the cathedralbuilding era religious enthusiasm was so often expended in mutual fury and reprisals that neither time nor thought was left for that common and gentle expression of medival fervour ecclesiastical architecture and the church of notredameetsaintcastor which would seem to have suffered from the neglect and ignorance of both patrons and builders is one of the least interesting cathedrals in languedoc a graceful gallery of the nave which also surrounds the choir is the notable part of the interior and the insignificance of the exterior is relieved only by a frieze of the xi and xii centuries on this frieze is sculptured in much interesting detail the biblical stories of the early years of mankind but it is unfortunately placed so high on the front wall that it seems badly proportioned to the faade and as a carved detail it is almost indistinguishable as has been finely said the whole church is gaunt and unbeautiful it is a depressing mixture of styles roman romanobyzantine and gothic and in studying its one fine detail a photograph or a drawing is much more satisfactory than an hours tantalising effort to see the original sidenote montpellier montpellier is an agreeable city clean wellbuilt intersected by open squares with widespread horizons and fine broad boulevards a city whose distinctive characteristics would appear to be wealth and a taste for art leisure and study the taste and the art are principally those of the pseudoclassic style an imitation of ancient greece and imperial rome which the french of the xviii century carried to such unpleasant excess the general characteristics of the imitation size and bombast are well epitomised in the principal statue of montpelliers fine champ de mars which represents the highheeled and luxurious louis xiv in the unfitting armour of a roman imperator mounted on a huge and restive charger such affectation in architectural subjects is the deathblow to all real beauty and originality and montpellier has gained little from its bourbon patrons except a series of fine broad vistas no city could offer greater contrast to the ancient and dignified classicism of nmes if the medival origin of montpellier were not well known one would believe it the creation of the renaissance and the few narrow tortuous streets of the older days recall little of its intense past when the city grew as never before nor since when scholars of the genius of petrarch and the wit of rabelais sought her out when she belonged to aragon or navarre and not to the king of france this is the interesting montpellier in the xiii century she had a university which the pope formally sanctioned and a school of medicine founded by arabian physicians which rivalled that of paris more significant still to languedoc her prosperity had begun to overshadow that of the neighbouring bishopric of maguelonne and a bitter rivalry sprang up between the two cities from the first maguelonne was doomed she had no schools that could rival those of montpellier she ceased to grow as the younger city increased in fame and size till even history passed her by and the stirring events of the times took place in the streets of her larger and more prosperous neighbour finally she was deserted by her bishops and no longer upheld by their episcopal dignity her fall was so overwhelming that today her medival walls have crumbled to the last stone and only a lonely old cathedral remains to mark her greatness in 1536 my lord bishop with much appropriate pomp and ceremony rode out of her gates and entered those of montpellier as titular bishop for the first time he did not find the townsmen so elated by the new dignity of the city as to have broken ground for a new cathedral nor did he himself seem ambitious as his predecessors of maguelonne had been to build a church worthy of his rank however as a bishop must have a cathedralchurch the chapel of the benedictine monastery was chosen for this honour and solemnly consecrated the cathedral of saintpierre of montpellier this chapel had been built in the xiv century and at the time of these episcopal changes only the nave was finished it was however gothic and as this style had become much favoured by the south at this late period the bishop must have believed that he had the beginning of a very fine and admirable cathedral in the religious wars which followed 1536 succeeding prelates found much to distract them from any further building the cathedral itself was so injured that such attention as could be spared from heretics to mere architectural details was devoted to necessary restorations and reconstructions and the finished saintpierre of today is an edifice of surprising modernity in the interior the nave and aisles are partially of old construction but the beautiful choir is the xix century building of rvoil of the exterior the entire apse is his also and as the portal of the south wall was built in 1884 and the northern side of the cathedral is incorporated in that of the bishops palace only the tower and the faade are medival illustration its general effect is somewhat that of a portecochremontpellier none of the towers have much architectural significance either of beauty or originality in comparison with the decoration of the faade they make but little impression this decoration has more original incongruity than any detail ever applied to faade gothic or romanesque and is an extreme example of the license which southern builders allowed themselves in their adaptation of the northern style it is a vagary and has appealed to some anglosaxon travellers but french authorities almost without dissent allude to it apologetically as unpardonable its general effect is somewhat that of a portecochre whose roofing directly attached to the front wall is gothically pointed and supported by two immense pillars the pillars end in cones that resemble nothing in the world so much as sugarloaves and the whole structure is marvellously unique yet strange to say the effect of the faade with the smoothness and roundness of its pillars and the uncompromising squareness of its towers while altogether bad is not altogether unpleasing standing before it the traveller was both bewildered and fascinated as he saw that even in the extravagance of their combinations the builders with true southern finesse had avoided both the grotesque and the monstrous illustration the finest view is that of the apsemontpellier as a whole saintpierre is a fine cathedral through many stages of building enlarging and reconstructing its style has remained consonant but the general impression is not altogether harmonious the perspective of the western front which should be imposing is destroyed by a hill which slopes sharply up before the very portal the faade is attached to the immense unbroken wall of the old episcopal palace and the majesty which is a cathedrals by very virtue of its height alone is entirely destroyed by a seemingly interminable breadth of wall reversing the natural order of things the finest view is that of the apse and this modern part is in reality the chief architectural glory of this comparatively new cathedral and its comparatively modern town sidenote bziers you have only to look from a distance at any oldfashioned cathedralcity and you will see in a moment the medival relations between church and state the cathedral is the city the first object you catch sight of as you approach is the spire tapering into the sky or the huge towers holding possession of the centre of the landscapemajestically beautifulimposing by mere size as you go nearer the pinnacles are glittering in the tints of the sunset when down below among the streets and lanes twilight is darkening and even now when the towns are thrice their ancient size the cathedral is still the governing force in the picture the one object which possesses the imagination and refuses to be eclipsed these words are the description of bziers as it is best and most impressively seen from the distance the cathedral and its ramparts rise in imposing mass a fine example of the strength pride and supremacy of the church as we approach the cathedral grows much less imposing and its faade gives the impression of an unpleasant conglomeration of styles it is not a fortress church yet it was evidently built for defence it is gothic yet the lightness and grace of that art are sacrificed to the massiveness and resistive strength imperatively required by southern cathedrals in times of wars and bellicose heretics the whole building seems a compromise between necessity and art it is however a notable example of the gothic of the south and of the modifications which that style invariably underwent through the artistic caprice of its builders or the political foresight of their patrons the bishops the faade of saintnazaire of bziers has a gothic portal of good but not notable proportions and a large and beautiful rosewindow as if to protect these weaker and decorative attempts the builder flanked them with two square towers whose crenellated tops and solid heavy walls could serve as strongholds perhaps to reconcile the irreconcilable crenellations joining the towers were placed over the rosewindow and at either end of the portal a few inches of gothic carving were cut in the towerwall the result is frank incongruity and the traveller left without regret to look at the apse it cannot be denied that the clocktower which comes into view is very square and thick but in spite of that it has a simple dignity and as the apse itself is not florid this proved to be the really pleasing detailed view of the cathedral the open square behind the church is tiny and there one can best see the curious grilled ironwork which in the times of medival outbreaks protected the fine windows of the choir and preserved them for future generations of worshippers and admirers it was after noon when the traveller finished his investigations of saintnazaire and as the southern churches close between twelve and two he took djeuner at a little caf nearby and patiently waited for the hour of reopening had there been nothing but the interior to explore he could not have spent two hours in such contented waiting but there was a cloisterand on the stroke of two he and the sacristan met before the portal illustration the clocktower is very square and thickbziers in describing their monuments french guidebooks confine themselves to facts and the adjectives fine and remarkable they are almost always strictly impersonal and the traveller who uses them as a cicerone has a sense of unexpected discovery a peculiar elation in finding a monument of rare beauty but he is never subjected to that disappointed irritation which comes when one stands before the monument and feels that ones expectations have been unduly stimulated the cloister of bziers is a fine monument but as he walked about it the traveller felt no sense of elation he found a small cloister gothic like the cathedral with clustered columns and little ornamentation it was not very completely restored and had a sad melancholy charm like a solitary sprig of lavender in an old press or a roseleaf between the pages of a worn and forgotten missal in the cloisterclose stands a gothic fountain but the days when its waters dropped and tinkled in the stillness when their sound mingled with the murmured prayers and slow steps of the prieststhose days are long forgotten the quaint and pretty fountain is now dry and dustcovered while about it trees and plants and weeds grow as they may and bits of the cloister columns have fallen off and niches are without their guarding saints illustration the quaint and pretty fountainbziers by contrast the cathedral itself seems full of life its interior is an aisleless gothic room whose fine height and emptiness of column or detail give it an appearance of vast and wellconceived proportions except the really beautiful windows of the choir which are a study in themselves there is very little in this interior to hold the mind one is lost in a pleasant sense of general symmetry as the traveller was sitting in the nave a few priests filed into the choir and began in quavering voices to intone their prayers and in the peacefulness of the church in the trembling monotony of the weak old voices his thoughts wandered to the stirring history which had been lived about the cathedral and within its very walls for bziers was and had always been a hotbed of heretics here in the iv century long before the building of the cathedral the emperor constantius ii forced the unwilling catholic bishops of gaul to join their heretical aryan brethren in council here the equally heretical visigoths gave new strength to the dissenters and here again after centuries of orthodoxy which clovis had imposed a new centre of religious storm was formed it was about this period the xii and xiv centuries that the cathedral was built and it is perhaps because of the strength of those french protestants against the church of rome the albigenses that its essentially gothic style was so confused by military additions at the beginning of the troublous times of which these towers are reminders raymondroger of trencavel the gallant and romantic lord of carcassonne was also viscount of bziers and contrary to the fanatical enthusiasm of his day was much disposed toward religious toleration therefore in the early wars of catholics and protestants the city of bziers became the refuge not only for the terrified faithful of the surrounding country but for many hunted protestants in the xiii century the zeal of the catholic party reinforced by the political interests of its members grew most hot and dangerous saint dominic had come into the south and in his fearful fiery sermons he not only prophesied that the albigenses would swell the number of the damned at the day of judgment but also advocated that living they should know the hell of inquisition partisans of the catholic faith were solemnly consecrated crusaders by pope innocent iii and wore the cross in these wars of extermination as they had worn it in the holy wars of palestine in 1209 their army advanced against bziers and from out their councils the leaders sent the bishop of the city to admonish his flock all the inhabitants were summoned to meet him and they gathered in the choir and transepts of the cathedralthe only parts which were finished at that time one can imagine the anxious citizens crowding into the church the coming of the angered prelate whose state and frown were well calculated to intimidate the wavering and the tense silence as he passed with grave blessing to the altar in a few words he advised them of their peril spiritual and material he told them he knew well who was true and who false to the church that he had in written list the very names of the heretics they seemed to harbour then he begged them to deliver those traitors into his hands and their city to the legate of the holy father in fewer words came their answer venerable father all that are here are christians and we see amongst us only our brethren such words were a refusal a heinous sin and dread must have been written on every face as without a word or sign of blessing the outraged bishop swept from the church and returned to the camp of their enemy the crusaders councils were stormy for some of the nobles wished to save the catholics others cried out for the extermination of the whole rebellious place and finally the choleric legate armandamaury abbot of cteaux could stand it no longer and cried out fiercely kill them all god will know his own the words of their legate were final the army attacked the city andas henri martin finely writesneither funeral tollings nor bellringings nor canons in all their priestly robes could avail all were put to the sword not one was saved and it was the saddest pity ever seen or heard the city was pillaged was fired was devastated and burned till no living thing remained no living thing remained to tell the awful tale and yet with time and industry a new and forgetful bziers has risen to all its old prestige and many times its former size the cathedral alone was left and its most memorable tale to our day is not that of the abiding peace of the faith but that of the terrible travesty of religion of the twentysecond of july hundreds of years ago sidenote narbonne narbonne is still mighty and healthful if one is to judge from the activities of the present day is picturesque and pleasing and far more comfortably disposed than many cities with a more magnificently imposing situation these words which were running in the travellers mind grew more and more derisive more and more ironical as he walked about narbonne not in all the south of france had he seen a city so depressing her decline has been continuous for the long five hundred years since the roman dykes gave way and she was cut off from the sea agde almost as old displays the decline of a dignified retired old age saintgillesdugard was as dirty but not a whit as pretentious nmes was majestically antique narbonne simply sordid it is sad to think that over two thousand years ago she was a second marseilles that she was the first of romes transalpine colonies and that under tiberius her schools rivalled those of the capital of the world it is sadder to think that all the magnificence of roman luxury of sculptured marblea forum capitol temples baths triumphal archesstood where dreary rows of semimodern houses now stand it is almost impossible to believe in the lost grandeur of this city and that it was veritably under the tutelage of so great and superb a god as mars the eventful christian period of narbonne was very noted but not very long her melancholy decay began as early as the xiv century of her great antiquity nothing is left but a few hacked and mutilated carvings of her ambitious medivalism nothing but an unfinished group of ecclesiastical buildings long gone is the lordly narbo dedicated to mars gone the city of the latin poet whose words repeated today in her streets are a bitter mockery and gone the stronghold of medival times there remains a rare phenomenon for cleanly francea dirty city whose older sections are reminiscent of unbeautiful old age decrepit and unwashed and whose newly projected boulevards are distinguished by tawdry and pretentious youth in the midst of this city stands a group of medival churchly buildings the palace of the prelate his cathedral and an adjoining cloister they are all either neglected unfinished or rebuilt but are of so noble a plan that the traveller feels a divine wrath that they should never have reached their full grandeur of completion that this great architectural work should have been begun so near the close of the citys prosperity and that in spite of several efforts it has never been half completed it is as if a fatality hung over the whole place and as if all the greatness narbonne had conceived was predestined to destruction or incompletion illustration the door of the cloisternarbonne of the three structures the least interesting is the former palace of the archbishops this is now the hteldeville and as all the body of the structure between the towers of the xii century was built in our day by violletleduc very little of the old palace can properly be said to exist besides its two principal towers a smaller one a gate and a chapel remain violletleduc has constructed the hteldeville after the perfectly appropriate style of the xiii century but its stone is so new and its atmosphere so modern and republican that the traveller left it without regret and made his way up the dark steep badlypaved alleyway which leads to the door of the cloister this cloister which separated the palace from the cathedral is now dreary and desolate and neglected like the cathedral it is gothic with sadly decaying traces of graceful ornament the little plot of enclosed ground which should be planted in grass or with a few flowers is a mere dirt court tramped over by the few worshippers who enter the cathedral this way two or three trees grow as they will gnarled or straight the sense of peaceful melancholy which the traveller had felt in the cloister of bziers is wanting here this is a place of deserted solitude and with a sigh for the beauty that might have been the traveller crossed the enclosure and entered the church by the cloisterdoor illustration this is a place of deserted solitudenarbonne architecturally dissimilar the fate of this cathedral is not unlike that of beauvais each was destined to have a completed choir and each to remain without a nave at beauvais the addition of transepts adds very materially to the beauty of the cathedral at narbonne no transepts exist there is simply a choir which makes a very singular disposition of the church both religious and architectural entering the gates which lead from the ambulatory to the choir the traveller found that benediction had just begun on his immediate right before the altar all aglow with lights were the officiating priests and the altarboys on his left in the choir was the congregation in the canons stalls and at the back as at the end of a nave rose the organ the traveller walked about the ambulatory and leaning against the farthest wall tried to view the church only to be baffled there was no perspective the ambulatory is very narrow and the choirscreen very high the impressions he formed were partly imaginative partly inductive and the clearest one was that of sheer height straight superhuman height that is one of the unmatchable glories of french gothic here the traveller thought again of beauvais and wished as he had so often wished in the northern cathedral and with something of the same intensity that this freedom and majesty of height might have been gloriously continued and completed in the nave such a church as his imagination pictured would have been worthy of a place with the best of northern gothic now it is a suggestion a beginning of greatness and its chief glory lies in the simplicity and directness of its height clustered columns rise plainly to the pointed gothic roof there is so marked an absence of carving that it seems as if ornamentation would have been weakening and trammelling it is not bareness but beautiful firmness which refreshes and uplifts the heart of man as the sight of some island mountain rising sheer from the sea the exterior of the cathedral imposing from a distance is rather complicated in its unfinished compromise of detail in the xv century two towers were built which flank the western end as towers usually flank a faade and this gives the church a foreshortened effect of real faade there is none and the front wall which protects the choir is plainly temporary in front of this wall there are portions of the unfinished nave stones and other building materials a scaffolding and a board fence and the only pleasure the traveller could find in this confusion was the fancy that he had discovered the oldtime appearance of a cathedral in the making the apse is practically completed and one has the curious sensation that it is a building without portals having no faade it has none of the great front entrances common to the gothic style neither has it the usual lateral door the choir is entered by the temporary doors of the pseudofaade the ambulatory is entered through the cloister or a pretty little gothic doorway which if it were not the chief entrance of the church would properly seem to have been built for the clergy rather than for the people who now use it if these portals are strangely unimportant their insignificance does not detract materially from the stateliness of the apse which is created by its great heightone hundred and thirty feet in the interior measurementand the magnificent flyingbuttresses these flyingbuttresses give to the exterior its most curious and beautiful effect they are a form of gothic seldom attempted in the south and exist here in a rather exceptional construction over the chapels which surround the apse rise a series of doublearched supports the outer ones ending in little turrets with surmounting crenellations on these supports after a splendid outward sweep rest the abutments of the flying arches these have a fine sure grace and withal a lightness that relieves the heaviness imposed on the church by the towers and the immense strength of the body of the apse they are the chief as well as the most salient glory of the exterior and give to the cathedral its peculiar individuality illustration these flyingbuttresses give to the exterior its most curious and beautiful effectnarbonne apart from its buttresses saintjust has little decorative style its crenellations and turrets are military and forceful not ornate for the church had its defensive as truly as its religious purpose and formerly was united on the north with the fortifications of the palace and contributed to the protection of its prelates as well as to their archepiscopal prestige in spite of the fostering care of the french government the palace the cloister and the cathedral seem in the hands of strangers the traveller who had longed to see them in their finished magnificence realised the futility of this wish but he turned away with another as vain that he might have known them even in incompletion when they were in the hands of the church when the archbishop still ruled in his palace when the canons prayed in the cloister and the cathedral was still abuilding sidenote perpignan perpignan like elne is in rousillon the period of her most brilliant prosperity was that of the majorcan dominion in the xii century later she reverted to aragon and was still so fine a city that for two hundred years france coveted and sought her until she finally yielded to the greedy astuteness of richelieu and became formally annexed to the kingdom of louis xiii perpignan is a gay little town much affected by the genius and indolence of the spanish race morning is worktime noontide is siesta but afternoon and evening were made for pleasure and every bright day when the sun begins to cast shadows people fill the narrow shady streets and walk along the promenade by the shallow river under the beautiful planetrees the pavements in front of the cafs are filled with little round tables and here and there small groups of men idle cheerfully over tiny glasses of liqueur and cups of cool black coffee perhaps they talk a little business certainly they gossip a great deal noisy little teams filled with merry people run down from the promenade to the seashore and after an hours dip almost in the shadow of the tall pyrnes the same merry people return laughing to a cooler perpignan in the evening they seek the bright cafs and the waiters run busily to and fro among the crowded little tables the narrow streets imperfectly lighted are full of moving shadows and through the open churchdoors candles waver in the fitful draught and quiet worshippers pass from altar to altar in penance or in supplication all the old buildings of the city are of spanish origin the prison is the brick battlemented castle of a majorcan sancho the citadel is as old and the aragonese bourse is divided between the townhall and the citys most popular caf the cathedral of saintjean which faces a desolate little square was also begun in majorcan days and under that sancho who ruled in 1324 at first it was merely a church for elne had always been the seat of the bishopric of rousillon and although the town had suffered from many wars and had long been declining it was not shorn of its episcopal glory until there was sufficient political reason for the act this arose in 1692 and was based on the oldtime french and spanish claims to the same county to which these two cities belonged illustration all of the old buildings of the city are of spanish originperpignan over a hundred years before charles viii had plenarily ceded to ferdinand and isabella all power in rousillon even that shadowy feudal suzerainty with which in default of actual possession many a former french king had consoled himself and irritated a royal spanish brother ferdinand and isabella promptly visited their new possessions and made solemn entry into perpignan unfortunately the inquisition came in their train and the unbounded zeal of the holy office brought the spanish rule which protected it into everincreasing disfavour in vain philip iii again bestowed on perpignan the title of faithful city which she had first received from john of aragon for her loyal resistance to louis xi in vain he ennobled several of her inhabitants and transferred to her from elne the episcopal power the city was ready for new and kinder masters than the most catholic kings and in 1642 the french were received as liberators during all these years the cathedral had grown very slowly commenced in 1324 over a century elapsed before the choir was finished and the building of the nave was not begun until a hundred years later the high altar a porch and the iron cage of the tower were added with equal deliberation and even today it is still unfinished the most beautiful part is the strongly buttressed apse the poorest the unfinished faade which has been very fitly described as plain and mean looking disconsolately at it from the deserted square scarcely tempted to go nearer the traveller was astounded at the thought that for several centuries this unsightly wall had stared on generations of worshippers without goading them into any frenzy of actioneither destructive or constructive his only comfort lay in the scaffolding which was building around it and which seemed to promise better things illustration the unfinished faadeperpignan the interior of the cathedral is very large and lofty it is without aisles and the chapels are discreetly hidden between the piers far above ones head curves the ribbed gothic vaulting and all around is unbroken space that ends in darkness or the vague outline of an altar dimly lighted by a flickering candle the walls are painted in rich sombre colours and the light comes very gently through the good old stainedglass windows it is a southern church dark cool and somewhat mysterious quite foreign to the glare and heat of reality people are lost in its solemn vastness and even with many worshippers it is a solitude where most holy vigils could be kept a mystic place where the southern imagination might well lose itself in such sacred ardours as saint theresa felt the traveller liked to linger here in the daytime when he peered vainly at the reredos of soler de barcelona at masstime when the lighted altarcandles glimmered over its fine old marble but best of all he liked to come at night those summer nights in rousillon were hot and full of the murmur of voices the cathedral was the only silent place more full than ever of the mysteriousthe felt and the unseen as one entered the sanctuary light shone as a star out of a night of darkness in a nearby chapel a candle sputtered itself away and a womanwhether old or young one could not seelighted a fresh taper sometimes a man knelt and told his beads sometimes two women entered and separated for their differing needs and prayers sometimes one sat in meditation or knelt unmoving for a space of time once a child brought a new candle to saint antony always some one came or some one went until the hour of closing then the bell was rung the door shut by a hand but dimly seen and the last few watchers went outacross the little square down this street or that until they were lost in the darkness of the summers night illustration the stony street of the hillsidecarcassonne sidenote carcassonne the train puffed into the station at carcassonne and the impatient traveller throwing his bags into an hotel omnibus asked for the cathedral and walked eagerly on that he might the more quickly see in line the city on the hill the castle walls as grand as those of babylon and gaze at last on carcassonne his mind was full of the poem and faithfully following directions he hurried through clean narrow streets until he came at length not upon a poetic vision of battlemented walls and towers but on the most prosaic of boulevards and the church of saintmichel which has been the cathedral since 1803 a large uncouth building with a big unfinished tower there is no faade portal and a small doorway in the north side leads into the great vaulted hall one of the most usual and commonplace forms of the gothic interior of the south this room which is painted receives light from a beautiful rosewindow at the west and a series of small roses like miniatures of the greater one are cut in the upper walls of the nave and little chapels characterised by the same heavy monotony which hangs like a pall over the whole cathedral are lost in the churchs capacious flanks illustration the ancient crosscarcassonne having lost much of his enthusiasm the traveller asked for the oldhe had almost said the realcathedral and with new directions he started afresh leaving the wellbuilt agreeable commonplace lower city of the plain he came to the bridge and there sitting on its parapet near the ancient cross he feasted his longing eyes on that perfect vision of medivalism the high arid and almost isolated hill of the cit stood before him and at the top rose battlements and flanking towers in double range bristling warlike and strong yet beautiful in their mass of uneven peaked towerroofs and crenellations he climbed wearily up the stony street of the hillside and as he passed through the open gate he realised that hunnewell had written truly when he said carcassonne is a romance of travel for he went into a town so quiet into streets so still so weedgrown and lonely and yet so well built that he felt as a fairy prince who has penetrated into some enchanted castle and it seemed as if the inhabitants were asleep in the upper rooms behind those bowed windows and as if when the mysterious word of disenchantment should be uttered all would come trooping forth menatarms hurrying to clean their rusty swords old women trudging along to fill their dusty pitchers at the well and younger women staring from doors and windows to see the stranger within their streets the cadets de gascogne knew the city before the evil spell of modern times was cast about it they know and miss it now and although they may no longer wear the plumed hat and clanking sword of their ancestors the spirit beneath their more conventional garb is as gay and daring as that of cadets more picturesque they have conceived a plan as exciting as any old adventure an idea which they present to the world not as cyrano their most famous member was wont to convey his thoughts at the end of a sword but none the less dexterously and delightfully this plan like the magic word of the travellers fancy is to make the old carcassonne live again not as the traveller had timidly imagined in time of peace but in the stirring times of war and battle and its magic word is the siege of carcassonne truly it is but a matter of bengal lights blank cartridges and firecrackers though for the matter of that cinderellas coach was but a pumpkin yet the effect was none the less real illustration often too little time is spent upon the navecarcassonne on the evening of the siege a rare great fte the forces of the cadets with their lights and ammunition are in the upper town and long before dark their friends and every inhabitant of the country for miles around have gathered in the houses which face the cit on the bridges and along the banks of the little aude as the sunlight fades and the shadows creep along a strange feeling of expectancy comes over everybody a hush almost a dread of danger the towers on the hilltop loom dark against the sky and the battlements bristle in the moonlight no sound comes from the cit and it seems to lay in unconcerned security memories of besieging armies which have vainly encamped in this valley return to the travellers mind memories of the treacheries of simon de montfort and he wonders if any crusading sentinel ever paced where he now stands watching along the aude if any spy or even the terrible simon himself had ever crept so near the walls to reconnoitre suddenly every one is startled by the sound of distant shots which are repeated nearer the walls every one peers into the darkness there is no sign of life on wall or tower the attacking force must still be climbing the hill out of range of the stones and burning oil of the defenders more shots are fired and now there are answering shots from the besieged and so naturally does the din increase that one can follow by listening the progress of the attack and the slow sure gain of the invader some of the illusion of the anxiety and mental tension which war brings steals over the watching crowd and they breathlessly await the outcome of the struggle the attacking party is now seen under the wallsnow on themthey throw wads of burning cotton which are at first extinguished they still gainthey fire the walls in several places and the defenders who can be seen in the flashes of light run frantically to the danger spots but they are gradually overcome beaten back by the intensity of the heat flames now burst forth from a tower there is an explosion and the fire curls and creeps along the walls unchecked another explosion follows another burst of flames which soar higher and higher the men of the cit seem still more frantic and powerless all the towers now stand out in bold reliefas if they were just about to crumble into the seething mass below roofs within the walls are on fire and finally a red tongue licks the turret of the cathedral in a few seconds its walls are hideously aglow and the people in the valleyalthough they know the truthgroan aloud so real is the illusion the nave lines of the cathedral are silhouetted as it burns the fires along the walls growing brighter spread gradually at firstthen rapidly and the whole cit is the prey of great waving clouds of flame and smoke men and women as if fascinated by this lurid and magnificent destruction press forward to get the last view of the cathedrals lovely rose or the peaked roof of some tower which is dear to them but slowly the deep red flames are growing paler less strong and less high then the glare too begins to die away the fire turns to smoke and the light becomes grey and misty it is all over some one whispers and with backward glances at the charred smoldering hilltop they turn silently towards home a few sitting on the stone parapet of the bridge remain to talk of the evenings magic of the inspiration of the cadets de gascogne and other scenes which their memory suggests of wars and rumours of other wars and when at length they turn to go they see the moonlight on the glimmering aude the peaceful lower city and above carcassonnethe invinciblerising from her ashes illustration the choir is of the xiv centurycarcassonne illustration the faadestraight and massivecarcassonne the cathedral of the cit is worthy of great protecting walls and there are few churches whose destruction would have been so sad a blow to the architecture of the midi saintnazaire is typical at once of the originality of the southern builders of their idealism and their joyous freedom from conventional thrall the faade straight and massive has the frowning severity of an old donjon wall its towers are solid masses of heavy stone instead of spires there are crenellations instead of graceful flyingbuttresses at the sides there are solid upright supports on the firm plain sidewalls this is the true old romanesque a few steps further and the apse appears as great a contrast to the body of the church as a bit of mechlin lace to a coatofmail a little tower with gargoyles another with a finecarved turret windows whose delicate traceries could be broken by a blow and an upper balustrade which would have been as easily crushed as an eggshell in the hands of the lusty huguenotsthese are the ornaments of its wall as true xiv century gothic as the nave is xii century romanesque it is sadly disappointing to find the cloisters in uninteresting ruin but the church within is so full of great beauty that all other things are unimportant the windows glow in the glory of their glass and the tombs especially those of the lower chapel of the bishop are wonderfully carved the first burial place of de montfort terrible persecutor of his churchs foes lies near the high altar and in the wall there is a rude basrelief representing his siege of toulouse all these admirable details are puny in comparison with the interior which contains them it is to be feared that often too little time is spent upon the nave even in midday lighted by the southern sun its beautiful severe lines are mellowed but little and one turns too instinctively to the gothic the greater lightness beyond yet it is a nave of exceedingly fine rugged strength and to pass on lightly to belittle it in comparison with its brighter choir is to wantonly miss in the great round columns the heavy piers and the dark tunnel vaulting the conception of generations of men who had ever before their mindand literally believeda mighty fortress is our god the choir is of the xiv century a day when the beauty of holiness seems to have been the cathedral architects ideal delicate clustered columns from which saints look down long windows beautifully veined a glorious rose at each transepts end and high vault arches springing with a slender pointed grace all these are of exquisite proportions and the brilliant stainedglass adds a softening warmth of colour but not too great a glow to the cold fragility of the shafts of stone nothing in the gothic art of the south little of gothic elsewhere is more thoughtfully and lovingly wrought than this choir of saintnazaire and few churches in the romanesque form are more finely constructed than its nave on the exterior the gothic choir and the romanesque nave are so different in style it seems they must be perforce antagonistic that the grace of the gothic must make romanesque plainness appear dull or that the noble simplicity of the rounded arch must cause the gothic arches here so particularly tall and slender to seem almost fragile and undignified in reality this juxtaposition of the styles has justified itself and passing from one to the other the traveller is more impressed by the subtle analogies they suggest than by the differences of their architectural forms on weekdays when the church is empty they seem to prefigure the two ideals of the religion which they servethe stern selfconquering asceticism of a saint dominic and the exquisite radiant visions which saint cecelia saw when heavenly music was vouchsafed her or if one has time to fancy further the nave is the epic of its great religion the choir a song which is the expression of most delicate aspiration most tender worship on sunday when to this beauty of the godly habitation is added all the beauty of worship the music of the oldest organs in france slowmoving priests in gorgeous vestments sweet smelling incense chants and prayers of a most majestic ritual one is tempted to read into these stones symbolical meaningsas if the heavy nave where the dim praying figures kneel were typical of their life of struggleand their glances altarward where all is light and beauty presaged their final coming into the presence and glory of god illustration perspective of the romanesquecarcassonne hunnewell has finely written that while the passions and the terrors of a fierce rude age made unendurable the pleasant land where we may travel now so peacefully and while religion grown political forgot the mercy of its lord and ruled supreme an earnest faith and consecrated genius were creating some of the noblest tributes man has offered to his creator and it may be truly said that of these one of the noblest is the church begun in that most cruel age of saint dominic and de montfort in the very heart of the country they laid waste in the city which one conquered by ruse and the other tortured by inquisition the old cathedral of saintnazaire in carcassonne sidenote castres in the vii century castres which had been the site of a roman camp became that of a benedictine abbey and around this foundation as about so many others a town grew through the middle ages and came safely to prosperity and importance untrue to its early protectors and in opposition to the fervent orthodoxy of the neighbouring city of albi castres became a protestant stronghold and its fortunes rose and fell with the chances of religious wars it was perhaps one of the most intrepid and obstinate of all the centres of heresy and the centuries of struggle seem only to have strengthened the fierceness of its faith in 1525 when the duke de rohan was absent and a royal army again summoned it to submission and conversion the duchess had herself carried from a sick bed to the gate of the city which was threatened and it is related that the inhabitants of all classes men women and children without distinction of sex or age armed themselves and rushed victoriously to her aid thirtyfive years later their children sacked churches destroyed altars and images and drove out monks and nuns bellicose incidents make history a thrilling story but they are accompanied by such material destruction that they too often rob a city of its greatest treasures and leave it as far as architectural interest is concerned an arid waste such a place is castres prosperous industrial historically dramatic but actually commonplace old houses picturesque and mouldy with irregular overhanging eaves lean along the banks of the little river as they are wont to line the banks of every old stream of the midi and they are nearly all the remains of castres medivalism for her streets are wellpaved trolleys pass to and fro department stores are frequent and that most modern of vehicles the automobile does not seem anachronistic no building could be more in harmony with the citys atmosphere of uninteresting prosperity than its cathedral and he who enters in search of beauty and repose is doomed to miserable disappointment confronted in the xiv century by a growing heresy john xxii devised among other less christian methods of combat that of the creations of sees whose power and dignity of rank should check the progress of the enemies of the church and in 1317 that year which saw the beginning of so many of these new sees the old benedictine abbey of castres lying in the very centre of protestantism was created a bishopric the century if unpropitious to catholicism was favourable to architecture the abbey was of ancient foundation and from either of these facts a fine cathedral might reasonably be hoped fora dim abbeychurch whose rounded arches are lost in the gloom of its vaulting or a bit of southern gothic which the newly consecrated prelate might have ambitiously planned but the cathedral of saintbenot is neither of these for it was reconstructed in the xvii century the xvii century in all its confusion of ideas all its lack of taste all its travesty of styles there is the usual multitude of detail the usual unworthiness portals which have no beauty an expanse of unfinished faade dark ugly walls whose bareness is not sufficiently hidden by the surrounding houses heavy buttresses ridiculously topped off by globes of stonesuch are the salient features of the exterior of saintbenot the spaciousness of the interior has given room if not for an impartial representation at least for a reminder of all the styles of architecture to which the xvii century was heir there is the renaissance conception of the antique in the ornamental columns in the rosewindow there is a tribute to the gothic the tradition of the south is maintained by a coat of coloursmany if subdued and the ground plan of nave and sidechapels might be called romanesque although the vaulting is high and the room large there is no simplicity no beauty no artistic virtue in this interior opposite the church is the episcopal palace which mansart built a large construction that serves admirably as a city hall behind it along the river are the charming gardens designed by le ntre where bishops walked and meditated looking upon their not too faithful city of castres upon this very ground was the ancient abbey and close of the benedictines and as if in memory of these monkish predecessors bishop and builder of the xvii century left in an angle of the palace the old abbeytower this is the treasure of castres past a romanesque belfry with the pointed roofing of the campanile of italy heavy in comparison with their grace and stout and strong sidenote toulouse toulouse is one of the most charming cities of the south of france it is also one of the largest but in spite of its size it is neither noisy nor stupidly conventional it is on the contrary an ideal provincial capital where everything even the climate corresponds to our preconceived and somewhat romantic ideal of the southern type when the wind blows from the desert it comes with fierce and sudden passion the sun shines hot and under the awnings of the open square men fan themselves lazily during a long lunch hour under this appearance of semitropical languor there is the persistent energy of the great southern peoples an energy none the less real because it is broken by the long siestas the leisurely mealtimes and the daytime idling which seem so shiftless and so strange to northern minds this is the energy however which has made toulouse a rich opulent citya city with broad boulevards open squares and fine buildings and a city of the gay renaissance rather than of the stern middle ages yet for toulouse the middle ages were a dark time what could be gotten by the sword was taken by the sword and even the mind of man in that gross age was forced and controlled by the agony of his body it is a time whose most peaceful outward signs the churches have been preserved to toulouse and the warsigns towers walls and fortifications dungeons and the tortureirons of inquisition are nowand wiselyhidden or destroyed of the fierce tragedies which were played in toulouse even to the days of the great revolution few traces remainthe stern orthodox figure of simon de montfort and of count raymond his too politic foe and the anguish of the crusaders siege the bent form of jean calas and the shrewd keen face of voltaire who vindicated him from afar these memories seem dimmed and those which live are of lighthearted troubadours and gaily dressed ladies of the city of the gay insouciant renaissance to whom an autodaf was a gala between the blithesome robing of the morning and the serenade in the moonlight fierce and steadfast sentimentally languishing dying for a difference of faith or dying as violently to avenge the insult of a frown or a lifted eyebrow such are the languedocians whom toulouse evokes near to the gascons and akin to them here is the acadmie des jeuxfloreaux the college of gay wit which was founded in the xiv century and still distributes on the third of every may prizes of gold and silver flowers to poets and writers of fine prose and here are many htels of the renaissance rich and beautiful homes of the old toulousan nobility whose courts are all too silent here is the htel du vieuxraisin the maison de pierre and the htel dasszat where jeanne dalbret lived and nearby is a statue of her son the strongest sanest and most debonnaire of all the great southmen henry of navarre here in toulouse is indeed material for a thousand fancies illustration the nave of the xiii century is an aisleless chamber low and broadly archedtoulouse and here the cathedralseeker who had usually had the proud task of finding the finest building in every city he visited was doomed to disappointment in vain he tried to console himself with the fact that toulouse had had two cathedrals of one there was no trace in the other confusion and he was met with the axiom true in architecture as in other things that two indifferent objects do not make one good one the dalbade formerly the place of worship of the knights of malta has a more elegant tower the church of the jacobins a more interesting one the portal of the old chartreuse is more beautiful the church of the bull more curious and the basilica of saintsernin so interesting and truly glorious that the cathedral pales in colourless insignificance some cities of medival france possessed at the same time two cathedrals two bodies of canons and two chapters under one and the same bishop such a city was toulouse and until the xii century saintjacques and saintetienne were rival cathedrals then for some reason obscure to us saintjacques was degraded from its episcopal rank and remained a simple church until 1812 when it was destroyed the present cathedral of saintetienne is a combination of styles and a violation of every sort of architectural unity and realises a confusion which the most perverse imagination could scarcely have conceived according to every convention of building the cathedral is not only artistically poor but mathematically insupportable the proportions are execrable and the interior the finest part of the church reminds one irresistibly of a good puzzle badly put together the weak tower is a sufficient excuse for the absence of the other from the tower the roof slopes sharply and unreasonably and the rosewindow is perched with inappropriate jauntiness to the left of the main portal the whole structure is not so much the vagary of an architect as the sport of fate the selfevident survival of two unfitting faades walking through narrow streets one comes upon the apse as upon another church so different is its style it is disproportionately higher than the faade instead of being conglomerate it is homogeneous instead of a squat appearance uninterestingly grotesque it has the dignity of height and unity and although it is too closely surrounded by houses and narrow streets and although a view of the whole apse is entirely prevented by the high wall of some churchly structure it is the only worthy part of the exterior and by comparison even its rather timid flyingbuttresses and insignificant stone traceries are impressive illustration the present cathedral is a combination of stylestoulouse the nave of the early xiii century is an aisleless chamber low and broadly arched as the eye continues down its length it is met by the south aisle of the choiropening directly into the centre of the nave except for this curiously bad juxtaposition both are normally constructed and each is of so differing a phase of gothic that they give the effect of two adjoining churches the choir was begun in the late xii century on a new axis and was evidently the commencement of an entire and improved reconstruction in spite of the poorly planned restoration in the xvii century the worthy conception of this choir is still realised it is severe lofty gothic majestic by its own intrinsic virtue and doubly so in comparison with the uncouth puzzlebox effect of the whole its unity came upon the traveller with a shock of surprise relieving and beautiful and after he had walked about its high narrow aisles and refreshed his disappointed vision he left the cathedral quicklylooking neither to the right nor to the left without a trace of the temptation of lots wife to glance backward sidenote montauban although montauban was founded on the site of a roman station the mons albanus it is really a city of the late middle ages recreated as it were by alphonse i count of toulouse in 1144 and it was even a greater hotbed of heretics than bziers incited first by hatred of the neighbouring monks of le moustier and then by the bitter agonies of the inquisition it became fervently albigensian and as fervently huguenot and even now it has many protestant inhabitants and a protestant faculty teaching theology the montauban of the present day is busy and prosperous very prettily situated on the turbid little tarn in spite of her constant loyalty to the huguenot cause perhaps partly because of it she has had three successive cathedrals saintmartin burned in 1562 the procathedral of saintjacques and finally notredame the present episcopal church a heavy structure in the italian style of the xviii century large and light and bare the nudeness of the interior is uncouth and the stiff exterior decorated with statues impresses one as pleasantly as clothes upon crossed beanpoles it is artificial and mannered the last of the city cathedrals of languedoc and the least if the notorious vices of the xviii century were as bad as its style of ecclesiastical architecture they must have been indeed
