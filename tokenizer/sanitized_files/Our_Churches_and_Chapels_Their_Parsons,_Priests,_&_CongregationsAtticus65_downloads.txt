of every place of worship in preston by atticus a hewitson t is pleasant through the loopholes of retreat to peep at such a worldcowper reprinted from the preston chronicle printed at the chronicle office fishergate preston 1869 to the reader the general satisfaction given by the following sketches when originally printed in the preston chronicle combined with a desire largely expressed to see them republished in book form is the principal excuse offered for the appearance of this volume into the various descriptions of churches chapels priests parsons congregations c which it contains a lively spirit which may be objectionable to the phlegmatic the sadfaced and the puritanical has been thrown but the author who can see no reason why a man whose blood is warm within should sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster on any occasion has a large respect for cheerfulness and has endeavoured to make palatable by a little genial humour what would otherwise have been a heavy enumeration of dry facts those who dont care for the gay will find in these sketches the grave those who prefer vivacity to seriousness will meet with what they want those who appreciate all will discover each the solemn are supplied with facts the facetious with humour the analytical with criticism the work embodies a general history of each place of worship in prestonfuller and more reliable than any yet published and for reference it will be found valuable whilst for general reading it will be instructive the author has done his best to be candid and impartial if he has failed in the attempt he cant help it if he has succeeded he is thankful no writer can suit everybody and if an angel had compiled these sketches some men would have croaked to the generality of the church of england catholic and dissenting clergymen c in the town the author tenders his warmest thanks for the generous manner they have assisted him and the kindly way in which they have supplied him with information essential to

is important that something should be known about our churches and chapels it is more important that we should be acquainted with their parsons and priests it is most important that we should have a correct idea of their congregations for they show the consequences of each and reflect the character and influence of all we have a wide field before us the domain we enter upon is unexplored our streets with their midday bustle and midnight sin our public buildings with their outside elaboration and inside mysteries our places of amusement with their gilded fascinations and shallow delusions our clubs bar parlours prisons cellars and workhouses with their amenities frivolities and severities have all been commented upon but the most important of our institutions the best the queerest the solemnest the oddestthe churches and chapels of the townhave been left out in the cold entirely all our public functionaries have been viewed round examined closely caressed mildly and sometimes genteely maltreated our parochial divinities who preside over the fate of the poor our municipal gogs and magogs who exhibit the extreme points of reticence and garrulity in the council chamber our brandy drinkers chronic carousers lackered swells pushing shopkeepers otiose policemen and dimlooking cabdrivers have all been photographed framed and hung up to dry long ago our workshops and manufactories our operatives and artisans have likewise been duly pictured and exhibited the ribble has had its praises sung in polite literary strains the parks have had their beauties depicted in rhyme and blank verse naybut this is hardly necessarythe old railway station that walhallah of the gods and paragon of the five orders of architecture has had its delightful peculiarities set forth all our public places and public bodies have been thrown upon the canvas except those of the more serious typeexcept places of worship and those belonging them these have been neglected nobody has thought it worth while to give them either a special blessing or a particular anathema there are about 45 churches and chapels and probably 60 parsons and priests in preston but unto this hour they have been treated so far as they are individually concerned with complete silence we purpose remedying the defect supplying the necessary criticism and filling up the hiatus the whole lot must have either something or nothing in them must be either useful or useless parsons must be either sharp or stupid sensible or foolish priests must be either learned or illiterate either good bad or indifferent in all from the rector in his silken gown to the back street psalmsinger in his fustian there must be something worth praising or condemning and the churches and chapels with their congregations must likewise present some points of beauty or ugliness some traits of grace or godlessness some features of excellence dignity piety or sham there must be either a good deal of gilded gingerbread or a great let of the genuine article at our places of worship but whether there is or there is not we have decided to say something about the church and the chapel the parson and the priest of each district in the town this is a mere prologue and we shall but hint at the general theme on this occasion churches and chapels are great institutions in the land nobody knows the exact time when the first was thought of and it has not yet transpired when the last will be run up but this is certain we are not improving much in the make of them the sunday sanctums and sabbath conventicles of today may be mere ornate may be more flashy and show more symptoms of polished bedizenment in their construction but threefourths of them sink into dwarflings and mediocrities when compared with the rare old buildings of the past in strength and beauty in vastness of design and skill of workmanship in nobility of outline and richness of detail the religious fabrics of these times fall into insignificance beside their grand old predecessors and the manner in which they are cut up into patrician and plebeian quarters into fashionable coteries for the perfumed portion of humanity and into halfstarved benches with the brand of poverty upon them for the poor is nothing to the credit of anybody all the churches and chapels of the land may profess christianity but the game of the bulk has a powerful reference to money those who have got the most of the current coin of the realm receive the blandest smile from the parson the politest nod from the beadle the promptest attention from that strange mixture of piety and pay called the chapelkeeper those who have not got it must take what they can get and accept it with christian resignation as st paul tells them this may be all right we have not said yet that it is wrong but it looks suspicious doesnt itshows that in the arena of conventional christianity as in the seething maelstrom of ordinary life money is the winner our parsons and priests like our ecclesiastical architecture and general church management do not seem to have improved upon their ancestors priests are not as jolly as they once were in olden days holy fathers could wear horsehair shirts and scarify their epidermis with a finer cruelty than their modern successors and they could after all that make the blithest songs sing the merriest melodies and quaff the oldest port with an air of jocund conscientiousness making one slyly like them however much inclined to dispute the correctness of their theology and the parsons of the past were also a blithesome set of individuals they were perhaps rougher than those mild and refined gentlemen who preach nowadays but they were straightforward thorough absolutely english well educated and stronger in the brain than many of them in each episcopalian catholic and dissenting community there are new some most erudite most useful men but if we take the great multitude of them and compare their circumstancestheir facilities for education the varied channels of usefulness they havewith those of their predecessors it will be found that the latter were the cleverer often the wiser and always the merrier men plainness erudition blithesomeness were their characteristics aye look at our modern men given up largely to threnodychiming and to polishing off tea and muffin with elderly females and compare them say for instance with the poet praeds immortal vicar who wisely wore the cleric gown sound in theology and liquor quite human though a true divine his fellowmen he would not libel he gave his friends good honest wine and drew his doctrine from the bible institute a comparison and then you will say that whilst modern men may be very aesthetic and neatly dressed the ancient apostolic successors though less refined had much more metal in them were more kindly genial and told their followers to live well to eat well and to mind none of the hairsplitting neological folly which is now cracking up christendom in old times the lord did not call so many parsons from one church to another as it is said he does now in the days which have passed the bulk of subordinate parsons did not feel a sort of conscientious hankering every three years for an enlarged sphere of usefulness where the salary was proportionately increased we have known multitudes of parsons in our time who have been called to places where their salaries were increased we know of but few who have gravitated to a church where the salary was less than the one left business enters largely into the conceptions of clergymen as a rule no teachers of religion except catholic priests and methodist ministers leave one place for another where less of this worlds goods and chattels predominate and they are compelled to do so else the result might be different when a priest gets his mittimus he has to budge it is not a question of he said or she said but ofgo and when a wesleyan is triennially told to either look after the interests of a fresh circuit or retire into space he has to do so it would be wrong to say that lucre is at the bottom of every parsonic change but it is at the foundation of the great majorityeh if it isnt just make an inquiry as we have done this may sound like a deviation from our textperhaps it is but the question it refers to is so closely associated with the subject of parsons and priests that we should have scarcely been doing justice to the matter if we had not had a quiet fling at the money part of it in the letters which will follow this we shall deal disinterestedly with all shall give churchmen catholics quakers independents baptists wesleyans ranters and calathumpians fair play our object will be to present a picture of things as they are and to avoid all meddling with creeds people may believe what they like so far as we are concerned if they behave themselves and pay their debts it is utterly impossible to get all to be of the same opinion creeds like faces must differ have differed always will differ and the best plan is to let people have their own way so long as it is consistent with the general welfare of social and civil life it being understood that the milk of human kindness is within the pale of the church we shall begin there the parish church of preston will constitute our first theme no i preston parish church it doesnt particularly matter when the building we call our parish church was first erected and if it did the world would have to die of literary inanition before it got the exact date none of the larger sort of antiquaries agree absolutely upon the subject and the smaller fry go in for all sorts of figures varying as to time from about two years to one hundred and fifty this may be taken as a homoeopathic dose in respect to its history built about 900 years since by catholics and dedicated to st wilfrid handed over to protestants by somebody who was perhaps acting on the very generous principle of giving other folks property in the 16th century rebuilt in 1581 and dedicated to st john rebuilt in 1770 enlarged elaborated and rejuvenised in 1853 plagued with dry rot for a considerable time afterwards in a pretty good state of architectural health now and likely to last out both this generation and the next it looks rather genteel and stately outside it has a good steeple kept duly alive by a congregation of traditional jackdaws it has a capital set of bells which have put in a good deal of overtime during the past five months through a pressure of election business and in its entirety as baines once remarked the building looks like a good ordinary parish church there is nothing either snobbish or sublime about it and speaking after josh billings its a fair evengoing critter capable of being either pulled down or made bigger that is about the length and breadth of the matter and if we had to appeal to the commonwealth as to the correctness of our position it would be found that the ayes have it we dont believe in the parish church but a good deal of people do and why shouldnt they have their way in a small fight as well as the rest of folk all except mormons and fenians who honestly believe in anything are entitled to respect our parish church has a good contour and many of its exterior architectural details are well conceived and arranged but like other buildings of the same order it has got a multiplicity of strange hobgoblin figureheads about it which serve no purpose either earthly or heavenly and which are understood by hardly one out of five million we could never yet make it out why those grotesque pieces of masonrygargoyles we believe they are called were fixed to any place of worship around our parish church and halfway up the steeple there are at almost every angle and prominence rudely carved monstrosities conspicuous for nothing but their ineffable and heathenish ugliness huge eyes great mouths immense tooth savage faces and distorted bodies are their prime characteristics the man who invented this species of ecclesiastical decoration must have been either mad or in the horrors an evenly balanced mind could never have thought of them and why they should he specially tacked to churches is a mystery in accordance with neither king solomon nor cocker the graveyard of our parish church is we dare say something which very few people think of we have seen many such places in our time but that in connection with our parish church is about the grimmest specimen in the lot it has a barren cold dingy unconsecrated look with it and why it should have we cant tell either ruffianism or neglect must at some time have done a good stroke of business in it for many of the gravestones are cracked in two some are nearly broken to pieces and a considerable number of those in the principal parts of the yard are being gradually worn out we see no fun for instance in paving the entrances to the church with gravestones somebody must at some time have paid a considerable amount of money in getting the gravestones of their relatives smoothed and lettered and it could never have been intended that they should be flattened down close as tile work for a promiscuous multitude of people to walk over and efface the back of the churchyard is in a very weary delapidated and melancholy state why cant a few shrubs and flowers be planted in it why is not the ground trimmed up and made decent from the time when the egyptians worshipped cats and onions down to the present hour religious folk have paid some special attention to their grave spaces and we want to see the custom kept up our parish church yard has a sad forsaken appearance if it had run to seed and ended in nothing or had been neglected and closed up by an army of hypochondriacs it could not have been more gloomy barren or disheartening the ground should be looked after and the stones preserved as much as possible it is a question of shoes v gravestones at present and if there is not some change of position the shoes will in the end win about the interior of our parish church there is nothing particularly wonderful it has a respectable substantial reverential appearance and that is quite as much as any church should have there is no emblematic ritualistic moonshine in any part of it we hope there never may be we are sure there never will be so long as the men now at the helm are in office but let us start at the beginning the principal entrance is through a massive and somewhat dimlylighted porch which in its time has necessarily like all church porches been the scene of much pious gossip superstition and sanctimonious scandal it is rather a snug place to halt in if you stand on one side of the large octagonal font which is placed in the centre of the inner perch and patronised by about 20 of the rising race every sunday afternoon you will be able to see everybody whilst nobody can distinctly see you as a rule many people are too fired or too ill or too idle to go to a place of worship on a sunday morning and at our parish church one may plainly notice this a certain number always put in a regular appearance if they did not attend the parish church twice a day they would become apprehensive as to both their temporal respectability awl spiritual welfare they are descendants of the old longhorned stock and have a mighty notion of the importance of churchgoing probably they dont care very profoundly for the sermons but they have got into a safesided orthodox groove and some of them have an idea that they will be saved as much by church going as by faith the members of this class have a large notion of the respectability of their individual pews and seats if they belonged to a family of five hundred each and if every one of them had to go to church every sunday they would want their respective seats prayer books footstools and all that sort of thing they dont like to see strangers rambling about in search of a resting place they are particularly solemnlooking and give symptoms of being on the border of some catastrophe if an unknown being shows any disposition to enter their pews and some of them would see a person a good deal beyond the ether side of jordan before they would think of handing him a prayer book we dont suppose any of them are so precise as the old gentleman who once when a stranger entered his pew doubled up the cushion sat upon it in a twofold state and intimated that ordinary beards were good enough for interlopers but after all there is much of the number one principle in the devotion of these goodly followers of the saints and they have been so long at the game that a cure is impossible taking the congregation of our parish church in the agregate it is a fair sample of every class of human life you have the old maid in her unspotted demurelycoloured moire antique carrying a prayer book belonging to a past generation you have the ancient bachelor with plenty of money and possessing a thorough knowledge as to the safest way of keeping it his great idea being that the best way of getting to heaven is to stick to his coins attend church every sunday and take the sacrament regularly you have the magistrate whose manner if not his beard is of formal cut the retired tradesman with his domestic looking wife and smartlydressed daughters ten times finer than ever their mother was the manufacturer absorbed in cotton and wondering when he will be able to do a good stroke of business on change again the lawyer who has carried on a decent business amongst fees during the week and has perhaps turned up to join in the general confession the doctor ready to give emphasis to that part of it which says and there is no health in us the pushing tradesman who has to live by going to church as well as by counter work the speculating shopkeeper who has a connection to make the young finelyfeathered lady got up in silk and velvet and carrying a chignon sufficient to pull her cerebellum out of joint the dandy buttoned up to show his figure and heavily dosed with scent the less developed young swell who is always talking about his pa and his ma and has only just begun to have his hair parted down the middle the broken down middleaged man who was once in a good position but who years since went all in a piece to pot the snuffloving old woman who curtsies before fine folk who has always a long tale to tell about her sorrows and who is periodically consoled by a trifle the working man who is rather a scarce article except upon special occasions and the representative of the poorest class living somewhere in that venal slum of slime and misery behind the church a considerable number of those floating beings called strags attend the parish church they go to no place regularly they gravitate at intervals to the church mainly on the ground that their fathers and mothers used to go there and because they were christened there but they belong a cunning race they can scent the battle from afar and they generally keep about threequarters of a mile from the parish church when a collection has to be made to the ordinary attendants collections do not operate as deterrents but to the strags they are frighteners whats the reason there are so few people here we said one day to the beadle and that most potent grave and reverend seignior replied with a rogersonian sparkle in his rolling eye theres a collection and the strags wont take the bait it is the same more or less at every place of worship and to tell the truth theres a sort of instinctive dislike of collections in everybodys composition the congregation of our parish church is tolerably numerous and embraces many fine human specimens money and fashion are well represented at it and as zadkiel and the author of pogmoor almanac say those powers have to rule for a long time we may take it for granted that the parish church will yet outlive many of the minor raving academies in which they are absent there is touch more generalisation than there used to be as to the sittings in our parish church but birds of a feather flock together still the rich know their quarters exquisite gentlemen and smart young ladies with morroccobound giltedged prayer books still cluster in special sections and although it is said that the poor have the best part of the church allotted to them the conspicuousness of its position gives a brand to it neither healthy nor pleasant they are seated down the centre aisle but the place is too demonstrative of their poverty if half the seats were empty situated excellently though they may be you wouldnt catch any respectable weasle asleep on them if some doctor or magistrate or private bibandtucker lady had to anchor here supposing there were any spare place in any other part of the house there would be a good deal of quizzing and wonderment afloat if you dont believe it put on a highly refined dress and try the experiment and if you are not very specially spotted we wild give a fifty dollar greenback on behalf of the society for converting missionary eaters in chillingowullabadorie we shall say nothing with regard to the ordinary service of the parish church except this that it would look better of three fourths of the congregation if they would not leave the responses to a paid choir lor bless yer as betsy jane ward would say a choir will sing anything put before them if it is set to music and they think no more of getting through all that sad business about personal sinfulness agonising repentance and a general craving for forgiveness than the odd woman did when she used to kiss her cow and say it was delicious there was once a period when all parish church goers made open confession joined audibly in the prayers and said amen as if they meant it although we are doubtful about even that now the choir does all the work and the congregation are left behind the distance post to think about the matter but if it suits the people its quite right there are three parsons at our parish churchcanon parr who is the seventeenth vicar in a regular line of succession since the reformation and two curates as to the curates we shall say nothing beyond this that one has got a better situation and is going to it and that the other would like one if he could get itnot that the present is at all bad only that there are others better we dont know how many curates there have been at the parish church since the reformation but it may be safely said that in their turn they have as a rule accepted with calm and christian resignation better paid places when they had a fair opportunity of getting them we are not going to say very much about cannon parr and let nobody suppose that we shall make an effort to tear a passion to tatters regarding any of his peculiarities canon parr is an easygoing genial educated man kindly disposed towards good living not blessed with over much money fond of wearing a billycock and strongly in love with a cloak he has seen much of the world is shrewd has a long head has both studied and travelled for his learning and is the smartest man preston protestants could have to defend their cause but he has a certain amount of narrowness in his mental vision and like the bulk of parsons can see his own way best he has a strong temper within him and he can redden up beautifully all over when his equanimity is disturbed if you tread upon his ecclesiastical bunions he will give you either a dark mooner or an eye openerwe use these classical terms in a figurative sense he will keep quiet so long as you do but if you make an antagonistic move be will punish you if possible he can wield a clever pen his style is cogent scholarly and unless overburdened with temper dignified he can fling the shafts of satire or distil the balm of pathos can be bitter saucy and aggravating can say a hard thing in a cutting style and if he does not go to the bone its no fault of his he can also tone down his language to a point of elegance and tenderness can express a good thing excellently and utter a fine sentiment well his speaking is modelled after a good style but it is inferior to his writing in the pulpit he expresses himself easily often fervently never rantingly the pulpit of the parish church will stand for ever before he upsets it and he will never approach that altitude of polemical phrenitis which will induce him to smash any part of it his pulpit language is invariably well chosen some of his subjects may be rather commonplace or inappropriate but the words thrown into their exposition are up to the mark he seldom falters he has never above one and now finally brethren in his concluding remarks he invariably gives over when he has donea plan which john wesley once said many parsons neglected to observe and his congregation whether they have been awake or fast asleep generally go away satisfied canon parr has been at our parish church nine and twenty years and although we dont subscribe to his ecclesiastical creed we believe he has done good in his time he is largely respected he would have been more respected if he had been less exacting towards dissenters and less violent in his hatred of catholics neither his churchrate nor easter due escapade improved his position and some of his fierce antipopery denunciations did not increase his circle of friends but these things have gone by and let them be forgotten in private life canon parr is essentially social he can tell a good tale is full of humour he knows a few things as well as the rest of men and is charitably disposedindeed he is too sympathetic and this causes hint to be pestered with rubbishy tales from all sorts of individuals and sometimes to act upon them as if they were true as a protestant vicarand remembering that no angels have yet been born in this country that everybody is somewhat imperfect and that folk will differwe look upon canon parr as above the average he has said extravagant and unreasonable things in his time but he has rare properties qualities of sense and erudition which are strangers to many pretentious men in his line of business and on the whole he may be legitimately set down in the language of the gods as ok no ii st wilfrids catholic church it was at one time of the day a rather dangerous sort of thing for a man or a woman or a mediumsized infant living in this highly favoured land of ours to show any special liking for roman catholicism but the days of religious bruising have perished and catholics are now in the main considered to be human as well as other people and to have a right to live and put their sunday clothes on and go to their own places of worship like the rest of mortals no doubt there are a few distempered adherents of the immortal william school who would like to see catholics driven into a corner banished or squeezed into nothing probably there are some of the highly sublimated no surrender gentlemen who would be considerably pleased if they could galvanise the old penal code and put a barrel able to play the air of boyne water into every street organ but the great mass of men have learned to be tolerant and have come to the conclusion that catholics civilly and religiously are entitled to all the liberty which a free and enlightened constitution can conferto all the privileges which fairplay and evenhanded justice call give and if these are not fully granted now the day is coming when they will be possessed lancashire seems to be the great centre of catholicism in england and preston appears to be its centre in lancashire this benign town of preston with its fervent galaxy of lecturing curates and its noble army of high falutin incumbents is the very fulcrum and lever of northern romanism if catholics are wrong and on the way to perdition and blisters there are 33000 of them here moving in that very awkward direction at the present a number so large whether right or wrong cannot he despised a body so great whether good or evil will by its sheer inherent force persist in living moving and having a fair share of being you cant evaporate 33000 of anything in a hurry and you could no more put a nightcap upon the catholics of preston than you could blacken up the eye of the sun that stout old vatican gentleman who storms this fast world of ours periodically with his encyclicals and who is known by the name of pius ix must if he knows anything of england know something of preston and if he knows anything of it he will have long since learned that wherever the faith over which he presides may be going down the hill it is at least in preston as well as can be expected and likely for a period longer than be will live to bloom and flourish our text isst wilfrids catholic church preston this place of worship is situated in a somewhat sanctified placechapelstreet but as about half of that locality is taken up with lawyers offices and the centre of it by a police station we fancy that this world rather than the next will occupy the bulk of its attention it is to be hoped that st wilfrids which stands on the opposite side will act as a healthy counterpoisewill at any rate maintain its own against such formidable odds the building in chapelstreet dedicated to the old anglesaxon bishopst wilfrid who was a combative sort of soul fond of argumentatively knocking down obstreperous kings and ecclesiastics and breaking up the strongholds of paganismwas opened seventysix years ago it signifies little how it looked then today it has a large appearance there is nothing worth either laughing or crying about so far as its exterior goes it doesnt look like a church it resembles not a chapel and it seems too big for a house there is no effort at architectural elaboration in its outer arrangements it is plain strong large and like big feet or leathern shirts has evidently been made more for use than ornament but this style of phraseology only refers to the extrinsic part inside the church has a vast ornate and magnificent appearance no place of worship in preston is so finely decorated so skilfully painted so artistically got up in the world of business there is nothing like leather in the arena of religion there seems to be nothing like paint every church in the country makes an effort to get deeply into the region of paint they will have it upon either windows walls or ceilings it is true that dissenters do not dive profoundly into the coloured abyss but weakness of funds combined with defective aesthetic cultivation may have something to do with their deficiency in this respect those who have had the management and support of st wilfrids in their hands have studied the theory of colour to perfection and whilst we may not theologically agree with some of its uses one cannot but admire its general effect saints angels rings squares floriations spiralizations and everything which the brain or the brush of the most devoted painter could fairly devise are depicted in this church and there is such an array of them that one wonders how anybody could ever have had the time or patience to finish the work the high altar which occupies the southern end is in its way something very fine a magnificent picture of the crucifixion occupies the back ground flowers and candles in numbers sufficient to appal the stoutest evangelical and turn to blue ruin such men as the editor of the bulwark are elevated in front over all as well as collaterally there are inscriptions in latin designs in gold and azure and vermilion fill up the details and on each side there is a confessional wherein all members whether large or diminutive whether dressed in corduroy or smoothest blackest broad cloth in silk or surat cotton must unravel the sins they have committed this confession must be a hard sort of job we know for some people but we are not going to enter upon a discussion of its merits or demerits only this may be said that if there was full confession at every place of worship in preston the parsons would never get through their work every day from an early hour in the morning until a late period of the evening st wilfrids is open to worshippers and you may see them some with smiling faces and some with very elongated ones going to or coming from it constantly like tennysons stream they evince symptoms of constant movement and the only conclusion we can fairly come to is that the mass of them are singularly in earnest there are not many protestants neither church people nor dissenters neither quiescent quakers nor revivalist dervisheswho would be inclined to go to their religious exercises before breakfast and if they did some of them like the old woman who partook of sacrament in minnesota would want to know what they were going to get for it on sundays as on week days the same businesslaborious as it looks to outsidersgoes on there are several services and they are arranged for every class for those who must attend early for those who cant for those who wont and for those who stir when the afflatus is upon them there are many however who are regular attendants soon and late and if precision and continuity will assist them in getting to heaven they possess those auxiliaries in abundance the congregation attending on a sunday is a mixed onerags and satins moleskins and patent kids are all duly represented and it is quite a study to see their wearers put in an appearance directly after entrance reverential genuflections and holywater dipping are indulged in some of the congregation do the business gracefully others get through it like the very grandfather of awkwardness the irish who often come first and sit last are solemnly whimsical in their movements the women dip fast and curtsy briskly the men turn their hands in and out as if prehensile mysticism was a saving thing and bow less rapidly but more angularly than the females then you have the slender young lady who knows what deportment and reverence mean who dips quietly and makes a partial descent gracefully the servant girl who goes through the preliminary somewhat roughly but very earnestly the smart young fellow who dips with his gloves ona rather lazy kind of thing as the cobbler remarked when he said his prayers in bedand gives a sort of half and half nod as if the whole bend were below his dignity the business man who goes into the water and the bowing in a matteroffact style who gets through the ceremony soon but well and moves on for the next comer the youth who touches the water in a comeandgo style and makes a bow on a similar principle the aged worshipper who takes kindly but slowly to the hallowed liquid and goes nearly upon his knees in the fulness of his reverence and towards the last you have about six sisters of mercy belonging st wilfrids convent who pass through the formality in a calm easy finished manner and then hurry along some with veils down and others with veils up to a side sitting they have there is no religious shoddy amongst these persons they may look solemn yet some of them have finely moulded features they may dress strangely and gloomily yet if you converse with them they will always give indications of serener spirits whether their profession be right or wrong this is certain they keep one of the best schools in the town and they teach children mannersa thing which many parents cant manage they also make themselves useful in visiting they have a certain respect for faith but more for good works and if other folk in christendom held similar views on this point the good done would in the end be greater all these sisters of mercy are accomplishedthey are clever in the head know how to play music to paint and to sew can cook well if they like and its a pity they are not married but they are doing more good single than lots of women are accomplishing in the married state and we had better let them alone its dangerous to either command or advise the gentler sex and as everything finds its own level by having its own way they will we suppose in the end one of the most noticeable features in connection with the services at st wilfrids is the music it is proverbial that catholics have good music you wont find any of the drawling facepulling rubbishy melodies worked up to a point of agony in some places of worship countenanced in the catholic church all is classicalall from the best masters there is an enchantment in the music which binds youmakes you like it whether you will or not at st wilfrids there is a choir which cant be excelled by any provincial body of singers in the kingdom the learned individual who blows the organ may say that the comparative perfection attained in the orchestra is through the very consummate manner in which he raises the wind the gentleman who manipulates upon its keys may think he is the primum mobile in the matter the soprano may fancy she is the life of the whole concern the heavy bass or the chief tenor may respectively lay claim to the honour but the fact is its amongst the lot so that there may be a general rubbing on the question of service and a reciprocal scratching on the point of ability there are several priests at st wilfrids they are all jesuits to the marrow and the chief of them is the rev father cobb each of them is cleverfar cleverer than many of the halffeathered curates and fullfledged incumbents who are constantly bringing railing accusations against them and they work harderget up sooner go to bed laterthan the whole of them they jump at midnight if their services are required by either a wild irishman in canalstreet or a gentleman of the first water in any of our mansions it is not a question of cloth but of souls with them they are afraid of neither plague pestilence nor famine they administer spiritual consolation under silken hangings as well as upon straw lairs in the fever stricken garret as well as in the gilded chamber neither the nature of a mans position nor the character of his disease enters into their considerations duty is the star of their programme action the object of their lives they receive no salaries their simple necessaries are alone provided for some of them perhaps get halfacrown a month as pocket money but that will neither kill nor cure a man sevenpence halfpenny per week is a big sumisnt itbig enough for a jesuit priest but calculated to disturb the christian balance of any other class of clergymen if it isnt try them in reference to the priests of st wilfrids we shall only specially mention and that briefly the rev father cobb no man in preston cares less for fine clothes than he does we once did see him with a new suit on but neither before nor since that ever memorable day have we noticed him in anything more ethereal than a plain wellworn coat waistcoat and pair of trousers he might have a finer exterior but he cares not for this kind of bauble he knows that trappings make neither the man nor the christian and that elaborate suits are often the synonym of elaborate foolery he takes a pleasure in work is happy inaction and hates both clerical and secular indifference priests he thinks ought to do their duty and men of the world ought to discharge theirs in education father cobb is far above the ordinary run of men he has a great natural capacity which has been well regulated by study he is shrewd has a strong intuitive sense cant be got over wont be beaten out of the field if you once get him into it and is sure to either win or make you believe that he has like all strong catholics he has much venerationthat organ speaking in the vernacular of phrenology is at the top of the head and you never yet saw a thorough catholic who did not manifest a good development of it he is strong in ideality has also a fine vein of humour in him can laugh say jolly as well as serious things and is a positively earnest and practical preacher he speaks right out to his hearers hits them hard in reference to both this world and the next tells them what to eat drink and avoid says that if they get drunk they must drop it off that if they stuff and gormandise they will be a long while before reaching the kingdom of heaven that they must avoid dishonesty falsehood impurity and other delinquencies and furthermore intimates that they wont get to any of the saints they have a particular liking for by a round of simple religious formalitythat they must be good do good and behave themselves decently individually and collectively we have never heard a more practical preacher he will tell young women what sort of husbands to get young men what kind of wives to choose married folk how to conduct themselves and old maids and bachelors how to reconcile themselves virtuously to their fate there is no halfandhalf ring in the metal he moulds it comes out clear sounds well and goes right home in delivery he is eloquent in action rather brisk and he weighsone may as well come down from the sublime to the ridiculousabout thirteen stones he is a jolly hearty earnest devoted priest is cogent in argument homely in illustration tireless in work determined to do his duty and if we were a catholic we should be inclined to fight for him if any one stepped upon his toes or said a foul word about him here endeth our epistle to the romans no iii cannonstreet independent chapel fortyfour years ago the ebenezer of a few believers in the bird offreedom school with a spice of breezy religious courage in their composition was raised at the bottom of cannonstreet in preston and to this day it abideth there why it was elevated at that particular period of the worlds history we cannot say neither does it signify it may have been that the spirit of an irrepressible brown older than the harpers ferry gentleman was marching on at an extra speed just then for let it be known to all and singular that it was one of the universal brown family who founded the general sect or it may have been that certain prestonians with a lingering touch of the scots wha hae material in their blood gave a solemn twist to the line in burnss epistle and decided to go in for the glorious privilege of being independent be that as it may it is clear that in 1825 the independents planted a chapel in cannonstreet places of worship like everything else good or evil grow in these latter days and so has cannonstreet chapel in 1852 its supporters set at naught the laws of banting and made the place bigger it was approaching a state of solemn tightness and for the consolation of the saints the ease of the fidgety and the general blissfulness of the neighbourhood it was expanded cannonstreet chapel has neither a bell nor a steeple nor an outside clock and it has never yet said that it was any worse off for their absence but it may do for chapels like churches are getting proud things nowadays and they believe in both lacker and gilt there is something substantial and respectable about the building it is neither gaudy nor paltry neither too good nor too bad looking nobody will ever die in a state of architectural ecstacy through gazing upon it and not one out of a battalion of cynics will say that it is too ornamental it is one of those wellfinished middleclass looking establishments about which you cant say much any way and if you could nobody would be either madder or wiser for the exposition usually the only noticeable feature about the front of itand that is generally the place where one looks for the virtues or vices of a thingis a series of cagedup boards announcing homilies and tea parties and collections all over the north lancashire portion of congregational christendom it is to be hoped that the sermons are not too dry that the tea saturnalias are neither too hot nor too wet and that the collections have more sixpenny than threepenny pieces in them the interior of cannonstreet chapel has a spacious and somewhat genteel appearance a practical business air pervades it there is no storied window scarcely any dim religious light and not a morsel of extra colouring in the whole establishment at this place the worshippers have an idea that they are going to get to heaven in a plain way and if they succeed all the betterwe were going to say that they would be so much the more into pocket by it freedom of thought sincerity of heart and going as straight to the point as possible is what they aim at there are many seats in cannon street chapel and as it is said that hardly any of them are to let the reverend gentleman who makes a stipulated descent upon the pew rents ought to be happy it is but seldom the pews are well filled they are not even crammed on collection sundays but they are paid for and if a congenial wrinkle does not lurk in that fact for the ministerhe will find neither the balm of gilead nor a doctor anywhere the clerical notion is that pew rents as well as texts must be stuck to and if those who pay and listen quietly acquiesce then it becomes a simple question of so mote it be for outsiders the congregation at cannonstreet chapel is made up of tolerably respectable materials it is no common dissenting rendezvous for illclad screamers and roaring enthusiasts neither fanatics nor ejaculators find an abiding place in it not many poor people join the charmed circle a middleclass shopkeeping halo largely environs the assemblage there is a good deal of pride vanity scent and silkrustling astir in it every sunday just as there is in every sacred throng and the oriental theory of caste is not altogether ignored the ordinary elements of every christian congregation are necessarily visible herebacksliders and newly caught communicants ancient women duly converted and moderately fond of tea snuff and charity people who cough continually and will do so in their graves if not closely watched parties with the fates against them who fly off periodically into fainting fits contented individuals whose gastric juice flows evenly who can sleep through the most impassioned sermon with the utmost serenity weatherbeaten orthodox souls who have been recipients of ever so much daily grace for half a life time and fancy they are particularly near paradise lofty and isolated beings who have a fixed notion that they are quite as respectable if not as pious as other people easygoing welldressed creatures whose life glides away in a mild and amiable conflict between the claims of piety and good breeding but the bulk are of a substantial mediumgoing description practical sharp respectable and naturally inclined towards a free well got up reasonable theology there is nothing inflamed in themnothing indicative of either a very thick or very thin skin any of them will lend you a hymn book and whilst none of them may be inclined to pay your regular pew rent the bulk will have no objection to find you an occasional seat and take care of you if there would be any swooning in your programme clearheaded and full of business they believe with binney in making the best of both worlds they will never give up this for the next nor the next for this into their curriculum there enters as the american preacher hath it a sensible regard for piety and pickles flour and affection the means of grace and good profits crackers and faith sincerity and onions benevolence cheese integrity potatoes and wisdomall remarkably good in their way and calculated when well shaken up and applied to christianise anybody the genteel portion of the congregation principally locate themselves in the side seats running from one end of the chapel to the other the every day mortals find a resting place in the centre and the galleries the poorer portion are pushed frontwards below where they have an excellent opportunity of inspecting the pulpit of singing like nightingales of listening to every articulation of the preacher and of falling into a state of coma if they are that way disposed the music at this place of worship has been considerably improved during recent times but it is nothing very amazing yet there is a curtain amount of cadence along with a fair share of power in the orchestral outbursts the pieces the choir have off go well those they are new at rather hang fire but we shall not parry with either the conductor or the members on this point they all manifest a fairlydefined devotional feeling in their melody turn their visual faculties in harmony with the words expand and contract their pulmonary processes with precision and if they mean what they sing they deserve better salaries than they usually get they are aided by an organ which is played well and we hope paid for the minister of cannonstreet chapel is the rev h j martyn who has had a good stay with the brethren considering that their fighting weight is pretty heavy and that some of them were made to have their way frequently independents are in hot water concerning their pastors in preston they are very exemplary in this respect the grimshaw street folk have had a storm in a tea pot with one of their ministers so have the lancasterroad christians and so have the cannonstreet believers and the beauty of it is they generally win born to have their own way in sacred matters they can turn off a parson if they cant defeat him in argument and that is a great thing they hold the purse strings and no parson can live unless he has a call to some other vineyard if they are closed against him on the whole the present minister of cannonstreet chapel has got on pretty evenly with his flock he has had odd skirmishes in his spiritual fold and will have if he stays in it for ever but the sheep have a very fair respect for the shepherd and can paint the lily gracefully a while since they gave him leave of absencepaying his salary of course whilst awayand on his return some of them got up a tea party on his behalf and made him a presentation there might be party spirit or there might be absolute generosity in such a move but the parson was no loserhe enjoyed the out and accepted with christian fortitude the gift the rev h j martyn is a small gentleman considerably below the average of parsons in physical proportion but he consoles himself with the thought that he is all right in quality if not in quantity diminutive men have generally very fair notions of themselves small men as a rule are smarter than those of the bulky and adipose school and harmonising with this regulation mr martyn is both sharp and kindly disposed towards himself he is not of opinion like one of his predecessors that he assisted at the creation of the world and that the endurance of christianity depends upon his clerical pivot but he believes that he has a mission and that on the whole he is quite as good as the majority of congregational divines there is nothing pretentious in his appearance nothing ecclesiastical in his general framework and in the street he looks almost as much like anybody else as like a parson the education of mr martyn is equal to that of the average of dissenting ministers and better than that of several he is however more of a reader than a thinker and more of a speaker than either on the platform he can make as big a stir as men twice his size his delivery is moderately even his words clear and he can throw a good dash of imagination into his language in the pulpit to the foot of which place he is led every sunday by certain sacred diaconal lamas who previously rub him down and saddle him for action in a contiguous apartmentin the pulpit we say he operates in a superior style and he looks better theremore like a parsonthan anywhere else he is here above the ordinary level of his hearers if it were not for the galleries minute as may be his physiology he would be the loftiest being present and if he wishes to keep up appearances we would advise him to remain in the pulpit and have his meals there casting joking overboardout of the pulpit if you likeit may be said that mr martyn as a preacher has many fair qualities it is true he has defects but who has notunless it be a deaconstill there is something in his style which indicates earnestness something in his language demonstrative of culture and eloquence his main pulpit fault is that he goes off too soon and too frequently in the course of a sermon he will give you three or four perorations and sometimes wind up without treating you to one there is nothing very metaphysical in his subjects sometimes he wanders slightly into space occasionally he exhausts himself in fighting out the mysteries of faith and grace and justification but in the ordinary run of his talk you can get good pictures of practical matters he is a lover of nature is fond of talking about the sublime and the beautiful conjointly with other things freely named in burkes essay can pile up the agony with a good deal of ability and split the ears of the groundlings as the occasion requires he can get into a white heat quickly or blow his solemn anger graduallywind it up by degrees and make it burst at a given point of feeling he is a better declaimer than reasonerhas a stronger flow of imagination than logic there is nothing bitter or mocking in his tone he seldom flings the shafts of ridicule or irony he constructs calmly and then sends up the rocket he draws you slowly to a certain point and then tells you to look out for its coming his apparatus is well fixed he can give you any kind of dissolving view his ecstacies are rapid and therefore soon over the level places in his sermons are rather heavy and at times uninteresting it is only when the thermometer is rising that you enjoy him and only when he reaches the climax and explodes that you fall back and ask for water and a fan taking him in the aggregate we are of opinion that he is a good preacher that he goes through his ordinary duties easily and complacently he gets well paid for what be doeslast year his salary exceeded 340 pounds and our advice to him iskeep on good terms with the bulk of the brethren hammer as much piety into them as possible tickle the deacons into a genial humour and look regularly after the pew rents no iv lunestreet wesleyan methodist chapel wesleyan methodism first breathed and opened its eyes in or about the year 1729 it was nursed in its infancy at oxford by two rare brothers and a few students was christened at the same place by a keenlyobserving slightlysatirical collegian developed itself gradually through the country took charge of the neglected masses and gave them a new life and today it is one of the great religious forces of the world the first wesleyan chapel in preston was built in the year 1787 and its situation was in that consecrated and highly aromatic region of the town called backlane there was nothing very prepossessing or polished nothing particularly fashionable or attractive about the profession of methodism in those days it was rather an indication of honest fanaticism than of deliberate reasoningrather a sign of being solemnly on the rampage than of giving way to careful convictionand more symptomatic of a sharp virtuous rant got up in a crack and to be played out in five minutes than of a judicious move in the direction of permanent good the orthodox looked down with a genteel contempt upon the preachers whose religion had converted kingswood colliers and turned cornwall wreckers into honest men and the formally pious spoke of the worshippers at this new shrine of faith with a serene sneer and classed them as a parcel of fiercely ejaculating hymnsinging nonentities but there was vitality at the core of their creed and its fuller triumphs were but a question of time in 1817 methodism became dissatisfied with its backlane quarters and migrated into a lighter healthier and cleaner portion of the townlunestreetwhere a building was erected for its special convenience and edification it was not a very elegant structure it was in fact a plain phlegmatic aggregation of brick and mortar calculated to charm no body externally and evidently patronised for absolute internal rapture in 1861 the chapel was rebuiltenlarged beautified and made fine so as to harmonise with the laws of modern fashion and afford easy sitting room for the large and increasing congregation attending it the frontispiece is of a costly character but it has really been born to blush unseen it is so tightly wedged in between other buildings is so evenly crammed into companionship with the ordinary masonry of the street that the general effect of the tall arch and spacious porch is lost nothing can be distinctly seen at even a moderate distance you have to get to the place before you become clearly aware of its existence and if you wish to know anything of its appearance you have either to turn the head violently off its regular axis or cross the street and ask somebody for a step ladder the facade of the building is not very prepossessing the large arch which has given way at some of the joints considerably and has been doing its best to fall for about six years does not look wellit is too high and too big for the place the stonework within is also hid and the whitewashed ceiling above ought to be either cleaned or made properly black at present it is neither light nor dark and is rather awkwardly relieved at intervals with cobwebs there is something humorous and incongruous in the physical associations of this chapel it is flanked with a doctors shop and a moneylending establishment with a savings bank and a solicitors office the bank nestles very complacently under its lower wing and in the ratio of its size is a much better looking building the text regarding the deposit of treasure in that place where neither moth nor rust operate may be well worked in the chapel but it is rather at a discount in the immediate neighbourhood a great work in the business of spreading wesleyan methodism has been done by the people and parsons of lunestreet chapel we know of no place in the town whose religious influence has been more actively radiated its power a few years ago spread into the northern part of the town and the result was a new chapel with excellent schools there it then moved eastward and the consequence was a school chapel in st marystreet in croftstreet canal street and on the marsh it has also outposts whose officers are fighting the good fight with lung and head and heart in a sprightly and vigorous fashion originally what is termed the circuit of lunestreet embraced places 18 or 20 miles from preston but the area of the sacred circumbendibus was subsequently reduced and its servants now find that they have as much on hand as they can fairly get through by looking after half of the town and a few of the contiguous villages there are none of those solemn milkmen called deacons in connection with wesleyanism still there are plenty of medicine men up up the ears in grace and business belonging it at lunestreet chapel as at all similar places there are classleaders circuit stewards chapel stewards and smaller divinities who find a niche in the general pantheon of duty the cynosure of the inner circle is personal piety combined with a penny a week and a shilling a quarter all members who can pay this have to do so beneath the chapel there is a sunday school which operates as a feeder when the scholarsthere are 500 or 600 of them altogether show certain symptoms of inherent rectitude and facial exactness when they answer particular questions correctly and pass through the crucial stages of probation consistently they are drafted into the church and presented with licences of perennial happiness if they choose to exercise them the school is well supervised and if some of the teachers are as useful and consoling at home as they are in their classes their general relatives will be blissful the congregation of lunestreet chapel is moderately numerous but it has been materially thinned at intervals by the establishment of other wesleyan chapels in its circuit there are now between 800 and 900 persons known as members who are going on their way rejoicing at the chapel itself there are between 300 and 400 individuals similarly situated viewed in the aggregate the congregation is of a middle class character both in regard to the colour of the hair and the clothes worn there are some exceedingly poor people at the place but the mass appear to be individuals not particularly hampered in making provision for their general meals lunestreet chapel is the fashionable wesleyan tabernacle of preston the better end of those whose minds have been touched through either tradition or actual conviction with the beauties of methodism frequent it there is more silk than winsey more cloth than hodden grey and a good deal more false hair and artificial teeth in the building on a sunday than can be found by fair searching at any other wesleyan chapel in the town a sincere desire to flee from the wrath to come and be saved from their sinsthe only condition which john wesley insisted upon for admission into his societiesdoes not prevent some of the members from attending determinedly to the bedizenments conceits and spangles of this very wicked speck in the planetary system in the congregation there are many most excellent hardworking thoroughly sincere men and women who would be both useful and ornamental to any body of christians under the sun but there are in addition as there are in every building set apart for the purposes of piety several who have more frill than shirt and much more cry than wool about themrectified beautifully selfrighteous children who would sugar over a very ugly personage ten hours out of the twelve every day and then at night thank the lord for all his mercies in lunestreet chapel faction used to run high and wilfulness was a gem which many of the members wore very near their hearts but much of the old feudal spirit of party fighting has died out and there are signs of pious resignation and loving kindness in the flock which would at one time have been rare jewels a somewhat lofty isolation is still manifested here and there a few regular attenders appear heavily oppressed with the idea that they are not only as good as anybody else but much better still this is only human nature and no process of convertibility to the most celestial of substances can in this world entirely subdue it the bruising deacon who said that grace was a good thing but that that knocking down an impertinent member was a better didnt miss the bulls eye of natural philosophy very far the observation was not redolent of much christian spirit but it evinced that which many of the saints are troubled withhuman nature lunestreet chapel contains standing sitting and sleeping room for about 1400 people the bulk who attend it take fair advantage of the accomodation afforded for the first and second positions a moderate number avail themselves of the privileges held out for the whole three postures the chapel is not often crowded it is moderately filled as a rule and there is no particular numeric difference in the attendance at either morning or evening service on a sunday the singing is neither loftily classic nor contemptibly commonplace it is good medium well modulated melody heartily got up and thoroughly congregational in some places of worship it is considered somewhat vulgar for members of the congregation to give specimens of their vocalisation and you can only find in out oftheway side and back pews odd persons warbling a mild falsetto or piping an eccentric tenor or doing a heavy bass on their own responsibility but at lunestreet chapel the general members of the congregation go into the work with a distinct determination to either sing or make a righteous noise worthy of the occasion they are neither afraid nor ashamed of the job and we hope they draw consolation from it the more genteel worshippers take up their quarters mainly on the ground floorat the back of the central seats and at the sides the poor have resting places found for them immediately in front of the pulpit and at the rear of the galleries very little of that unctuous spasmodic shouting which used to characterise wesleyanism is heard in lunestreet chapel it has become unfashionable to bellow it is not considered the thing to ride the high horse of vehement approval and burst into luminous showers of amens and halleleujahs now and then a few worshippers of the ancient type drop in from some country place and explode at intervals during the course of some impulsive prayer or gleeful hymn or highly enamelled sermon you may occasionally at such a time hear two or three in distant pews having a delightful time of it at first they only stir gently as if some on were mildly pinching or tickling them gradually they become more audible and as the fire of their zeal warms up and the eloquence of the minister enflames they get keener fiercer more rapturous the intervals of repose are shorter the moments of ecstacy are more rapid and fervent and this goes on with gathering desperation until the speaker reaches hisclimax and stops to either breathe or use his handkerchief but hardy a scintilla of this is perceived on ordinary occasions indeed it has become so unpopular that an exhibition of it seems to quietly amuseto evoke mild smiles and dubious glancesrather than meet with reciprocity of approval it must be some great man in the region of wesleyanism some grand tearing pathetic eloquent preacher who can stir to a point of moderate audibility the voices of the multitude of worshippers in lunestreet chapel the ten commandments occupy a prominent position and that is a good thing it would be well if they were fastened up in every place of worship and better still if the parsons referred to them more frequently respecting the ministers of the chapel in question we way say that there are three none of them can stay less than one nor more than three years it is a question of hey prestoquick change every third year the names of the triumvirate at lunestreet are the rev w mearns ma who is the superintendent the rev w h tindall second in command and the rev f b swift the general clerical servant of all work mr mearns is a calm rather bilious looking elderly man there is nothing bewitching in his appearance he looks like what he isa quietlydisposed evenlytempered methodist minister he is neither fussy nor conceited nor fond of brandishing the sword of superiority he goes about his work steadily and is as patient in harness as out of it he has northern blood in his veins which checks impulsiveness and everything approaching that solemn ferocity sometimes displayed in methodist pulpits there is nothing oratorical in his style of delivery it is calm slow and has a rather soporific influence upon his hearers there is more practical than argumentative matter in his sermons but in the aggregate they are hard and drylack lustre and passion and this combined with his stoical manner of delivery has a chilling rather than an attractive influence he always speaks in harmony with the rules of grammar his sentences although uttered extemporaneously are invariably well finished and scholarly his words are well chosen they are fit in with cultivated exactitude and polished precision they will stand reading nay they will read excellentlyinfinitely better than the burning rhapsody of more phrensied and eloquent men but they fall with a longdrawn dulness upon the ear when first uttered and dont as sam slick would say get up ones steam anyhow mr mearns has a clear head and a good heart but his spoken words want power and immediate brightness and his style is deadened for the want of a little enthusiasm the rev mr tindall comes up in a more polished energetic and fashionable garb he is eloquent argumentative polemical his literary capacity is good and it has been well trained he has read much and studied keenly his sermons are well thought out he has copious notes of them and when he enters the pulpit they are made complete for actionare fully equipped in their sunday clothes and ready for duty his delivery is good but physical weakness deprives it of potency and his contempt of the clock before him renders people now and then uneasy his manner is refined his matter is select but there is something in both at times which you dont altogether believe in digesting a rather haughty dictatorial ring is sometimes noticed in them a large notion of the importance of the preacher occasionally peeps up he has a perfect right to venerate mr tindall and if he is a little fashionable what of thatisnt it fashionable to be fashionable only this may be carried a little too far even in men for whom pulpits are made and circuits formed and it is not always safe to let organ 15 in phrenological charts get the upper hand after all we admire mr tindalls erudition and eloquence he is free from vulgarity and in general style miles ahead of many preachers in the same body whose great mission is to maltreat pulpits and turn religion into a rhapsody of words the wellmeaning and plodding mr smith succeeds he is a hard worker but there does not appear to be over much in him at present more thinking and a greater experience of life may cause him to germinate agreeably in a few years his style is stereotyped and copied there is a lack of original force in him when he talks you know whats coming nextyou can tell five minutes off what he is going to say and that rather spoils the sensation of newness and surprise which one likes to experience when parsons are either pleasing or terrifying sinners but mr swift does his best and according to ebenezer elliot he does well who does that it would be wrong to deal harshly with a new beginner and therefore we have decided to check our criticismto be briefwith mr swift and express a hope that in time he will be president of the conference no v fishergate baptist chapel the right thing in regard to baptism is a recondite point but we are not going to enter into any controversy about it we shall say nothing as to the defects or merits of aspersion or sprinkling immersion or dipping affusion or pouring opinions vary respecting each system and one may fairly say that the words uttered in explanation of the general theme come literally to us in the voice of many waters jacob the patriarch was the first baptist the jews kept up the rite moderately but had more faith in its abstergent than spiritual influence john turned it into an institution of christianity the primitive church carried on the business slowly turtullian kicking against and cyprian lauding it in the fifth century baptism became fully established amongst all christian communities then the eastern and western churches quarrelled as to whether sprinkling or immersion constituted the proper ceremony other small disputes concerning the modus operandi followed and from that time to this the adherents of each scheme have spilled a great deal of water in piously working out their notions there was once a time when nobody could undergo the ordinary process of baptism except at easter or whitsuntide but children and upgrown people can now be put through the ceremony whenever it is considered necessary in preston as elsewhere the majority of people think well of water when it is required by children for engulphing or baptismal purposes but they care little for its use when the teens have been trotted through it may be right enough for the physical and religious comfort of babes and sucklings but its virtues recede in the ratio of development there are however some sections of men and women in the town who symbolically at least have a high regard for water at any time after the years of sense and reason have been reached these are the baptists there are four or five chapels set apart for their improvement in preston and the smartest of these is in fishergate in leemingstreet it was in the chrysalis state in fishergate the butterfly epoch has been reached a dull forlorn looking edifice afterwards taken advantage of by the episcopalian party and now cleared off to make way for st saviours church once formed the sacred asylum of a portion of the baptists but a desire for better accomodation combined with a wish for more fashionable quarters induced a change the dove was repeatedly sent out and dry land was finally found for the baptists in fishergate in 1858 a chapel was erected upon the spot and thus far it has steadfastly maintained its position it is a handsome building creditable to both the architect and the congregation and if its tower were less top heavy it would in its way be quite superb we never look at that solemn tower head without being reminded of some immense quadrangular pepper castor fit for a place in the kitchen of the titans in every other respect the building is arranged smartly if anything it is too ornamental and in making a general survey one is nearly afraid of meeting with panathenaic frieze work on the principle that you cant have the services of a good piper without paying proportionately dear for them so you cant obtain a handsome chapel except by confronting a long bill the elysium of antipedobaptism in fishergate cost the modest sum of 5000 pounds and of that amount about 800 pounds remains to be paid considering the greatness of the original sum the debt is not very large but if it were less the congregation would be none the worse and if it didnt exist at all they would be somewhat nearer bliss in this general vale of tears fishergate baptist chapel is the only dissenting place of worship in the town possessing an exterior clock and it is one of the most orderly articles in the town for it never strikes and has not for many months shown itself after dark it used to exhibit signs of activity after sunset but it was considered a burning shame by some economists to light it up with gas when the town hall clock was got into working order and ever since then it has been nightly kept in the dark fishergate baptist chapel has an excellent interior and it will accommodate about twice as many people as patronise it long stately side lights neatly embellised with stained glass and opaque filigree work give it a mild solemnity which is relieved by fine circular windows occupying the gables the seats are arranged in the usual threerow style and there is a touch of neat gentility about them indicative of good construction whatever the parties they have been made for are like fashionablyconceived gasstands shoot up and spread their branches at intervals down the chapel and at the extreme end there is a broad gallery set apart for the singers who need be in no fear of breaking it down through either the weight of their melodious metal or the specific gravity of their physique a new organ is much wanted and if a few new singers were secured or the old ones polished up slightly the proceedings would be more lively and agreeable nearly three of the members of the choir are really good singers the remainder are what may be termed only moderate what lunestreet is to the wesleyans so fishergate seems to be to the baptiststhe centre of gravity of the more refined and fashionable worshippers very few poor people visit it and it is thought that if they dont come of their own accord they will never he seriously pressed on the subject the free sittings are just within the door on the left hand side and we should fancy that not more than 25 really poor people use them the higher order of christians occupy the lower portion of the same range of seats the central pews and those on the right side thereof the congregation consists almost entirely of middleclass persons people who have either saved money in business or who are making a determined effort to do so good clothes quiet demeanour and numerical smallness are the striking characteristics nothing approaching fervour ever takes possession of the general body religion with them is not a termagant revered for her sauciness and loved for her violent evolutions it is a reticent even spirited calmly orthodox affair whose forerunner fed on locusts and wild honey and whose principles are to be digested quietly there may be a few very boisterous sheep in the fold who get on fire periodically in the warmth of speaking and praying who will express their willingness when the pressure is up to do any mortal thing for the good of the cause but who will have to be caught there and then if anything substantial has to follow like buckwheat cakes and rum gruel they are best whilst hot at a night meeting they may be generously disposed and full of universal sympathy but they can sleep out their burning thoughts in a few hours and waken up next morning like larks with no recollection of their gushing promises there is accomodation in the chapel for about 400 persons but the average attendance is not more than 200 and there are only about 90 members not much difference between the morning and evening attendance is noticed the baptismal thermophylae is generally guarded by the sacred 90 and looked at by the fuller 200 the pew rents are very high but this evil is compensated for by the comparative absence of those solemn gad flies which come in the shape of collections at some places of worship contribution boxes and bags are seen floating about rapidly nearly every other sunday for either home expenses or perishing indians but at fishergate baptist chapel incidental requirements are blended with the pew rents and for other purposes about two collections annually suffice that is all and that ought to make attendance at such a place rather agreeable the primal government of the chapel is in the hands of four deacons but they are not very officious like some pillars of the church one of them is mild and obliging the second is wiselooking and crotchety the third is disposed to pious rampagiousness in his lucid intervals and the fourth is a kindly sort of being with a moderate respect for converted dancers and hallaleujah men some theological writers say that there are evangelists as well as deacons in connection with baptist government there may be some of this class at the fishergate chapel but we have not yet seen their sacred personages the place is highly favoured with clocks not only is there a specimen of horology outside but there is one within and it may be called a worldlywise creature for it never gets beyond no i in its striking tradition hath it that once when there was no clock in the chapel the preacher used to overshoot most uncomfortably the ordinary limits of time that the congregation whilst fond of sermons did not like them stretched too violently and that they resolved unanimously to purchase a clock probably this story is groundless but it is a fact nevertheless that the clock is so situated as to be only fully and easily seen by the preacher more than threefourths of the people sit with their backs directly to it and it is furthermore a fact that whilst when there was no clock the usual time of deliverance was passed the congregation are now released with scrupulous exactitude they got into the open air one sunday evening when we were there about 16 seconds before eight and the preacher had abandoned the pulpit by the time the town hall clock gave its opinion on the question in winter there is a sunday morning prayer meeting at the place but in summer the members cant stand such a gathering either because too much light is thrown upon the subject or because the attendance is too small or because early prayers are not required at that season of the year a prayer meeting is however held all the year round on a wednesday night and it is favoured on an average with about 20 earnest individuals who sometimes create what might if not properly explained be considered a rather solemn disturbance these parties meet in the sunday school which is beneath the chapel the average attendance of scholars at this school is not very large when buns and coffee are astir it may be computed at 200 when ordinary religious instruction is simply placed before the juvenile mind the attendance may be set down at about 100 in the chapel and immediately before the pulpit there is a square hole usually covered which in denominational phraseology goes by the name of the baptistery in the first ages of christianity such places were made outside the church and were either hexagonal or octagonal then they became polygonal then circular and now they have got quadrangular two of the finest baptisteries in the world are at florence and pisa that at the former place being 100 feet in diameter made of black and white marble and surrounded with a gallery on granite columns that at the latter being 116 feet wide and beautifully ornamented the biggest baptistery ever made is supposed to have been that at st sophia in constantinople which we are told was so spacious as to have once served for the residence of the emperor basilicus but there is no marble about the baptistery in fishergate chapel and no one would ever think of transmuting it into a residence it is used two or three times a year and if outsiders happen to get a whisper of an intended dipping curiosity leads them to the chapel and they look upon the ceremony as a piece of sacred fun right enough to look at but far too wet for anything else this dipping is indeed a quaint cold piece of business none except adults or youths who have it is thought come to sense and reason are permitted to pass through the ordeal and it is recognised by them as symbolic of their entrance into the church sometimes as many as six or seven are immersed they put on old or special garments suitable for the occasion and the work of baptism is then carried on by the minister who stands in the figurative jordan he quietly ducks them overhead they submit to the process without a murmur they neither bubble nor scream nor squirm and the elders look on solemnly though impressed with thoughts that excellent as the ceremony may be it is a rather shivering sort of business after all after being baptised the new members retire into an adjoining room strip their saturated cloths rub themselves briskly with towels or get the deacons to do the work for them then redress comb their hair and receive liberty to rejoice with the general israel of the flock such baptism as that we have described seems a rather curious kind of rite but it is honestly believed in and as those who submit to it have to undergo the greatest punishment in the casehave to be put right overhead in cold longridge waterother persons may keep tolerably cool on the subject people have a right to use water any way so long as they dont throw it unfairly upon others or drown themselves and if threefourths of the people who now laugh at adult baptism would undergo a dipping next sunday and then stick to water for the remainder of their lives they would be better citizens whatever might become of their theology the rev j odell is the pastor of fishergate baptist chapel and he is an exemplary man in his way for be only receives a small salary and yet contrives to keep out of debta thing which a good deal of parsons and which many of the ordinary children of grace cant accomplish he is well liked by his congregation and we have heard of no fighting over either his virtues or defects he has quite a clerical look and if he hadnt his voice would give the cue to his profession there is an earnest unctuous modulation about it which as a rule is acquired after men have flung overboard the common idioms of secular life the salary of mr odell is about 160 pounds a year and although he would like more he can make himself and mrs odell and the younger branches of the house of odell comfortable on that sum some pastors gnash their teeth if their purse strings are opened for less than 300 pounds a year mr odell would purchase a pair of wings and sing tis like a little heaven below if his stipend was raised to that figure there is nothing very extraordinary in the preaching style of mr odell it lacks the cunning of that rare old baptist bird who once went by the name of birney and it is devoid of that learned and masterly eloquence so finely worked by the last minister of the chapel who used to read some of his sermons over to the deacons before trying them upon the other sinners in the chapel still it is sincere straight forward and theologically sound it never reaches a point of raving is never loudly pretentious or ferocious in tone mr odell will never be a brilliant man but he is now what is often much bettera good working minister he will never occupy the position of a commander will never even be a lieutenant but he will always be a good soldier in the ranks he has neither a lofty imaginative capacity nor a dashing ratiocinative faculty but he has a clear sense of the importance of his pastoral duties he goes easily and earnestly to work makes neither much fuss nor smoke and if he does now and then seem to pull queer faces in his sermons give odd twists to some of his musclesthat does not debar him from preaching fair evensounding sermons soothing to his general hearers and pleasing to those who have to pay him there are a few people whom mr odells sermons fail to keep awake but as such parties are probably better asleep than in a full state of consciousness no great harm is done he has all sorts of folk to deal withmen who are pious and smooth creatures quietly given to humbug people who practice what they are taught and a few so wonderfully good that if they called a meeting of their creditors they would begin the business by saying let us pray individuals who follow their duties calmly and make no show about their work and respectable specimens of indifference who go to chapel because it is fashionable to do so but they seem all complacent and the happy family element predominates mr odell suits them they suit mr odell and if he had only a fuller chapela better salary too wouldnt be despised by himhe could send up his orisons with more courage and preach to the sinners around him with the steam hammer force of a gadsby no vi st georges church my respecks to st george and the dragoon wrote the gay and festive showman at the conclusion of an epistlepenned under the very shadow of moral wax stattersto the prince of wales and there was no evil in such a benevolent expression of feeling george the particular party referred to occupies a prominent position in our national escutcheonry ant the dragoon is a unique creature always in his company which it would be wrong to entirely forget the name of the saint sounds essentially english and it has been woven into the countrys history the nation is fond of its georges we had four kingsnot all of a saintly dispositionwho rejoiced in that name we sometimes swear by the name of george and it plays as good a part as any other cognomen in our universal system of christening nobody can really tell who st george was and nobody will ever be able to do so gibbon fancies he was at one time an unscrupulous bacon dealer and that he finally did considerable business in religious gammon butler the romish historian thinks he was martyred by diocletian for telling that amiable being a little of his mind ancient fabulists make it out that be killed a dragon saved a fair virgins life and then did something better than eithermarried her medieval men with a knightly turn of mind transmuted him into the patron of chivalry edward iii made him the patron of the order of the garter the eastern and western churches venerate him yet britains have turned him into their countrys tutelary saint and many places of worship have been dedicated to this curiously mythologic individual we have a church in preston in this category and it is of such churchst georgeswe shall speak now in 1723 it was erected up to that time the parish church was the only place of worship we had in connection with what is termed the establishment st georges was brought into existence as a chapel of ease for it and it is still one of the easiest quietest best behaved places in the town it was a plain brick edifice at the beginning but in 18434 the face of the church was hardenedit was turned into stone and it continues to have a substantial petrified appearance in 1848 a new chancel was built and afterwards a dash of christian patriotism resulted in a new pulpit and reading desk the general building which is of cruciform shape has a subdued solemn halfgenteel halfquaint look there is neither architectural maze nor ornamental flash in its construction it is plain all round and is characterised by a simplicity of style which could not be well reduced unless a severe plainness were adopted its position is not in a very imposing locality and the roads to it are bad and irregular baines the historian says that st georges church is situated between fishergate and friargaterather a wide definition applicable to about 500 other places ranging from billiard rooms to foundries from brewing yards to bedstead warehouses in the same region that brightest of all our historical blades p whittle fas states that it is located on the southwest side of friargatea better but still very mystical exposition to all not actually acquainted with the place whilst hardwicke comes up to the rescue in the panoply of modern exactness and tells us that it is on the south side of fishergate these historians must have missed their way in trying to find the place and in their despair guessed at its real situation there are many ways to st georgesyou can get to it from fishergate lune street friargate or the market place but if each of those ways was thrown into one complete whole the road would still be fifteenth rate tortuousness and dimness mark them and a strong backyard spirit of adventure must operate largely in the minds of some who manage to reach the building the churchyard of st georges has nothing interesting to the common mind about it the great bulk of the grave stones are put flat upon the groundarranged so that people can walk over them with ease and comfort whatever may become of the letters and if it were not for a few saplings which shoot out their bright foliage periodically and one very ancient little tree which has become quite tired of that business the yard would look very grave and monotonous the principal entrance can be reached by way of lunestreet or chapel walks but when you have got to it there is nothing very peculiar to be seen it is plain rather gloomy and in no way interesting the interior of the church wears a somewhat similar complexion but it improves by observation and in the end you like it for its thorough simplicity no place of worship can in its internal arrangements be much plainer than st georges if it were not for three stained windows in the chancel which you can but faintly make out at a distance nothing which could by any possibility be termed ornamental would at first sight strike you on reaching the centre of the place you get a moderately clear view of the pulpit which somewhat edifies the mind and on turning right round you see a magnificent organ which compensates for multitudes of defects and below itin front of the orchestraa rather powerful representation of the royal arms a massive lion and unicorn fighting for the crown as usual and got up in polished wood work we see no reason why there should not be something put up contiguously emblematic of st george and the dragon it is very unfair to the saint and unjust to the dragon to ignore them altogetherthe ten commandments are put on one side in this church not done away with but erected in a lateral position very near a corner and somewhat out of the way one of the historians previously quoted says that st georges used to be heated by what is commonly called a cocklesome sort of a warmth radiating apparatus which he describes minutely and with apparent pleasure we have not inquired specially as to the fate of this cockle it may still have an existence in the sacred edifice or it may have given way as all cockles must do in the end whether in churches or private houses to hotwater arrangements the pews in st georges are of the old fashioned patriarchal character they are of all sizes an irregularity quite refreshing peculiarises them there are hardly two alike in the building and a study of the laws of variety must have been made by those who had the management of their construction private interests and family requirements have probably regulated the size of them some of the pews are narrow and hard to get intoa struggle has to be made before you can fairly take possession others are broader and easier to enter a few are very capacious and might be legitimately licensed to carry a dozen inside with safety nearly all or them are lined with green baize much of which is now getting into the sere and yellow leaf period of life many of them are wellcushionedgreen being the favourite colour and in about the same number brussels carpets may be found there is a quiet secluded coziness about the pews the sides are high the fronts come up well nobody can see much of you if care is taken and a position favourable to either recumbent ease or horizontal sleep may be assumed in several of them with safety the general windows excepting those in the chancel are very plain and if it were not for a rim of ambercoloured glass here and there and a fair average accumulation of dust on several of the squares there would be nothing at all to relieve their native simplicity the pillars supporting the nave are equally plain the walls and ceiling are almost entirely devoid of ornament and primitive whitewash forms the most prominent colouring material the gas stands often very elaborate in places of worship have been made solely for use here simple upright pipes surmounted by ordinary burners constitute their sum and substance the pulpit lights are simpler gas has not yet reached the place where the law and the prophets are expounded the orthodox mould candle reigns paramount on each side of the pulpit and its light appears to give satisfaction there is no sunday school in connection with st georges in some respects this may be a disadvantage to the neighbourhood but it is a source of comfort to the congregation for all the noise which irrepressible children create during service hours at every place where they are penned up is obviated neither children nor babes are seen at st georges it is considered they are best at home and that they ought to stay there until the second teeth have been fairly cut the congregation of st georges is specifically fashionable a few poor people may be seen on low seats in the centre aisle but the great majority of worshippers either represent or are connected with what are termed good families young ladies wearing on just one hair the latest of bonnets and elaborated with costly silks and ribbons tender gentlemen of the silverheaded cane school and the my deah fellah region quiet substantial looking men of advanced years who believe in good breeding and properly brushed clothes elderly matrons awfully spiff as lady wortley montague would say and a few welldisposed tradespeople who judiciously mingle piety with business and never make startling noises during their devotional momentsthese make up the congregational elements of st georges they may be described in three wordsfew serene select and this seems to have always been the case years since the historian of lancashire said that st georges has at all times had a respectable though not a very numerous congregation the definition is as correct now as it was then the worshippers move in high spheres the bulk of them toil not neither do they spin and if they can afford it they are quite justified in making life genteel and easy and giving instructions for other people to wait upon them we dare say that if their piety is not as rampant it is quite as good as that of other people vehemence is not an indication of excellence and people may be good without either giving way to solemn warwhoops or damaging the hearing faculties of their neighbours considering the situation of st georges churchits proximity to friargate and the unhallowed passages running therefromthere ought to be a better congregation churches like beefsteaks are intended to benefit those around them it is not healthy for a church to have a congregation too select and too fashionable souls are of more value than either purses or clothes more of the people living in the immediate neighbourhood of st georges ought to regularly visit it very few of them ever go near the place but the fault may be their own and neither the parsons nor the beadles the choir of st georges is a wonderfully good one and whether the members sing for love or money or both they deserve praise their melody is fine their precision good their expression excellent they can give you a solemn piece with true abbandonatamente they can observe an accelerando with becoming taste they can get into a vigorosamente humour potently and on the shortest notice they will never be able to knock down masonry with their musical force like the jericho trumpeters nor build up walls with their harmony like amphion but they will always possess ability to sing psalms hymns spiritual songs and whatever may be contained in popular music books with taste and commendable exactitude we recommend them to the favourable consideration of the public in st georges church there is an organ which may be placed in the h c category it is a splendid instrumentcant be equalled in this part of the country for either finery or musicand is played by a gentleman whose name ranks in st georges anthem book with those of beethoven handel and mozart we have heard excellent music sung and played at st georges but matters would be improved if the efforts of the choir were seconded at present the singers have some time been what we must term for want of a better phrase musical performers they are tremendously ahead of the congregation much of what they sing cannot be joined in by the people many a time the congregation have to look on and listenecstacised with what is being sung wondering what is coming next and delightfully bewildered as to the whole affair the minister at st georges is the rev c h wooda quiet homely wellbuilt man who is neither too finely dressed nor too well paid his salary is considerably under 200 pounds a year mr wood is frank and unostentatious in manner candid and calm in language and of a temperament so even that he gets into hot water with nobody you will never catch him with his virtuous blood up theologically or politically he has a cool head and a quiet tongue two excellent articles for general wear which threefourths of the parsons in this country have not yet heard of he is well liked by the male portion of his congregation and is on excellent terms with the fair sex he is a batchelor but that is his own fault he could be married any day but prefers being his own master he may have an ideal like dante or a love phantom like tasso or an imogene like the brave alonzo but he has published neither poetry nor prose on the subject yet and has made no allusion to the matter in any of his sermons no minister in preston with similar means is more charitably disposed than mr wood he behaves well to poor people and the virtue of that is worth more than the lugubriousness or eloquence of many homilies charity in purse as well as in speech is one of his characteristics and if that doth not cover a multitude of ordinary defects nothing will in the reading desk mr wood gets through his work quickly and with a good voice there is no effort at elocution in his expression he goes right on with the business and if people miss the force of it they will have to be responsible for the consequences in the pulpit he drives forward in the same earnest matteroffact style there is no hand flinging hair wringing or dramatic raging in his style the matter of his sermons is orthodox and homelysystematically arranged innocently illustrated at intervals and offensive to nobody his manner is calculated to genially persuade rather than fiercely arouse and it will sooner rock you to sleep than lash you to tears there is a slight touch of sanctity at the end of his sentencesa mild elevation of voice indicative of pious oiliness but altogether we like his quiet straightforward simple english style people fond of church of england ideas could not have a more genial place of worship than st georges the seats are easy and well lined the sermons short and placid and the company good st augustines catholic church st augustines catholic church preston is of a retiring disposition it occupies a very southern position is neither in the town nor out of it and unlike many sacred edifices is more than 50 yards from either a publichouse or a beershop cleanlooking dwellings immediately confront it green fields take up the background an air of quietude half pastoral half genteel pervades it but this ecclesiastical rose has its thorn only in its proximate surroundings is the place semirural and select as the circle widenstownwards at any rateyou soon get into a region of murky houses ragged children running beer jugs poverty and as you move onwards in certain directions the plot thickens until you get into the very lairs of ignorance depravity and misery st augustines district is a very large one it embraces 8000 or 9000 persons and their characters like their faces are of every colour and size much honest industry much straightforwardness and every day kindness much that smells of gin and rascality and heathenism may be seen in the district there is plenty of room for all kinds of reformers in the locality and if any man can do any good in it whatever may be his creed or theory let him do it the priests in connection with st augustines catholic church are doing their share in this matter and it is about them their church and their congregation that we have now a few words to say the church we name is not a very old one it was formally projected in 1836 the first stone of it was laid on the 13th of november 1838 and it was opened on the 30th of july 1840 by dr briggs afterwards first bishop of the catholic diocese of beverley it has a plain yet rather stately exterior nothing fanciful nor tinselled nor masonically smart characterises it four large stone pillars flanked with walls of the same material surmounted with brick a flight of steps a portico a broad gable with massive coping and a central ornament at the angle are all which the facade presents the doors are lateral and are left open from morning till night three hundred and sixtyfive days every year the interior of the church is spacious wonderfully clean and decorated at the high altar end in most tasteful style we have not inquired whether charity begins at home or not in this place perhaps it does not but it is certain that painting does for all the fine colouring with its many formed classical devices at the sanctuary was executed by one of the members of the congregation the principal altar is a very fine one and a fair amount of pious pleasure may be derived from looking at a tremendous pastoral candlestick which stands on one side it is when charged with a fullsized candle perhaps five feet ten high and it has a very patriarchal and decorous appearancelooks grave and authoritative and seems to think itself a very important affair and it has a perfect right to its opinion we should like to see it in a procession with zaccheus the sacristian carrying it three fine paintings which however seem to have lost their colour somewhat are placed in the particular part of the church we are now at the central one represents the adoration of the magi and was painted and given by mr h taylor bulmer who formerly resided in preston the second picture to the left is a representation of christs agony in the garden and the third on the opposite side is christ carrying the cross in front of the altar there is the usual lamp with a crimson spirit flame burning day and night and reminding one of the old vestal light watched by roman virgins who were whipped in the dark by a wrathful pontifex if they ever let it go out at the northern end of the church there is a large gallery with one of the neatest artistic designs in front of it we ever saw the side walls are surmounted with a chaste frieze and running towards the base are stations and statues of saints a small altar within a screen surmounted with statuary is placed on each side of the sanctuary and not far from one of them there is a bright painting which looks well at a distance but nothing extra two yards off it represents christ preaching out of a boat to some galileans amongst whom may be seen the rev canon walker if the painting is correct the worthy canon has deteriorated none by age for he seems to look just as like himself now as he did eighteen hundred years since and to be not a morsel fonder of spectacles and good snuff now than he was then his insertion however into this picture was a whim of the artist whose cosmopolitan theory led him to believe that one man is as a rule quite as good as another and that paintings are always appreciated best when they refer to people whom you know there are three of those very terrible places called confessionals at st augustines and one day not so long since we visited all of them it is enough for an ordinary sinner to patronise one confessional in a week or a month or a quarter of a year and then go home and try to behave himself but we went to three in one forenoon with a priest afterwards had the courage to get into the very centre of a neighbouring building wherein were two and twenty nuns and then reciprocated compliments with an amiable young lady called the mother superior terrible places to enter and most unworldly people to visit we fancy some of our protestant friends will say but we saw nothing very agonising or dreadfulnot even in the confessionals like other folk we had heard grim tales about such placesabout trap doors whips manacles and all sorts of cruel oddities but in the confessionals visited we beheld nothing of any of them number one is a very small apartment perhaps two yards square with a seat and a couple of sacred pictures in it in front there is an aperture filled in with a slender grating and backed by a curtain which can be removed at pleasure by the priest who officiates behind on one side of the grating there is a small space like a letterbox slip and through this communications in writing of various dimensions are handed everything is plain and simple where the penitent is located and the apartment behind occupied by the priest who hears confession is equally simple there is no weird paraphernalia no mysterious contrivances no bolts bars pullies or strings for either working miracles or making the hair of sinners stand on end number two confessional is similarly arranged and equally plain we examined this rather more minutely than the other and whilst we could find nothing dreadful in the penitents apartment we fancied on entering the priests side that we had met with something belonging the realm of confessional torture as depicted by the hogans murphys and maria monk showmen and which the officials had forgot to put by in some of their secret drawers it was hung upon a nail had a semi circular half viperish look and was cupped at each end as if intended for some curious business of incision or absorption we were relieved on getting nearer it and on being informed that it was merely an ear trumpet through which questions have to be put to deaf penitents who now and then turn up for general unravelment and absolution the two confessionals described are contiguous to a passage at the rear of the church the third we are now coming to is near one of the subsidiary altars nod looks specifically snug it is a particularly small confessional and a very stout penitent would find it as difficult to get into it as to reveal all his sins afterwards there is nothing either harrowing or cabalistic in the place and you can see nothing but two forms a screen and a crucifix there are many services at st augustines on monday mornings at a quarter past seven and again at halfpast eight mass is said on tuesdays and thursdays there is benediction at halfpast seven on fridays and saturdays and on the eve of holidays there is confession on sundays there is mass at halfpast seven halfpast eight halfpast nine and at 11 when regular service takes place on sunday afternoons at three the children are instructed and at halfpast six in the evening there are vespers a sermon and benediction the church has a capacity for about 1000 persons without crushing the average number hearing mass on a sunday is 3290 on four consecutive sundays recentlyfrom february 14 to march 14upwards of 13100 heard mass within the walls of the church the congregation is almost entirely made up of working people a few middle class and wealthy persons attend the placesome sitting in the gallery and others at the higher end of the churchbut the general body consists of toiling everyday folk the poorest section including the irishwho in every catholic church do a great stroke of business on a sunday with holy water beads and crucifixesare located in the rear it is a source of sacred pleasure to quietly watch some of these poor yet curious beings they are all amazingly in earnest while the fit is on them they bow and kneel and make hand motions with a dexterity which nothing but long years of practice could ensure and they drive on with their prayers in a style which whatever may be the character of its sincerity has certainly the merit of fastness how to get through the greatest number of words in the shortest possible time may be a problem which they are trying to solve the great bulk of the congregation are calm and unostentatious evincing a quiet demeanour in conjunction with a determined devotion there are several very excellent sleepers in the multitude of worshippers but they are mainly at the entrance end where they are least seen we happened to be at the church the other sunday morning and in ten minutes after the sermon had been commenced about 16 persons all within a moderate space were fast asleep their number increased slowly till the conclusion several appeared to be struggling very severely against the morphean deity dining the whole service a few might be seen at intervals rescuing themselves from his graspgetting upon the very edge of a snooze starting suddenly with a shake and waking up dropping down their heads to a certain point of calmness and then retracing their steps to consciousness there are five men at st augustines called collectorsparties who show strangers c their seats and look after the pennies which attendants have to pay on taking them not one of these collectors has officiated less than 11 years three of them have been at the work for 27 and what is still better they discharge their duties as the sacristan once told us free gracious that is a philanthropic wrinkle for chapel keepers and other compounders of business and piety which we commend to special notice the singers at st augustines are of more than ordinary merit two or three of them have most excellent voices and the conjoint efforts of the body are in many respects capital their reading is accurate their time good and their melody frequently constitutes a treat which would do a power of good to those who hear the vocalisation of many ordinary psalmsingers whose great object through life is to kill old tunes and inflict grevious bodily harm upon new ones there is a very good organ at st augustines and it is blown well and played well usually there are three priests at the mission but on our visit there were only twothe rev canon walker and the rev j hawkesworth and if you had to travel from the lowest point in cornwall to the farthest house in caithness you wouldnt find two more kindly men we protestants talk volubly about the grim grinding character of priests about their tyrannous influence and their sinister sacerdotalism but there is a good deal of extra colouring matter in the picture whatever their religion may be and however much we may differ from it this at least we have always found amongst priestsexcellent education amazing devotion to duty gentlemanly behaviour and in social life much geniality they have studied all subjects they know something about everything their profession necessarily makes them acquainted with each phase and feeling of life the rev canon walker is a good type of a thoroughly english priest and of a genuine lancashire man he is unassuming obliging in manner careful in his duties fonder of a good pinch of snuff than of warring about creeds much more in love with a quiet chat than of platform violence and would far sooner offer you a glass of wine and ask you to take another when you had done it than fight with you about piety he is a man of peace of homely disposition of kindly thought unobtrusive in style sincere in action with nothing bombastic in his nature and nothing selfrighteous in his speech his sermons are neither profound nor simplethey are made up of fair medium material and are discharged rapidly there is no effort at rhetorical flourish in his style a simple lifting of the right hand with an easy swaying motion is all the action you perceive canon walker speaks with a rapidity seldom noticed average talkers can get through about 120 words in a minute canon walker can manage 200 nicely and show no signs of being out of breath the rev mr hawkeswortha brighteyed rubicundfeatured gentleman with a slight disposition to corporeal rotundityis the second priest he is a sharp kindlyhumoured gentleman and does not appear to have suffered in either mind or body by a four years residence in rome mr hawkesworth is a practical priest a good singer and a hard worker he resides with canon walker in a spacious house adjoining st augustines no unusual sounds have ever been heard to proceed from the residence and it may fairly be inferred that they dwell together to harmony the house is substantially furnished the library within it is not very large but what it lacks in bulk is made up for by variety its contents range from the clockmaker of sam slick to the imitation of thomas a kempis from little dorrit to the greek lexicon not far from st augustines church there is a convent it is the old larkhill mansion transmuted and is one of the most pleasantly situated houses in this locality in front of it you have flowers of delicious hues shrubs of every kind grassy undulations rare old shady trees a small artificial lake a fountainshall we go on piling up the agony of beauty until we reach a claude melnotte altitude it is unnecessary all we need add is thisthat the grounds are a lovely picture delightfully formed and most snugly set the convent is a large clean airy establishment the entrance hall is handsome some of the apartments are choicely furnished the walls being decorated with pictures c made by either the nuns or their pupils the convent includes apartments for the reception of visitors a small chapel with deeplytoned light and exquisitely arranged dining rooms sitting rooms two or three school rooms lavatories sculleries dormitories and a gigantic kitchen reminding one of olden houses wherein were vast open fireplaces massive spits and every apparatus for making meat palateable and life enjoyable the 22 nuns before referred to live at this convent they belong to the order of faithful companions they lead quiet industrious liveshave no saurinstarr difficulties and appear to be contented at the convent there are 33 pupilssome from a distance others belonging the town they are taught every accomplishment look very healthy and when we saw them seemed not only comfortable but merry near the convent there is a commodious girls and infants school connected with st augustines the general average attendance being about 240 in vauxhallroad there is another large excellently built school belonging to the same church and set apart for boys the attendance is not very numerous at both there is room for many more scholars and if religious bigotry did not operate in some quarters and prevent catholic children going to those schools recognising the principles of their own faith the attendance at each would be much better than it is taking the district in its entirety it is industriously worked by the catholics they deserve praise for their energy their object is to push on catholicism and improve the secular position of the inhabitants and they do this with a zeal most praiseworthy this finishes our augustinian mission quakers meeting house i love quaker ways and quaker worship i venerate the quaker principles it does me good for the rest of the day when i meet any of their people in my path when i am ruled or disturbed by any occurrence the sight or quiet voice of a quaker acts upon me as a ventilator lightening the air and taking off a load from the bosom but i cannot like the quakers as desdemona would say to live with themcharles lamb sheep leather and religion were the principal things which george fox the founder of quakerism looked after in boyhood he was a shepherd in youth a shoemaker in manhood an expounder of christianity no one could have had a series of occupations more comprehensive or practical the history of the world proves that it is as important for men to look after their mutton as to save their bacon that after all there is nothing like leather and that there can be nothing better than religion 219 years since the ancestors of those who now follow the inner light were termed quakers an english judgegervaise bennetgave them this name at derby and it is said that he did so because fox bid them quake at the word of the lord theologically quakers are a peculiar people they believe in neither rites nor ceremonies in neither prayer books nor hymnbooks in neither lesson reading nor pulpit homilies nor sacraments they are guided by their spiritual feelings and have a strong idea that a man has no right to open his mouth when he has got nothing to say and that he should avoid keeping it shut when he has something worth uttering this is an excellent plan and the world would be considerably benefited if it were universally observed both in religion and everyday life creation is killed and done for daily through an everlasting torrent of meaningless talk compact and quiet as it may appear quakerism has had its schisms and internal feuds early in this century the white quakers who dressed themselves in light suits when outside and didnt dress at allstripped themselves after the manner of adamiteswhen within doors created much furore in ireland about 30 years since the hicksite quakers who denied the divinity of christ and the authority of the bible made their advent afterwards the beaconite quakers put in an appearance and then came the wilburites taking all sections into account there are at present about 130000 quakers in the world and preston contributes just seventy genuine ones to their number in this locality they remain unchanged today they are neither smaller nor larger numerically than they were thirty years age in the early days of local quakerism the country rather than the town was its favourite situation newton freckleton rawcliffe and chipping contained respectively at one time many more quakers than preston but the old stations were gradually broken up and preston eventually got the majority of their members a building located somewhere between evertongardens and springgardens was first used as a meetinghouse by them in 1784 a better place was erected by the friends on a piece of land contiguous to and on the north side of friargate and in 1847 it was rebuilt although no one was officially engaged to map out the place a good deal of learned architectural gas was disengaged in its design and construction it was made three times larger than its congregational requirements the object being to accommodate those who might assemble at the periodical district meetings special attention was also paid to the loftiness of the buildingto the height of its ceiling one or two of the amateur designers having a finger in the architectural pie had serious notions as to the importance of air space they had studied the influence of oxygen and hydrogen of nitrogen and carbonic acid gas they had read in scientific books that every human being requires so many feet of breathing room and after deciding upon the number of worshippers which the meetinghouse should accommodate they agreed to elevate its ceiling in the ratio of their inspiring and expiring necessities this was a very good salutary quakerly idea and although it may have operated against the internal appearance of the building it has guaranteed purity of air to those attending it the meeting house is a quiet secluded wellmade place but it has a poor entrance which you would fancy led to nowhere a stranger passing along friargate on an ordinary day would never find the quakers meeting house he might notice at a certain point on the northeastern side of that undulating and bustling public thoroughfare a grey looking gable having a threelightwindow towards the head with a large door below and at its base two washing pots and a long butter mug belonging to an industrious earthenware dealer next door but he would never fancy that the disciples of george fox had a front entrance there to their meeting house yet after passing through a dim broad passage here and mounting half a dozen substantial steps you see a square neat looking fivewindowed building and this is the quakers meeting house over the passage there is a pretty large room which is used by the friends for sunday school purposes the attendance at this school on ordinary occasions is about 60 at special periods it is considerably more during the cotton famine a few years ago when the quakers were manifesting their proverbial charitygiving money food and clothingthe attendance averaged 160 and if it was known that they were going to give something extra tomorrow it would reach that point again speaking of the charity of quakers it may not be amiss to state that they keep all their own poordo not allow any one belonging their society ever to solicit aid from the parish or migrate in the dark hour of poverty to the workhouse reverting to the meetinghouse we may observe that just within its front door particular provision has been made for umbrellas there is a long low stand with a channel below it and this will afford ample accomodation for about 160 umbrellas taking into account the average attendance at the meetinghouse we have come to the serious conclusion that if every member carried two umbrellas on wet sundays the said umbrellas could be legitimately provided for it is not a pleasant thing for a man to carry a couple of umbrellas and we believe it has been found very difficult for any one to put up and use two at the same time still it is satisfactory to know that if ever the friends of preston decide upon such a course there will be plenty of provision for their umbrellas at the meeting house the inside of the general building is severely plain there is no decoration of any description about it and if the gas pipes running along the side walls had not a slight hogarthian line of beauty touch in their form everything would look absolutely horizontal and perpendicular the seats are plain and strong with open backs a few of them have got green cushions running the whole length of the form in some small cushions are dotted down here and there for individual worshippers who can at any time easily take them up put them under their arm and move from one place to another if they wish for a change of location over the front entrance there is a gallery but ordinarily it is empty there is no pulpit in the house and no description of booksneither bibles nor hymnbooks nor prayerbookscan be seen anywhere at the head of the place there is an elevated stronglyfronted bench running from one side to the other and below it an open form of similar length the more matured quakers and quakeresses generally gravitate hitherwards the males have separate places and so have the females it is expected that the former will always direct their steps to the seats on the righthand side that the latter will occupy those on the left and generally you find them on opposite sides in strict accordance with this idea there is nothing to absolutely prevent an enraptured swain from sitting at the elbow of his love and basking in the sunlight of her eyes nor to stop an elderly man from nestling peacefully under the wing of his spouse but it is understood that they will not do this and will at least submit to a deed of separation during hours of worship in addition to the 70 actual members of the society there are about 60 persons in preston who pay a sort of nominal homage at the shrine of george fox they have two meetings every sunday morning and evening and one every thursdayat halfpast ten in the morning during winter months and at seven in the evening in summer the average attendance at each of the sunday meetings is about 70 the character of the services is quite unsettled throughout christendom the rule in religious edifices is to have a preliminary service and then a discourse in quaker meeting houses there is no such defined course of action sometimes there is a prayer then another then an exhortationquakers have no sermons at other times an exhortation without any prayer now and then a prayer without any exhortation and occasionally they have neither the one nor the otherthey fall into a state of profound silence keep astonishingly quiet ever so long with their eyes shut and then walk out this is called silent meditation if a pin drops whilst this is going on you can hear it and tell in which part of the house it is lying you can feel the quietude see the stillness it is tranquil and herdlikeas in the pastureforty feeding like one it is sadly serene placidly mysterous like the uncommunicating muteness of fishes and you wonder how it is kept up to those who believe in solemn reticencein motionless communion with the inner lightthere is nothing curious in this it is in fact often a source of high spiritual ecstacy but to an unitiated spectator the business looks seriously funny and its continuance for any length of time causes the mind of such a one to run in all kinds of dreadfully ludicrous grooves quakers dont believe in singing and have no faith in sacred music of any kind neither the harp nor the sackbut nor the psaltery nor the dulcimer will they have neither organs nor bass fiddles will they countenance neither vocalists nor instrumentalists nor tune forks of any size or weight will they patronise they permit one another to enter and remain in their meeting house with the hat on or off and with the hands either in the pockets or out of them they have no regular ministers and allow either men or women to speak none except quakers and rantersthe two most extreme sections of the religious community so far as quietude and noise are concernedpermit this and it is a good thing for the world that the system is not extended beyond their circles if women were allowed to speak at some places of worship they would all be talking at onceall be growing eloquent voluble and strong minded in two minutesand an articulative mystification much more chaotic than that which once took place at babel would ensue at the meeting house in friargate it is taken for granted that on sundays the morning service lasts for an hour and a half and the evening one an hour and a quarter but practically the time is regulated by the feelings of the worshippersthey come and go as they are moved and that is a liberal sort of measure harmonising well with human nature and its varied requirements we have paid more than one visit to this meeting house the other sunday evening we were there the congregation at that time numbered just thirtytwofifteen men twelve women two boys and three girls this was rather a small assemblage for a place which will hold between 500 and 600 persons but it might be gratifying to the shades of its chemistryloving cubicfeetofairadmiring designers for they would at any rate have the lively satisfaction of knowing that none of the famous 32 would suffer through want of breathing space the members of the congregation came in at various times four were there at halfpast six the remainder had got safely seated in every instance by ten minutes to seven all the males made their appearance with their hats on some pulled them off the moment they got seated two or three seemed to get their convictions gradually intensified on the subject and in about ten minutes came to the conclusion that they could do without their hats some who had cast aside their castors at an early period reinstated them whilst odd ones kept on their head coverings during the entire meeting for 45 minutes not the least effort in any lingual direction was made no one said a word for threequarters of an hour there was a good deal of stirring on the forms and creaking sounds were periodically heard the whole indicating that the sitting posture had become uneasy and that the paint through warmth had got tenacious there was however neither talking nor whispering indulged in the elderly quakers with their broad brimmed substantial hats and white neckcloths kept their eyes closed for a season then opened them and looked ahead pensively then shut them serenely againjust as men of inward light are wont to turn their optics to upon t the quakeresses on the other side followed a similar programme we saw only three of them in the olden dressonly three with narrow barrelled high crowned bonnets made of brown silk and garnished with white silk strings the younger branches of quakerdom seemed more conventional than their ancestors in general dress there was a slight dash of antiquity in their style but their hats and bonnets their coats and shawls had evidently been made for ornament as well as use originally quakers were peculiarly stringent in respect to the plainness of their clothes what they wore was always good always made out of something which could not be beaten for its excellence of quality but it was always simple always out of the line of shoddy and bespanglement but quakerism is neither immaculate nor invincible time is changing its simplicity its quaint old fashioned solidity of dress civilisation is quietly eating away its rigidity and the day is coming when quakerism will don the same suit as the rest of the world for the first ten minutes we were in the chapel silence was not to us so much of a singularity but when the town hall clock struck seven when the machinery in the dim steeple of trinity church which adjoins gave a slow confirmation of it and when all the little clocks in the neighbouring housesfor you could hear them on account of the general silencechirped out sharply the same thing one began to feel dubious and mystified but the quakers took all quietly and even the children present sat still the chime of another hour quarter came in due order still there was no sign of action two minutes afterwards an elderly gentleman whose eyes had been kept close during the greater part of the time which had passed suddenly leaned forward the congregation followed his example in a crack and for ten minutes they prayed the elderly gentleman leading the way in a rather highkeyed voice which he singularly modulated but there was not much of the old foxian orgasm manifested by him he was serene did not shake was not agonised he finished as he began without any warning the general assemblage was seated in a second and for seven minutes there was another reign of taciturnity when that time had elapsed the same elderly party gave an exhortation simple in language kindly in tone and free from both bewilderment and fierceness mr jesperthe person to whom we have been alludingis one of the principal speakers at this meeting house his colleague in talking is mrs abbatt a very worthy lady who has often the afflatus upon her and who can hold forth with a good deal of earnestness and perspicuity although mr jesper and mrs abbatt do the greatest portion of the talking and praying others break through the ring fence of quakerdoms silence periodically one little gentleman has often small outbursts but he is not very exhilerating all the members attending the meeting house are very decorous respectable middleclass peoplesubstantial wellpursed folk who can afford to be independent and take life easilymen and women who dislike shoddy and cant as much as they condemn spangles and lackered gentility the aggregate of the people connected with the place are calm steadygoing beings we have a large respect for quakerism its professors are made of strong enduring practical metal they never neglect business for religion nor religion for business they believe in paying their way and in being paid in moral rectitude and yard wands not the millionth part of an inch too long in yea and nay in good trade good purses good clothes and good language in clearheaded cool calculations in cash discounts sobriety and clean shirts in calmness and close bargain driving in getting as much as they can in sticking to it a long while and yet in behaving well to the poor the influence of the creed they profess has made their uprightness and humanity proverbial their home influence has been powerful their views in the outer world are becoming more fully realised every day nations have smiled contemptuously at them as they have gone forth on lonely missions of freedom and peace but the inner beatings of the worlds great heart today are in favour of liberty of thought and quietness the quakers have been amongst lifes pioneers in the long hard battle for human freedom and human peace quakerism may be a quaint hatloving silencerevering concern in its meetinghouses its uriahs and abimelechs and deborahs and abigails may look curious creatures in their collarless coats and long drawn bonnets but they belong to a race of men and women who have kept the lamp of freedom burning who have set a higher price upon conscience than gold who have struggled to make everything freethe body the religion the bread and butter and the trade of the nations who are now by their doctrines slowly lifting humanity out of the red track of war and teaching it how grand a triumph can be made all the world over by absolute peace and honesty st peters church upon a high piece of enclosed land adjoining fylderoad stands st peters church portions of its precincts are covered with gravestones the remainder has been considerably damaged of late according to the belief of one of the churchwardens by the vicious scratching of a number of irreverent hens whose owners will be prosecuted if they do not look better after them the other sunday we saw a notice posted at the front of the church relative to the great henscratching question it is said that some of these tame and reclaimed birds have penetrated a foot or two into the ground for the purpose of lying not laying therein and on this account it is important that their proprietors should look more henergetically after them the foundation stone of st peters church was laid by mr justice park one of the old recorders of preston in 1822 rickman an able birmingham architect designed the place and the edifice sans steeple which was built in 1852 out of money left by the late thomas german esq was erected at a cost of 6900 pounds provided by the commissioners for the building of new churches st peters has a lofty commanding appearance learned people say it is built in the florid gothic style of architecture and we are not inclined to dispute their definition it has a very churchly look and if the steeple were at the other end it would be equally orthodox the world as a rule fixes its steeples westward but st peters following a few others we could name rises in the opposite direction and like a good mussulman turns to the east there is nothing in its graveyard calling for special comment neither monuments nor lofty tombs relieve it all round it has a flat dull aspect and good arrangements have been made for walking over the tombstones and obliterating their inscriptions there are two ways into the church at the western end both are near each other but one has advantages which the other does not possess passing through the larger you immediately face the pulpit and the congregation entering by the other you can hang your harp on several preliminary willowssit just sideways and hear whats going on stay behind the screen until a point arrives when a move forward can be made without many people catching your mould of form or inquire whos present and who isnt and glide out if nothing suitable is observed st peters church internally looks dirty if cleanliness be next to godliness a good cleaning would do it good and improve its affinities whitewash paint floorcloths dusters wash leathers and sundry other articles in the curriculum of scrubbers renovators and purifiers are needed the walls want mundifying so does the ceiling so do the floors the ten commandments need improving the apostles creed isnt plain enough the spirit of a time worn grimness requires ostracising from the place all is substantial but there is an ancient unwashed dulness about the general establishment which needs transforming into cleanness and brightness the pews are high and on the average they will hold six persons each seven might get into them on a pinch but if the number were much extended beyond that point either abraison or blue places through violent pressure would be the consequence two or three pews at the top end will hold twelve each but that apostolic number is not very often observed in them the price of a single sitting in the middle aisle is 10s per annum the cost of a side seat is equal to three civil halfcrowns the long side seats are free so are the galleries excepting that portion of them in front of the organ often the church is not much more than half filled on a sunday but it is said that many sittings calculated to accommodate nearly a full congregation are let viewed from the copperhead standpoint this is right but taking a higher ground it would be more satisfactory if even fewer pews were let and more folk attended the church is not well arranged for people occupying side seats in looking ahead the pillars of the nave constantly intercept their vision if they care about seeing who is reading or preaching wherever the pulpit were put it would blush unseen so far as many are concerned at present it is fixed on the southeastern side and only about onefourth of those seated under the galleries can see either it or the preacher some of them at times complain considerably of sequestration others feel it a little occasionally a few think it a rather snug thing to be out of sight a large five light stained glass window occupies the chancel end but there is nothing very entrancing in its appearance the greater portion of it has a bright ambercoloured monotonous flashiness about it which flares the eyes if gazed at long and makes other things if looked at directly afterwards yellowhued and it is surmounted with a number of minor designs reminding one of the big oddities in a mammoth keleidoscope but the congregation have got used to the window and will neither break it nor permit others to do so six spaces for tablet inscriptions occupy the base of the window two of them are blank two have a great mass of letters packed into them and two are but moderately filled in with words at a distance nobody can see what is said upon them it is reported that they contain the decalogue and the apostles creed and if this be so the incumbent the curate and the clerk must have been the parties for whose delight they were put up for they are the nearest to and can consequently best read them there are the full compliment of sacred enclosures and resting places at the higher end of the churcha chair for the ease of the incumbent or curate a desk for the prayer reader a box for the clerk a lectern for the lesson reader and a stout pulpit for the preacher the congregation of st peters church as we have said is small we cannot tell whether the collections terrify folk probably they do for it is estimated that there are between 30 and 40 of them annually and sometimes they come in an unbroken line for several sundays together a plan like this is enough to make people shy in their attendanceis certain to make ordinarily generous beings cover what they give with their finger ends or slip their gifts sharply into the boxes and get them instantly mixed up with the rest so that nobody can tell whether they have contributed a simple copper a roguish little threepenny piece or a respectable looking shilling there are voluntary contribution boxes at the doors but they never get very heavy those attending the church are mainly working people with the exception of about five all have to fight briskly for a living a greater work has been done outside than within the church there are many schools and classes belonging the place in cold bathstreet there is a large school for girls and infants and it is very well attended in fylderoad there is a club for working men open every day and on sundays several of the wives and mothers of britain attend a class in the same building in brookstreet there is a regular day school on sunday afternoons the members of an adult male class meet in it the average attendance of these members is about 160 and their ages range from 20 to 70 the district has been well worked up and there are many of both sexes in it prepared to either pray or fight for st peters the music at the church is good it costs about 30 pounds a year and a rather strong effort is sometimes required to raise that sum the organist immediately preceding the present one used to play for nothing get one or two collections annually for the choir and make up out of his own pocket any financial deficiency there might be the gentleman who now operates upon the organ likewise gives his services gratuitously he also has collections for the choir but if those said collections come short of the sum required he is seriously impressed with the idea that the deficiency ought to come out of other peoples purses and not his and so it does the organist has considerable musical ability he plays the instrument in his care with precision but he throws too much force into its effusionsbelieves too much in high pressureand the general boiler of its melody may burst some day kill the blower instantly and dash the choir into space the internal service arrangements at st peters are worked by an incumbent a curate and a clerk the last named gentleman has been a long time at his post he is a dry orthodox careful man never mistook a threepenny for a fourpenny piece in his life doesnt like slippery sixpences and he gets for his general services at the church 15 pounds a year nobody hardly ever hears him the responses of the choir materially swamp the music of his voice but his lips move and that is at least a sign of life the incumbent is the rev d f chapman he has been at the place a few years and receives about 400 pounds ayear for his trouble mr chapman is a powerfullyconstructed gentleman is somewhat inclined to oleaginousness has contracted a marine swing in his walk is heavily clerical in countenance and cloth believes in keeping his hair broad at the sides has a strong will and an enormous opinion of the incumbent of st peters will fume if crossed will crush if touched cant be convinced has his mind made up and rivetted down on everything must have his way thinks every antagonist mistaken is washy windy ponderous has a clear notion that each of his postulates is worth a couple of demonstrations that all his theories are tantamount to axioms and finally has quarelled more with his churchwardens than any other live parson in preston he once fought for weeks day and night with a warden as to the position of a small gaspipe because he couldnt get his way about it he is well educated but his erudition is not fairly utilised he can read with moderate precision but there is a lack of elocutionary finish in his tone he can talk a long while and now and then can say a good thing he preaches with considerable force makes good use of his arms sometimes rants a little at intervals has to pull back his sentences half an inch to get hold of the right word talks straight out occasionally telling the congregation what they are doing and what they ought to do but there is much in his sermons which neither gods nor men will care about digesting and there is a theological dogmatism in them which ordinary sinners like ourselves will never swallow we are rather inclined to admire the gentleman who until lately officiated as his curatethe rev e leeand who after preaching his last sermon was next day made the recipient of that most fashionable and threadbare of all things a presentation originally he indulged in odd pranks said strange things was laughably eccentric and did for a period appear to be in an ecclesiastical sense what the kangaroo of artemus ward was in a zoological onethe most amoozin little cuss ever introduced to a discriminatin public he has still some of the amoozin traits about him but during his curacy in st peters district he showed that he could work hard visit often look after the poor be generous get up good classes and never tire of his duty his salary was about 120 pounds a year and he was benevolent with it he has a stronger pair of lungs than any parson in preston and he can use them longer than most men without feeling tired his sermons are of a practical type he believes largely in telling people what he thinks and never hesitates to hit rich and poor alike in his discourses he has been transplanted to the parish church and he will stir up a few of the respectable otiose souls there if he has an opportunity there is a good deal of swagger about him he believes in carry a stick and turning it in admiring himself and letting other people know that he is of a cypher there is much conceit and ever so much bombast about him he likes giving historical lectures thinks he is an authority on everything appertaining to elizabeth mary the prince of orange c is fond of attacking bishop goss and getting into a groove of garrulous declamation concerning papists still he is a determined worker has been a laborious curate has troubled himself more than many people in looking after those whom parsons are so fond of calling sinners and so indifferent about visiting he was well liked in st peters district and we hope that in the new one he has gone to he will gather friends increase his usefulness get married and give fewer polemical lectures new jerusalem church de gustibus non est applies with as much force to religious as to secular life peoples tastes will differ you can no more account for them in churchnaming than in kissing or childchristening and that being so let no pious piece of perfection dispute with the new jerusalem brethren as to their spiritual gustation if a man were virtuously inclined to pirate in his religious nomenclature the oddities of old carey who coined that finely flowing word aldeborontiphoscophornio which is only a line ahead of that other stately polysyllable chrononhotonthologos why let him do so for somebody with more madness or wisdom than yourself will some day end or mend him let every man have his cogibundity of cogitation and let people suit themselves about the names of their churches swedenborgians is the name commonly given to those who belong to the new church signified by the new jerusalem in the revelation they might have cut it shorter to be sure and they might have had a less mystical but certainly not a cleverer man for their founder than the swedish emanuel no modern ever knew half so much or knew it so oddly as swedenborg and no one ever wrote so immensely on questions so varied and intractable he knew something about everything from toe nails to the differential and integral calculus from iron smelting to star cycles and in reading his works you might almost fancy so familiar does he appear to be with spirits that he had a quotidian nod from michael and a daily how are you old boy from gabriel emerson does well when he puts him down as the representative man of mystery and when he calls him the mastodon and missourian of literature he will have the concurrence of all unbiased scholars there are about 70 persons in preston who care vitally for that ideal church which st john saw in patmosif new jerusalemism as delineated by the followers of swedenborg is its symbol only about 70 are connected as members with its physical temple in avenham road more may be in embryo several maybe hanging on the skirts of conviction ready for a goodly plunge into reality but that is the number of mortals at present associated with the new church signified by the new jerusalem in preston all of them are earnest the bulk are conscientious and on that account entitled to respect about a quarter of a century ago a few sincere swedenborgians met in an office down cannonstreet which is now used as a gilding room by a modern revivalist they pushed the cause with a fair amount of energy and increased though by slow degrees the number of their members during the period of their spiritual exercises here the late mr hugh becconsall a calm benevolenthearted man got associated with them and this was the means of bringing into fuller life the principles of swedenborg in preston mr becconsalls thoughts were quickened and changed by them he became a devoted and sincere believer in the new church attended its meetings in cannonstreet was impressed with the idea that better accomodation was required for them and finally decided to build out of his own pocket and endow from the same source a new church in avenhamroad it was estimated that the cost of the church would be 1000 pounds which mr becconsall willingly agreed to pay but religion has no aegis against extrasthey will creep in are irrepressible and in accordance with this fatal philosophy the church in avenhamroad cost in the end nearly 2000 pounds which he paid without even grumblinga privilege all englishmen have the right to exercise freely after they have paid the piper well the foundation stone was laid in 1843 very soon after which the rev james bonwell curate of trinity church preston made a virulent attack upon swedenborgianism and its followers this gentleman who was subsequently unrobed for immorality charged both the ministers of the new church party and all who listened to them with the rebellion of korah dathan and abiram and uttered language implying a wish that the earth would open its mouth and swallow them up the rev augustus clissold ma formerly collegian at oxford who is the only profound scholar in england belonging to the new church sect ably answered him there are many smart polemics but very few great scholars in the sect referred to twentyfive years ago new jerusalem church in avenhamroad was opened and the believers in it increased for some time afterwards anything new is fashionable and a new church always gives an impetus to the number of its worshipers those assembling at the church created much curiosity and not a little cynical criticism at first they even do so now ordinarily orthodox people look down censoriously upon believers in the new jerusalem and class them as a mysterious visionary sect of religionists given up to dreams pious eccentricity and self righteousness but they have like other individuals a reason for their belief if it is madness there is method in it and they are prepared to argue the point and make a respectable disturbance if their creed is assailed we shall not criticise their beliefneither praise nor condemn it but just give its chief points for the benefit of unknowing ones here they are they believe in a trinity not of persons but essentialslove wisdom and power they do not believe in the doctrine of faith alone but of faith conjoined with good works they do not believe in a vicarious atonement but in a reconciliation of man to god they dont believe in a resurrection of the material body but a resuscitation of the spirit immediately after physical death they dont believe in a physical destruction of the world by fire but think that the world as it is now created will continue to existfor ever they have no faith in the noachian deluge and say that the sacred record of it refers to an inundation of evil and not of water finally they believe that there will be marriages in heavennot wedding ring unions not kissing courting and quarrelling amalgamations but conjunctions of goodness with truth and they have further an idea that there will be prolifications in heaven not of crying children with passions for sucking bottles and sugar teats but of truth and goodness swedenborg by whom they swear believed in three heavens and three hells they have a similar idea and fancy that common place sinners who think one heaven will meet all their requirements and that one hell will be too much for their nerves are wrong new jerusalem church in preston has a sunday school beneath ita place obtained partly on the celestial and partly on the irish principleby heightening the roof and lowering the foundations the school is pretty well managed but its scholars are not numerous they number between 60 and 70 and there is no immediate prospect of an increase the endowment of the late mr hugh becconsall realises 100 pounds ayear for the ministerthe rev e d rendell who has been at the church ever since its opening and the investment of a sum of money by the late mr john becconsall of ashton who was a great believer in swedenborgianism brings in on his behalf 50 pounds more the minister once had a call to accrington where the doctrines of the new church obtain a very large number of admirers and in consequence of that call which necessarily implied a better salary as well as a wider sphere of action five 10 pounds notes were added to his stipend here he was appeased by those said notes mr rendell also lives rent free in a house adjoining and belonging to the church its situation renders the house very convenient but a position more distant would not have been very harrowing if freedom from rent had accompanied its tenancy the church is built of stone and has a neat appearance but the approach to it is not very good you have to mount a small flight of steps to get to it and their gradient is so acute that if you should fall on them you would never proceed onward nor lie still but wend your way in a rolling manner to the bottom internally the church is one of the prettiest in preston it is not large we dont suppose it will accommodate more than about 250 but it is peculiarly neat and pleasing the walls are painted and slightly ornamented the windows are toned a little and bordered with elegant wellfinished designs the chancel is fronted with a gothic arch painted in marble pattern and edged with gold beyond there is a circular window stained in bright colours at each end there is a galleryone which apparently contains nothing whilst the other is devoted to the choir at one side of the chancel arch there is a reading desk which looks piously at a pulpit made just like it on the opposite side few churches have windows in the roof but this has about fourat least they are circular lights and in conjunction with the side windows make the place very bright and cheerful at the bass of the chancel beneath the gallery and behind the communion table there are several paintings some if not all of which were executed by the minister who has rather vivid artistic conceptions in the centre there is an open bible and on each side the decalogue or something to that effect for the letters although in gold cant be seen very clearly at a distance flanking these are sacred figures which are too small to be attractive at a greater distance than six yards but in their aggregate the representations look well and they give a good finish to the chancel the seats are of various sizes some will hold three persons others four and a few about six the church is not well attended hardly half of it is occupied except upon special occasions at present it appears to be a little better patronised than formerly but even now the congregation is comparatively thin and there will be no necessity for some time to do anything in the shape of enlarging the building if anything is effected in this way during the present century one of two things will certainly have to happeneither three times as many as those now attending it will have to solicit admission or those actually visiting it will have to grow three times as stout in their physiology they are a quiet piouslooking class of people who frequent the church they may like their great apostle have seasons of inner rapture and like him revel in the mysteries of the arcana coelestia but if so they keep the thing very subdued they never scream nor shout about anything and would refuse to do so if you asked them many of them are elderly people with decorous countenances all of them whether old or young believe in good suits very few of them are wealthy none of them seem very poor calmness with a disposition to find you a seat any time and provide you with books characterises them they have fixed services embracing prayers lessons psalms hymns and chants they have an excellent organ which was given to the place by mrs becconsall and their music is ever so fair their services on sundays are held in the morning and evening and they can get to the latter much easier and in much better time than to the former once a month there is an afternoon instead of an evening service the minister having to officiate for a few of the followers of swedenborg at blackburn who cant afford to pay or wont get or dont want a regular expounder of their views mr rendell is a rather learnedlysolemn kind of gentleman originally he was a painter but he had a greater passion for polemics than brushes and was eventually recommended to and admitted into the church as a minister he reads the scriptures and prays in black kid cloves but he shows the natural colour of his hands when preaching while conducting the preliminary service he wears a white surplice in the pulpit he has a black gown he looks very sacerdotal coldly clerical singularlysad in each place his voice is deep toned and has a melancholy authoritative ring in it he is fond of making critical allusions in his sermons and is rather lengthy in his talk some of the old puritans used to get to a nineteenthly point in their discourses but mr rendell has not reached that numeric climax he can occasionally get to a fifth point and then subdivide it before giving that final word of advice which parsons are so enamoured of but he never branches out beyond this stage his style of preaching is easy but it is very solemn occasionally he pushes a little latin into his discourses and at intervals be graces them with morsels of greek he can be practical sometimes can say a wise and generous thing at intervals but he is often very mysterious and has a large reverence for that which very few people can get at the spiritual sense mr rendell is an author as well as a preacher he has dived into antidiluvian history and has tried to bring up mystic treasures from the postdiluvian period furthermore he has written a prize essay on the last judgment and in addition to everything he is the editor of the juvenile magazine but the salary is only poor still he may console himself with the thought that he gets as much for his annual services on behalf of modern juveniles as milton did for his paradise lost on behalf of all posteritya clear 5 pounds note he has a sharp eye in his head and there is an aristocratic reverentialness in his look learned he is in some things but we are afraid he is too profound and sad he has a good analytical faculty and is a very fair polemical writer but he is very solemn in tonevery serious too wiselooking and phlegmatic his style of speaking has the ring of earnestness in it and his delivery is accompanied with a tolerable amount of activity if he were a little more buoyant if he could put on a less learned and more cheerful look and would not got so very grave in his style he would be better relished polemically he has done fair service for the denomination to which he belongsdone it sometimes in spite of lily and linacre and their descendants and if he is not immaculate he has at least the satisfaction of knowing that nobody else is and never will be until they reach the real new jerusalem trinity church in a part of the town preeminently dim intricate and populous stands the church of the holy trinity father time and the smoke of twice five hundred chimneys have darkened its fabric and transmuted its chiselled stone walls into a dull pile of masonry but it is a beautiful church for all that if the exterior has been carbonised and begrimed the interior has enjoyed a charmed life and is apparently as young today as it was on friday the eighth of december in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and fifteen when george h chester consecrated the building and all thereunto belonging the first stone of this church was laid on the 4th of june 1814the natal anniversary of george iiiby sir henry philip hoghton of hoghton the lay rector and patron of the parish of preston under that first stone there were deposited a number of coins two scrolls and one newspaperthe preston chronicle the first minister of trinity church was the rev edward law a gentleman who according to a local historian ably defended the belief of the adorable trinity in a series of letters assisted by the rev r baxter of stonyhurst against a unitarian minister the rev t c holland which appeared in the preston chronicle and were subsequently reprinted and sold for the enlightenment and mystification of all polemicallyminded men trinity church is built on a plot of ground once called patten field moderns know little if anything of that field but pattenstreeta delicious thoroughfare proximately fronting the churchstill remains as a lingering topographical reminder of olden days there were few houses in the region of patten field when trinity church was built pastures were its colleagues and patches of greensward its regular companions but things have changed since then and a mile of houses stretching northward and westward and eastward now fills up the ancient hiatus trinity church cost 9080 pounds 9s 3d and that sum was raised partly by subscriptions and donations and partly by the sale of pews who gave the ultimate threepence we cannot tell neither are we told in what way it was expended the architecture of the building is gothic there is nothing very striking about the exterior indeed it looks cold and sad and forsaken and its associations dont improve it the church is built upon a hill and therefore cant be hid its approaches may have been good at one time its environs may have been aristocratic and healthy in 1814 but they are not so now smoky workshops old buildings with the windows awfully smashed in houses given up to lodgings for travellers here densely packed dingy cottages and the tower of a wind mill which for years nobody has been willing to either mend or pull down are its architectural concomitants the approaches to the church are varied and aggravatingly awkward you can get to the church from any point of the compass but access to it may mean anythingperhaps a wandering up courts and passages a turning round the corners of old narrow streets an unsavoury acquaintance with the regions of trampery and an uncomfortable perambulation along corntorturing causeways and clumsily paved roads pigeon flyers dog fanciers gossipping vagrants crying children old iron stray hens women with a passion for sitting on door steps men looking at nothing with their hands in their pockets ancient rags pushed into broken windows and the mirage of perhaps one policeman on duty constitute the sights in the neighbourhood the churchyard which contains several substantial tombs and monuments is in a decent state of preservation it looks grave as all such places must do but it is kept in order and men of the hervey type of mind might meditate very beneficially amongst its tombs trinity may not be the longest but it is certainly about the widest church in the town it is neither a high nor a low but an absolutely broad church internally it is excellent on entering the place you are perfectly surprised at its capaciousness nothing cramped nothing showy nothing dim grim nor shabbygenteel enters into its proportions it is finely expansive airy light and well made goodness of build without gaudiness sanctity without sadness and evenness of finish without newfangled intricacy pervade it it is fit for either beggars or plutocrats there is not a better not a plainer neater nor more respectable looking church in the town and there is not a cleaner some of our churches have for years been cultivating a close and irreligious acquaintance with dirtwith dust cobwebs mould and other ancient kinds of mild nastiness but trinity church is a model of cleanliness everything in it seems cleanthe windows pews cushions mats floors c are all clean there is even an air of cleanliness about the sweeping brushes and the venerable dust bin the church has accomodation for about 1400 persons of ordinary proportions the seats are constructed on comfortable principles and that very traditional articlegreen baizeplays an important and goodly part in them at the top and bottom of the middle range on the ground floor the seats are of various shapessome narrow some broad a few oblong and others inclining to the orthodox square the central ones are regular and so are those at the sides in the galleries there is a slight irregularity of shape in the seats but they are all substantial and the bulk easy there are 46 free pews or benches in the church they run along the sides on the ground floor and will accommodate nearly 280 persons all the other seats excepting about two were sold to various parties at the time the church was opened not for any fixed price all round but for just as much as the trustees could get many were bought by highclass local families and the names of several of the original and present proprietors inscribed on small brass platesmay now be seen on the front sides fifty of the pews have ground rents amounting respectively to 1 pounds a year attached to them several of the pews are let the owners caring little for them or having removed to other towns many have been resold at intervals and three have been forfeited through their proprietors having neglected to pay certain trifling rates laid upon them the pews have deteriorated much in price once upon a time when nearly all the fashionable families of preston went to trinity church neither platonic love nor current coin could secure a pew it was a la mode in its most respectable sense it was sabbatical ton in its genteelest form to have and to hold a pew at holy trinity when george the third was king and for a considerable period afterwards this continued to be the case the exact thing on a sunday in preston 40 nay 20 years ago was to own a pew at trinity church to walk up to it and to sit therein it was superior to every modern process and beat walking in the zoo and all that species of delightful work hollow pews were then worth something they are now worth little only the other week a pew originally bought for about 70 pounds was sold by auction for 8 pounds and it is said that some proprietors would not be very unwilling to give a pew or two now if nicely asked just to get out of the ratepaying clauses trinity church has a plain yet pleasing chancel it is neat and good simple yet wellproportioned and elegant the chancel window is but sparingly stained still it has a tasteful and rather stately appearance amber is the most prominent colour in it and loyalty the principal virtue represented on it there are a few small emblematiclooking characters towards the base which few can make out but everybody can see and understand the rather large english outburst of loyalty surmounting the window the display consists of the royal arms well and broadly defined with a crown above them and a lion above all this speaks well for the lion which ought to be satisfied plain gothicbordered tablets with a central monogram occupy the wall below the window they have a good effect and give a somewhat artistic richness to the chancel within and at each end of the communion rails there is a fine old oak chair both are beautifully carved and are valuable the readingdesk and the pulpit are placed opposite each other and at the sides of the chancel they are very tall but altitude rather improves than diminishes their appearance they are well made are fashioned of dark oak and have carved gothic canopies we have seen nothing so tall nor so respectablelooking in the arena of virtuous rostrumdom for a long period on each side of the pulpitdesk there is a small circular hole and those said holes have a history what are they used for said we one day whilst in the pulpit to a friend near us for said the sagacious party they are for nothing and then followed a history which we thus summarise for the benefit of parsons in general a few years ago a gentleman with a redhot dash of hibernian blood in his veins was the curate here when he came the stands of two gas lights were fixed in the holes named but one sunday when wilder than usual he gave the bottom of the righthand stand a vehement beating smashed his ring in the encounter and frightened the incumbent who being apprehensive as to the fate of the two stands and their globes had them shifted further back and more out of the curates reach they were in imminent peril every minute and a change was really necessary not many years agoplenty of people can remember itthe congregation of trinity church was both large and influential the elements of influence and the representatives of wealth may still be seen in it but few and far between are the worshippers pews may be owned seats may be taken few sittings may be to let but where are the worshippers what a pity it is that a church of proportions so goodly an edifice with accomodation so capacious a building with arrangements so substantial and excellent should be deserted in a manner so absolute a screw of large dimensions is loose somewhere the population of the district seems greatdense many of the people round about the church stand singularly in need of entire acres of virtue some of them are thoroughgoing heathens and think heathenism a rather jolly thing at times and yet this most excellent church is comparatively emptydesolatereminding one painfully of ossians picture of balcluthas walls the congregation of trinity church is better than it was a few years ago but it is still lamentably small there is often a beggarly account of empty boxesa great deal of nothing in the church and how to remedy this defect is a problem the present congregation consists of a very moderate number of middle class people a few elderly wellto do individuals a thin scattering of poor folk and a small body of sunday school scholars the recorder of preston who has been connected with the management of the church since the time it was opened attends regularly when health permits trinity church is of course in the hands of trustees and as people of an inquiring turn of mind sometimes wonder who they are we will give their names here are the trustees mr t b addison mr john cooper mr thos walmsley mr john swainson mr john bickerstaffe mr thomas houlker and mr isaac gate the present churchwardens are mr w fort and mr w h smith and they have discharged their duties looked after the church kept it clean preserved its orderin thoroughly commendable style testimonials are due for their services the music at trinity church has for a considerable period been a troublesome irregular unsatisfactory thing years ago it was fine there was full cathedral service in the church then and the orchestral performances were attractive but dullness and poorness are now their characteristics the organ is one of the best in the town its tones are fine and musical it could perhaps be improved in one or two particulars but everything in it is good as far as it goes the tunes however which come from it are of a very ordinary character some of them may be tasteful but the bulk seem weak and wearisomelack fineflowing harmony and can neither be joined in nor appreciated by many parties the members of the choir are not a very lustrous class of vocalists but they do their best and appear to fight through the musical fog surrounding them very patiently we believe the tunes are selected by the incumbent if so let us hope that he will see the propriety of recognising something a little brisker and more classicalsomething rather livelier and more popularly relishable many clergymen simply select the hymns and leave the music to the choir the incumbent might try this plan as an experiment squabbling about music carping and fighting and biting about it have in the past done much harm to trinity church there is more peace now than there used to be amongst the singers but there will never be very much contentment and never much harmony of music until they are permitted to moderately follow the custom of other placesto swim with the tideand have a reasonable share of their own way singers can as a rule quarrel enough among themselves when in the enjoyment of the fullest privileges and interference with their services if they are really worth anything only makes them more illnatured angular and combative they are awkward people to deal with and have strange likings for hot water the minister of trinity church is the rev j t brown and his salary amounts to about 300 pounds a year he was christened at the place was in after years curate of it and is now its incumbent about two years ago when he came to the church in the lastnamed capacity the congregation was wretchedly thinawfully scarce and just on the borders of invisibility it has since improved a little but working up a forsaken place into real activity is a difficult task which at times staggers the ablest of men mr brown is a scholar and a thoroughly upright man he believes not in fighting down other peoples creeds never rails against religious antagonists has a natural dislike to platform bigotry and pulpit wrathfulness is generously inclined will give but not lend objects to everything in the shape of loud clerical display is strongly evangelical in his tastes is exact and calm and orderly even to the cut of his whiskers wont be brought out and exhibited doesnt care about seeing other people make exhibitions and thinks every minister should mind his own business and leave other people alone but he is far too good for a parson a gentle melancholy seems to have got hold of him he always preaches sincerely a quiet spirit of simple unadorned piety pervades his remarksbut he depresses you too much and is rather predisposed to a calm mournful consideration of the great sulphur question he never gets into a lurid passion never horrifies but calmly saddens you in his discourses he is fond of quoting good old richard baxter and john banyan and he might have worse authorities but he is very serious and his words sometimes chill like a condensation of youngs night thoughts if he had more dash and blithesomeness in him if he could fling a little more of this worlds logic into his sermons if he would periodically blow his own trumpet very audibly and make a smart spread now and then he would gather force the best of things will sink if there be not some noise and show made about them if mr brown knew the holloways pills and ointment theory better than he does he would have a fuller congregation but he is too honest and too good for superficial emblazonry and he believes in quietness trinity church has some excellent schools for boys girls and infants the attendance is only poor but it is better than it was the boys school is improving that of the girls is also recruiting the strength it lost last whitsuntide but one when a number of its attendants left in a body because mr brown objected to a display of orange and blue ribbons which they were senselessly enamoured of and with respect to the infants they are regularly growing in size if not in numbers mrs brown wife of the incumbent not only industriously visits the district like a genuine christian lady as she is but teaches in the girls school and at intervals when at churchhere is an example for parsons wiveslooks after a number of the scholars personally whilst her own servants are quietly occupying the family pew we could like to see both the church and the schools of mr brown full he has our best wishes in this respect and we hope he may find some talisman by which the difficulty will be satisfactorily solved lancasterroad congregational chapel preston congregationalism is a very good a very respectable and a very quarrelsome creature it is liberal but gingerly has a large regard for freedom but will quarrel if crossed can achieve commendable triumphs in the regions of peace but likes a conscientious disturbance at intervals believes in the power of union but acts as if a split were occasionally essential will nurse its own children well when they are quiet but recognises the virtues of a shake if uneasiness supervenes respects its ministers much but will order them to move on if they fret its epidermis too acutely can pray well work well fight well and from its antagonisms can distil benefits about nine years since a sacred stirring of heads a sharp moving of tongues and a lively up heaving of bristles took place at cannonstreet congregational chapel in this town the result of the dispute involved amongst other things a separationa clear marching from the place of several parties who whether rightly or wrongly matters not now felt themselves aggrieved they did not leave the chapel in processional order neither did they throw stones and then run when they took their departure the process of evaporation was quiet and orderly for 12 months the seceders worshipped on their own account in accordance with the principles of congregationalism at the institution avenham and whilst there they gathered strength in the meantime they negotiated for land upon which to build a new chapel and schools and finally they purchased a site on the higher side of the orchard contiguous to the old vicaragea rare piece of antique rubbishy ruin in these daysand very near if not actually upon ground which once formed the garden of the famous isaac ambrose who was vicar of preston in 1650 and afterwards ejected with many more in the land on account of his religious opinions thinking it good to harmonise with that ancient wisdom which recommends people to carry the calf before beginning with the cow the new band of congregationalists under notice commenced operations on the site named by erecting a large school room in which for about a year they worshipped in due time they got the chapel built and for about seven years it has been open its position is prominent but its associations like those of the generality of sacred edifices has a special bearing upon the world we live in above it there is a portion of the old vicarage buildings graced in front with various articles the most prominent being a string of delapidated red jackets right facing it we have the sable smithsonian institute flanked with that gay and festive lion which is for ever running and never stirring below there are classic establishments for rifleshooting likeness taking and hot pea revelling and ahead there is the police station the chapel stands well occupies high and commanding ground and looks rather stately its exterior design is good and if the stone of its facade had been of a better qualityhad contained fewer flaws and been more closely jointedit would have merited one of our best architectural bows the chapel and school and the land upon which they are erected cost 7000 pounds and about 1000 pounds of that sum remains to be paid this is not bad considering the brevity of their existence and the severe times they have had to pass through the lancasterroad congregationalists must have worked hard and put a very vigorous christian screw into operation to reduce their debt so rapidly the inside of the chapel is plain very neat and quite genteel we have seen no congregational place of worship in this part equal to it in ease and elegance of design it is amphitheatrical is galleried three quarters round and derives the bulk of its beauty not from ornament not from rich artistic hues nor rare mouldings nor exquisite carvings but from its quiet harmony of arrangement its simple gracefulness of form its close adherence in outline and detail to the laws of symmetry and proportion the circular style prevails most in it and how to make everything round or halfround seems to have been the supreme job of the designer the gallery above the seats below the platform the pulpit on which it stands the chairs behind the orchestra and its canopy the windowheads the surmountings of the entrance screen the gas pendants and scores of other things have all a strong fondness for circularity and the same predilection is manifested outside the large lamps there being quite round and fixed upon circular columns the pews in the chapel are very strong have receding backs and make sitting in them rather a pleasing easy contented affair the highest price for a single seat is 3s 6d per quarter the lowest 1s there are a few free sittings in the place and although they may seem a long way backbeing at the rear of the gallerytheir position is not to be despised they are not so far distant as to render hearing difficult and they obviate that unseemly publicity which is given to poor people in some places of worship how to give the poorest and hungriest folk a very good seat in a very prominent placehow to herd them together and piously pen them up in some particular place where everybody can see themappears to be an object in many religious edifices but that is a piece of benevolent shabbiness which must come to grief some day in the meantime and until the period arrives when honest poverty will be considered no crime and when a seat next to a poor man will be thought nothing vulgar or contaminating whilst worshipping before him who cares for souls not lucre hearts not wealth let the poor be put in some place where they can hear fairly without being unduly exhibited the chapel we are noticing has a spacious appearance within and has none of that depressing dulness which makes some people very sad long before they have been ministerially operated upon from side windows there comes a good light and from the roof which has a central transparency additional clearness is obtained the light from the ceiling would be improved if the glass it were kept a little cleaner the congregation is neither a very large nor a particularly small one it is fairly mediummight be worse and would in no way be hurt if it were enlarged the members number about 120 and they are just about as good as the rest of mortals who have made their calling and election sure the congregation consists almost entirely of middle and working class people there is not so much of that high gassy pride that fine mezzotinto isolated hauteur and selfrighteousness in the place which may be seen in some chapels of course particles of vanity morsels of straightlacedness lively little bits of cantankerousness and odd manifestations of first person pronoun worship periodically crop up but altogether the congregation has a quiet unassuming friendly disposition nobody in it appears to be very much better or worse than yourself there is an evenness of tone and a sociality of feeling in the spot and a stranger can enter it without being violently stared at and can sit down without feeling that his room is nearly if not quite as good as his company the music is fairly congregational individuals in various parts of the chapel have sufficient courage to sing and the choir is moderately harmonious but the melody one hears in the place is rather flat and meagre it lacks instrumental relief and it will never be really up to the mark until an organ is obtained the first regular minister of this chapel was the rev g w clapham he was connected with it for some years then had a difficulty with certain partiesdeacons amongst the rest of course and afterwards left the place uttering in a quiet shaksperian tone as he departed now mark how i will undo myself he threw to the winds his congregationalism and a few months ago joined in due clerical order the church of england the present pastor of lancasterroad congregational chapel is the rev e bolton the church tried the merits of about 30 ministers before making a selection the height depth weight tone of voice matter manner theology brains and spirit of that band of 30 were duly weighed and finally mr bolton was picked out a salary of 300 pounds was offered him he might have got other places and if he had followed the clerical wisdom of his generation he would have tried to secure one of them for they all more or less implied a better salary than that which the preston people offered him but he fixed upon preston just because he fancied more good might be done therein than elsewhere a trick like thisa generosity so distinct as thisis a real oasis in the ecclesiastical desert few parsons would imitate it how to get the biggest salary and lug in the will of the lord as an excuse for changing to some locality where it could be snugly got is the question which many pious men seem desirous of solving mr bolton has different ideas and finds some compensation in goodness achieved as well as in money pocketed he has been at lancasterroad chapel three months and unlike many new parsons he had more sense than preach his best sermons firstthan make a grand pyrotechnic dash at the onset and settle down into a round of prating mediocrity afterwards when tried he gave the people a fair average specimen of what he could dodid not say his best nor his commonest things began with a fire which he could keep up and the result is not disappointment but an increasing relish mr bolton is a plain darkcomplexioned clearheaded manrather clerical in look wellbuilt married about 38 years of age fond of a billycock teetotal but averse to drowning other people with water doesnt think it sinful to smoke just one pipe of tobacco after he has done a days work had rather visit poor than rich people dislikes nambypambying and making a greater fuss over high than low class members of his church thinks that those in poverty need most looking after and that those with good homes and decent purses should try to look a little after themselves believes in working hard cares precious little for deaconswe rather like that for deacons are queer birds to encounter is original in thought fairly up in theology and straightforward in language it is rather a treat to see him preach he does not like the bulk of parsons solemnly work out all his divinity in the pulpit preaching is not a sad up and down airsawing monotonous thing with him he steps out of the sacred box when his feelings begin to warm up moves to one side of it then round the back of it and then to the other side of it talks to you and not at you is quite conversational in style and ignores everything conventional and stereotyped in manner he exercises his lungs with considerable force at times but he never tears nor disturbs the circumambient air with religious agony it is as pleasant to hear as to see him good sound sense neatly adjusted argument newness of thought and clear illustration characterise his expressions he is liberal and independent in tone speaks easily and if he now and then wanders a little he always returns to the question with vigour and freshness he has no written sermons a few notes are sufficient for him he does not believe in long discourses he has an idea that it is better to say a little and let it be well understood than float into immensity let off fireworks there and dumfounder everybody but he has his faults he has quite as much confidence in himself as is requisite for the present he is rather too impervious and too oracular but then who would not be if they had the chance we like him well on the whole and as he is new amongst us it is but right that we should deliver him with charity adjoining the chapel there are many classrooms and a fine school boys girls and infants are accommodated in them the average sunday attendance is about 200 we believe mr bolton will add numeric strength to both the chapel and schools and if he does let no one make the least conceivable noise for there is room enough for all in preston the town isnt a quarter as virtuous as it should be the bulk of us are scarcely half as good as we ought to be and if anybody can do any good in any way let it be done without a single whimper saulstreet primitive methodist chapel there is nothing very timeworn about methodism it is only 140 years old but during that period its admirers have contrived to split numerous hairs and have extended very fairly what is known as the dissidence of dissent the ring of methodism includes many sections it embraces amongst others ordinary wesleyans bryanites new connectionists primitives united free church men and independent methodists they cant all be right but they think they are and that is enough they have as yet requested nobody to be responsible for them and weighing that over well the fairest plan is to let the creed of each aloneto condemn none to give all legitimate chance and permit them to go on antique simplicity seems to be the virtue of those whom we have now to describe and yet there is nothing very ancient about them there is more in the sound than in the name of primitive methodists they are a comparatively young people with a somewhat venerable name it was not until 1810 that they were formed into a society originally they were connected with the wesleyan methodists but they disagreed with them in the course of time and left them eventually the immediate cause of separation was we are informed a dispute as to the propriety of camp meetings and the utility of female preaching the wesleyans couldnt see the wisdom of such meetings nor the fun of such preaching probably they thought that people could get as much good as they would reasonably digest in regular chapel gatherings and that it was quite enough to hear women talk at home without extending the business to pulpits the primitives believed otherwisefancied that camp meetings would be productive of much christian blissfulness and thought that females had as much right to give pulpit as caudle lectures with a chivalry nearly knightly they came to the rescue and gave woman a free pass into the regions of language and theology a third point of difference had reference to the representative character of wesleyan conferences but into that question we need not enter the first regular quarters of preston primitive methodism were in friargate in a yard facing lunestreetin a small building there where a few men with strong lungs and earnest minds had many seasons of rejoicing the thermometer afterwards rose and for some time a building which they erected in lawsonstreet and which is now used as the weavers institute was occupied by them often did they get far up the dreamy ladder of religious joy and many a time did they revel with a rich and deafening delightfulness in the regions of zeal there they were determined to keep the thing warm and to let outsiders know that if they were not a large they were a lively body primitive methodism does not profess to be a fine but an earnest thingnot a trimmedup lackadaisical arrangement but a strong sincere simple enthusiastic species of religion it has largely to do with the heart and the feelings is warmnatured full of strong straightforward devotional vigour combines homeliness of soul with intensity of imagination links a great dash of honest turbulence with an infinitude of deep earnestness tells a man that if he is happy he may shout that if under a shower of grace he may fly off at a tangent and sing makes a sinner wince awfully when under the pang of repentance and orders him to jump right out of his skin for joy the moment he finds peace gives him a fierce cathartic during conversion and a rapturous cataplasm in his reconciliation primitive methodism occupies the same place in religion as the ballad does in poetry it has an untamed blithesome healthy ring with it harmonises well with the common instincts and the broad common intuitions of common life cant hurt a prince and will improve a peasant wont teach a king wrong things is sure to infuse happiness amongst men of humbler mould its exuberance is necessary on account of the materials it has to deal with its spiritual ebullitions and esctacies are required so that they may accord with and set all ablaze the strong vehement spirits who bend the knee under its aegis primitive methodism has reached deeper depths than many other creedshas touched harder wilder ruder souls than nearly all the isms put together it may not have made much numeric progress may not have grown big in figures nor loud in facts but it has done goodhas gone down in the diving bell of hope to the low levels of sin and brought up to the clear rippling surface of life and light many a pearl which would have been lost without it primitive methodism is just the religion for a certain class of beings just the exact article for thousands who cant see far ahead and who wouldnt be able to make much out if they could there are people adoring it who would be stupid reticent and recalcitrant under any other banner who would wonder what it all meant if they were in a calmer clearer atmospherewho would be muddymottled and careless in a more classical and ambrosial arena after this learned morsel of theorising we shall return to the subject in 1836 the primitive methodists left their lawsonstreet seminary and pitched their tent eastwardson a piece of land facing saul street and flanking lambstreet its situation is pretty good and as it stands right opposite only about eight yards from the baths and washhouses we would suggest to the saulstreet brethren the propriety of putting up some sign or getting some inscription made in front of their chapel to the effect that cleanliness is next to godliness and that both can be obtained on easy terms the chapel is a very ordinary looking building having a plain brick front with sides of similar material and a roof of welsh slate which would look monotonous if it were not relieved on the western side by 19 bricks and two stones and on the eastern by four stones one brick and a piece of rodiron tacked on to keep a contiguous chimney straight the chapel has a somewhat spacious interior and has a large gallery fixed on six rather slender iron pillars the pews have at some time had one or more coats of light delicate green paintthe worst colour which could be chosen for enduranceput upon them and many are now curiously black at the rear through people leaning back against them a glance round shows the various sombre places and their relative darkness gives a fair clue as to the extent of their use at one end there is a small gallery for the choir and the organ and in front of it the pulpit a plain moderatelysubtantial affair is located the organ is a very poor one it has a tolerably good appearance but it is a serious sinner with reference to its internal arrangements we quietly examined it very recently and should have gone away with a determination not to be comforted if an intimation had not been made to the effect that the organist was organising a plan for a new organ and that there was some probability of a better instrument being fit up before very long the members of the choir are of a brisk warbling turn of mind and can push through their work blithely the singing is thoroughly congregationalpermeates the whole place is shot out in a quick cheerful strain is always strong and merry is periodically excellent is often jolly and funny has sometimes a sort of chorus to it and altogether is a strong virtuouslyjocund free and easy piece of ecstacy which the people enjoy much it would stagger a man fond of linked sweetness long drawn out it might superinduce a mortal ague in one too enamoured of handel and mozart but to those who regularly attend the place who have got fairly upon the lines of primitive action it is a simple process of pious refreshment and exhileration the chapel will hold between 700 and 800 persons if hydraulicised 1000 might be got into it but such a number is rarely seen in the place and the average attendance may be set down at about 600 there are about 400 members in connection with the place and they respectively contribute 1d per week towards the expenses we may here remark that in preston there are two primitive methodist chapels that in saulstreet being the principal one the circuit runs mainly westward its utmost limit in that direction being fleetwood formerly three ministers were stationed at saulstreet chapel but two are now considered sufficient and they are as a rule married men the circuit being considered sufficiently large to keep parties in the olive branch category in the whole circuit there are between 700 and 800 members the congregation of saul street chapel is almost entirely of a workingclass character in the front and on each side of the body of the building there are a few free seats which are mainly used by very poor humblelooking people the ministers are the rev j judson who is the superintendent and the rev w graham they are paid on a systematic and considerate plan money is given to them to accordance with the number of their family they get so much per headthe more numerous the family and the larger the pay becomes but it is not very extraordinary at the best of times and if even a preacher happened to have a complete houseful of children if his quiver were absolutely full of them he would not be pecuniarly rich the bulk of primitive methodist preachers are taken from the working classes and the pay they receive is not more than they could earn if they kept out of the ministry altogether they become parsons for the love of the cause and not for loaves and fishes reverting to mr judson it may be said that he is a quiet earnest elderly closeshaven clerical looking gentlemanhas a welldefined keen solemnity on his countenance looks rather like a catholic priest in facial and habilimental cut is one of the old school of primitive preachers is devout but not luminous good but not erudite is slow and long drawn in his utterances but he can effervesce on a high key at intervals and can occasionally draw out the brethren to a hot pitch of exuberance his general style is sincere he means well but his words like colddrawn castor oil dont go down with overmuch gusto the junior preachermr grahamis more modernised in manner and matter he is an earnest thoughtful plodding man can preach a fair sermon tears a little sometimes and can bring down the house in tolerably good style both of them are hard workers both are doing good and neither must be despised on account of humility of position primitive like wesleyan preachers are changed periodically superintendents can under certain conditions stay at one place for three years but no longer junior men have to cut their straps every two years since this description was first published both the ministers named have gone the rev thomas doody having succeeded as superintendent and the rev john hall as junior mr doody is a middleaged gentleman is a pretty good preacher has considerable zeal in him and fires up more energetically than his predecessor mr hall is a young man with a rather elderly look his style is discursive his lucid intervals not as electrical as those of some primitive parsons but he is a good fellow and if he had more physical force and more mental condensation be would go down better there are numerous collections some fixed and some incidental at saulstreet and on special occasions they can raise sums of money which would put to the blush the bulk of loftier and more respectable congregations not much time is lost by the saul street primitives every monday evening they have preaching at the place on tuesday evening three or four class meetings in which singing praying and talking are carried on on wednesday ditto on thursday evening the singers work up their exercises on friday evening there is a meeting of leaders or committee men on saturday evening a band of hope meeting and on sundays they are throng from morning till night their prayer meetings are pious and gleeful affairs throughout the whole of such gatherings and in fact generally when prayer is being gone on with the steam is kept well up and the safety valve often lifts to let off the extra pressure sharp shouts breezy amens tenderlyattenuated groans deep sighs sudden hallelujahs and vivacious cries of just now aye glory yes praise the lord call well meant characterise them but prayer meetings are not half so stormy as they used to be twenty or thirty years since they were tremendously boisterous now whilst a fair amount of ejaculatory talk is done at them they are becoming comparatively quiet and on sundays only a few of the oldfashioned and more passionately devoted members make noises love feasts are held occasionally at saulstreet as at all other primitive methodist chapels the members give their experience at these gatheringstell with a bitter sorrow how sinful they once were mention with a fervid minuteness the exact moment of their conversion allude to the temptations they meet and overcome the quantity of grace bestowed upon them the sorrows they pass through and the bliss they participate in we have heard men romance most terribly at some of these love feasts but we are not prepared to say that anybody does so at saulstreet chapel immediately adjoining the chapel there is a large and well made building which has only been erected about two years the lower portion of it is used for class rooms the upper part is appropriated for sunday school purposes the average attendance of scholars is 350 belonging the school there is a good library the building cost about 1000 pounds and is entirely free from debt considering everything the saulstreet primitives are doing a praiseworthy work they may lack the spiciness and finish of more fashionable bodies they may have little of that wealthiness about them which gives power and position to many but they are a class of earnest useful humble souls drawing to them from the lowly walks of life men and women who would be repelled by the processes of a more aesthetic and learned creed we have a considerable regard for primitive methodism in some respects we admire its operations and for the good it does we are quite willing to tolerate all the erratic earnestness musical effervescence and prayerful boisterousness it is so enamoured of st ignatiuss catholic church catholicism owes much to the jesuits and casuistically speaking the jesuits owe their existence to a broken leg ignatius of loyola was their founder he was at first a page then a soldier then got one of his legs broken in battle was captured and confined as an invalid had his immortal leg set and reset whiled away his time whilst it was mending in reading romances got through all within his reach could at last find nothing but the lives of the saints had his latent religious feelings stirred during their perusal travelled to different places afterwards and at last established the order of jesuitsan order which has more learning within its circle than perhaps any other section of men which has sent out its missionaries to every clime has been subjected to every kind of vicissitude has been suppressed by kings and emperors ostracised by at least one pope and shouted down often by excited peoples in the heated moments of revolution but which has somehow managed to live through it all and progress the men fighting under the standard of ignatius have a tenacity a mysterious irrepressibleness about them which dumfounds the orthodox and staggers the processes of ordinary calculators in preston we have three churches besides an auxiliary chapel wherein priests of the jesuit order labour by far the largest number of preston catholics are in charge of those priests and the generality of them dont seem to suffer anything from the tyrannythat is the phrase some of us protestants delight to honourof their supervision they can breathe and walk about laugh and grow fat without any difficulty and they are sanguine of being landed in ultimate ecstacy if they conduct themselves fairly in a former article we referred to one of the catholic churches in this townst wilfridswhich is looked after by jesuit priestson this occasion we purposely alluding to anotherst ignatiuss the catholics in the district of this church are very strong they number about 6000 are mainly of a workingclass complexion and are conveniently and compactly located for educational and religious purposes catholics are so numerous in the neighbourhoodare so woven and interwoven amongst the denizens of itthat it is a good and a safe plan never to begin running down the pope in any part of it murphyites and patent christians fond of immolating rome c would have a very poor chance of success in this district the church of st ignatius stands in the square which bears its name the first stone of the edifice was laid on the 27th of may 1833 to 1858 the church was enlarged and in the course of the reopening services the famous dr manning now archbishop of westminster preached a sermon the building is erected in the perpendicular english style of architectureliterally a very general thing the horizontal style being yet unworkable is railed round and has a dim quiet elegance about its exterior at the southern end there is a tower with a spire surmounted by a cross above it the total height being 120 feet it may be information to some people when we state that the first spire attached to any place of worship in preston was that we now see at st ignatiuss indeed up to 1836 it was the only spire which could be found between the ribble and the lune spires have since sprang up pretty numerously in preston but there was a time and not very long since either when the line in the well known doggrel verse high church and low steeple was descriptively correct the original cost of st ignatiuss church with the adjoining priests house was about 8000 pounds and of that sum upwards of 1000 pounds was raised by small weekly offerings from the poor the church has got an outside clock with three faces and they would sustain no injury whatever if they were either washed or regilt we dont think the clock would strike against such a thing the enlargement of the church which was at the chancel end cost about 3000 pounds and the money was quite ready when the job was finished the building is cruciform in shape and has a fine interioris lofty capacious and cathedrallike the high altar is very choice and beautiful and the contiguous decorations are profuse and exquisite the painting is rich and elaborate and the most frigid soul if blessed with even a morsel of artistic taste would be inclined to admire it there is a large window behind the altar and it is a very handsome affair but it is rather too brightflashes and crystalises a little too strongly and needs a deeper tone somewhere to make it properly effective not very far from the pulpit which is massive elegant and calculated to hold the stoutest priest in the country there are two large statues standing on tall stone columnsopposite each otherat the sides of the nave one of them represents st joseph and the other we believe st ignatius not very far from this part of the building there used to be a statue of st patrick but it was removed to one side awhile since either to make room for some other ornament or to edify those belonging ould ireland who may happen to sit near its present position towards the higher end and on each side of the church there is an opening projecting back several yards a gallery occupies each of these spaces and beneath there are seats the roof of the nave which is finely decorated depends upon parallel stone columns but they are rather heavyare massive and numerous enough to support another church if ever one should be erected above the present edifice the seats are of plain stained wood and the doors are gradually disappearing open seats are desiderated and whenever the opportunity occurs the doors are attacked some of the pews have doors to them and so long as the present occupiers hold their sittings in them they will not unless it is requested be disturbed but as soon as they leave the doors will be quietly taken off and either sold or judiciously split up or quietly buried adjoining the chancel there are four of those mystic places called confessionals the other evening we were in every one of them viewed them round from head to foot asked a priest who was with us the meaning of everything visible and left without noticing in any of them anything to particularly fret at confession is good for the soul we are told and by all means let those who honestly believe in it go the entire figure without molestation or insult every morning on week days there is mass in the church at seven halfpast seven and eight oclock every friday evening there is benediction and on sundays a great business is doneat eight nine ten and eleven in the forenoon at three in the afternoon and at halfpast six in the evening there are masses combined more or less with other ceremonies the proper services are understood to be at eleven and halfpast six the nine and ten oclock masses are by far the best attended partly because they appear to be more convenient than the others and partly because the work is cut comparatively short at them human nature as a rule cant stand a very long fire of anything doesnt like to have even too much goodness pushed upon it for too long a time believes in a very short and very sweet thing it may have to pay more for it as it has at the ten oclock mass on a sunday at st ignatiussfor the price of seats at that time is just double what it is at any other only the work is got through sharply and that is something to be thankful for school children have the best seats allotted to them at the mass just named and the wealthiest man in the place occupying the most convenient seat in it has to beat a mild retreat and take his hat with him when they appear the more fashionable and solemnlybalanced catholics attend the services at eleven and halfpast six they are made of respectable metal which will stand a good deal of calm hammering and absorb a considerable quantity of virtuous moisture at this as at all other catholic chapels the usual aqueous and genuflecting movements are made and they are all done very devotedly more water we think is spilled at the entrance than is necessary and we would recommend the observance of a quiet even calm dipnot too long as if the hand were going into molasses nor too fleetingly as if it had got hold of a piece of hot iron by mistake at ten and three on sundays the music is sung by a number of girls occupying one of the small galleries wherein there is an organ which is played by a nun the singing is sweet and the nun gets through her work pleasantly the catholic soldiers stationed at fulwood barracks make st ignatiuss their place of devotional resort they attend the nine oclock sunday morning mass and muster sometimes as many as 200 one of the finest sights in the church is that which the guilds of the place periodically make on the first sunday in every month the girls and womens guilds numbering about 600 members attend one of the morning masses on the third sunday in each month the members of the boys and mens guilds numbering between 400 and 500 do likewise fine order prevails amongst them numerous captains are in command special dresses are worn by many of the members some of the girls are in white all the members wear sashes crosses c and after entering their bright goldenhued banners are planted in lines at the ends of the seats giving a rare and imposing beauty to the general scene the church will hold about 1000 persons and the complete attendance on a sunday is about 3500 the congregation is principally made up of working class people and they have got a spirit of devotion and generosity within them which many a richer and more rosewatered assembly would do well to cultivate there are four priests at st ignatiuss and in addition to the duties discharged by them in the church they have special departments of labour to look after outside it father j walker the principal priest superintends the female guilds and visits the soldiers at the barracks father r brindle attends to the male guilds father boardman hangs out an educational banner and has the management of the various schools the fourth priest officiates as auxiliary wonders used to be worked in this district by the rev father cooperan indefatigable farseeing mildmoving man in very plain clothes who could any time get more money for religious and educational purposes than half a score of other priests he was always planning something for the improvement of the district was always looking after the vital endthe money and was always bringing in substantial specimens of the current coin he included protestants among his supporters people who in nine cases out of ten would give to nobody elsewere always calmly tickled and trotted into a generous mood by him st ignatiuss district was stirred into full and active life by father cooper he extended and elaborated the church improved the schools greatly touched with the wand of progress everything belonging the mission and the catholics of the neighbourhood may thank all their stars in one lot for his 15 years residence amongst them a man like father cooper was bad to follow it was no easy matter putting his shoes on and walking in them regularly through the district but his successor father walker who has seen something of the world has done service in the west indies has fought with mosquitoes confronted black and yellow fever preached to dark men and soldiers and made himself moderately acquainted with the hues and habits of butterflies centipedes and snakes if the museum at stonyhurst college is anything to go by was not the priest to be either disheartened or ignored father walker is a locomotive wiry fibrous manfull of energy wide awaketenacious keenly perceptive could pass his sharp eye round you in a second and tell your age weight and habits could nearly look round a corner and say how many people were in the next street has a touch of shrewd suddenworking humour to him can stand a joke but wont be played with has a strong sense of straightforwardness is tall dark complexioned weirdlooking wears bushy hair which is becoming iron grey and uses a thin penetrating pair of spectacles he has been at st ignatiuss for twoandahalf years the decorations in the church are mainly due to him and he has earned the respect and affection of the people his style of preaching is clear sonorouslysounding and vigorous is not rhetorically flashy but strong impetuous and full of energy the ardour of his nature makes his utterances rapid but they are always distinct and there is nothing extravagant or tragic in his action he is a clearheaded determined sagacious man and would be formidable if put to it with either his logic or fists father brindle who has been at the church about ten years is a quiet mildlyflowing gentlybreathing man has nothing vituperative or declamatory in his nature works hard and regularly has an easy gentle subdued style of preaching but knows what common sense means and can infuse it into his discourses if he had a little more force he would be able to knock down sinners better the oracle cant always be worked with tranquillity delinquents need bruising and smashing sometimes father boardmanan active unassuming sort of gentlemanhas been at the church for about a year he is quick in the regions of education and literature knows much about old and new books has a lively regard for ancient classical and religions works is perhaps better acquainted with the 26000 volumes in stonyhurst college library than anybody else likes to preach on tuitional questions has a mortal dislike of secular education he is plodding intelligent up to the mark in his business and if 50 changes were made it is quite probable no improvement would be made upon him father baron comes next when we visited st ignatiuss he had only been there a few weeks and since then he has gone to some place near london for a long time father baron was at wakefield and during his stay there he officiated as catholic chaplain of the gaol he was the first priest in the kingdom who made application under the prison ministers act for permission to hold regular gaol services in wakefield he earned the respect of all classes and there was general regret expressed when it became known he had to leave protestants as well as catholics liked him and if he had stayed in preston the very same feeling would have been created he is just about the most fatherly and genial man we have seen has a venerated rubicund cozy look seems like the descendant of some festive abbot or blithesome friar makes religion agree with him some people are never happy unless they are being tortured by it has hit upon the golden meanis neither too ascetical nor too jocund is simply good and jolly has ever so much vivacity sprightliness and poetic warmth in his constitution can preach a lively earnest sermon has a strong imitative faculty is brisk in action can tell a good tale is fine company wouldnt hurt anybody would step over a fly rather than kill it unkindly and is just such a man as we should like for a confessor if we were a believer in his church he has been succeeded by father pope who is no relative of the old gentleman at rome but is we believe a nephew of the celebrated archbishop whately all the priests at st ignatiuss avoid in their discourses that which is nowadays very fashionableattacking other peoples creeds a person who has regularly attended the church for twenty years said to us the other day that he had never heard one sermon wherein a single word against other folks creeds had been uttered the great object of the priests is to teach those who listen to them to mind their own business and that isnt a bad thing at any time the music at st ignatiuss is of a high order it is not nice and easy but rich and vigorousfine and fierce comes out warm and has with it a strong compact harmony indicative of both ability and earnestness the conductor is energetic and efficient wields his baton in a lively manner but hits nobody with it there is a very fair organ in the church and it is pleasantly played the blowers also do their duty commendably adjoining the church there is the priests housea rather labrynthal commodious place with plain ancient furniture beyond is a very excellent school for girls as well as infants of the gentler sex it is supervised by nuns some of whom are wonderfully clever they are sisters of the holy child are most painstaking sincere and useful never dream about sweethearts devote their whole time to religion and education all of them are well educated two or three of them are smart the school which has an average attendance of 550 is in a high state of efficiency is in fact one of the best to the country the sceptical can refer to government reports if they wish for absolute proof still further on there is another school set apart for the instruction of middle class boys and in charge of three xavierian brothers about 90 boys attend it and they are well disciplined at the rear of the school there is a fine playground for the boysit is about the largest in preston and close to it we have the old graveyard of the church which is in a tolerably fair state of order brothers of the xavierian type have been in charge of the school for about nine years the three now at it are mild obliging quietlooking men they live in a house hard by and do all the household work themselves well done xavierians you will never be aggravated with the great difficulty of domestic lifeservantmaidism will never have to solve the solemn question as to when it is susans sunday out will never be crossed by a ribbonwearing jemima nor harrowed up in absent moments by pictures of hungry followers fond of cold joints and pastry in addition to looking after the school the xavierians in question give religious instruction at nights and on sundays to the children attending st ignatiuss school in walker street the sunday after we visited the church about fifty whom they had been training received their first communion and in addition got a medal and their breakfast giventwo things which nobody despises as a rule whether on the borders of religious bliss or several miles therefrom the school in walkerstreet is attended every day by about 400 boys and infants and is in an improving condition the sunday schools are in a very flourishing state the girls attending them numbering about 650 and the boys about 500 taking all into account a great educational work is being carried on in the district of st ignatius the importance of secular and religious instruction is fully appreciated by the priests they know that such instruction moulds the character and tells its tale in after life they are active and alive to the exigences of the hour are on the move daily and nightly for the sake of the mind and the soul and they like the rest of their brethren set many of our protestant parsons an example of tireless industry which it would be well for them to imitate if they wish to maintain their own and spread the principles they believe in vauxhallroad particular baptist chapel dont be so particular is a particularly popular phrase it comes up constantly from the rough quarry of human natureis a part of lifes untamed protest against punctilliousness and mathematical virtue particular people are never very popular people just because they are particular the world isnt sufficiently ripe for niceties it likes a lot and pouts at eclectical squeamishness it believes in a big vigorous roughhewn medley is choice in some of its items but free and easy in the bulk and it cant masticate anything too severely didactic too purely logical too strongly distinct or too acutely exact but it does not follow etymologically that a man is right because he is particular he may be very good or very bad and yet be only such because he is particularly so singularity eccentricity speciality isolation oddity and hundreds of other things which might be mentioned all involve particularity but we do not intend to grammarout the question nor to disengage and waste our gas in definitions the particular enters into all sorts of things and it has even a local habitation and a name in religion what could be more particular than particular baptism certain followers of a man belonging the great smith family constituted the first congregation of english baptists these were of the general type the particular baptists trace their origin to a coterie of men and women who had an idea that their grace was of a special type and who met in london as far back as 1616 the doctrines of the particular baptists are of the calvinistic hue they believe in eternal election free justification ultimate glorification they have a firm notion that they are a special people known before all time that not one of them will be lost and they differ from the general baptists so far as discipline is concerned in thisthey reject open communion will allow no membership prior to dipping orto quote the exact words of one of them who wrote to us the other day on the subject and who paled our ineffectual fire very considerably with his definitionall who enter our pail must be baptised if there is any water in the pail they will if not it will be a simple question of dryness the chapel used by the particularbaptists in vauxhallroad preston has a curious history it beats platos theory of transmigration and is a modern edition of ovids metamorphoses the building was erected by mr george smith father of the late alderman g smith of this town and he preached to it for a short time afterwards it was occupied by a section of methodists connected with the round preachers then it was purchased by a gentleman of the general baptist persuasion who let it to the late mr moses holdena pious astronomical person who held forth in it for a season with characteristic force subsequently it was taken possession of by the episcopalians the rev mr pearson late of tockholes being the minister he along with some of his flock was in the habit of holding prayer meetings c in different parts of the town the vauxhallroad building being their central depot but when the rev carus wilson was appointed vicar of preston an end was put to both their praying and preaching when the episcopalians made their exit a section of religious people called the fieldingites obtained the building they drove a moderately thriving business at the place until permission was unwittingly given for a mormon preacher to occupy the pulpit just oncea circumstance which resulted in a thorough breakup many of the body liking neither joe smith nor his polygamising followers after the mormon fiasco and the evaporation of the fieldingites another denomination took it the particular baptistssome people call them gadsbyiteswere at this period working the virtues of their creed in a small room towards the bottom of cannonstreet and on hearing that vauxhall road chapel was on sale they smiled made a bid at it and bought it their first minister after the removal was a certain mr mckenzie who stimulated the elect with many good things and eventually died the question as to who should be his successor next presented itself supplies were tried various men from various parts were invited into the pulpit looked at and listened to the object being to get the right man in the right place there was considerable difference of opinion as to that said right man one portion of the church wanting a smart wellstarched polished individual and the other desiring a plain straightforward gospel preachera man of the gadsby kidney capable of hitting people hard and telling the truth without any fear this was in 1848 and about this time a plain homely broadhearted lancashire chap named thomas haworth a block printer by trade and living in the neighbourhood of accrington who had taken to preaching in his spare time was invited to supply the vauxhallroad pulpit tommythats his recognized name and hell not be offended at us for using itcame saw and conquered he made his appearance in a plain coat a plain waistcoat and a pair of plain bluecoloured corduroy trousers and as he went up the steps of the pulpit people not only wondered where he came from but who his tailor was and if they had seen his hat they would have been solicitous as to its manufacturer the more elaborate portion of the church pulled uncongenial features at the young blockprinters appearance thought him too rough too unreclaimed too outspoken and too vehement the plain people the humble hardworking unfashionable folk liked him and said he was just the man for them time kept moving tommy was asked to officiate in the pulpit for 52 sundays he consented kept up his fire well and in a good gadsbyfied style and when settling day came a majority of the members decided that he should remain with them the noncontents moved off said that it would not do was too much of a good thing escaped to zoar and in the course of this retreat somebody tookwhatnot the pulpit nor its bible nor the hymn books nor the collecting boxes nor the unpaid bills belonging the chapel butthe title deeds of the old place and to this day they have not been returned this was indeed a sharp thing how shylockhow the old jew with his inexorable pound of fleshworship creeps up in every section of human society vauxhallroad chapel which has passed through more denominational agony than any twenty modern places of worship put together is situated in a poor localityin a district where pure air and less drink and more of the christ that is to be as tennyson would say are needed than the majority of places in the town architecturally the chapel is nothing and if it were not for a few tall front rails painted green a good gable end pointed up and a fairly cut inscription thereon it would ecclesiastically speaking seem less than nothing it has just been repainted internally and necessarily looks somewhat smart on that account but there is no pretension to architecture in the general building between 500 and 600 persons might be accomodation in it but the average attendance is below 200 people are not particular about what church or chapel they belong to in its locality and some of them who belong to no place seem most wickedly comfortable there is a great deal of heathenish contentment in vauxhallroad district and how to make the people living there feel properly miserable until they get into a christian groove of thought is a mystery which we leave for the solution of parsons the interior of vauxhallroad particular baptist chapel is specially plain and quiet looking has nothing ornamental in it and at present having been newly cleaned it smells more of paint than of anything else the pews are of various dimensionssome long some square all highand whilst grained without they are all green within this is not intended as a reflection upon the occupants but is done as a simple matter of taste the members of the chapel at present are neither increasing nor decreasingare stationary and they wilt number altogether between 50 and 60 either the chapel is too near the street or the street too near the chapel or the children in the neighbourhood too numerous and noisy for on sundays mainly during the latter part of the day there is an incessant halfshouting halfsinging din from troops of youngsters adjoining who play all sorts of chorusing games which must seriously annoy the worshippers the music at the chapel is strong lively and congregational sometimes there is more cry than wool in it but taken altogether and considering the place it is creditable there is neither an organ nor a fiddle nor a musical instrument of any sort that we have been able to notice in the place all is done directly and without equivocation from the mouth the members of the choir sit downstairs in a square place fronting the pulpit the young menin their quiet momentslooking very pleasantly at the young women the older members maintaining a mild equillibrium at the same time and all going off stiffly when singing periods arrive the hymn books used contain principally pieces selected by the celebrated william gadsby and nobody in the chapel need ever be harassed for either length or variety of spiritual verse they have above 1100 hymns to choose from and in length these hymns range from three to twenty three verses whilst inspecting one of the books recently we came to a hymn of thirteen verses and thought that wasnt so badwas partly long enough for anybody but we grew suddenly pale on directly afterwards finding one nearly twice the sizeone with twentythree mortal verses in it it is to be hoped the choir and the congregation will never he called upon to sing right through any hymn extending to that disheartening and elastic length we have heard a chapel choir sing a hymn of twelve verses and felt ready for a stimulant afterwards to revive our exhausted energies if twentythree verses had to be fought through at one standing in our hearing we should smile with a musical ghastliness and perish at the back of the chapel there is a sundayschool it was built in 1849 the number of scholars on the books is 120 and the average attendance will be about 90 in connection with the school there is a nice little library and if the children read the books in it and legitimately digest their contents they will be brighter than some of their parents there are two sunday services at the chapelone in the morning and the other in the evening no religious meetings are held in it during weekdays the minister couldnt stand them he is getting old and rotund and constitutionally finds it quite hard enough to preach on sundays he would be killed said one of the deacons to us the other day in a very earnest and sympathetic manner if he had to preach on week dayshes so stout you know and weighs so heavy we hardly think he would be killed by it standing in a narrow pulpit for a length of time must necessarily be fatiguing to him but why cant things be made easy if a high seat a tall broad easy elasticbottomed chairwere procured and fixed in the pulpit he could sit and preach comfortably or a swing might be procured for him such a contrivance would save his feet check his perspiration and console his dorsal vertebra we suggest the propriety of securing a chair or a swing it would be grand preaching and swinging the congregation at vauxhallroad chapel is preeminently of a workingclass character nearly the whole of the pew holders are factory people not above six or seven of them find employment outside of mills they are a plain honest enthusiastic homespun class of folk a few there may be amongst the lot who are authoritative or saucy or illnaturedly solemn but the generality are simpledealing quaintlyexhuberant oddlystraightforward and primitivelypious peopledistinctly sincere periodically eccentric and fond of a good religious outburst a shining spiritual fandango now and then as we have before intimated the minister of the chapel is mr thomas haworth during the first 18 years of his ministry he received 20s a week for his services for three years afterwards he got 25s during the last two he has had 30s per week and his temporal consolation is involved in a sovereign and a half at present be is 54 years of age has had very little education believes in telling the truth as far as he knows it and cares for nobody he has a strongly intuitive mind is full of human nature is broadfaced very fat and thoroughly english in look has a chin which is neither of the nutmeg nor the cucumber order but simply double weighs heavier than any other parson in preston couldnt run gets out of breath and pants when he goes up the pulpit stairs has his own ideas and likes sticking to them about everything has neither cunning nor deception in him is rough but honest is without polish but full of common sense would have been a good companion for tim bobbin in his better moments and for sam slick in his unctuous periods cares more for thoughts than grammar likes to rush out in a buster when the spell is upon him can either shout you into fits or whisper you to sleepis in a word a virtuous and venerable caution he is the right kind of man for humble queerthinking determined sincerelysingular christians is just the sort of person you should hear when the blues are on you has much pathos much fire much uncurbed virtue in him is a sort of theological baileys dictionaryrough ready outspoken unconventional and funny is a second gadsby in oddness and force and sincerity but lacks gadsbys learning unlike the bulk of parsons mr haworth does his own marketing you may see him almost any saturday in the market with a huge orthodox basket in his handa basket bulky and made not for show but for holding things he has no pride in him and thinks that a man shouldnt be ashamed of buying what he has to eat and neednt blush if he has to carry home what he wants to digest his sermons in both manner and matter are essentially haworthian there is no gilt no mock modesty in his style there is to vapid sentimentalism in the ideas he expounds a broad unshaven everyday lancashire vigour pervades both and what he cant make out he guesses at in the pulpit he seems earnest but uneasy honest but fidgetty about his eyes and legs watch him he preaches extemporaneously but often peers up and winks and often looks down at his bible and squeezes his eyes he has a great predilection for turning to the leftthat he apparently thinks is the right side for small appeals of a special character and when he gets back again for the purpose of either looking at his book or sending out a new idea he makes a short oscillating waddlea sharp whimsical wavy motion as if he either wanted to get his feet out of something or stir forward about half an inch he pitches his hands about with considerable activity and often flings himself suddenly into a whiteheat tantrum of virtue and the brethren like him when be does this he is original when stormy is refreshing when his temper is up his style is naturalis a reflection of himselfis warm with life is odd and at times fierce through the power of his sincerity his illustrations are all homely his theories most original his expressions most honest and quaint he has a fondness for the old testamentlikes to get into the company of isaiah jeremiah c sometimes touches the hem of habakkuks garment and nods at a distance occasionally at joel and the other minor prophets we should like to see a biblical commentary from his pen it would be immortal on account of its straightforwardnsss and oddity adam clarke and matthew henry must sometimes turn over in their graves when he expounds the more mysterious passages of sacred writ to no one does mr haworth hold the candle he is candid to all and pitches into the entire confraternity of his hearers sometimes he said one sunday none of you are ower much to be trustednone of us are ower good are we a bless ya i sometimes think if i were to lay my head on a deacons breastone of our own lotmay be there would be a nettle int or summut at sooart he is partial to long ohs and ahs and solemn breathings and sometimes tells you more by a look or a subdued calmlymoulded groan than by dozens of sentences he spices his sermons considerably with the lancashire dialect isnt at all nice about aspirates inflection or pronunciation thinks that if you have got hold of a good thing the best plan is to out with it and to out with it any way rough or smooth so that it is understood he never stood at philological trifles in his life and never will do those who listen to him regularly think nothing of his singularities of gesture and expression but strangers are bothered with him occasionally the ordinary worshippers look in different directions and smile rather slyly when he is budding and blossoming in his own peculiar style but they never make much ado about the business and swallow all that comes very quietly and goodnaturedly strangers prick their ears directly and would laugh right out sometimes if they durst there are not many collections at the chapel but those which are made are out of the ordinary run two were made on the sunday we were there and they realised whatnot 5 pounds nor 10 pounds nor 12 pounds as is the custom at some of our fashionable places of worshipno they just brought in 63 pounds 3s 9d at the request of the minister who announced the sum the congregation set to and sung over it for a short time simplicity and liberality mingled with much earnestness and a fair amount of self righteousness are the leading traits of the elect at vauxhall road chapel whilst their minister is a curious compilation of eccentricity sagacity waddlement winking straightforwardness and thorough honesty christ church about 33 years since there was a conquest somewhat norman in preston and the neighbourhood and the william of it was an industrious exjoiner in 1836 and during the next two years four churches three in preston and one in ashtonwere erected through the exertions of the rev carus wilson who was vicar here at that time each of them was built in the norman style and the general of them was a plodding man who had burst through the bonds of joinerdom and winged his way into the purer and more lucrative atmosphere of architectural constructiveness one of the sacred edifices whose form passed through his alembic was christ church and to this complexion of a building we have now come there is so much and so little to be said about christ church that we neither know where to begin nor how to end nobody has yet said that christ church architecturally is a very nice place and we are not going to say so it is a piece of calm sanctity inbuckram is a stout mass of undiluted lime stone has been made ornate with pepper castors looks sweetlyclean after a summer shower is devoid of a steeple will never be blown over couldnt be lifted in one piece and will nearly stand forever it is as strong as a fortress has walls thick enough for a castle is severely plain but full of weft has no sympathy with elaboration and is a standing protest against masonic gingerbread it rests on the northern side of fishergatehill between bowlane and jordanstreet is surrounded with houses has two entrances with gateposts which might owing to their solidity have descended lineally from the pillars of hercules is entirely out of sight on the eastern side and from the other points of the compass can be seen better a mile off with a magnifying glass than 20 yards off without one there is something venerable and monastic something substantial and coldly powerful about the front but the general building lacks beauty of outline and gracefulness of detail christ church is the only place of worship in preston built of limestone and if it has not the prettiest it has the cleanest exterior there is no matter in its wrong place palmerstons definition of dirt about it if you had to run your hand all round the buildingclimbing the rails at the end to do soyou might get scratched but wouldnt get dirtied the foundation stone of christ church was laid in 1836 and in the following year the place was opened adjoining the church there is a graveyard which is kept in excellent condition some burial grounds are graced with old hats broken pots ancient cans and dead cats but this has no such ornaments it is clean and neat properly levelled nicely green swarded and wellcared for the first person interred in the ground was the wife of the first incumbentthe rev t clark outside and in front of the building there is a large bluefeatured clock with a castiron inside it was fixed in 1857 and there was considerable newspaper discussion at the time as to what it would do time has proved how well it can keep time it is looked after by a gentleman learned in the deep mysteries of horology who wont allow its fingers to get wrong one single second who used to make his own solar calculations in his own observatory on the other side of jordan street who gets his time now from greenwich who has drilled the clock into a groove of action the most perfect and who would have just cause to find fault with the sun if antagonising with its indications he his thoroughly master of the clock and could almost make it stop or go by simply shouting or putting up his finger at it it is a good clock however blue it may look it has gone well constantly and if we may credit the words of one of the clock managers sanguine brethren is likely to do so at the entrance doors there are two curious pieces of wood exactly like spout heads some people say they are for money but we hardly think so for during our visits to the church we have seen no one go too near them with their hands the interior of christ church is plain and rather heavylooking but it is very clean and orderly the chancel of the building is circular tastefully painted with a calm subdued light and looks rich the ceiling of the church is lofty and very woodyis crossed by four or five unpoeticallooking beams which deprive the building of that airiness and capaciousness it would otherwise possess contiguous to the chancel there is a galleried transept a large gallery also runs along the sides and at the front end of the general building the seats below are substantial and high very small people when they sit down in them go right out of sightif you are sitting behind you cant see them at all people less diminutive show their occiput moderately ordinarilysized folk keep their heads and a portion of their shoulders just fairly in sight about 560 people can be accommodated below and 440 in the galleries there are several free sittings in front of the pulpitgood seats for hearing but rather too conspicuous just within each entrance on the ground floor there are more free sittings and all the pews in the galleries except the two bottom rowslet at a low figure are we believe also free altogether there are about 400 seats free and tolerably easy in the building there are many pretty stained glass memorial windows in the church indeed if it were not for these the building would have a very cold and unpleasantly normanised look they tone down its severity of style and cast gently into it a mellowed light akin to that of the dim religious order they are narrow circularheaded and occupy the front the sides the transept and the chancel all the lower windows in the building except two or three are filled in with stained glass the windows were put in by the following parties four by mr edward gorst afterwards lowndes one in memory of his wife and two children another in memory of mr septimus gorst his wife and only child and two in commemoration of the 20 years services of the late rev t clark at the church five by the late mr j bairstowtwo of them being in memory of his sisters miss bairstow and mrs levy two in memory of the late mr j horrocks sen and mrs horrocks his wife by their children one in memory of the late mr john horrocks jun by his widow and two sisters one to the memory of mr lowndes by his son two by the late mrs clark one we believe being in memory of her mother whilst the other does not appear to have any personal reference one by the rev raywood firth the present incumbent in memory of miss buck who remembered him kindly in her will and one by the rev mr firth and his wife which was put up when the rev t clark relinquished the incumbency and gave way for his soninlaw this in memoriam act was done out of affection and not because the incumbency was changing hands the pulpit in the church is tall and somewhat handsome it occupies a central position in front of the chancel and is flanked by two reading desks one being used for prayers and the other for lessons there is no clerk at this church and there were never but two connected with the place one being the late mr stephen wilson of the firm of wilson and lawson and the other the late mr john brewer of the firm of bannister and brewer of this town the responses are now said by the choir and everything appertaining to the serious problems of surplice and gown arranging pulpit door opening and shutting is solved by black rod in waitingthe beadle the first incumbent of christ church was the rev t clarka kindlyexact sincere quietmoving gentleman who did much good in his district visited poor people regularly wasnt afraid of going down on his knees in their houses gave away much of that which parsons and other sinners generally like to keepmoney and was greatly respected we shall always remember himremember him for his quaint virtuous preciseness his humble kindly plodding ways his love of writing with quill pens and spelling words in the old fashioned style his generosity and mild maidenly fidgetiness his veneration for everything evangelical his dislike of having e put after his name and his courteous accomplished affable manners for 27 yearshaving previously been curate at the parish church in this townmr clark was incumbent of christ church he was succeeded by his soninlaw the rev raywood firth who has worked through longfellows excelsior gamut rapidly and successfully the father of mr firth was a wesleyan methedist minister and singular to say was at one timein some yorkshire circuit we believethe superintendent of a gentlemen who is now and has been for some years the incumbent of a preston church a few years ago mr firth visited preston as secretary of a society in connection with the church of england then got married to the daughter of the rev t clark subsequently became curate of that gentlemens church and in 1864 was made its incumbent well done the ascent is good we like the transition mr firth is a minute russetfeatured gentleman is precise in dress neat in taste gets over the ground quietly and quickly has a full clear dark eye has a youthful clerical countenance has given way a little to facial sadness is sharp and serious has a healthy biliary duct and has carried dark hair on his head ever since we knew him is clearsighted shy unless spoken to and cautious is free and generous in expression if trotted out a little is no bigot dislikes fierce judgments and creedreviling likes visiting folk who are well off wouldnt object to tea crumpet and conversation with the better end of his flock any day visits fairly in his district and says many a good word to folk in poverty but would look at a floor before going down upon it like his predecessor thinks that flags and boards should be either very clean or carpeted before good trousers touch them minds his own business is moderately benevolent but doesnt phlebotomise himself too painfully never sets his district on fire with either phrensied lectures or polemical tomahawking takes things easily and respectably believes in his own views rather strongly at times loves putting the sacred kibosh upon things occasionally is well educated can think out his own divinity need never buy sermons has a clear quietworking fairlydeveloped brain is inclined to thoughtfulness and taciturnity might advantageously mix up with the poor of his district a little more neednt care over much for the nods of rich folk or the green tea and toast of antique spinsters might be a little heartier and less reserved is a sincere man believes in what he teaches and is thoroughly evangelical is more enlightened than threefourths of our preston church of england parsons and doesnt brag over his ability his salary is about 400 pounds a year and that is a sum which the generality of people would not object to he is a good reader is clear and energetic but shakes his head a little too much in the pulpit he never gets either fast asleep or hysterical he can preach good original sermonscarefully worked out wellbalanced neatly arranged and he can give birth to some which are rather dull and mediocre his action is easy yet earnesthis style quiet yet dignified his matter often scholarly and never stolen he is not a gatherer and disposer of other mens stuff like some clerical greengrocers what he says is his own and he sticks to it there are two full services morning and evening and prayers in an afternoon on sundays at the church and on a tuesday evening there is another serviceattended only slenderly and patronised principally we are afraid by elderly females whose sands have run down and who couldnt do much harm now if they were very solicitous on the subject the attendance on sundays is pretty large particularly in a morning the adult congregation used to be very select and high in the instepwas a kind of second edition of st georges in three volumes it is still numerous but not so choice still proud but not so well bred still stiff serene loftyminded and elanish but not so wealthy as is formerly was the superior members of the congregation as a rule gravitate downwards have seats on the ground floorit is vulgar to sit in the galleries they are all excellently attired the latest thing may be seen in hair and bonnets and dresses the best of coats and the cleanest of waistcoats are also observable a cold tone of gentleblooded highmiddleclass respectability prevails much special adhesiveness exists amongst them small charmed circles little isolated coteries fond of exclusive devotional dealing and keeping themselves to themselves are rather numerous many good and some very inquisitive and gossipy people attendindividuals who know all your concerns can tell how many glasses you had last week and where you had them at and like to make quiet hints on the subject to others the congregation is substantial in look and possesses many excellent qualities but there is a great amount of what dr johnson would call immiscibility in it nearly every part of it has a very strong notion that it is better than any other part as in the grocers shop pictured by one of our best wits so is it herethe tenpenny nail looks upon the tin tack and calmly snubs it the long sixes eye the farthing dips and say they are poor lights the bigger articles seem cross and potent in the face of the smaller the little look big in the face of the less and the infinitessimal clap their wings when they make a comparison with nothing the congregation at christ church wont mix itself up is fond of distance says in a genteely pious tone keep off cant be approached beyond a certain point isnt sociable wont stand any handshaking except is its own peculiar circles we know a person who has gone for above 20 years to one of our methodist chapels and yet nobody has ever said on either entering or leaving the place how are you the very same thing would have happened if that same person had gone to christ church unless there had been some connection with a special circle in all our churches and chapels there is sadly too much of this rigid isolation this frigid dont know you business clanishness and cleanliness occupy front ranks at christ church and if the scotch tartans were worn in it the theory of distinction would be consummated we would advise mr firth to write northwardbeyond the firth of forth ohfor samples of plaids the congregation on the whole is pretty liberal can subscribe fair sums of money but the collections are not now what they once were the main reason being that there is not the same wealth in the place as there used to be the music at christ church was until lately very good it now seems to be degenerating a little there is a splendid organ in the building it cost about 1000 pounds and with the exception of that at st georges is about the best in the town the late mr j horrocks jun contributed handsomely towards the organ played it gratuitously gave liberally towards the choir expenses and christ church is under a lasting debt of gratitude to him for his excellent services the organ is blown by two small engines driven by water so that its music literally resolves itself into a question of wind and water the tones of the instrument are good and they are very fairly brought out by the present organist the services are well got through and whilst puritanism is on the one hand avoided in them ritualism is on the other distinctly discarded a medium course which is the best is observed in the church and so long as mr firth remains at the place there will be nothing bedizened or foolish in its ceremonies a small memorial place of worship which will operate as a chapel of ease for christ church has been built in birdstreet belonging to christ church there are some good day and sunday schools they are numerously attended and well supervised adults have a room to themselves on a sunday and they go through the processes of instruction patiently benignly and without thrashing at one time there was a school connected with the church in wellfieldroad but when st marks was erected the building and the scholars were transferred to its care viewing everything right round it may be said that christ church is a good substantial building but is rather too plain and weighs too much for its size that its minister is a mildlytoned welleducated devout gentleman with no cant in him with a tender bias to the side of gentility and born to be luckier than threefourths of the sons of wesleyan parsons that its congregation is influential rosecoloured goodlooking numerous thinks that everybody is not composed exactly of the same materials believes that familiarity is a flower which must be cautiously cultivated that its religious and educational operations are extensive and that if all who are influenced by them would only carry out what they are taughtnone of us do this over wellthey would be models from which plaster casts might be taken either for artistic purposes or the edification of heathens generally wesley and moor park methodist chapels these two places of worship must constitute one dose they are in the same circuit are looked after by the same ministers and if we gave a separate description of each we should only be guilty of that unpleasant iteration which shakspere names so forcibly in one of his plays wesley chapel is the older of the two and therefore must be first mentioned it is situated in northroad at the corner of upper walkerstreet and we dare say that those who christened it thought they were doing a very handsome thingcharming the building with a name and graciously currying favour with the wesley family people have a particular liking for whoever or whatever may be called after them and good old john may sometimes look down approvingly upon the place and tell charles that he likes it the chapel which was built in 1838 enjoys the usual society of all pious buildings it has two public houses and a beershop within thirty yards of its entrance and they often seem to be doing a brisker business than it can drive except during portions of the sunday when they are shut up and consequently have not a fair chance of competing with it the chapel is square in form has more brick than stone in its composition and has a pretty respectable front approached by steps and duly guarded by iron railings neither inside nor outside the building is there anything architecturally fine a decent mediocrity generally pervades it the entrances are narrow and there is often a good deal of pushing and patient squeezing at the neck of them but nobody is ever hurt and not much bad temper is manifested when even the collateral pew doors mix themselves up with the crowd and prevent people from getting in or out too suddenly the chapel although simple in style is clean lofty and light a gallery of the horse shoe pattern runs round the greater portion of it thin iron pillars support the gallery and the chancel end which is arched and recessed for orchestral accomodation is flanked by fluted imitation columns there is accomodation in the place for between 800 and 900 persons but it is not often that all the seats are filled the average attendance will be about 800 and nearly every one making up that number belongs to the workingclass section of life amongst the body are many genial goodhearted folkpeople who believe is doing right without telling everybody about it in obliging you without pulling a face over it and there are also individuals in the rank and file of worshippers who are very pecksniffian and dismal cranky windy authoritative who would look sour if eating sugar would call a church meeting if you wore a lively suit of clothes and would tell you that they were entitled to more grace than anybody else and had got more the better washed and more respectably dressed portion of the congregation sit at the back of the central range of seats on the ground floor also along portions of the sides and in front of the gallery towards the front of the central seats there is a confraternity of humble earnestlooking beings including several aged persons who are true types in form manner and dress of unsophisticated methodists here as elsewhere there are very few people in the chapel ten minutes before the train starts those present at that time are mainly middleaged unpretentious and very seriously inclined others of a higher type follow and then comes the rush which lasts for about five minutes worship is conducted in the chapel with considerable quietness you may hear the longdrawn gelatinous sigh the subdued quiet unctuous amen and if the thing gets hot a few lively half innate exclamations are thrown into the proceedings but there is nothing in any of them of a turbulent or riotous character the parsons can draw out none of the worshippers into a very ungovernable frame of mind and we believe none of the people have for some time been very violent in either their verbal expressions or physical contortions they are beginning to take things quietly and to work inwardly during periods of bliss there are about 400 members in connection with wesley chapel and we hope they are nearly half as good as such like people usually profess to be the rule in life is for people to be about onethird as virtuous as they say they are and if they can be got a trifle beyond that point by any legitimate process it is something to be thankful for there is a very fair organ at wesley chapel and the person who plays it does the requisite manipulative business with good ordinary skill the choir is a sort of family compact the members of one household preponderate in it but its arrangements are well worked and the music taking everything into account is pretty fair it is far from being classical but it will do the singing in the galleries and below is full if not very sweet is spirited and generously expressed if not so melodious quite the old style of vocalising prevails in some quarters of the place and it is mainly patronised by old people they swing backwards and forwards gently and they sing get into all kinds of keys experimentally put their hands on the pew sides or fronts beating time with the music as the business proceeds and like singing hymn ends over again there is a school beneath the chapel on weekdays its average attendance is about 115 and on sundays 450 we must now for a moment pass on to moor park chapel this is a new and somewhat genteellooking buildinghas a rather taking outside and is inclined to be smart within it was opened on the 26th of june 1862 a style of architecture closely resembling that of lancasterroad congregational chapel has been followed in its construction there is much circular work in its ornamental details its general arrangements are neat and well finished nothing cold or sulkily puritanical presents itself a degree of even taste and polish has been observed in its make this is a more respectable chapel than its companion at the top of walkerstreet its patrons are supposed to be a somewhat richer class it will accommodate about 900 people but as at wesley chapel so herethere are more sittings than sitters it has been known to hold 1300 on an excursion said a quietminded young man to us when we were at the chapel but we didnt understand the young man couldnt fathom his excursion sentiments and afterwards threw ourselves into the arms of one of the ministers for numeric protection there is a good gallery in the building and the pillars which support it prop up a sort of arched canopy like an oblong umbrella which is too low too near the head and must consequently both confine the air and develope sweating when the place is filled there is a neat pulpit in the chapel and it is ornamented with what seem to be panels of opaque glass we were rather distressed on first seeing them being apprehensive that one of the preachers might some very fine sunday when in a mood more rapturous than usual send the points of his shoes right through them but our mind was eased when an explanation was made to the effect that the glass was ornamental zinc and that the feet of the preachers couldnt get near it behind the pulpit there is a circular niche for the members of the choir who aided and abetted in musical matters by a pretty good harmonium acquit themselves respectably the congregation as hinted is more fashionable than that at wesley chapel it is more select has more pride in it sighs more gently moans less audibly turns up its eyes more delicately hardly ever gets into a religious spree and is inclined to think that piety should be genteel as well as vital the members here number 280 immediately adjoining the chapel there is good school accomodation and the attendance appears to be very creditable on week days the average is two hundred and on sundays it reaches about four hundred at both wesley and moor park chapels there are weeknight services and class meetings the former are rather dull and badly attended and a special effort on the part of both those who talk and those who listen is required to get up the proceedings into a state of pleasant activity the latter are fairly managed and are somewhat like experiences meetings talking singing and praying are done at them there is a constant fluctuation whilst they are going on between bliss and contrition and you are sometimes puzzled to find outtaking the sounds made as a criterionwhether the attendants are preparing to fight or fling themselves into a fit of crying or hug and pet each other the circuit embraces the two chapels named also kirkham freckleton bamber bridge longridge moons mill wrea green and ashton it has now about 795 members and all of them with the exception of 115 as figures previously given show are in preston the circuit so far as members go is slightly decreasing in power but it may recruit its forces by and bye there has been a species of duality in it during the past three years its energies have been a little divided faction has reigned in it there have been too many raynerites and adamites and sadly too few christians in it pious snarling and godly backbiting have been too industriously exercised and one consequence has been weakened power and a declension of progress but the brethren are getting more cheerful much old spleen has subsided and we hope they will all kiss and get kind again soon when this sketch was first printed the rev t a rayner was the superintendent minister the rev j adams being second in command and they worked the different sections alternately mr rayner is an elderly gentleman with a strong osseous frame which is well covered with muscle and adipose matter he has been about 34 years in the ministry and should therefore be either very smart or very dull by this time he has a portly grave reverential look carries with him both spectacles and an eyeglass is slow and coldlykeen in his mental processes thinks that he can speak with authority and that all minor dogs must cease barking when he mounts the oracular tripod he is sincere works well for his years and in his own way does his best he is a man of much experience and has fair intellectual powers but his temperament is very icy and flatulent his humours heavy and watery and a phlegmagog purge would do him good he is a rigid methodical man believes in original rules and ancient prerogatives is a wesleyan of the antique type but is devoid of force and enthusiasm he never sets you on fire with declamation nor melts you with pathos he had rather freeze than burn sinners he thinks the harrier principle of catching a hare is the surest and that travelling on a theological canal is the safest plan in the long run he is more cut out for a country rectory where the main duties are nodding at the squire and stunning the bucolic mind with platitudes than for a large circuit of active methodists he would be more at home at a rural deanery surrounded by rookeries and placid fish ponds than in a town mission environed by smoke and made up of screaming children and thinskinned christians mr rayner has many good properties but short sermon preaching is not one of them some of the descendants of that man who according to drunken barnaby slaughtered his cat on a monday because it killed a mouse on the sunday were in the bait of preaching for three hours at one stretch mr rayner never yet preached that length of time and we hope he never will do but he can like the east wind blow a long while in one direction one sunday evening when we heard him be preached just one hour and at the conclusion intimated that he had been requested to give a short sermon but had drifted into a rather prolix one we should like to know what length he would have run out his rhetoric if be had been requested to give a long discourse by the powers it would have tickled the catastrophe of each listener finelydoctors would have had to be called in a vast amount of physic would have been required and it would never have got paid for in these hard times so that bad debts would have been added to the general calamity we could never see any good in long sermons and nobody else ever could except those giving them neither could we ever see much fun in a parson sayingand now lastly more than once in the 60 minutes discourse to which we have alluded the preacher got into the lastly part of the business five times if that other conclusive phrase and now finally brethrenhad been taken advantage of and similarly worked we might never have got home till morning summarising mr rayner it may be stated that he is calm phlegmatic earnest but too prolix likes to wield the rod of authority and occupy one of the uppermost seats in the synagogue is an industrious minister but adheres to a programme antique and chilling is a real wesleyan in his conceptions but behind the times in spirit and mental brilliance is in a word good grim imperial cold as ice steady and soundly orthodox mr adams the junior minister is quite of a different mould he is sprightly gamey wide awake full of courage with a smack of yankee audacity in his manner and a fair share of conceit in his general make up there is much determination in him much of the lively bantam element about him he has a sharp round face which has not been spoiled by sanctimoniousness he is sanguine combative go ahead and would like a good fight if he got fairly into one he cares little for forms and ceremonies is a good mower wears a billycock which has passed through much tribulation we believe it was once the subject of a church meeting can play cricket pretty well and enjoys the game is frank candid and speaks straight out can say a good thing and knows when he has said it has an aboveboard clear decisive style is not a great scholar and would be puzzled like the generality of parsons if asked how many teeth he had in his head or who was the grandfather of his mothers first uncle knows little of latin and less of greek but understands human nature and that says the clockmaker beats scholarship has been in america which accounts for the nasal ring in his talk is active sanguine free and easy and would enjoy either a ridotto or a fast can utter lively merry things in his sermons and does not object sometimes to recognise the wisdom of shakspere mr adams is a good platform speaker and he can give straight shots as a preacher sometimes his discourses are only commonplace wordy and featherless but in the general run he is much above the average of sermonisers he has good action can put out considerable canvas when very warm smacks the pulpit sides with his hands when particularly earnest and occasionally makes a direct aim at the bible before him and hits it we rather like his style it is free but not coarse spirited but not crazy determined but not bigoted and it is in no way spice with either cant or hallowed humbug mr adams was five years in america and he is now completing the tenth year of his career as a regular wesleyan minister he has a large veneration for his own powers and thinks there are few sons of adam like him in the methodist world still he is a hardworking shrewd clearheaded little man a good preacher with a deal of every day fun and sunshine in his heart and calculated to take a considerably higher post than that which he now occupies presbyterian and free gospel chapels who are the presbyterians we can imagine many curious quietly inquisitive people asking and we can further imagine numbers of the same class coming to various solemn and inaccurate conclusions as to what the belief of the presbyterians is shortly and sweetly we may say that they believe in calvinism and profess to be the last sound link in the chain of olden puritanism they do not believe in knocking down may poles nor in breaking off the finger and nose ends of sacred statues nor in condemning as wicked the eating of mince pies nor in having their hair cropped so that no man can get hold of it like the ancient members of the roundhead family but in spiritual matters they have a distinct regard for the plain unceremonious tenets of ancient puritanismfor the simplicity definitiveness and absolutism of calvinism some persons fond of spiritual christenings and mystic gossip have supposed that the presbyterians who during the past few years have endeavoured to obtain a local habitation and a name in preston were connected with the unitarians others have classed them as a species of independents and many have come to the conclusion that their creed has much scotch blood in ithas some affinity to the up style of theology and has a moderate amount of the holy fair business to it the most ignorant are generally the most critically audacious and men knowing no more about the peculiarities of creeds than of the capillary action of woolly horses are often the first to run the gauntlet of opinionism concerning them the fact of the matter is the preston presbyterians are no more and no less in doctrine than calvinists in discipline and doctrine they are on a par with the members of the free church of scotland but they are not connected with that church and dont want to be unless they can get something worth looking at and taking home historically the presbyterians worshipping in preston dont pretend to date as far back as some religious sects but they do start ancestrally from the first epoch of british presbyterianism their spiritual forefathers had a stern beginning in this country they were cradled in fierce tomes said their prayers often amid the smoke of cannons and the tumult of armies and maintained their vitality through one of the sternest and most revolutionary periods of modern history in the 17th century they were for a few moments paramount in england in 1648 nearly all the parishes in the land were declared to be under their form of church government but the tide of fortune eventually set in against them at the restoration episcopacy superseded their faith and since then they have had to fight up their way through a long a circuitous and an uneven track their creed as before intimated is calvinistic and that is a sufficient definition of it they believe in a sort of universal suffrage so far as the election of their pastors is concerned and if they have grievances on hand they nurse them for a short time then appeal to the presbytery and in case they cant get consolation from that body they go to the synod we could give the history of this sect but in doing so we should have to quote many figures and numerous factsthings which according to one british statesman can never be relied uponand on that account we shall avoid the dilemma into which we might be drifted it will be sufficient for our purpose to state that in 1866 a few persons in preston with a predilection for the ancient form of presbyterianism held a consultation and decided to start a church they had a sprinkling of serious blood in their arteriesa tincture of well balanced modernised puritanism in their veinsand they honestly thought that if any balm had to come out of gilead it would first have to pass through presbyterianism and that if any physician had to appear he would have to be a calvinistic preacher they at first met privately and then engaged the theatre of avenham institutiona place which had previously been the nursery of fishergate baptism and lancasterroad congregationalism from the early part of january 1866 till september 1867 they were regaled with supplies from different parts of the kingdom when they met on the second sundayit would be unfair to criticise the first curtian plunge they made14 persons including the preacher put in an appearance but the number gradually extended courage slowly accumulated and eventuallyin september 1867the rev a bell a gentleman young in years and fresh from the green isle who pleased the preston presbyterians considerably was requested to stop with them and endeavour to make them comfortable mr bell thought out the question briefly got a knowledge of the duties required c and then consented to stay with the brethren and he is still with them hoping that they may multiply and replenish the earth and spread presbyterianism muchly from the period of their denominational birth up to now the preston presbyterians have worshipped in the theatre of the institution avenhama place which everybody knows and which we need not describe there is nothing ecclesiastical about it the place is fit for the operations of either lecturers or preachers or conjurors and it will do for the inculcation of presbyterianism as well as for anything else the leaders of the presbyterian body are looking out for a site upon which a new chapel may be erected but they have not yet found one byandbye we hope they will see a site which will suit their vision will come up to their ideal and in the words of butler be presbyterian true blue the members of the church number at present about 112 and the average congregation will be about 200 it includes scotchmen irish presbyterians people who have turned over from baptism independency catholicism and several other creeds and all of them seem to be theologically satisfied there ought to be elders at the place but the denomination seems too young for them as it progresses and gets older it will get into the elder stage there is no pulpit in the building and the preacher gets on very well is the absence of one if he has no pulpit he has at least this consolation that he can never fall over such a contrivance as the south staffordshire methodist once did when in a fit of fury and nearly killed some of the singers below the congregation consists principally of middle and working class people their demeanour is calm their music moderate and in neither mind nor body do they appear to be much agitated like some people during their moments of devotion the preacher who has been about six years in the ministry and gets 250 pounds a year for his duties here is a darkcomplexioned sharp featured manslender seriouslooking energetic earnest with a sanguinebilious temperament he is a ready and rather eloquent preacher is fervid emphatic determined has moderate action never damages his coat near the armpits by holding his arms too high has a touch of the ould ireland brogue in his talk never loudly blows his own trumpet but sometimes rings his own bell a little means what he says is pretty liberal towards other creeds but is certain that his own views are by far the best is a steady thinker a sincere minister a tolerably good scholar and a warm hearted man who wouldnt torture an enemy if he could avoid it but would struggle hard if put to it like the rest of preachers he has his admirers as well as those who do not think him altogether immaculate but taking him in totomind body and clotheshe is a fervent candid mediumsized respectablelooking man worth listening to as a speaker of the serious school and calculated if regularly heard to distinctly inoculate you with presbyterianism it is as clear as a bell that he is advancing considerably the cause he is connected with and that his church is making satisfactory progress there is a sabbath school attached to the denomination the scholars meet every sunday afternoon in the institution and their average attendance is about 90 as a denomination the presbyterians are pushing onwards vigorously though quietly and their prospects are good to the free gospel people we next come they dont occupy very fashionable quarters ashmoorstreet a long way down adelphi street is the thoroughfare wherein their spiritual refuge is situated if they were in a better locality the probability is they would be denominationally stronger in religion as in everything else respectability is the charm we have heard many a laugh at the expense of these free gospel folk but there is more in their creed although it may have only ashmoorstreet for its blossoming ground than the multitude of people think of they were brought into existence through a dispute with a primitive methodist preacher at saulstreet chapel although previously men holding opinions somewhat similar to theirs were in the town and built but through adverse circumstances had to give up vauxhallroad chapel in the early stages of their existence the free gospellers were called quaker methodists because they dressed somewhat like quakers and had ways of thinking rather like the followers of george fox in some places they are known as christian brethren in other parts they are recognised as a kind of independent ranters about ten years ago the preston free gospel people got mr james toulmin to build a chapel for them in ashmoorstreet they having worshipped up to that time first at a place on snowhill and then in gorststreet he did not give them the chapel never said that he would couldnt afford to be guilty of an act so curious but he erected a place of worship for their pleasure and they have paid him something in the shape of rent for it ever since the chapel is a plain small humblelooking buildinga rather respectably developed cottage with only one apartmentand we should think that those who attend it must be in earnest the place seems to have been arranged to hold 95 personsa rather strange number but upon a pinch and by the aid of a few forms planted near the foot of the pulpit perhaps 120 could be accommodated in it there are just fourteen pews in the chapel and they run up backwards to the end of the building the highest altitude obtained being perhaps four yards a good view can be obtained from the pulpit not only can the preacher eye instantaneously every member of his congregation but he can get serene glimpses through the windows of eight chimney pots five house roofs and portions of two backyards in a season of doubt and difficulty a scene like this must relieve him there are about 30 members of the chapel the average attendance on a sunday including all ranks will be about 50 the worshippers are humble peopleartisans operatives small shopkeepers c a few of the hottest original partisans were the first to leave the chapel after its opening there is a sunday school connected with the body and between 40 and 50 children and youths attend it on the average voluntaryism in its most absolute form is the predominant principle of the denomination the sect is in reality a free community their standard is the bible they believe in both faith and good works but place more reliance upon the latter than the former they recognise a progressive christianity harmonising as we have been told with science and common sense they object to the trinitarian dogma as commonly accepted by the various churches maintaining that both the bible and reason teach the existence of but one god they have no eucharistic sacrament believing that as often as they eat and drink they should be imbued with a spirit of christian remembrance and thankfulness they argue that ministers should not be paid they dispense with pewrents repudiate all money tests of membershipclasspence c make voluntary weekly contributions towards the general expenses each giving according to his means and all have a voice in the regulation of affairs but direct executive work is done by a president and a committee the independent volition of quakerism is one of their prime peculiarities if they have even a teaparty no fixed charge for admission is made the price paid for demolishing the tea and currant bread and crackers being left to the individual ability and feelings of the participants service is held in the chapel morning and evening every sunday and the business of religious edification is very peacefully conducted there is a moderate choir in the chapel and a small harmonium the singing is conducted on the tonic sol fa principle and it seems to suit mr william toulmin brother of the owner of the chapel preaches every sunday and has done so more or less from its opening he gets nothing for the job contributes his share towards the church expenses as well and is satisfied others going to the place might preach if they could but they cant so the lot constantly falls upon jonah who gives homely practical sermons and is well thought of by his hearers he is a quaint cold generous man is original humble honest cares little for appearances wears neither white bands nor morocco shoes looks sad rough and ready and unapproachable works regularly as a shopkeeper on week days and earnestly as a preacher on sundays passes his life away in a mild struggle with eggs bacon butter and theology isnt learned nor classical nor rhetorical but possesses common sense expresses himself so as to be understooda thing which some regular parsons have a difficulty in doing and has laboured sunday after sunday for years all for nothinga thing which no regular parson ever did or ever will do we somewhat respect a man who can preach for years without pocketing a single dime and contribute regularly towards a church which gives him no salary and never intends doing the homilies of the preacher at ashmoorstreet chapel may neither be luminous nor eloquent neither pythonic in utterance nor refined in diction but they are at least worth as much as he gets for them any man able to sermonise better or rhapsodise more cheaply or beat the bush of divinity more energetically can occupy the pulpit tomorrow it is open to all england and possession of it can be obtained without a struggle who bids st jamess church there is a touch of smooth piety and elegance in the name of st james it sounds refined serious precise two of the quietest and most devoted pioneers of christianity were christened james the most fashionable quarters in london are st jamess the spaniards have for ages recognised st james as their patron saint and on the whole whether referring to the elder or the less james the name has a very good and jamesly bearing an old english poet says that saint james gives oysters just as st swithin attends to the rain but we are afraid that in these days he doesnt look very minutely after the bivalve part of creation if he does he is determined to charge us enough for ingurgitation and that isnt a very saintly thing he may be an ichthyofagic benefactors onlywe dont see the oysters as often as we could like not many churches are called after st james and very few people swear by him we have a church in preston dedicated to the saint but it got the name whilst it was a kind of chapel st jamess church is situated between knowsley and berrystreets and directly faces the national school in avenhamlane who erected the building said we one day to a churchman and the curt reply with a neatly curled lip was a parcel of dissenters very few people seem to have a really correct knowledge of the history of the place and for the satisfaction of all and the singular we will give an account of it in the exact words of the gentleman who had most to do with the building originally mr james fielding deposeth st jamess was erected by the rev james fielding and his friends the occasion of its erection was this vauxhallroad chapel in which mr fielding had been preaching four or five years had become too small for the accomodation of the congregation worshipping there and it was thought advisable to open a subscription for a new and larger building the first stone of st jamess was laid by mr fielding may 24th 1837 and the place was opened for divine worship in january 1838 under the denomination of the primitive episcopal church that beats the reformed churcheh by the rev j r matthews of bedford who was a clergyman of the established church the building was computed to seat about 1300 people the cost of the place was about 1500 pounds after the opening mr fielding commenced his ministry in the new churchthe congregation removing from vauxhall chapel into that place of worship not long afterwards mr fielding had a severe attack of illness and was laid aside from his work from this together with the urgency of the contractors for the payment of their bills it was thought advisable to sell the premises the late vicar of preston rev carus wilson in conjunction with his friends offered 1000 pounds for the building this was believed to be considerably under its real value being 500 pounds below the cost amount however under the circumstances it was decided to accept the offer the transfer of the premises took place in april 1838 mr fielding continued his ministry in preston in several other places for thirteen years after the erection of st jamess the late john addison esq of this town says in a document written by himself which we have before us and which is entitled some account of st jamess church in the parish of prestona body of dissenters having erected a large building capable of holding 1100 persons and having opened it for public worship under the name of st jamess church but being unable to pay the expenses offered it for sale the building being situated directly opposite the central national school and in the immediate neighbourhood of the infant school and church sunday schools a few of the committee of the national school thought it desirable that the building should be purchased and made into a church for the accomodation of the children of the schools and of the neighbourhood and the result was the purchase of the rev james fieldings primitive episcopal church the building is made mainly of brick and looks very like a dissenting place of worship it is a tame moderately tall quadrangular edifice flanked with stone buttresses heavy enough to crush in its sides fronted with a plain gable pierced with a few prosaic windows and surmounted with collateral turrets and a small bell fit for a schoolhouse and calculated to swivel whilst being worked quite as much as any other piece of sacred bellmetal in the hundred of amounderness there is a small graveyard in front of the church containing a few flat tombstones and six young trees which have rather a struggling time of it in windy weather the ground spaces at the sides of the church are decorated with ivy thistles chickweed and a few venerable docks the internal architecture of the building is as dull and modest as that of the exterior the seats are stiff between 30 and 40 inches high and homely just at present they have a scraped careworn look as if they had been getting parish relief but in time when cash is more plentiful their appearance will be improved a considerable sum of money was once spent upon the cleaning and renovation of the church but the paint which was put on during the work never suited it was either brushed on too thickly or varnished too coarsely it persisted in sticking to people rather too keenly at times would hardly give way if struggled with and taking into account its tenacity and ill looksit was finally decided to rub it off make things easy with pumice stone and agitate for fresh paint and varnish when the opportunity presented itself there is a large gallery in the church but like everything else it is plain the only striking ornament in the building is a sixteenspoked circular window at the chancel end and until made to turn round it will never be popularly attractive in 1846 the chancel which isnt anything very prepossessing was added to the church the pulpit is high and rather elegant in design the reading desk is a gothicised fabric and with its open sides reminds one more of a genteel open gangway on which everything can be seen than of a snug high box like those in which oldfashioned clerks used to sup gin and go to sleep during the intervals until recently there were two wooden gas stands at the sides of the reading desk they looked like candlesticks and shortsighted people with thin theological cuticles and a horror of puseyism disliked them eventually the wood was gilded and seeing this as well as knowing that candles were never gilded and that therefore the stands couldnt be candles the dissatisfied ones were appeased there are about 400 free sittings in the church but few people appear to care much for them these seats are situated on each side of the building at the rear and in the gallery and they will be dying of inanition by and bye if somebody doesnt come to the rescue people dont seem to care about having a thing for nothing in the region of st jamess church they would probably flock in greater numbers to the edifice if there were an abundance of those oysters which it is said saint james gives but they appear to have a sacred dread of free seats very recently we were at the church and on the side we noticed seventeen free pews how many people do you think there were in them just one delicious old woman who wore a brightlycoloured old shawl and a finelyspreading old bonnet which in its weight and amplitude of trimmings seemed to frown into evanescence the sprightly halfounce head gearing of today paying for what they get and giving a good price for it when they have a chance is evidently an axiom with the believers in st jamess there is at present a demand for seats worth from 7s to 10s each but those which can be obtained for 1s are not much thought of and nobody will look on one side at the pews which are offered for nothing that which is not charged for is never cared for and further in respect to free pews patronage of them is an indication of poverty and people as a rule dont like to show the white feather in that department the congregation is thin but selectis constituted of substantial burgeois people and a few individuals who are comparatively wealthy there is a smart elegance about the bonnets and toilettes of some of the females and a studied precision in respect to the linen vests and gloves of several of the males nothing gloomy nor acetose nor piouslyangular can be observed in them nothing preeminently lustrous is seen in the halo of the respective worshippers yet there is a finish about them which indicates that they have no connection with the canaille and that they are in some instances approaching and in others directly associated with the higher middle class there are only two services a weekmorning and evening on a sundayat st jamess formerly there were more one on a sunday afternoon and another on a thursday evening but as the former was only attended by about 30 and the latter by eight or ten and as the fund for maintaining a curate who had the management of them was withdrawn it was decided some time ago to drop the services the sunday congregation although it does not on many occasions half fill the church is gradually increasing and it is hoped that during the next twentyyears it will swell into pretty large proportions the choral performances form the main item of attraction in the services without them the business would be tame and flavourless they give a warmth and charm to the proceedings the members of the choir sit in collateral rows in the chancel they are all surpliced all very virtuous and clerical in look seldom put their hands into their pockets whilst singing and whatever quantity of linen may be got out by them they invariably endeavour to obviate violence of expression their appearance reminds one of cathedral choristers in precision and harmony they are good and as a body they manage all their workresponses psalmsinging cin a very satisfactory style for their services they receive nothing except perhaps an annual treat in the shape of a country trip or social supper they wouldnt have money if it were offered to them st jamess is the only preston church in which surpliced choristers sing and we believe they have tended materially to increase the congregation the choral system now followed at st jamess was inaugurated in 1865 originally the choir consisted of 12 boys and 10 men but if anything parties who are under the painful necessity of shaving now preponderate in one corner at the chancel end there is a moderately wellmade organ but it is not an a1 affair although it is played with ability by a gentleman who is perhaps second to none hereabouts in his knowledge of ecclesiastical music like the singers the organist resolves his services into what may be termed a labour of love in other ways much may be fish which cometh to his net but he is organically of a philanthropic turn of mind the necessary expenses of the choir amount to about 25 pounds ayear and they are met by private subscriptions from the congregation the lessons are read in the church by mr gardner who comes up to the lectern undismayed with a calm military cast of countenance and goes through his articulative duties in a clear distinct style saying nothing to anybody near him which is not contained in the book before him and making neither incidental comment nor studied criticism upon any of the verses be reads the rev john wilson soninlaw of the present vicar of preston is the incumbent of st jamess he is the seventh minister who has been at the place since its transference from the primitive episcopalians the first of the seven was the rev w harrison the next was the rev p w copeman afterwards came the rev w wailing who was succeeded by the rev mr betts whose mantle fell upon the rev j cousins then came the rev a t armstrong and he was followed by the present incumbent during the reign of mr cousins there was a rupture at the place and many combative letters were written with reference to it up to and for some time after his appointment the sunday schools of the parish and st jamess churches were amalgamatedwere considered as one lot but through some misunderstanding a separation ensued mr cousins who had no locus standi as to the possession of the schools took with him some scholars drilled them after his own fashion for a time and eventually the present day and sunday schools in knowsleystreet were built and opened on behalf of st jamess the day school is at present in excellent condition and has an average attendance boys and girls included of 400 the sunday school has an average attendance of something like 200 the generality of the children being of a respectable welldressed character although no more disposed at times than other juveniles to be docile and peaceful the rev j wilson has been at st jamess upwards of 15 years he was curate of the parish church from 1847 to 1850 in the latter year he left in order to take the sole charge of a parish in norfolk in 1854 he gravitated to preston again and in the course of a year was made incumbent of st jamess for some time he had much to contend with in the district and he has had uphill work all along he was one of the original agitators for an alteration of the parish church and in one sense it may be said that the move he primarily made in the matter eventuated in the restoration of that building the creation of st saviours church is also largely due to him and owing to the building being in st jamess district which is a blandsford parish and the only one of the kind in preston we may remark he has the right of presentation to it mr wilson is a calm middlesized rather eccentric looking gentleman tasteful in big hirsute arrangements and biased towards a small curl in the front of his forehead he is light on his feet has a forward bend in his walk as if trying to find something but never able to get at it has a passion for an umbrella which he carries both in fine and wet weather likes a dark thin closelybuttoned overcoat and used to love a downeaster wideawake hat he is a frank independent educated man has no sham in him is liberal is far as his means will allow works hard has an odd goahead way with him cares little about bowing and scraping to people often passes folk unintentionally without nodding and has nothing of a polemically virulent character in his disposition there is something genuine honest gentlemanly and unreadable in him he almost reminds one of elias inexplicable cousin he has a special fondness for architecture plans specifications c have a charm for him he is a sort of clerical inigo jones and ought to have been an architect he is a rather polished reader but he holds his teeth too tightly together and there is a tremulousness in his voice which makes the utterances thereof rather too unctuous as a preacher he is clear calm and methodical his sermons all written are scholarly in style cool in tone short and in the orthodox sense practical in their delivery he does not make much stir he goes on evenly and rapidly looking little to either the right hand or the left broiling none and foaming never occasionally but it is quite an exception he forgets his sermons leaves them at homeand this is somewhat awkward when the mistake is only found out just before the preaching should be gone on with but the company are kept serene by a little extra singing or something of that kind and in the meantime a rapid rush is made to the parsonage and the missing manuscript is secured conveyed to the church either in a basket or a pocket taken into the pulpit looked at rather fiercely shook a little and then read through how would it be if the manuscript could not be found long official life appears to be the rule at st jamess mr wm relph who died last year was a churchwarden at the place for 21 years mr bannister has been in office as churchwarden for nearly as long the person who was beadle up to last year had officiated in that capacity for nearly eleven years the organist has been at the church above 15 years the mistress of the school belonging the church has been at her post about as long and the schoolmaster has been in office 13 or 14 years if long service speaks well for a place the facts we have given are creditable alike to the church and the officials mr wilson who gets about 300 pounds a year is wellrespected by all he manages to keep down unpleasant feuds regulates the district peacefully if slowly deserves a handsomer church and would be quite willing we believe to be its architect if one were ordered the mormons there are about 1100 different religious creeds in the world and amongst them all there is not one more energetic more mysterious or more witshaken than mormonism it is a mass of earnest abysmal nonsense an ollapodrida of theological whimsicalities a saintly jumble of pious staff made upif we may borrow an ideaof hebraism persian dualism brahminism buddhistic apotheosis heterodox and orthodox christianity mohammedanism drusism freemasonry methodism swedenborgianism mesmerism and spirit rapping we might go on in our elucidation but what we have said will probably be sufficient for present purposes there are some deepswimming fish in the waters of mormon but the piscatorial shoal is sincere enough though mortally oddbrained and dreamy on the 22nd of september 1827 a roughspun american named joseph smith belonging to a family reputed to be fond of laziness drink and untruthfulness and suspected of being somewhat disposed to sheepstealing had a visit from the angel of the lord he had previously been told that his sins were forgiven that he was a chosen instrument c and on the day named joseph found somewhere in ontario a number of gold plates eight inches long and seven wide nearly as thick as tin fastened together by three rings and bearing inscriptions in reformed egyptian relative to the history of america from its first settlement by a colony that came from the tower of babel at the confusion of tongues to the beginning of the 5th century of the christian era these inscriptions were originally got up by a prophet named mormon were as before stated found by joseph smith were read off by him to a man rejoicing in the name of oliver cowdery and they constitute the contents of what is now known as the book of mormon smith did not translate the reformed egyptian openlyif he had been asked to do so he would have said not for joe he got behind a blanket in order to do the job considering that the plates would be defiled if seen by profane eyes and deciphered them by two odd lapidistic transparencies called urim and thummin which he found at the same time as he met with the records report hath it that joes translation of the sacred plates is substantially a paraphrase of a romance written by one solomon spalding but the mormons or rather the members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints deny this and say that at least eleven persons saw the original plates after transcription they may have seen them but nobody else has and heaven only knows where they are now did you ever gentle reader see the book of mormon we have one before us purchased from a real live salt lake missionary but it is so dreadfully dry and intricate and seems to be such a dodgedup paraphrase of our own scriptures that we are afraid it will never do us any good it professes to be a record of the people of nephi and also of the lumanites their brethren and also of the people of jared who came from the tower the mormons think it equal in divine authority to and a positive corollary of the old and new testaments it consists of several books and many chapters the books being those of nephi jacob enos jarom mosiah alma helaman nephi mormon ether and moroni the language is quaint and simple in syllabic construction but the book altogether is a mass of dreamy puzzling historyis either a sacred fiction plagiarised or a useless and senile jumble of christian and red indian tradition smith the founder of mormonism had only a rough time of it his church was first organised in 1830 in the state of new york afterwards the mormons went into ohio then established themselves in missouri were next driven into clay county subsequently look refuge in illinois and finally planted themselves in the valley of the great salt lake where they may now be found smith came to grief in 1844 by a pistol shot administered to him in illinois by a number of roughs and brigham young a man said to be very much married and who will now be the father of perhaps 150 children was appointed his successor mormonism is disliked by the bulk of people mainly on account of its fondness for wives the generality of civilised folk think that one fairly matured creature with a ring on one of her lefthand fingers is sufficient for a single householdquite sufficient for all the fair purposes of existence lecturing included but the latterday saints who were originally monogamists and whose book of mormon condemns polygamy believe in a plurality of housekeepers they contend that since the finding of the sacred record by smith there has been a divine revelation on the subject and that their dignity in heaven will be in proportion to the number of their wives and children in this leaving the polygamic part of the business we may observe that the mormons believe that god was once a man but is now perfect that any man may rise into a species of deity if he is good enough that mortals will not be punished for what adam did but for what they have done themselves that there can be no salvation without repentance faith and baptism that the sacramentbread and water must be taken every week that ministerial action must be preceded by inspiration that miraculous gifts have not ceased that the soul of man coexisted equal with god that the word of god is recorded in all good books that there will be an actual gathering of israel including the red indians whom they regard with much interest as being the descendants of an ancient tribe whose skins were coloured on account of disobedience in some part of america about 2400 years ago that the new zion will be established in america and that there will be a final resurrection of the flesh and boneswithout the bloodof men some of their moral articles of belief are good and if carried out ought to make the salt lake valley a decent peaceable place notwithstanding all the wives therein in one of the said articles they express their belief in being honest true chaste temperate benevolent virtuous and upright and further on they come down with a crash upon idle and lazy persons by saying that they can be neither christians nor enjoy salvation in 1837 certain elders of the mormon church including orson hyde and heber c kimball were sent over to england as missionaries the first town they commenced operations in after their arrival was preston and the first shot they fired in preston was from the pulpit of a building in vauxhallroad now occupied by the particular baptists things got hot in a few minutes here it became speedily known that hyde kimball and co were of a sect fond of a multiplicity of wives and the missionaries had to forthwith look out for fresh quarters they secured the old cock pit drove a great business in it and at length actually got about 500 members whilst this movement was going on in the town the missionaries were pushing mormonism in some of the surrounding country places at longton nearly everybody went into raptures over the new doctrine mormonism fairly took the place by storm it caught up and entranced old and young married and single pious and godless it even spread like a sacred rinderpest amongst the wesleyans who at that time were very strong in longtoncaptivating leaders members and some of the scholars in fine style and the chapel of this body was so emptied by the mormon crusade that it was found expedient to reduce it internally and set apart some of it for school purposes to this day the village has not entirely recovered the shock which mormonism gave it 30 years ago during the heat of the conflict many longtonians went to the region of mormondom in america and several of them soon wished they were back again in preston too whilst the cock pit fever was raging numbers went out after the work of conversion c had been carried on for a period in the sacred pit mentioned the mormons migrated to a building which had been used as a joiners shop in parkroad subsequently they took for their tabernacle an old sizing house in friargate then they went to a building in lawsonstreet now used as the weavers institute and originally occupied by the ranters and at a later date they made another movetransferred themselves to a room in the temperance hotel limestreet which they continue to occupy and in which every sunday morning and evening they ideally drink of mormondoms saltwater and clap their hands gleefully over joe smiths impending millenium there are only about 70 members of the mormon church in preston and the immediate neighbourhood at present but they are all hopeful and fancy that beatification is in store for them we had recently a halfsolemn halfcomic desire to see the very latest development of preston mormonism in its lunestreet home but having an idea that strangers might be objected to whilst the holding forth was going on that in fact the members had resolved themselves through diminished numbers into a species of secret conclave we were rather puzzled to know how the business of seeing and hearing could be accomplished nevertheless we went to the temperance hotel and after some conversation with a person therenot a mormonwe decided to go right into the meetingroom the idea being that under any circumstances we could only be pitched into and then pitched out and with this notion we entered the place put our hat upon a table deliberately took a seat upon a form quietly and then looked round coolly in anticipation of a round of sauce or a trifle of fighting but peace was preserved there were just six living beings in the roomthree welldressed moustached young men a thinlyfiercelooking woman a very redheaded youth and a quiet little girl for about 30 seconds absolute silence prevailed the thin woman then looked forward at the redhaired youth and in a clear voice said bin round there yeteh which elicited the answer yea and comed whoam things are flat there as well as here arent theyeh and the redhaired youth said yea factories arnt doing much now are they said she next and the rejoinder was they arnt bin round by bowton and its aw alike this slightly refreshing prelude was supplemented by sapient remarks as to the weather c and we were beginning to wonder whether the general service was simply going to amount to this kind of conversation or be pushed on properly when in stepped a strong built darkcomplexioned man who marched forward with the dignity of an elder until he got to a small table surmounted by a desk whence he drew a brown paper parcel which he handed to one of the moustached young men who undid it cautiously and carefully what is it going to be said we mentally when lo there appeared a white table cloth which was duly spread the strong built man then dived deeply into one of his coat pockets and fetched out of it a small paper parcel flung it upon a form close by seized a soup plate into which he crumbled a slice of bread then got a double handled pewter pot into which he poured some water and afterwards sat down as generalissimo of the business the individual who manipulated with the table cloth afterwards made a prayer universal in several of its sentiments but stiffened up tightly with mormon notions towards the close two elderly men and a lad entered the room when the orison was finished and a discussion followed between the general and the young man who had been praying as to some hymn they should sing cant find the first hymn said the young man and we thought that a pretty smart thing for a beginning oh never mindgo farther onanylong meter uttered his interlocutor and he forthwith made a sanguine dash into the centre of the book and gave out a hymn the company got into a peculiar metre tune at once and the singing was about the most comically wretched we ever heard the lad who came in with the elderly men tried every range of voice in every verse and thought that he had a right to do just as he liked with the music the elderly men near him hammed out something in a weak and timeworn key the woman got into a high strain and flourished considerably at the line ends the little girl said nothing the three young men seemed quite unable to get above a monotonous groan and the general looked forward then down and then smiled a little but uttered never a word and seemed immensely relieved when the singing was over the bread which had been broken into the soup plate was next handed round and it was succeeded by the pewter pot measure of water this was the sacrament and it was partaken of by allthe young as well as the old during the enactment of this part of the programme a gailydressed young female sporting a paisley shawl earrings a chignon a small bonnet and the other accoutrements of modern fashion dropped in and also took the sacrament another hymn was here given out and the young woman with the paisley shawl c rushed straight into the work of singing without a moments warning she carried the others with her and enabled them to get through the verses easily just when the singing was ended a rubicundfeatured and bosky female who had perhaps seen fiveandforty summers landed in the room took a seat and then took the sacrament she was the last of the mohicans and after her appearance the door was closed and the latch dropped speaking succeeded and the talkers got upon their feet in accordance with certain nods and memoes from the chairman they all eulogised in a joyous strain the glories of mormonism but never a syllable was expressed about wives a young moustached man led the way he told the meeting that he had long been of a religious turn of mind that he was a wesleyan until 17 years of age that afterwards he found peace in the smithsonian church that the only true creed was that of mormonism that it didnt matter what people said in condemnation of such creed and that he should always stick to it the thin woman who seemed to have an awful tongue in her head was the second speaker she panegyrised the church in a phrensied fiercetempered piping strain talked rapidly about the new dispensation declared that she had accepted it voluntarily hadnt been deceived by any onewe hope she never will beand that she was happy her conclusion was sudden and she appeared to break off just before reaching an agonypoint the third talker was one of the old men and he commenced with things from before the foundations of the world and brought them down to the present day his speech was earnest florid and rather argumentative in tone after stating that he had a pious spell upon him before visiting the room and that the afflatus was still upon him he entered into a labyrinthal defence of the church mormonism he said is more purer than any other doctrine that is and this here faith he continued has to go on and win he talked mystically about things being resurrectioned contended that the solomon spalding theory had been exploded and quoting one of the elders said that mormonism began in a hamlet and got to a village from a village to a town thence to a city thence to a territory and that if it got just another kick it would as sure as fate be kicked into a great and mighty nation this old man eloquent seemed over head and ears in mormonism and almost shook with joy at certain points of his discourse the fourth and the last speaker was the chairman he raised his brawny frame slowly held a bible in one hand and started in this fashionwell i spose ive to say something but i cant tell what itll be this declaration was followed up by a long wandering mass of talk full of repetition and hypothetical theologya mixture of judaism christianity and mormonism and from the whole he endeavoured to distil this fact that both isaiah and st john had made certain prophetic statements as to the book of mormon and its transcription by joe smith it did not however appear from what he said that either isaiah or the seer of patmos had named anything about the blanket trick which had to be adopted by joe is translating the book but that was perhaps unnecessary and we shall not throw a wet blanket upon the matter by further alluding to it when the chairman had done his speech the doxology was sung and this was supplemented by benediction pronounced by a young man who shut his eyes stretched his hands a quarter of a yard out of his coat sleeves and in a most inspired and bishoply style delivered the requisite blessing handshaking in which we found it necessary to join supervened and then there was a general disappearance the whole of the speakers at this meetingwhich may be taken as a fair sample of the gatheringswere illiterate people individuals with much zeal and little education and the manner in which they crucified sentences and maltreated the general principles of logic and commonsense was really disheartening they are very earnest folk we also believe they are honest but after all they are gone coons beyond the reach of both physic and argument we knew none of the mormons who attended the meeting described and singular to say the proprietor of the establishment wherein they assembled had no knowledge of either their names or places of abode they pay him his rent regularly and he deems that enough all that we really know of the sect is that their chairman is either a mechanic or a blacksmith somewhere is plain muscular solemn looking bassvoiced and dreamy and that his flock are a small earnest and preciouslyfashioned parcel of sincere yet deluded enthusiasts st walburges catholic church this is a church in charge of the jesuits and by them and it we are reminded of what may fairly be termed the great leg question the order of jesuits as we lately remarked was originated by a damaged leg and st walburges church preston owes its existence to the cure of one excellent o legs tradition hath it that once upon a timeabout 1160 years agoa certain west saxon king had a daughter born unto him whose name was walburge that she went into germany with two of her brothers became abbess of a convent there did marvellous things was a wonder in her way couldnt be bitten by dogsthey used to snatch half a yard off and then run that she died on the 25th february 778 that her relics were transferred on the 12th october following to eichstadt at which place a convent was built to her memory that the said relics were put into a bronze shrine which was placed upon a table of marble in the convent chapel that every year since then between the 12th of october and the 25th of february the marble upon which the shrine is placed has perspired a liquid which is collected below in a vase of silver and that this liquid which is called st walburges oil will cure by its application all manner of physical ailments this is the end of our first lesson concerning st walburge and the wonderful oil the second lesson runneth thus about five and twenty years ago there lived as housemaid at st wilfrids presbytery in this town one alice holderness she was a comely woman and pious but she fell one day on some steps leading to the presbytery hurt one of her legsbroke the knee cap of it we believeand had to be carried straight to bed medical aid was obtained but the injured knee was obstinate wouldnt be mended and when physic and hope alike had been abandoned so far as the leg of alice was concerned the rev father norris who in conjunction with the rev father weston was at that time stationed at st wilfrids was struck with a somewhat bright thought as to the potency of st walburges oil a little of that oil was procured and this is what a sister of the injured woman says in a letter which we have seen on the subject vizthat father norris dipped a pen into the oil and dropped a morsel of it upon her knee whereupon the bones immediately snapped together and she was perfectly cured having no longer the slightest weakness in the broken limb this is a strange tale which people can either believe or disbelieve at their own pleasure all protestantsourselves includedwill necessarily be dubious and if any polemical lecturer should happen to see the story he will go wild with delight and consider that there is material enough in it for at least six good declamatory and paying discourses well whether correct or false the priests at st wilfrids believed in the miraculous cure and decided forthwith to agitate for a church in honour of st walburge that church is the one we now see on maudlandsa vast and magnificent pile larger in its proportions than any other preston place of worship and with a spire which can only be equalled for altitude by two others in the whole country what a potent architectural charm was secreted in that mystic oil with which father norris touched the knee of alice in the walpurgis dance of globule and oblate spheroid there may be something wonderful but through this drop of oil from the walpurgian shrine an obstreperous knee snapped up into compact health instantly and then a large church ornamental to preston and creditable to the entire catholic population arose there used to be a hospital dedicated to mary magdalen either actually upon or very near the site occupied by st walburges church but that building disappeared long ago and no one can tell the exact character of it prior to and until the completion of the erection of st walburges church schools intended for it and built mainly at the expense of the late mr w talbot were raised on some adjoining land service in accordance with the catholic ritual was held therein until the completion of the church father weston was the leading spirit in the construction of st walburges and to himalthough well assisted by father williamsmay be attributed the main honour of its development into reality father cobb of st wilfrids laid the foundation stone of st walburges church on whitmonday 1850 and on the 3rd of august 1854 the building was opened the ceremony being of a very grand and imposing description the spire of the church was not completed until 1887 the entire cost of the place has been about 15000 pounds st walburges is built in the early decorated gothic style of architecture and it is beyond all controversy a splendid looking building at the eastern end there is a remarkably fine sevenlight stained glass window this is flanked by a couple of twolight windows and the general effect is most imposing the central window is 35 feet high at the western end there is a beautifullycoloured circular window 22 feet in diameter which was given by miss roper and beneath it there are small coloured lights put in by father weston out of money left him by miss green nearly all the side windows in the church are coloured and four of them are of the presentation stamp the most prominent thing about the church is the spire which as well as the tower is built of limestone and surmounted by a cross the distance from its apex to the ground being about 301 feet we saw the weather vane fixed upon this spire and how the man who did the job managed to keep his head from spinning right round and then right off was at the time an exciting mystery to us which we have not yet been able to properly solve a little before the actual completion of the spire we had a chance of ascending it but we remained below the man in charge wanted halfacrown for the trip and as we fancied that something like 5 pounds ought to be given to us for undertaking a journey so perilous it was mutually decided that we should keep down why it would be a sort of agony to ascend the spire under the most favourable circumstances and as one might only tumble down if ascension were achieved the safest plan is to keep down altogether we have often philosophised on the question of punishment and locally speaking we have come to this conclusion that agony would be sufficiently piled in any case of crime if the delinquent were just hoisted to the top of st walburges spire and left there from the summit of the tower which is quite as high as safesided human beings need desire to get there is a magnificent view preston lurches beneath like a hazy amphitheatre of houses and chimneys to the east you have pendle longridge and the dark hills of bowland northwards in the far distance the undulating lake hills westward the fertile fylde flanked by the ribble winding its way like a silver thread to the ocean and southwards rivington pyke and hoghtons wooded summit with a dim valley to the left thereof in which blackburn works and dreams out its vigorous existence the general scenery from the tower is panoramic and charming the view from the spire head must be immense and exquisite but few people of this generation unless a very safe plan of ascension is found out will be able to enjoy it in the tower there is a large bell weighing 31 cwt and it can make a very considerable sound drowning all the smaller ringing arrangements in the neighbourhood some time but not yet there will probably be a peal of twelve bells in the tower for it has accomodation for that number internally the church is very high and spacious is decorated artistically in many places and a sense of mingled solemnity and immensity comes over you on entering it the roof is a tremendous affair it is open and supported by eleven huge gothicfashioned principals each of which cost 100 pounds and it is panelled above with stained timber but we dont care very much for the roof no doubt it is fine but the whole of the wood work seems too heavy and much too dark there is a cimmerian massiveness about it and on a dull day it looks quite bewildering if it were stained in a lighter colour its proportions would come out better and much of that gigantic gloom which now shadows it would be removed there are canopied stands for two and twenty statues towards the base of the principals but the whole of them except about five are empty saints c will be looked after for these stands when money is more abundant and when more essential work has been executed what seems to be proximately wanted in the church is a good sanctuary something in keeping with the general design of the building and really worthy of the place it is intended we believe to have a magnificent sanctuary but a proper design for one cant be exactly hit on when it is the past liberality of the congregation is a sufficient guarantee that the needful articlemoneywill be soon forthcoming notwithstanding the greatness of the church it will not seat as many as some smaller places of worship this is accounted for through its having no galleries there is a small elevation in the shape of a gallery at the western end which is seldom used but the sides of the church are open the windows running along them rendering this necessary the church will comfortably seat about 1000 persons 1700 have been seen in it but there had to be much crushing and all the aisles c had to be filled with standing people to admit such a number the seats are all well made and all open on a sunday masses are said at eight nine ten and eleven and there is an afternoon service at three the aggregate average attendance on a sunday is about 3000 there are three confessionals in the church towards the southeasterncorner they stand out like small square boxes and although made for everybody seem specially adapted for thin and cassiuslike people falstaffs theory was more flesh more frailty if this be so then there are either very few great sinners at st walburges or the large ones confess somewhere else the worshippers at this church are in nine cases out of ten working people the better class of people sit at the higher end of the central benches and if one had never seen them there no difficulty would be experienced in finding out their seats you may always ascertain the character of worshippers by what they sit upon workingclass people rest upon bare boards middleclass individuals develop the cushion scheme to a moderate pitch the upper species push it towards consummationlike ease and therefore are the owners of good cushions very few cushions can be seen in st walburges those noticeable are at the higher end and the logical inference therefore is that not many superb people attend the place and that those who do go sit just in the quarter mentioned at the doors of this church as at those of other catholic places of worship in the town you may see men standing with boxes asking for alms these are brothers of the society of st vincent de paul the object of this society is to visit and relieve the sick and the poor the brothers are excellent auxiliaries of the clergy and further do the work of the mendicity societies like those now being established in london by examing applications for relief and so disappointing impostors the conference of st vincent attached to st walburges church numbers 16 active members who collected and distributed in food and clothing during last year 112 pounds the brothers are deserving of all praise for spending their evenings in visiting the sick and distressed in courts and alleys after their days work the singers at this church occupy a small balcony on the south side they are a pretty musical bodygot through their business ever so creditably but they are rather short of that which most choirs are deficient intenor power they would be heard far better if placed at the western end but a good deal of expense would have to be incurred in making orchestral arrangements for them there so that for some time at least they will have to be content with their grated and curtained musical hoist on the southern side singing right out as hard as they can at the pulpit which exactly faces them and at the preacher if they like when he gets into it the organ which is placed above the singers and would crush them into irrecoverable atoms if it fell is a fine instrument but it is pushed too far into the wall into the tower which backs it and if there are any holes above much of its music must necessarily escape up the steeple the organ is played with taste and precision the members of the choir sing gratuitously since the opening of st walburges there have been twelve different priests at it three are in charge of it now father weston was the first priest and as already stated was the mainspring of the church he died on the 14th of november 1867 and to his memory a stained glass window will by and bye be fixed in the church this window is in preston now we have seen itit is a most beautiful piece of workmanship and as soon as the requisite money is resubscribed the original contributions having through unfortunate financial circumstances been more than half sacrificed it will be fixed father henry late rector of stonyhurst college was for some time at st walburges and during his stay the work begun by father weston and pushed on considerably by successive priests was elaborated and finished the three priests now at st walburges are fathers j johnson principal payne and papall father johnson who has been at the church about fourteen months is a spare longheaded warmhearted unostentatious man he is between 50 and 60 years of age has a practical weatherbeaten shrewd look would be bad to take in has much latent force is a kindly fatherly preacher is dry in humour till drawn out and then can be very genial is a sharp man mentally and executively has been provincial of the jesuits and rector of stonyhurst college knows whats what and knows that he knows it is determined but can be melted down seems cold and sly but has a kind spirit and an honest tongue in his bead and is the right man for his position father payne has been at st walburges about four years he has passed 40 summers in single blessedness and says he intends to last it out his preaching is serious and earnest in style his eloquence may not be so captivating as that of some men but it comes up freely and involves utterances of import father payne has not much action but he has a good voice he lifts his arms slowly and regularly leans forward somewhat occasionally seizes both his hands and shakes them a little but beyond this there is not much motion observable in him he has a keen discreet sense of things and like the rest of his order can see a long way in private lifethat is to say when he is out of the pulpit and off general dutyhe is an affable clear merry brisktalking little gentleman fond of a good joke a blithe chat and a hearty laugh he is a pleasant payne when in company and if you knew him you would say so the last daniel who cometh up to judgment is father papallthe very embodiment of vivaciousness linguistic activity and dignity in a nut shell darkhaired sharpeyed spectacled diminutive warmblooded he is about the most animated priest we know of he has english and italian blood in his veins and that vascular mixture works him up beautifully no man could stand such an amalgam without being determined volatile practical and at times dreamy and you have all these qualities developed in father papall he is 40 years of age and has seen more foreign life than many priests he has been in italy where he resided for years in holland belgium germany france america c and he has been at st walburges in this town for 14 months he is all animation when conversing with you and in the pulpit he talks from head to foot stirs all over fights much with his sleeves moves his arms and hands and fingers as if under some hot spell of galvanism and fairly gets his four feet into the general subject and revels with a delicious activity in it at intervals he is an earnest preacher has good intellectual constructiveness and if he had not to battle so much with our english idioms and curious modes of pronunciation he would be a very potent speaker and a racy homilist he has a sweeping powerful voice you could almost hear him if you were asleep and this fact may account for the peculiarly contented movements of several parties we observed recently at the church whilst father papall was preaching at least 20 near us went to sleep in about five minutes after he began talking slept very well during the whole sermon and at its conclusion woke up very refreshed made brisk crosses listened awhile to the succeeding music c and then walked out quite cool and cheerful most excellent schools are situated near and on the northern side of the church the average daily attendance of boys is 200 that of the girls 260 that of the infants 350 the boys seem well trained the girls who are in charge of nunscalled companions of the holy child jesusare likewise industriously cared for and the infants are a show in themselves we saw these 350 babies for many of them are nothing more the other day and the manner in which they conducted themselves was simply surprising the utmost order prevailed amongst them and how this was brought about we could not tell one little pleasantlooking nun had charge of the whole confraternity and she could say them at a wordmake them as mute as mice with the mere lifting of her finger and turn them into all sorts of merry moods by a similar motion in a second if this little nun could by some means convey her secret of managing children to about nineteentwentieths of the mothers of the kingdom who find it a dreadful business to regulate one or two saying nothing of 350 babes and sucklings she would confer a lasting benefit upon the householders of britain night and sunday schools the latter being attended by about 700 boys and girlsare held in the same buildings there are five nuns at st walburges they live in a convent hard by and like the rest of their class they work hard every day and sacrifice much of their own pleasure for the sake of that of other peoplea thing which the generality of us have yet to take first lessons in unitarian chapel there is something so severely mental and so theologically daring in unitarianism that many cant whilst others wont hold communion with it unbiased thinkers willing to give all men freedom of conscience admit the force of its logic in some things the sincerity of its intentions in all but deem it too dry and much too intellectual for popular digestion the orthodox brand it as intolerably heretical and terribly unscriptural the multitude of human beingslike oyster nan who couldnt live without running her vulgar rigconsider it downright infidelity the companion of rationalism and the stepping stone to atheism still there are many good people who are unitarians many magnificent scholars who recognise its principles and if respectability is any proof of correctnessthis age in the obliquity of its vision and in the depth of its respect for simple appearances says it isthen unitarianism ought to be a very proper article for its congregations though comparatively small are highly seasoned with persons who wear capital clothes take their time from the best of watches and have ever so much of what lawyers call real and personal property men termed monarchians were the first special professors of unitarianism they made their appearance between the second and third centuries and if tertullian tells the truth they consisted of the simple and the unlearned directly after the reformation unitarianism spread considerably on the continent and transylvania which now contains about 56000 of its followers became its great stronghold unitarianism got into england about the middle of the 16th century and many of the presbyterian divines who were ejected during the century which followedin 1662gradually became believers in it in england the unitarians have now about 314 chapels and emission stations in scotland there are only five congregations recognising unitarianism in ireland about 40 in our colonies there are a few in the united states of america the body has 256 societies in france germany holland c the principles of unitarianism are pretty extensively believed in some of our greatest thinkers and writers have been unitarians milton was one so was john locke and so was newton in different ages there have been different classes of unitarians in these days there are at least twothe conservative and the progressive but in the past the following points were generally believed and in the present there is no diversity of opinion regarding them viz that the godhead is single and absolute not triune that christ was not god but a perfect being inspired with divine wisdom that there is no efficacy in his vicarious atonement in the sense popularly recognised and that original sin and eternal damnation are in accordance with neither the scriptures nor common sense the origin of unitarianism in preston as elsewhere is mixed up with the early strivings and operations of emancipated nonconformity we can find no record of nonconformists in preston until the early part of the 18th century at that period a chapel was erected at waltonledale mainly if not entirely by sir henry de hoghtonfifth baronet and formerly member of parliament for prestonwho was one of the principal patrons of nonconformity in this district very shortly afterwards and under the same patronage a nonconformist congregation was established to preston meetings having previously been held in private housesand the rev john pilkington great uncle of w o pilkington esq of the willows near this town who is a unitarian was the minister of it as well as of that in walton in 1718 a little building was erected for the nonconformists of preston on a piece of land near the bottom and on the north side of churchstreet this was the first dissenting chapel raised in preston and in it the old nonconformistspresbyterians we ought to sayspent many a free and spirituallyhappy hour eventually the generality of the congregation got into a monarchian frame of mind and from that time till this the chapel has been held by those whom we term unitarians the parsonage house of the unitarian minister used to be in churchstreet near the chapel but it has since been transmuted into a shop one of the ministers at this place of worship towards the end of the last century was a certain mr walker but he couldnt masticate the unitarian theory which was being actively developed in it so he walked away and for him a building in grimshawstreetthe predecessor of the present independent chapel therewas subsequently erected the edifice wherein our unitarian friends assemble every sunday is an oldfashioned homelylooking little buildinga tiny quakerised piece of architecture simple to a degree prosaic diminutive snug dull it is just such a place as you could imagine old primitive nonconformists fonder of strong principles and inherent virtue than of external embellishment and masonic finery would build it can be approached by two ways but it is of no use trying to take advantage of both at once you would never get to the place if you made such an effort there is a road to it from percy streetthis is the better entrance but not much delight can be found in it and there is another way to the chapel from church streetup a delicious little passage edged on the right with a houseside and on the left with a wall made fierce with broken glass which will be sure to cut the sharpest of the worshippers if they ever attempt to get over it what there really is behind that glasstopped wall we are at a loss to define but it is evidently something which the occupier of the premises apprehends the unitarians may have an illicit liking for if they want to get to it we would recommend the use of some heavy blunt instrument by which they could easily break the glass after which they might quietly lift each other over recently a small sign has been fixed at the end of the passage and from the letters upon it an inference may be safely drawn that the unitarian chapel is somewhere beyond it to strangers this will be useful for prior to its exhibition none except those familiar with the place or gifted with an instinct for threading the mazes of mystery could find out with anything like comfort the location of the chapel whether the people have or have not sought for a sign one has at any rate been given to them here a small and somewhat neat graveyard is attached to the chapel there are several tombstones laid flat upon the ground and in the centre of it there is a rather elaborate one substantially railed round and surmounting the vault of the ainsworth family the remains of the late w ainsworth esq a wellknown and respected preston gentleman are interred here at the northern side of and directly adjoining the chapel there is a small sunday school it was erected about 15 years ago the scholars previous to that time having met in a little building in lordswalk the average attendance of scholars at present is about 60 the chapel internally is small clean plain and ancient looking a central aisle runs directly up to the pulpit and it is flanked with a range of high oldfashioned pews some being plain a few lined with a redcoloured material and several with faded green baize occasionally tacked back and elaborated with good old fashioned brass nails the seats vary in size and include both the moderately narrow and the full square for family use there are nine variously shaped windows in the building through three of them you can see sundry things ranging from the spire of the parish church to the beforementioned wall with the broken glass top through some of the others faint outlines of chimneys may be traced the chapel is light and comfortablelooking there seems to be nothing in the place having the least relationship to ornament except four small gas brackets which are trimmed up a little and surmounted with small crosses of the greek pattern at the west end supported by two pillars there is a small gallery in which a few elderly people the scholars and the choir are deposited the body of the chapel will accommodate about 200 persons the average attendance excluding the scholars will be perhaps 60 when we visited the place there were 50 present45 downstairs and five in the gallery and of these upwards of 30 were females the congregation is quite of a genteel and superior character there are a few rather poor people embraced in it but nine out of ten of the regular worshippers belong to either independent or prosperous middle class families the congregation although still highly respectable is not so influential in tone as it used to be a few years ago six or seven county magistrates might have been seen in the chapel on a sunday and they were all actual members of the body but death and other causes have reduced the number of this class very considerably and now not more than two are constant worshippers there is neither sham shoddy nor rant amongst them from one year end to another you will never hear any of them during any of the services rush into a florid yell or reduce their spiritual emotions to a dull groan they abstain from everything in the contortional and ejaculative line quiet contemplative intellectualism appears to reign amongst them a dry tranquil thoughtfulness pervades the body they are eclectical optimic cool believe in taking things comfortably never conjure up during their devotions the olden pictures of orthodoxy never allow their nerves to be shattered with notions about the devil or the burning lake in which sinners have to be tortured for ever and ever never hear of such things from the pulpit wouldnt tolerate them if they did think that they can get on well enough without them they may be right or they may be very wrong but like all sections of christians they believe their own denominational child the best there are two services every sunday in the unitarian chapelmorning and eveningand both are very good in one sense because both are very short there have been many ministers at the chapel since its transformation into a unitarian place of worship but we need not unearth musty records and name them all within modern memory there have been just a trinity of ministers at the chapelthe rev joseph ashton an exceedingly quiet unassuming well learned man who would have taken a higher stand in the town than he did if he had made more fuss about himself the rev w croke squier who made too much fuss who had too big a passion for easterdue martyrdoms and the like for corn exchange speeches patriotic agony points and virtuous fighting but who was nevertheless a sharpheaded quick sighted energetic little gentleman and the rev r j orrthe present ministerwho came to preston about a year and a half since mr orr is an irishman young in years tall cold timid quiet yet excellently educated he is critical seems slightly cynical and moves along as if he either knew nobody or didnt want to look at anybody there is somewhat of the student and somewhat of the college professor in his appearance but he is a very sincere man has neither show nor fussiness in him and practices his duties with a strict quiet regularity he may have moods of mirth and high moments of sparkling glee but he looks as if he had never only laughed right out about once in his life and had repented of it directly afterwards if he had more dash and less shyness in him less learned coolness and much more humour in his composition he would reap a better harvest in both pulpit and general life mr orr is no roaring will o the wisp minister what he says he means and what he means he reads his prayers and sermons are all read he is not eloquent but his language is scholarly and if he had a freer and more genial expression he would be better appreciated if he were livelier and smiled more he would be fatter and happier his style is his own is too orrible needs a little more sunshine and blithesomeness he never allows himself to be led away by passion sticks well to his text invariably keeps his temper he wears neither surplice nor black gown in the pulpit and does quite as well without as with them for his services he receives about 120 pounds a year and if the times mend he will probably get more in the chapel there is a harmonium which is played as well as the generality of such instruments are the singing is only moderate and if it were not for the good strong female voice apparently owned by somebody in the gallery it would be nearly inaudible would have to be either gently whispered or thought out the services in the main are simple free from all boisterous balderdash and if not of such a character as would suit everybody are evidently well liked by those participating in them all saints church the calendar of the canonised has come in handy for the christening of churches without it we might have indulged in a poor and prosaic nomenclature with it the dullest as well as the finest architecture can get into the company of the beatified barring a few places all our churches are associated with some particular saint every edifice has cultivated the acquaintance of at least one but that we have now to notice has made a direct move into the general constellation and is dedicated to the aggregate body we believe that in churchnaming as in common life all is for the best and we commend rather than censure the judgment which recognised the full complement of saints when all saints was consecrated a man maybe wrong in fixing upon one name or upon fifty or fifty hundred but if he agglomerates the entire mass condenses every name into one and gives something respectable that particular name he wont be far off the equinoctial of exactness in this sense the christeners of all saints were wise they went in for the posse comitatus of saintsbacked the favourites as well as the fieldand their scheme so far as naming goes must win there is however not much in a name and less in a reverie of speculative comment so we will descend to a lower yet perhaps more healthy atmosphere in 1841 the rev w walling son of a yeoman living is silverdale one of the prettiest places we know of in the north of englandcame to preston as minister of st jamess church he stayed at the place for about a year then went to carlton in nottinghamshire and afterwards to whitby mr walling was a man of quiet disposition during his stay in preston he was exceedingly well liked and when he left the town a vacuum seemed to have been created he was a missed man his value was not found out until he had gone and it was determinedmainly amongst a pious enthusiastic section of working peopleto get him back again if possible and they went about the business like sensible people decided not to root out his predecessor at st jamess nor to exterminate any of the sundry clerical beings in other parts of the town but to build him a new church they were only poor men but they persevered and in a short time their movement took a distinct shape and the building whose erection they had in view was prospectively called the poor mans church in time they raised about 200 pounds but a sum like that goes only a little way in church buildingsometimes doesnt cover those very refreshing things which contractors call extras a number of wealthier men who appreciated the earnestness of the original promoters and saw the necessity of such a church as they contemplated came to the rescue and what they and divers friends gave justified a start on a plot of land between walkerstreet and elizabethstreet on the 21st of september 1846 the foundationstone of the churchall saintswas laid by the late thomas german esq who was mayor of preston at that time the building which cost about 2600 pounds was not consecrated till december 1856 but it was ministerially occupied by the rev w walling on the 23rd september 1848 and he held his post earning the respect and esteem of all in the discharge of its duties till october 10th 1863 when death suddenly ended his labours when the church was consecrated there was a debt of about 750 pounds upon it but in a few years by the judicious and energetic action of the trustees it was entirely cleared off the present trustees of the church are dr hall messrs j r ambler f mitchell and w fort the successor of the rev w walling was the rev g beardsell who still occupies the situation but before saying anything to the point concerning him we must describe the church and its concomitants all saints is a good substantiallooking church it is built in the ionic style of greek architecture has a massive pillared front is railed round has an easy and respectable entrance andgetting worse as it gets higheris surmounted with a small bell turret and a chimney other things may be put upon the roof after a while for space is abundant there the church has a square respectable capacious interioris roomy airy light doesnt seem thrown together in a dim foggy labrynth like some places and you feel as if you could breathe freely on taking a seat in it it is well galleried and will accommodate altogether about 1500 human beings the pews are good and whilst it is impossible for them to hold more people than can get into them they are charged for as if one additional person could take a seat in each after being full this is odd but quite true in the case of pews which will just accommodate five persons six sittings are charged for those holding four are put down in the rent book for five and this scale of charges is kept up in respect to all the pews whether big or little the rents go into the pocket of the incumbent at the southern end there is a small chancel which was erected at the expense of the late j bairstow esq it is ornamented with several stained glass windows and has an inlaid wooden canopy but there is nothing startling nor remarkable about the work beneath the windows there is painted in large letters the word emmanuel but the position of it is very inconvenient people sitting above may see the name fairly but many below have a difficulty in grasping it and those sitting in the centre will never be able to get hold of more letters than those which makeup the mild name of emma names particularly great onesshould never be put up anywhere unless they can be seen on each side of the chancel arch then is a small tablet one being to the memory of the rev w walling and the other to that of the late w tuson esq who was one of the original wardens the church is clean and in good condition but the windows would stand repainting there are about 400 free seats in the building and they are pretty well patronised the general attendance is tolerably large between 700 and 800 people frequent the church on the average but the congregation seems to be of a floating character is constantly changing and embraces few old stagers formerly many who had been at the church from the first might be seen at it numerous persons recognised as fixtures were there but they have either gone to other churches or died off and there is now a strong ebb and flow of new material at the place the congregation is of a complex description you may see in it the grecian bend and the coal scuttle hood the buff waistcoat and the dark moleskin coat but in the main the worshippers are of a quiet wellassorted characterpartly working class partly middleclass with a sprinkling of folk above and below both the humble minded and the ancient appear to have a liking for the left side range of seats the swellishlyyoung and the substantiallymiddle class take up a central position people of a fair habilimental stamp occupy the bulk of the seats on the other side whilst the select and the specially virtuous approximate the pulpitone or two in the excelsior category get even beyond it and like both the quietude and the dignity of the position the galleries are used by a promiscuous company of worshippers who keep good order and make no undue noises the taletellers and the gossipsfor they exist here as in the generality of sacred placesare distributed in various directions it would be advantageous if they were all put in one separate part for then their influence would not be so ramified and they might in the end get up a small kilkenny affair and mutually finish off one another late attendance does not seem to be so fashionable at all saints as at some churches still it exists things would look as if they were getting wrong if somebody didnt come late and make everybody turn their heads when we visited the church the great mass were present at the right time but a few dropped in after the stipulated period one put in an appearance 30 minutes late and another sauntered serenely into the region of the ancient people just 65 minutes after the proceedings had commenced at a distance the reading desk and the pulpit look oddly mixed up but a close inspection shows that they are but fairly associated stand closely together the pulpit which is the higher being in the rear there is no decoration of any sort in the body of the church everything appears tranquil serious straightforward and respectable the singing is of a very poor characteris slow weak and calculated at times to make you ill pope in his essay on criticism says some to church repair not for the doctrine but the music there probably they do but nobody goes to all saints for that purpose no genuine hearty interest seems to be taken in the singing by anybody particularly the choir move through their notes as if some of them were either fastened up hopelessly in barrels or in a state of musical syncope the organist works his hands and feet as well as he can with a poor organ the members of the congregation follow lowly and contentedly doing their best against long odds and the parson sits still all in one grand piece and looks on the importance and influence of good music should be recognised by every church and we trust in time there will be a decided improvement at all saints a church like ita building of its size and with its congregationought to have something superior and effective in the matter of music we have already said that the rev george beardsell is the minister of all saints he has been at the church as its incumbent about five years originally mr beardsell was a methodista methodist preacher too we believe but in time he changed his notions and eventually flung himself in a direct line into the arms of mother church mr beardsell made his first appearance in preston as curate of trinity church he worked hard in this capacity stirred up the district at times with that peculiar energy which poor curates longing for good incumbencies wherein they may settle down into security and ease can only manifest and with many he was a favourite from trinity church he went to st saviours and here he slackened none of his powers enthusiasm combined with earnest plodding enabled him to improve the district considerably he drew many poor people around him he repeatedly charmed the unwashed with his strong roughhewn orgasms the place seemed to have been specially reserved for some man having just the perseverance and vigorous volubility which he possessed he had ostensibly a mission in the locality the people of the district liked him he reciprocated the feeling and more than once intimated that he would make one or two spots including the wild region of larkhill blossom as the rose but the period of efflorescence has not yet arrived a call came in due season and this carried the ministerial florist to another sphere of action mr beardsell was translated to the incumbency of all saints and he still holds it when mr walling was at this church the income was about 260 pounds a year taking everything into account it is now worth upwards of 400 pounds mr beardsell is not a beautiful but a stout wellmade strong looking man close upon 40 with a growing tendency towards adiposity he has a healthy bulky english look is not a man of profound education but makes up by weight what he may lack in depth thinks it a good thing to carry a walkingstick to keep his coat well buttoned and to arrange his hair in the highfront full whig style has a powerful roughly eloquent voice is rather sensational in the construction of some of his sentences bellows a little at times welters pathetically often is somewhat monotonous in tone ululates too heavily behaves harshly to the letter r sounds it with a violent vigour and makes it fairly spin round his tongue end occasionally can sustain himself well as a speaker is never at a loss for words has a forcible way of arranging his subjects is systematic in his style of treatment and can throw into his elucidation of questions wellcoined and emphatic expressions he likes perorationsused to imitate punshon a little he has a good analogical faculty takes many of his illustrations from nature and works them out exceedingly well is a capital explainer of biblical difficulties is peculiarly fond of the travels of st paul piles up the agony easily and effectively many times gets into a groove of highbeating fierceburning enthusiasm as if he were going to take a distinct leap out of his pentup utica and revel in the whole boundless continent of thought and sacred sensation is a thorough believer in the my brethren phrasewe recently heard him use it nineteen times in twenty minutes and regretted that he didnt make the numbers equal delights in decking out his discourses with couplets and snatches of hymns has a fullblown determined style of speaking reads with his gloves on and preaches with them off like one or two other parsons we have seen makes his sermons too long is a good platform man and would make a fair travelling lecturer has a great predilection for openair preaching and has spells of it to the orchard might with advantage work more in and less out of his own district wouldnt commit a sin if he studied the question of personal visiting shouldnt think that his scripture readera really good hardworking mancan perform miracles and do nearly everything can talk genuine common sense if he likes and make himself either very agreeable or pugnacious is an orangeman with a holy horror of popery can give deliciously passionate lectures about the reformation considers money a very important article and is inclined to believe that all people particularly parsons should stick to it very firmly will have his own way in church matters likes to fight with a warden has had many a lively little brush over sacrament money might have got on better with many of the officials if he had been more conciliatory is a man of moderate ability of fair metal of strong endurance but would be more relished if he were less dogmatic were given less to wandering preaching and threw himself heart soul purse and clothes into his own district near the church and occupying good relative positions on each side of a beerhouse called the rising sun are all saints schools one of themthat now occupied by the boys was according to a tablet at the outside erected several years ago by our old friend captain german as an affectionate tribute to the memory of thomas german esq about five years since two class rooms were attached to it at the expense of j bairstow j horrocks r newsham and t miller esqrs the other school set apart for the girls was erected after that built by captain german both of the schools are very good onesare large lofty and commodious that used for the boys is scholastically in a superior condition the master is sharp fully up to his duties and according to a report by the government inspector his school is one of the best in the district the average day attendance at the boys school is 150 whilst at the girls school the regular attendance may be set down at 330 the schools are used on sundays and their average attendance then is 800 much might be written concerning them but we must close we have said enough and can only add that if all are not saints who go to all saints they are about as good as the rest of people united methodist free church and polestreet baptist chapel we have two places of worship to struggle with on the present occasion and shall take the freest yet most methodistical of them first the united methodist free churchthat is a rather long and imposing nameis generally called orchard chapel the poetry of the thing may suffer somewhat by this deviation but the building appears to smell as sweetly under the shorter as the longer name so that we shall not enter into any criticism condemnatory of the change this chapel is the successor in a direct line of the first building ever erected in the orchard its ancestor was placed on precisely the same spot in 1831 those who raised it seceded from the wesleyan community in sympathy with the individuals who retired from the old body at leeds in 1828 and who adopted the name of protestant methodists for a short time the preston branch of these methodists worshipped in that mystic nursery of germinating isms called vauxhallroad chapel and in the year named they erected in the orchard a building for their own spiritual improvement it was a plain chapel outside and mortally ugly within amongst the preaching confraternity in the connexion it used to be known as the ugliest chapel in great britain and ireland in 1834 a further secession of upwards of 20000 from the wesleyans took place under the leadership of the late dr warren of manchester these secessionists called themselves the wesleyan association and with them the protestant methodists including those meeting in the orchard chapel preston amalgamated they also adopted the name of their new companions in 1857 the wesleyan association coalesced with another large body of persons who seceded from the original wesleyans in 1849 under the leadership of the rev james everett and others and the two conjoined sections termed themselves the united methodist free church none of the separations recorded were occasioned by any theological difference with the parent society but through disagreement on matters of government the ministers of the united methodist free church body move about somewhat after the fashion of the wesleyan preachers they first go to a place for twelve months and if they stay longer it has to be through invitation from one of the quarterly meetings as a rule they stop three or four years at one church and then move off to some new circuit where old sermons come in at times conveniently for new hearers the various churches are ruled by leadersmen of a deaconly frame of mind invested with power sufficient to enable them to rule the roost in ministerial matters to say who shall preach and who shall not and to work sundry other wonders in the high atmosphere of church government the members support their churches financially in accordance with their means there is no fixed payment those who are better off and not stingy give liberally the less opulent contribute moderately those who cant give anything dont after an existence of about 30 years the old chapel in the orchard was pulled down in order to make way for a larger and a better looking building during the work of reconstruction sunday services were held in the school at the rear which was built some time before at a cost of 1700 pounds the new chapel which cost 2600 pounds was opened on the 22nd of may 1862 it has a rather ornamental frontlooks piquant and seriously nobby there is nothing of the great or the grand in any part of it the building is diminutive cheerful wellmade and inclined in its stone work to be fantastical internally it is clean ornate and substantial its gallery has stronger supports than can be found in any other preston chapel if every person sitting in it weighed just a ton it would remain firm there are two front entrances to the building and at each end red curtains are fixed on pushing one pair aside the other sunday we cogitated considerably as to what we should see inside we always associate mystery with curtains caudle lectures with curtains shows and waxwork and big women and dwarfs with curtains but as we slowly yet determinedly undid these united methodist free church curtains and presented our mould of form before the full and absolute interior we beheld nothing special there were only a child two devotional women and a young man playing a slow and deathlike tune on a wellmade harmonium present but the plot thickened the place was soon moderately filled and whilst in our seat before the service commenced we calmly pondered over many matters including the difficulty we had in reaching the building yes and it was a difficulty we took the most direct cut as we thought to the place from the southern sidepassed along the marketplace into that narrowlybeautiful thoroughfare called new street then through a yet newer road made by the pulling down of old buildings in lordstreet and reminding one by its sides of the ruins of petra and afterwards merged into the orchard to neither the right nor the left did we swerve but moved on the chapel being directly is front of us but in a few moments afterwards we found ourselves surrounded by myriads of pots and a mighty cordon of cratesit was the pot fair thinking that the orchard was public ground and seeing the chapel so very near we pursued the even tenour of our way but just as we were about sliding between two crates so as to pass on into the chapel a strong man topcoated muffled up and with a small bludgeon in his hand moved forward and said cant go why said we folks isnt allowed in this here place now said he well but this is the towns property and we pay rates was our rejoinder and his was dont matter a cuss if you were lord derby i should send you back we accused him of rudeness and threatened to go to the police station close by but the fellow was obstinate his labours were concentred in the virtuous guardianship of pots he defied the police and everybody and feeling that amid all this mass of crockery we had for once unfortunately gone to pot we quietly walked round to the bottom of the ground for the crates and the pots swamped the whole place came up to the chapel door within four yards of the lordderby defying individual and quietly went into the building there are about 300 members of the church in the preston circuit which until recently included croston cuerden brinscall chorley and blackpool and which now only embraces cuerden and crostonthe other places being thought sufficiently strong to look after themselvesthere are about 400 members what are termed churches have been established at all the places named preston being the parent of them a branch of the body exists at southport and it was brought up under the care of the preston party orchard chapel will accommodate between 700 and 800 persons but like other places of worship it is never full except upon special occasions and the average attendance may be put down at about 400 in the old chapel the father of the late alderman g smith preached for a time the first minister of the chapel when rebuilt was the rev j guttridgean energetic impetuous eloquent earnest man he had two spells at the place was at it altogether about six years and left the last time about a year ago mr guttridge who is one of the smartest ministers in the body is now residing at manchester connected regularly with no place of worship on account of ill health but doing what he can amongst the different churches the congregation of orchard chapel consists principally of welldressed working peoplea quiet sincerelooking class of individuals given in no way to devotional hysteria and taking all things smoothly and seriously they are a liberal class too during the past two years they have raised amongst themselves about 800 pounds towards the chapel upon which there is still a debt but which would have been clear of all monetary encumbrances long since if certain old scores needing liquidation had not stood in the way the members of the choir sit near the pulpit the females on one side and the males on the other they are young goodlooking and often glance at each other kindly a female who plays the harmonium occupies the centre the music is vigorous and considering the place commendable on sundays there are two services at the chapelmorning and evening and during the week meetings of a religious character are held in either the chapel or the adjoining rooms the present minister of the chapel is the rev richard abercrombie he has only just arrived and may in one sense be termed the greatest minister in preston for he is at least six feet high in his stocking feet he is an elderly gentlemanmust be getting near 70 but he is almost as straight as a wand has a dignified look wears a venerable grey beard and has quite a military precision in his form and walk and he may well have for he has been a soldier mr abercrombie served in the british army upwards of twenty years he followed wellington after waterloo and was in paris as a british soldier when the famous treaty of peace was signed his grandfather was cousin of the celebrated sir ralph abercrombie who defeated napoleons forces in egypt and his ancestors held commissions in our army for upwards of four generations tired of military life mr abercrombie eventually laid down his arms and for 33 years he has been a minister in the body he is now connected with it is worthy of remark that before leaving the army he occasionally sermonised in his uniform and 35 years ago he preached in his red jacket c in the old orchard chapel mr abercrombie is a genial smoothnatured quiet mantalks easily yet carefully preaches earnestly yet evenly there is no froth in either his prayers or sermons he never gets into fits of uncontrollable passion never rides the high horse of personal ambition nor the low ass of religious vulgaritykeeps cool behaves himself and looks after his work midly and well he has two or three sons in the united methodist free church ministry and one of them called after the general who defeated the napoleonic forces is the only man belonging the body who has a university ma after his name very good schools are connected with orchard chapel the average day attendance is 140 and on sundays the average is about 350 in the last place we may observe that the people belonging orchard chapel are generally getting along comfortably in all their departments formerly they had feuds and fights and church meetings at which odd pieces of scandal were bandied aboutthey may have morsels of unpleasantness yet to encounter but taking them all in all they are moving on serenely and well passing not from pole to pole but from the orchard to pole street we come to the baptist chapel in that thoroughfarea rather dull stronglyrailedoff place which seems to be receding from public sight altogether about 45 years ago a small parcel of preston people enamoured of the calvinistic methodism which the countess of huntingdon recognised worshipped in a building in cannonstreet in 1825 they built or had raised for them a chapel in polestreet which was dedicated to st mark at this time probably on account of its novelty the creed drew many followers the new chapel was patronised by a somewhat numerous congregation which kept increasing for a period but it gradually dwindled down and a total collapse finally ensued in 1855 a number of general baptists who split from their brethren worshipping in the old leemingstreet chapel struck a bargain with the expiring lady huntingdon section for their building in polestreet gave about 700 pounds for it forthwith shifted thereto and continue to hold the place there is nothing at all calling for comment as to the exterior of the chapel and not much as to the interior it will accommodate about 900 persons the pews are high awkward to sit in and have a grim cold appearance the building is pretty lofty and is well galleried the pulpit is at the far end and the singers sit on a railed platform before it the congregation seems both thin and poor very lately we were in it and estimated the number present at 84rather a small party for a chapel capable of holding 900 the building possesses about the best acoustical properties of any place of worship in preston the late mr samuel grimshaw of preston who amongst many other things had a special taste for music used to occupy it at times with his band for the purposes of practising he liked it on account of its excellent sounding qualities once after some practice in it mr grimshaw offered a returnsaid he would give the brethren a musical lift with his band during some anniversary services to be held in the chapel his promise was accepted and when the day came there was a complete musical flood the orchestra including the singers numbered about 50 and the melodious din they created was something tremendous sam had the arrangement of it there were tenors baritones bass men trebles altosingers in the fullest feather there were trumpeters tromboners bassooners ophicleideans cornetapiston players and many others all instrumentally armed to the very teeth and the sensation they made fairly shook and unnerved the more pious members of the congregation who protested against the chapel being turned into a concerthall c the music after all was good and if it were as excellent now there would be a better attendance at the place the present orchestra consists of perhaps a dozen singers including a central gentleman who is about the best shouter we ever heard and they are helped out of any difficulties they may get into by a rather awkwardlyplayed harmonium the rev w j stuart is the minister of the chapel and he receives from 70 to 80 pounds a year for his duties he has a gentlemanly appearance looks pretty well considering the nature of his salary is getting into the grey epoch of life is not very erudite but seems well up in scriptural subjects is sincere mild primitive in his notions has fits of cautiousness and boldness is precise and earnest in expression has an interpretational tendency in his sacred utterances is disposed to explain mysteries likes homilising the people can talk much and can be very earnest over it all he has fair action and sometimes gets up to 212 degrees in his preaching we wont say that he is in any sense a wearying preacher but this we may state that if his sermons were shorter they would not be quite so long and from this he may take the hint we are told that the attendance at the chapel is slightly increasing but as compared with the past it is still very slender the admission to either the platform or pulpit of the chapel not very long ago of a wandering indian chief and a number of revivalists who told strange tales and talked wildly has operated we believe against the placeannoyed and offended some and caused them to leave the minister no doubt admitted these men with an honest intention but everybody cant stand the warwhooping of itinerant indians nor the sincere ferociousness of revivalists and awkward feelings were consequently generated in some quarters by them in the main mr stuart is a kindly quiet gentlemanly person and barring the little interruption caused by the dubious indian and the untamed revivalists has got on with a small congregation and a bad salary better than many parsons would have been able to do church of the english martyrs to this church a name which is general property has been given each of our religious sects can number its martyrs in the good old times cruelty was a reciprocal thing amongst professing christians it was a preeminently mutual affair amongst the two great religious parties in the landthe protestants and the catholicsfor when one side got into power they slaughtered their opponents and when the other became paramount the compliment was returned the church we have here to describe is dedicated to those english catholics who in the stormy days of persecution were martyred it is situated on the northern side of the town in a new and rapidly increasing part of preston at the extreme southwestern corner of what used to be called preston moor and on the very spot where men used to be hanged often and get their heads cut off occasionally gallows hill is the exact site of the church of the english martyrs and this hill is associated with a movement constituting one of the rugged points in our history the rebellion of 1715 virtually collapsed at preston many fights and skirmishes were indulged in one or two breezy passages of arms even took place within a good stonethrow of the ground occupied by the church of the english martyrs but the kings troops finally prevailed according to an old book before us there were taken at preston amongst the rebelsseven lords besides 1490 other including the several gentlemen officers and private men and two clergymen and the book further says in a humorously sarcastic mood there was a popish priest called littleton among them but having a great deal of the jesuit he contrived a most excellent disguise for he put on a blue apron went behind an apothecarys counter and passed for an assistant or journeyman to the apothecary and so took an opportunity of getting off but all the captured rebels did not escape so adroitly as our jesuitical friend littleton for several of them were either hanged or beheaded and the fate of many was sealed on the site of the church of the english martyrs on the 5th of january 1715 we are told that sixteen rebels were hanged upon gallows hill for high treason and conspiracy in the following year 42 condemned prisoners of all religions were hanged and decapitated at preston and amongst them were five belonging preston and the neighbourhood they were richard shuttleworth of preston esq roger moncaster of garstang attorney thomas cowpe of waltonledale william butler of myerscough esq william arkwright of preston gentleman and all of them were put to death on gallows hill the cost being for materialls hurdle fire cart c and for setting up shuttleworths head c 12 pounds 0s 4d there can be no doubt that gallows hill derives its name directly from the transactions of 171516 prior to that time it was a simple mound after that period it became associated with hangings and beheadings and received the name of gallows hill which was peculiarly appropriate in may 1817 gallows hill was cut through so that the great north road to lancaster might be improved whilst this was being done two coffins were found and in them there were discovered two headless bodies local historians think they were the remains of two rebel chieftains they may have been but there is no proof of this although the fair supposition is that they were the decapitated remnants of two somebodies who had assumed a rebellious attitude in 1715 it is probable that the heads of these parties were exposed on poles in front of our townhall for that was an olden practice and was considered very legitimate 154 years ago we have spoken of the discoveries of 1817 and in continuing our remarks it may be said that near the spot some timber supposed to have been the gallows was once found and that a brass handaxe was dug up not far from it at the same time the moor which amongst other things embraced the hill we have mentioned was a rough wildish placea rude looking common but it seems to have been well liked by the people for upon it they used to hold trade meetings political demonstrations c and for 65 yearsfrom 1726 to 1791 horse races were annually run upon it the corporation and the freemen of the borough once had a great dispute as to their respective claims to the moor and the latter by way of asserting their rights put upon it an old white horse but the corporation were not to be cajoled out of their ownership by an argument so very horsey as this they ordered the animal off and mr j dearden who still obeys their injunctions with courteous precision put it into a pinfold hard by the church of the english martyrs was erected not long ago upon that part of the moor we have described originally the promoters of the church treated for a plot of land about 20 yards above the present site but the negotiations were broken off and afterwards they bought wren cottage and a stable adjoining situated about a quarter of a mile northwards the house was made available for the priest the stable was converted into a church and mass was said in it for the first time on christmas morning 1864 on the 21st of january 1865 it was formally opened the revs canon walker t walton and f soden taking part in the services of the day during 1865 preparations were made for erecting a new church upon the same site but some of the gentlemen living in the immediate neighbourhood took offence at the movement and insisted upon certain stipulations contained in the covenants which barred out the construction of such a building as a church or a chapel being carried out there was a considerable amount of corporation discussion in respect to the question and eventually the idea of erecting a church upon the land was abandoned directly afterwards gallows hill in which both the corporation and mr samuel pole shaw had rights was purchased as a site for it operations involving the removal of an immense quantity of earthfor the place was nothing more than a high rough sandy hillockwere commenced on the 26th of march 1866 on the 26th of may in the same year the foundationstone was laid with great ceremony by dr goss and on the 12th of december 1867 the church was opened mr e w pugin designed the building which externally does not look very wonderful at present but when completed it will be a handsome place the original design includes a beautiful steeple surmounted with pinnacles but want of funds precludes its erection the church is a high doubleroofed edificelooks like two buildings one placed above the other and owing to the absence of a steeple it seems very tall and bald it has a pretty western gable which can only be fully appreciated by close inspection the centre of this gable is occupied by a fine eightlight window and the general work is surmounted by pinnacles and ornamental masonry two angels cut in stone originally formed part of the ornamentation but during a strong gale early in 1868 they were blown down these fallen angels have never regained their first estate and as they might only tumble down if refixed and perhaps kill somebody which would not be a very angelic proceeding we suppose they will not be interfered with the church has an imposing a noble interior it is wide lofty has a fine calm majestic look and is excellently arranged the nave which is 69 feet high is supported by 14 stone pillars from nearly any point every part of the building may be seen the nave pillars do not as is the case in some churches obstruct the vision and everything seems easy clear and open in the daytime a rich shadowy light is thrown into the church by the excellent disposition of its windows at eventide the sheen of the setting sun caught by the western window falls like a bright flood down the nave and makes the scene beautiful the high altar is a fine piece of workmanship is of gothic design is richly carved is ornamented with marbles has a canopy of most elaborate construction and is in good harmony with the general architecture two small altars are near it one of them dedicated to st joseph and given by mr j pyke of this town is particularly handsome the other dedicated to the blessed virgin is of a less costly though very pretty character near one of the pillars on the northeastern side there stands a square wooden frame which is called the pulpit it is a deliciously primitive and remarkably commonplace concern but it is strong enough and will have to stop where it is until money for something better is raised there are sittings in the church for 850 persons on sundays there are masses at eight and halfpast nine a regular service at eleven and another at halfpast six in the evening the aggregate attendance during the day is about 1350 the assemblage at the first mass is thin at the second it is good better than at any other time at eleven it is pretty numerous and in the evening it is fair adults and children from the union workhouse of the catholic persuasion attend the eleven oclock service and they come in tolerable forcesometimes they number 100 the general congregation consists nearly altogether of working class people and it includes some of the best sleepers we have seen the members of the choir sit in a gallery at the western end their performances are of a curious description sometimes they sing very wellare quite exact in their renderings and decidedly harmonious at other times they torture the music somewhat but then they are young at the business havent had so much experience and have nothing to rely upon in the shape of instrumental music except the hard tones of an ordinary harmonium organ accompaniments help up good choirs and materially drown the defects of bad ones with better instrumental assistance the singers at the church of the english martyrs would acquit themselves more satisfactorily and with additional practice they would still further improve matters there are two priests stationed at the churchthe rev james taylor and the rev joseph pyke father taylor the principal is a blooming healthy fullspirited gentleman he is a fylde man has in him much strong straightforwardness looks as if he had never ailed anything in his life doesnt appear to have mortified the flesh very acutely seems to have taken things comfortably and well since the day of his birth has not allowed his creed to spoil his facea trick which some professors of religion are guilty of and is on the whole a genuine specimen of the true john bull type father taylors first mission was at lancaster under the late dean brown afterwards he came to st augustines preston where he remained four and a half years then he was appointed catholic chaplain at the house of correction and subsequently he took charge of his present mission he is an active man and works very hard in his district as a preacher he is energetic impetuous and practicalspeaks plainly and straight out minces nothing and tries to drive what he considers to be the truth right home he has very little rhetorical action hardly moves at all in the pulpit stirs neither head nor hand except upon special occasions but he has a powerful voice he pours out his words in a strong full volume and the force he has in this respect compensates for the general immobility he displays during his discourses his colleaguethe rev j pykeis a small mild gentleman unassuming in manner cautious careful quiet precise and whilst attending to his duties regularly he makes no bluster about them he was ordained at the church of the english martyrs in september 1868 in the pulpit he is earnest clear and regular in his remarks he makes no repetitions flings himself into no attitudes assumes no airs but proceeds on to the end steadily and calmly both the priests named live close to the church in a building which forms part of the property of the mission it is intended some time to have a proper presbytery near the church one is included in the original plan but shortness of funds bars its erection the work thus far executedthe church vestries chas cost about 8000 pounds and there still remains upon the buildings a debt of about 4000 pounds there are no schools in connection with the church but it is expected that there will be by and bye the land formerly used as the cattle market and situated near the church has been bought for this purpose and collectors are now engaged in raising money towards the erection of the schools the church has two or three guilds the female members thereof numbering about 200 and the males 100 in the district there are about 3000 catholics including 700 children under 10 years of age so that the priests in charge of it have quite enough on hand for the present a mission in debt to the tune of 4000 pounds a church to internally completefor much yet remains to be finished in the one described a church tower which will cost 2000 pounds to raise a presbytery to begin of schools which are primarily essential to erect and 7000 human beings to look after constitute what may fairly be termed no joke st saviours church few districts are more thoroughly vitiated more distinctly poverty struck more entirely at enmity with soap and water than that in which this church stands physically mentally and spiritually it is in a state of squash and mildew heathenism seethes in it and something even more potent than a fortyparson power of virtue will be required to bring it to healthy consciousness and legitimate action you neednt go to the low slums of london neednt smuggle yourself round with detectives into the back dens of big cities if you want to see sights of poverty and depravity you can have them nearer homeat homein the murky streets sinister courts crowded houses dim cellars and noisy drinking dens of st saviours district pass through it move quietly along its parapetsleaving a tour through its internal institutions for some future occasion and you will see enough to convince you that many missionaries with numerous bibles and piles of blankets are yet wanted at home before being despatched to either farthest land or the plains of timbuctoo the general scene may be thus condensed and described myriads of children ragged soreheaded barelegged dirty and amazingly alive amid all of it wretchedlooking matrons hugging saucy screaming infants to their breasts and sending senior youngsters for either herring or beer or very small loaves strong idle young men hanging about street corners with either dogs at their feet or pigeonbaskets in their hands little shops driving a brisk booking business with either females wearing shawls over their heads or children wearing nothing at all on their feet bevies of brazenfaced hussies looking out of grim doorways for more victims and more drink stray soldiers struggling about beer or dram shops entrances with dissolute brawnyarmed females and wandering old hags with black eyes and dishevelled hair closing up the career of shame and ruin they have so long and so wretchedly run anybody may see the sights we have just described we mention this not because there is anything pleasing in it but because it is something which exists daily in the heart of our townin the centre of st saviours district no locality we know of stands more in need of general redemption than this and any christian church no matter whatever may be its denominational peculiarities which may exist in it deserves encouragement and support the district is so supremely poor and so absolutely bad that anything calculated to improve or enlighten it in any way is worthy of assistance a baptist chapel was built in the quarter we are now describingit was erected in leemingstreet at the corner of queenstreetin 1783 fifty years afterwards it was enlarged subsequently the baptists couldnt agree amongst themselves the parties to the quarrel then separated some going to polestreet chapel others forming a new churchthat now in fishergate and on the 10th of august 1859 the old building was bought by certain gentlemen connected with the church of england a young man named william dent thompson strong in constitution greatly enamoured of reformation principles keenly polemical and brought up under the aegis of the rev geo alker was appointed superintendent of the place he stayed awhile then went away and was succeeded by the rev geo donaldson who in turn left for blackburn and was followed by the rev geo beardsell the present incumbent of all saints in this town mr beardsell did an excellent business in the districtworked it up well and most praiseworthily but he in time left for seven months after this there was no regular minister at the place still it didnt go down several energetic zealous laymen looked after it and the schools established in connection with it and considering their calibre they did a good work but they couldnt keep up a full and continuous fire a properly stationed minister was needed and mr thompson who had in the meantime entered holy orders was summoned from blackenall in staffordshire to take charge of the church and district in 1863 he came under his ministrations the congregation soon augmented and in a short time a movement was started for a new church the old building being a ricketty inconvenient rudelydismal place quite insufficient for the requirements of the locality the principal friends of the new movement were r newsham the late j bairstow j horrocks and t miller esqrs and what they subscribed constituted a substantial nucleus guaranteeing the commencement of operations in 1866 the old edifice was pulled down to make way for a new church and during the work of reconstruction divine service was performed in vauxhallroad schools which were sometime after mr thompsons appointment transferred by the rev canon parr from the parish churchs to st saviours district r newsham esq laid the cornerstone of st saviours church on the 26th of november 1866 the building was consecrated by the bishop of manchester on the 29th of october 1868 on the 9th of december in that year the rev w d thompson was licensed to its incumbency and on the 16th of april 1869 the district was legally assigned by the ecclesiastical commissioners st savioursdesigned by mr hibbert architect of this townis one of the handsomest and best finished churches we have seen it almost seems too good for the district in which it is situated the style of it is gothic externally its most striking feature is the tower we thought at one time when the tower had been run up a considerable distance that it was positively going to the dogs at each of its angles there is a strange arrangement of dogs they bristle out on all sides and are not over good lookingare thin hungry weirdlooking animals appear to have had a hard time of it somewhere and to be doing their best to escape from the stone whence they are protruding but the pinnacles placed above have completely taken away their grotesqueness their malicious suspicious appearance and the tower now looks beautiful there are three entrances to the churchone at the back another at the northwestern corner and the third beneath the tower on the south western side if you please we will enter by the door on the last named side we are within the buildingjust within and here we have on the right a glass screen on the left a multiplicity of warm water pipes and in the centre of the spot a handsome substantial baptismal font the gift of sir t g fermorhesketh mp this font cant be too highly praised its workmanship is excellent its material is most durable and with care it will last for at least four thousand years behind it are two stained glass windows one being in memory of the father of the incumbents wife the other in remembrance of the architects mother adjoining is a plain window which will shortly be filled in with stained glass at the expense of mr w b roper in memory of a relative leaving the font and the water pipes and the windows we move forward and are at once struck with the capaciousness the excellent disposition and the handsome finish of the interior directly in front there is a magnificent fivelight chancel windowbeautifully coloured well arranged containing in the centre a representation of our saviour and flanked by figures of the four evangelists we have seldom seen a more exquisite a more elegantly artistic window than this edward swainson esq whose works are in the district presented it still looking eastward but taking a nearer view and one of less altitude we notice the pulpita piece of fine carved oakwork resting upon a circular column of stone and given by mrs newsham then we have a lectern of the eagle pattern presented by the rev r brown and to the left of this there is a most excellently finished carved oak reading desk given by r newsham esq the communion plate most choice and elaborate in designwas we may observe given by the same gentleman turning round we notice a pretty fourlight window in the western gable this was also presented by r newsham esq in memory of the late j bairstow esq the church consists of a nave and a northern aisle if an aisle could be constructed on the southern side the building would assume proportions at once most complete and imposing but space will not permit of this land constitutes a difficulty on that side and the general building is considerably deteriorated in appearance at present through associations in this part at the southeastern end there is a small wretchedlooking beershop and near it a dingy usedup cottage these two buildings are a nuisance to the church they spoil the appearance of the building at one end completely and they ought to be pulled down and carted off forthwith reverting to the interior of st saviours we observe that the northern side is supported by four arches the central one depending upon double columns of polished granite and all of them having highly ornamented capitals a couple of stone angels support the primary principal of the chancel roof and they bear the weight put upon them very complacently the northern aisle is occupied below with free seats and above in a gallery with ditto at the western end there is a continuation of the gallery filled with free seats the church will hold 800 people and more than half the seats are free all the pews are strong open and good to sit in the central ones on the ground floor are very lengthyperhaps thirty feet in extent the congregation considering the capacity of the church is large and consists almost absolutely of working people we noticed during our visit to this place what we have seen at no other church or chapel in the town namely that many of the worshippers put in an early appearanceseveral were in their seats at least a quarter of an hour before the service commenced we further noticed that the congregation is a preeminently quiet and orderly one at some places you are tormented to death with stirring feet shuffling rustling clothes coughing sneezing c here however you have little of these things and at times a positive dead calm prevails it may also be worthy of mention that we saw fewer sleepers at st saviours than in any other place of worship yet visited by us only one gentleman got fairly into a state of slumber during the whole service a stout girl tried to drop over several times and an old man made two or three quiet efforts to get his eyes properly closed but both failed all the other members of the congregation appeared to be wide awake and amazingly attentive the free seats are well patronised by poor people and it is to such a class as this that the place seems really advantageous the music at the church is simple hearty and quite congregational the tunes are plain and the worshippers instead of looking on whilst the choir perform join in the music and get up a very full volume of respectable melody the regular singers have their quarters at the northeastern end on the ground floor and they acquit themselves with a very good grace near them is a small poorlooking organ it is played well but its music is not very consolatory and its tame infantile appearance throws it quite out of keeping with the general excellence of the church some money has we believe been promised towards a new organ and if somebody else would promise some more a seemlylooking instrument might be obtained two or three classes meet every sunday for instruction in the church formerly owing to defective accomodation the members of them had to assemble in two publichouse rooms where the education was in one sense of the mixed kind for whilst virtue was being inculcated above where the members met the elegant warwhooping of pagans below given over to beer tobacco and blasphemy could be heard this wasnt a thing to be desired and as soon as ever the church was ready a removal to it was effected educational business in connection with st saviours is carried on in various parts of the district in vauxhallroad there are day schools with an average attendance of 220 on sundays the work of education is carried on here also at the parsonagehouse which adjoins larkhill convent where a mothers class is taught by mrs thompson in shepherd street where a number of poor ragged children meet and likewise as before stated in the church the aggregate attendance being about 900 the parsonagehouse was purchased and presented to st saviours by the late j bairstow esq handsome new schools are being built entirely at the expense of r newsham esq who has been a most admirable friend to st saviours near the church they will accommodate about 400 scholars and will it is expected be ready by the end of the present year the entire cost of the church parsonage house c has been about 10000 pounds and not more than 50 pounds will be required to clear off all the liabilities thus far incurred the incumbent of st saviours is plain unpoetical stronglooking and practical he was reared under the shadow of ingleborough we have known him for 30 years on coming to preston he was for sometime a mechanic then he became missioner in connection with the protestant reformation society first at st peters in this town and next at st marys afterwards he left studied for the ministry and six years since as already intimated came to st saviours as its incumbent for a time after the church was erected he had nothing to depend upon but the pew rents which realised about 70 pounds a year but fortune favours parsons the ecclesiastical commissioners subsequently increased his stipend then 1000 pounds was left by j bairstow esq and the income is now equal to about 300 pounds per annum mr thompson is not a brilliant man and never will be he is closeshaven fullfeatured heavilyset slow is his mental processes but earnest pushing and enduring he is an industrious parson a striving persevering roughlyhewn hardworking mana good visitor a willing worker free and kindly disposed towards poor people and the exact man for such a district as that in which he is located if a smart highly drawn classical gentleman were fixed as minister in the region of st saviours the people would neither understand him nor care for him if he talked learnedly discussed old cosmogonies worked out subtle theories of divinity and chopped logic if he spiced up big homilies with plato and virgil or wandered into the domain of hebrew roots and greek iambics his congregation would put him down as insane and would be driven crazy themselves but mr thompson avoids these things primarily because he doesnt know much about them and generally because plain words and practical work are the sole things required in his district the gentleman under review used to be a tremendous antipopery speaker and more than once thought well of the reformation perorations of henry vincent but he has toned down much in this respect like panjandrum the grand under whose feathers he originally nestled he is still and has a right to be if that way inclined a strong believer in the triumph achieved at boyne water only he doesnt make so much stir about it as formerly mr thompson is a determined and aspiring man is earnest windy and clerically large knows he is a parson without being told of it has a somewhat ponderous and flatulent style of articulation has not the faculty of originality much developed but can imitate excellently could sooner quote than coin a great thought believes in stray polemical struggles with outsiders used to have a byronic notion that getting hold of other peoples thoughts and passing them off for those of somebody else was not a very great sin is a better anecdote teller than reasoner can be very solemn and most virtuously combative could yet though he seems to have settled down get up on the shortest notice any amount of immortal william steam and throw every ounce of it into a good ninthrate jeremiad still he has many capital points he is a most indefatigable toiler in his own district and that covers all his defects he is not too proud nor too idle to visit everybody however wretched or vile requiring his advice and assistance he is homely sincere and devoted to the cause he has in hand and the locality he has charge of he does his best to improve it he has not laboured unsuccessfully and no better minister could be found for such a place he can adapt himself to its requirements can level himself to its social and spiritual necessities does more good in it every day than a more polished or brilliant or namby pamby parson would be able to accomplish in a year has an excellent wife who takes her share of the districts work attends to the varied wants of the localityand there are many in a godless district like his with its 5000 soulsin a most praiseworthy manner he is the right man is the right place and it is a good job that he is not too learned for that would have interfered with his utility would have dumfounded those in his keeping and operated against his success mr thompson adieu and good luck to you christian brethren and brookstreet primitive methodists all over there are many who consider themselves christian brethren but the number taking up the name specifically with a determination to stick to it denominationally is small in all large towns a few of this complexion may be found and in preston odd ones exist whose shibboleth is christian brethren we had a spell with them rather unexpectedly on a recent first daychristian brethren always call sunday the first day and it came about in this way we were on the point of entering a dissenting place of worship when a kindlynatured somewhat originallyconstituted pillar of the church intercepted our movements and said you mustnt come here today why we asked and his reply was that a fiftiethrate stray parson whom the church doesnt care for would be in the pulpit that day and that if we wished for a fair sample we must come next sunday we didnt want to be hard and therefore said that if another place could be found for us we would take it instead violent cogitation for five minutes ensued and at last our friend more zealous than erudite conjured up what he termed them here new lot called christians we had heard of this section before and at our request he accompanied us to a small curiouslyconstructed building in meadow street at the side of the doorway we observed a strangelywritten badlyspelled sign referring to the different periods when the christian brethren met for worship c and above it another sign appeared small and dim and making some allusion to certain academical business hurrying up fourteen steps we reached a dark timeworn door and after pausing for a momentlistening to some singing withinour guide philosopher c opened it and we entered the place with him the room was not crowded to suffocation its windows were not gathering carbon drops through the density of human breathing there were just fourteen persons in the placefour men three women two youths a girl and four children a bible and a hymn bookthe latter according to its preface being intended for none but the righteouswere handed to us and our friend want through the singing in a delightfully dreadful style he appeared to have a way of his own in the business of psalmodysang whatever came into his head first got into all manner of keys and considering that he was doing quite enough for both of us we remained silent listening to the general melody and drinking in its raptures as placidly as possible prior to describing either the service we witnessed or the principles of those participating in it we must say a word in reference to the building it stands on the northern side of meadow street between sundry cottage houses retiring a little from the general frontage and by its architecture seems to be a cross between a small school and a minute country meetinghouse it was originally built in 1844 by mr john todd of this town he started it as a chapel on his own accountfor at that time he had special theological notions and probably considered that he had as much right to have a place of worship as anybody else we have been unable to ascertain the primal denominational character of the building the founder of it is unable to tell us all that we have been able to get out of him is that the place had no name and all that we can therefore fairly say is that he built it and did either something or nothing in it mr todd did not occupy it very long he struck his colours in about a year and afterwards it was used by different dissenting bodies including some scotch baptists on whose behalf the building was altered originally it was only one story high but when the baptists went to it a second story was added and having either aspiring notions or considering that they would be better accommodated in the higher than the lower portion of the building they went aloft leaving the ground floor for individuals of more earthly proclivities two years ago mr todd sold the building and about six months since certain christian brethren hired the top room for first day purposes week day work being carried on in it by an industrious schoolmaster like the quakers christian brethren are a peculiar people they believe more in being good and doing good than in professing goodness formally they recognise some forms and a few ceremonies but vital inherent excellencesimple christianity plain unadorned and earnestis their polestar they claim to be guided in all their religious acts solely by the scriptures consider that as the disciples were first called christians at antioch their followers have no right to assume any other name think baptismally speaking that whilst there may be some virtue in sprinkling and pouring there can be no mistake about absolute immersion inasmuch as that will include everything think baby baptism unnecessary and hold that none except penitent believers with brains fairly solidified should be admitted to the ordinance maintain that as under the apostolic regime the disciples came together on the first day of the week to break bread christians should partake of the sacrament every sunday call their ministers evangelists hold that at general meetings for worship there should be full liberty of speech that worship should be perfectly free and that everything should be supported on the voluntary principle those now worshipping in meadowstreet are the first christian brethren we have had regularly organised in preston how they will go on we cannot tell but if present appearances are any criterion we are afraid they will not make very rapid progress they have about ten members at present when the bakers dozen will be reached is a mystery the executive business of christian brethren is managed by deacons but the diaconal stage has not yet been reached in preston there are branches of the body in blackburn southport bolton c but none exist in lancashire north of preston the brethren here have no sundayschool but the establishment of one is contemplated and it may be in time fairly attended what the number of attendants will be we cant tell but this may be fairly saidthat if each of the ten members happens in the lapse of time to have 12 children and if all are sent to school 120 scholars will be raised and that this would constitute a very good muster for a small denomination but we must return to the subject after the singing which our friend so improvedand he continued in the werry same tone of voice as poor sam cowell used to say in his station porters song through every hymna bearded mustached and energetic young man mr w hindle originally a methodist town missionary at one time connected with shepherd street ragged school preston and now an evangelist belonging the christian brethren labouring at southport blackburn c but generally engaged for sunday service at preston read several verses from the bible then be prayed his orison being of a free and wide spreading type and afterwards he asked if any brother would read from holy writ a pause followed doubt and bashfulness apparently supervening but at length a calm thoughtful gentleman got up and went through sundry passages in isaiah the singing of a hymn succeeded and mr hindle then asked if another brother would read a gentleman spectacled with his hair well thrown back and very earnest here rose and having put a small bible upon a little table in front and taken up a larger volume which the minister had been perusing diced into corinthians and gave a tolerably satisfactory reading the minister then commenced discussing certain antithetical points in st pauls writings and next asked if two or three brethren would engage in prayer thirty seconds elapsed and then one of the brethren made a prayer the sacramentbread and winedirectly followed and after a purse suddenly pulled out from some place by the minister had been sharply handed round for contributions a serious young man gave out a hymn which the company genially sung more speaking ensued but the minister had it all to himself he saidwill any brother speak now is the time if you have anything to state utter it lose no time but say on never a brother spoke eyesqueezing and thumbturning and deep introspection followed and in the end the minister rose took his text from three or four parts of the bible and gave a lengthy discourse relieved at intervals with genuine outbursts of eloquence relative to christian action and general duty he seemed to have a poor notion of many christians and somewhat fantastically illustrated their position by saying that they were spiritually troubled with consumption and apparently with diabeteswere continually devouring good things constantly wasting away and doing no particular good amongst it at all we felt the force of this but we didnt ejaculate quietness except on very excited occasions being the rule here his discourse lasted about 30 minutes and it was well and forcibly delivered at the conclusion two or three of the brethren came out of their circlethey were all round a table before the parsonand shook hands with us we shortly afterwards retired leaving our musical friend engaged in a hot discussion with the parson as to the propriety of certain observations he had made in his sermon how the matter was fought out we cannot tell the brethren assemble every sunday morning and evening in the building sometimes they have a bible class meeting on a sunday afternoon and occasionally a week night service they are a calm devout forlornlooking class are distinctly sincere have strong liberal notions of christianity seem to love one another considerably and may at times greet each other with a holy kiss but they dont thrive much in preston in time they may become a great people but at present their status is small ten christian brethren up 14 steps may grow potent eventually but they may figuratively speaking fall down the steps in the meantime and so injure the cause as to defy the influence of theraputics a few words now as to brookstreet primitive methodist chapel which we visited the same day this is a tiny building and appears to stand in a dangerous region on one side all the windows are continually shuttered so as to prevent the mischievous action of stones and in front the door is railed in closely so as to frustrate the efforts of those who might be inclined to kick it the chapel which is also used for sunday school purposes was built in 1856 it is a very humble plainlooking edifice externally and internally it is equally unassuming you get to it collaterally through a pair of narrow doors which bang about very much in stormy weather the roof is supported by two iron pillars with which a tall stove pipe keeps company in the centre there are 16 pews each capable of holding three persons and a large pew which will accommodate six rows of small forms run down each side those on the left are used by men and boys those on the other side are principally patronised by women and little children some of whom are too young to engage in anything but lactary pursuits green is a favourite colour here the inside of the pews are green portions of the walls are green some of the windows are similarly coloured at the base the music stands in the orchestra are green and there is a fine semicircular display of green at the back of the pulpit at the southeastern corner there are sundry pieces of old timber piled up at the opposite side there is a cupboard and over the entrance numerous forms colour poles and a ladder are placed these constitute all the loose ornaments in the chapel about 150 persons can be accommodated in the place when we visited itthe time was rather unfavourable owing to the roughness of the weathersixty six persons exclusive of the choir and the parson were in it the congregation is a very poor one but it is singularly sincere and orderlyis not refined but devout is comparatively unlettered but honest there is neither silk nor satin nor diamond rings nor lavender kids in the place a hard workingday plainness mingled with poverty pervades it but there is no sham seen if the people are poor commonly dressed noisyif they effervesce sometimes and shout hallelujah with a fiery joyfulness and pray right out as if they were being shipwrecked or frightened to death why let them have their way for they are happy amongst it their convictions are strong and when they are at it they go in for a good thingfor something roughly exquisite hilariously pious and consumingly good they dont mince matters are neither dainty nor given to cant but shout out what they feel at the moment whatever may become of it afterwards sunday services prayer meetings and class meetings are held in the chapel regularly the pulpit is occupied by various persons the minister stationed at the place is the rev j hallcolleague of the pastor at saulstreet chapelbut he only takes his turn in it a strongbuilt man plainly attired earnest and not so given to flights of violent fancy as some preachers had charge of the pulpit during our visit his style was homely and in his easier periods he had a knack of putting his left hand into his breeches pocket and talking in a semiconversational lancashire dialect style he dilated for thirty minutes upon the hornblowing at jericho the siege the wallfalling and the sin of achan and then wound up by telling his hearersdrawing the moral from achans fatethat if they did wrong they would be sure to be found out the sermon was quite equal to the bulk of homilies given in primitive methodist chapels and it seemed to go right home to the congregation the plundering of achan was well told and when it was announced that he was stoned with stones and then burned the congregation sent up a mild halfsighing groan shaking their heads a little and apparently determining to do right as long as ever they lived the music at the chapel was strong and remembering the nature of the place satisfactory three men three young women and a boy managed it the women sometimes drowned the men the boy often got into a shrill mood but the men finally reached the surface the women quietly subsided the boy toned down his forces somewhat and on the whole the singing was well done after the sermon there came a prayer meeting we determined to see it out preserving that quietude and respect which one ought always to evince towards those believing in the great cardinal points of christanity however peculiar may be the modes of their expression only about twenty five who assembled on the southern side of the chapel joined the prayer meeting the proceedings were of a most enthusiastic virtuous hot and bewildering character singing feetbeating praying handclapping and reciprocal shouting constituted the programme one elderly man went fairly wild during the business he shook his head doubled his fists threw his arms about ejaculated with terrible rapidity and force and appeared to be entirely set on fire by his feelings a thorough crazea wild beating electrifying passiongot completely hold of him for a few minutes and he enjoyed the stormy pulsations of it exceedingly at the end somebody said now will some of the women pray instantly a little old man said god bless the women aye said another while several gave vent to sympathetic sighs but the women were not to be drawn out in this style none of them were in the humour for praying they didnt even return the benediction of the little old man by saying god bless the men they kept quiet then got up and then all walked out the last words we remember being from a woman who addressing us said now draw it mild st thomass church we have made no inquiry as to the original predecessors of those attending this church they may have been links in the chain of those men who ages ago planted themselves on the coast of malabar rejoicing in the name of christians of st thomas and struggling curiously with nestorians franciscans dominicans and jesuits they may have constituted a remnant of the good people whom cosmas indicopleustes saw in the east twelve hundred years since they may have only had a preston connection knowing nothing of the apostle of indiast thomasbeyond what anybody knows and caring more for his creed than his title whatever may have been their history and fate it is certain their successors believe in that most apostolical of unbelievers just mentionedso far at least as the name is concerned the church they respect is situated at the northern end of preston near the junction of moorlane and lancasterroad it is a small strong hardlooking building seems as if it would stand any amount of rain and never get wet through any quantity of heat and never have a sunstroke it is stoical cold firm and very stony has a bodkinpointed spire ornamented with round holes and circular places into which penetration has not yet been effected and its tout ensemble is in no way edifying it is neither ornate nor colossal strength plainness and smallness with a strong dash of general rigidity are its outward characteristics st thomass is one of the local churches erected through the exertions of the late rev r carus wilson and like all those churches it is built in the norman style of architecturea massive severe style which will never be popularly pleasing but will always secure endurance for the edifices constructed on its principles the first stone of this church was laid in august 1837 the building stands upon a hill is surrounded by a powerful stone wall can be approached two ways and has its front entrance opposite a small street which has not yet received any name at all to a stranger ingress to the building is rather perplexing a gateway in lancasterroad leading to a footpath fringed with rockery would appear to be the front way but it is only a rear road and when you get fairly upon it you wonder where it will end whether you will be able to get to the interior by it or only to some rails on one side and a wall on the other it however eventuates round a corner at the main entrance we recommend this back way for the legitimate front road is much more intricate and harassing you can only become acquainted with it if topographically unenlightened and bashful as to making inquiries by hovering about an ancient windmill moving up narrow hilly streets flanked by angular byepaths and then following either the first woman you see with a prayer book in her hand or the first man you catch a sight of with a good coat on his back the main entrance is ornamental but diminutive in many respects there are three doorways here the collateral ones which are very low and quite calculated to prevent people from entering the building with their hats on being patronised the mostnot because there is an offertory box in the central passage but because the side roads are the handiest during a second visit to the church we went in by the middle door the medium course as the proverb hath it being the safest and seeing the offertory boxa remarkably strong iron cornered article fastened to the wallwe remarked to an official in his shirt sleeves who was with us this will stand a deal of money before falling the official replied it will so and the look he gave us superinduced the conclusion that the offertory box was not going to fall for some time we have seen no more deceptivelooking church than that we are now at viewed externally you would say that scarcely a good handful of people could be accommodated in it it seems so narrow so entirely made up of and filled in with stone that one infers at first sight it will hardly hold the parson and the sacramentloving old woman who invariably exists as a permanent arrangement at all our places of worship but this is a fallacy for the building will accommodate about 1100 people the interior consists of a nave two aisles and a chancel everything in the building seems strong clean and good and considering the ponderous character of its architecture a fair share of light is admitted to it at the entrance there is a glass screen ornamentally got up and surmounted with a small lion and unicorn design just within this screen there is a curtained pew and sitting within its enclosure must be a very snug and select thing it is occupied by mr hermon mp and when he draws the curtains all roundhe sometimes does said the official accompanying usno one can see a morsel of him whilst he can see never a one in the building not even the parson without a special effort the nave is broad and quadrangular is supported by immensely strong pillars and has a fine high roof looking clean and spacious but considerably spoiled by several commonplace awkwardly fashioned beams the roof of each aisle is similarily marred the seats are disposed in six parallel ranges and the generality are quite good enough for anybody along each side there is a row of free seatsabout 50 altogethercapable of accommodating upwards of 300 persons there are also many free seats in the gallery the present incumbent has an idea that he has made some addition to this accomodation but people who have known the church ever since it was built say that the extra free pews appropriated for the poor by him were never charged for at the end of each aisle there is a neat stained glass window that to the right bearing this inscriptionto the memory of w p jones ma ob january 29 1864 aged 77 years and that on the left these words to the memory of mrs fanny jones ob january 27 1864 aged 75 years mr jones was a former incumbent of st thomass he was a quiet mildminded man devoid of bombast neither cynical nor meddlesome and was well liked by all his wife died just two days before him and both were interred in one grave in st peters church yard the pulpit and reading desk at st thomass are goodlooking and substantial but both are rather bad to get into and out ofthe steps are narrow and angular with a sudden descent which might cause a stranger to miss his footing and fall if he had not firm hold of the side rail right above perhaps 20 feet high and surmounting the chancel arch there is a small ornamental projection like a balcony it would make a capital stand for the minister or might be turned into a conspicuous place of sunday resort for the wardens but then they would have to be hoisted to it for there is no road up and that would not be seemly formerly we believe this balcony was used by the singers but they were subsequently transplanted to the western gallery the passage to the balcony front is now shut off a considerable effort at ornamentation has been made on the walls flanking the balcony described but we dont care much for it little pillars quaint window models and other architectural devices are heaped upon each other in curious profusion and it is difficult to get at their real meaning they relieve the walls a little but they do the work whimsically and you can neither get a smile nor a tear from them the chancel arch is strong and ornamental within it there is another arch the intervening roof being neatly groined and coloured and beyond there is the chancela small somewhat cimmerian yet prettylooking place there are five windows in it three having sacred figures painted upon them and the remaining two being filled in with fancy designs which dont look over well owing to the decay of the colours the congregation is tolerably numerous has in it the high the fairmiddling and the humblethe goodlooking the welldressed the rubicund the mildly mahoganyfeatured the simplydressed the attenuated and the indigent but there is a clear halo of respectability about the place superior habiliments are distinctly in the ascendant and orderly behaviour reigns throughout each section of worshippers the free seats are very fairly patronised and sometimes very oddly in one part of them we saw nine persons all near each other and out of that number five wore spectacles whilst three could only see with one eye at the western end of the church there is a beautiful circular window but it has not met with very good treatment it has been broken in one part and every morsel of it is covered up from general view by the organ occupying the gallery only the organ blower can see it properly and having the whole of it to himself it is to be expected he will derive some consolation from his special position if he doesnt then he neither gets up the wind nor looks through the window properly the organ is a good one and it is played with average ability but it is too big for the place it occupies and entirely swamps what was once considered a fine gallery the singers are rather afraid of giving vent to their feelings they discourse the music tastefully but they are too quiet and dont get into a temper as they ought to do occasionally over it prior to the advent of the present incumbent the choir considering its numbers was perhaps as good as any in the town or neighbourhood but one sunday morning the gentleman referred to having apparently been fiercely stung by a ritualistic wasp blew the trumpet of his indignation very strongly got into a whirlwind of denunciation all at once and without the aid of a text regarding ritualism and the organist and singers whose musical services embraced chants c fancying that the rev gentleman was either tired of their presence or performances many of which were voluntary sent in their resignations since then the music has not been very brilliant there are religious services every sunday morning and evening at st thomass and on thursday night a small gathering of the faithful takes place in the building the trustees of the church aremiss margaret ann beckles st leonards samuel husband beckles esq of the middle temple the rev edward auriol st dunstans the rev charles f close st anns blackfriars the rev w cadman marylebone and sir hugh hill the rev l w jeffrey was the first incumbent of the church then came the rev w p jones who died as before stated in 1884 afterwards the rev j t becher was appointed to the incumbency but he died from typhus fever in five weeks and was succeeded by the rev j p shepperd who still holds the post and receives from it about 400 pounds a year mr shepperd is a man of middle age and looks after his sheep fairly but at times eccentrically he has a polished tasteful clerical contour attends well to his hair whiskers and linen wears a hat half bishoply and half archidiaconal in its brim is a good scholar a clear reasoner an ablepreacher but repeats himself often and gets longwinded on sunday nights is highly enamelled touchy and imperial is lofty in tone cream laid and double thick in manner is full of metal and there is a stately mystery about him as if he were a blood relation of the great mokanna he is nearly infallible and would make a good pope he is strongly combative and would be a vigorous bruiser in stormy ecclesiastical circles we fancy no parson in preston has had more officials than mr shepperd in less than half a dozen years there have been at the place many organists singers curates scripture readers and eight or nine churchwardens either they have been very uneasy people or he has been uniquely antagonistic mr shepperd resides at a good parsonage some distance north of the church and he has a pretty garden adjoining the walls thereof having been built at the expense of mr hermon who has been a capital friend to the church in the garden there is a quantity of handsome rockery purchased by the late mr james carr who was at one time a warden out of the church funds this rockery was originally placed in the church yard along with that still remaining there but it was thought by somebody that the yard didnt require so much ornamental stone so a quantity of it was removed to the place mentioned if mr shepperd has it set in a circle he may play the druid amongst it reserving the biggest block for a cromlech and the smoothest for a seat if it is concentrated in one mass he may stand upon it defy all the exchurchwardens and quoting scott cry out come one come all this rock shall fly c originally st thomass cost a considerable amount of money and in consequence of improvements subsequently made there is still it is said a pretty round sum due to the late wardens and the contractors and they are much in the dark as to when they will get it the parson cant see the force of paying it himself the officers of the church make no move in the matter the congregation is apathetic on the subject the beadle keeps quiet and does his central church walk calmly never thinking of it but if owing somebody should settle the bill and the sooner it is liquidated the more respectable will the affairs of the church become bother without end has prevailed at st thomass about money and until people get their own and see regular annual statements of accountsthings which seem to be scarce in these timesthey will continue to be uneasy and probably noisy associated with the church are superior schoolsone for infants in the unchristened street near the church and two others for boys and girls in lancasterroad the average day attendance isboys 250 girls 220 infants 240 the average attendance on the sunday is boys 250 girls 320 the day schools are in a good state of efficiency and are of great service to the district they are well managed and with respect to some of their departments government reports speak most encouragingly worn old grievances with ex churchwardens are duly squared when a greater amount of what is called fixity of tenure exists in respect to the officials and when mr sheppard drops his little dogma as to personal immaculacy and allows other people a trifle more freedom his flock will be fatter woollier and quieter than ever they have been since he came croftstreet wesleyans and parkerstreet united methodists in 1827 a little school was opened in a building at the corner of gildowstreet abutting upon marshlane in this town it was established in the wesleyan methodist interest and one of its chief supporters was mr t c hincksman a gentleman still living who has for a long period been a warm friend of the general cause of methodism although begun tentatively the school soon progressed in time there was a good attendance at it ultimately it was considered too small and the result was a removal to more convenient premisesto a room connected with the mill of the late mr john furness in marklandstreet but the little old building did not change so much in its character after being deserted by the wesleyan scholars it was still retained for juvenile purposes still kept open for the edification if not improvement of youngsters oldfashioned sweets were sold in it and the place was long known as granny birds toffy shop at the mill in markland street which used to be called noggy tow the school was very prosperous but the accomodation here at length became defective and in 1832 the scholars retraced their steps to gildowstreetnot to the small toffy establishment where sucklings if not babes were cared for but to a building at the opposite end of the thoroughfare erected specially for them in 1840 they withdrew from this edifice and went to a new school made in croftstreet the foundation stone of which was laid by the rev john bedford a well known wesleyan minister who at that time was stationed in preston in 1858 two wings for class and other purposes principally promoted by the late mr t meek costing 700 pounds and opened clear of debt were attached to the school and twelve months agoscholastic business still proceedingthe central portion of it was set apart for regular religious services on the sabbath the building is large goodlooking and wellproportioned there is nothing of an ecclesiastical complexion about either its external or internal architecture substantially it is a school utilised twice every sunday for devotional purposes the floor of it is well cared for and ought to enjoy much fresh air for there are 18 ventilators grate shaped in front of it when that which formed the nucleus of the school was started the neighbourhood was open there was a suburban look about the locality but entire rows of new dwellings now surround the school the part in which it stands is densely populated all grades of men women and children inhabit it civilisationrags impudence dirt and sharpness for they mean civilisationhas long prevailed in the immediate neighbourhood a fine new brewery almost shakes hands with the building on one side the sailors home beershop stands sentry two doors off on the other what more could you desire a large industrious population lots of crying stonethrowing children a goodlooking brewery a busy beershop a school and a chapel all closely mixed up are surely sufficient for the most ardent lover of variety and progress the room wherein the wesleyans associated with croftstreet school meet for religious duties is square heavy looking dull and hazy in its atmosphere it is ventilated by curious pieces of iron which work curvilinearly up huge apertures covered with glass its walls are ornamented with maps painted texts natural history pictures c and at the eastern side there is a small orthodox article for pulpit purposes there are several ways into the roomby the back way if you climb walls by the direct front if you ascend steps by the sides of the front if you move through rooms pass round doorways and glide past glass screens we took the last route and sat down near a young gentleman with a strong bass voice in a corner near there was a roseatefeatured elderly man who enjoyed the service at intervals and slept out what he could not fathom close to him was a youth who did the very same thing and in front there were three females who followed the like example the service was plain simple sincere and quite methodistical it was earnestly participated in by a numerous congregation the responses were quiet and somewhat internal an easy respectable seriousness prevailed nothing approaching either cant or wildfire was manifested workingclass people preponderated in the place as they always do the singing was clear and plain odd lines coming in for a share of melodious quavering and the sermon was well gotup and eloquent the rev c f hame who has recently come to preston in the place of the rev w h tindall lunestreet circuit was the preacher on this occasion he is a little gentleman with considerable penetration and power has a good theological faculty is cool genial and lucid in language and although he can shout a little when very warm he never loses either the thread of his argument or his personal equilibrium there are 120 members at this place of worship the average attendance at the different services is 250 and the number is gradually increasing regular ministers and local preachers fill the pulpit in turns there being as a rule one of the former at either the morning or evening service every sunday sometimes both kinds may be present and ready for action at the same moment but they never quarrel as to which shall preachnever get up a tree figuratively speaking and everything is arranged quietly the school wherein the services we have referred to are held has been one of the most useful in preston more scholars have probably passed through it than through any other similar place in the town old scholarsmen and women nowwho received their religious education here are in all parts and there is not a quarter of the globe where some may not be found who have a pleasant recollection of the school its average day attendance is 240 its average sunday morning attendance 275 whilst on a sunday afternoon the regular number is 425 the school which is conveniently arranged and well fit up with every sort of ordinary educational contrivance is in a satisfactory state and in conjunction with the chapel which it makes provision for is doing an excellent work in the district which is open to all comers and will stand much drilling and spiritual flogging ere it reaches perfection over the hills and far awayup the brow of maudlands down new streets on the other side under the canal up another brow through narrow angular roads flanked with factories by the edge of a wild piece of land supplying accomodation for ancient horses brick makers pitch and toss youths and pigeon flyers and then turning suddenly at a mysterious corner in the direction of mill gates you reach parkerstreet united methodist free church externally this church is a very simple prosaic building viewed from the front it looks like the second storey bedroom of a cottage eyed from the side it seems like a long office four yards from the ground with a pair of roundheaded folding doors below and at the extreme end a narrow aperture which apparently leads round the corner it was built 12 or 13 years ago for a school by messrs j and j haslam near whose mill it is situated and it is still used for educational purposes during the latter end of 1858 and the beginning of 1859 there was a dispute amongst the united free church brethren assembling in orchard chapel both men and women entered into the disturbance freely but they did not follow the plan lately adopted by some united methodist christians living at batley who having a grievance at their chapel fought it out in the back yard what they did after many a lively church meeting was to appeal to the authorities of the denomination state their case quietly and abide the decision of their superiors that decision sanctioned a separation and the establishment in preston of a second united methodist circuit totally independent of the orchardstreet people but responsible to the general executive for its actions those forming the new circuit in prestonabout twenty membershad not however a chapel so messrs haslam who sympathised with the movement permitted them to meet in the school they had built in parkerstreet the course pursued by the secessionists was approved of by some united methodists at cuerden green where the orchard brethren had a small chapel and they left the parent body when the separation already mentioned took place there was a fair amount of goodly squabbling about the cuerden green chapel each side wanted it for a time the secessionists held it then the owner of the building died and after various movements the orchard brethren went in and won and they have retained possession of the premises ever since the second circuit includes no country place except brindle where the denomination has a good chapel the full members of the circuit number about 90 and 75 of them are in preston there are 25 on trial at the present moment but as we cannot tell how they will pass through the alembic it would be out of place to make any absolute statement as to their fate the circuit is increasing in strength its finances notwithstanding bad times are in a very fair state a good feeling exists between the members of both circuits they have become peaceable and pachydermatous thinskinnedness being considered an evil and altogether affairs are satisfactory the system under which ministers are appointed to parkerstreet chapel is the same as that prevailing amongst the general body and as we described at in a previous article no allusion need now be made to it the first parson at the chapel in parkerstreet was the rev robert eltringham since then the following have been at itthe revs j nettleton j shaw j mara who is now a missionary in china for the united methodist body w lucas c evans j w chisholm and the rev t lee the names show that there has been a new parson at the chapel almost every year the present pastor rev t lee only came in august last his predecessor mr chisholm who is a sharp shrewd liberalminded gentleman having been removed to manchester not long ago after struggling through many faraway streets we found ourselves at the corner of a little opening at the top of parkerstreet this is the place said a friend who was with us we knew it was for several yards before reaching the building the torrents of a strong voice came impetuously through an open window and the burthen of its strains had reference to a revival of our connexion such a noise as this we thought ought to have aroused the whole neighbourhood but we could see nobody about except a woman right opposite who was engaged in the serious business of front step washing and who seemed to take no notice whatever of the strong utterances coming through the window she washed on and the good man above prayed on it was rather difficult to find the way to the chapel it could not we fancied be by the front door of a shop which we saw beneath it could not we were certain be through a window above for whilst there was a pulley roller in front of it there was neither rope nor block visible for regular lifting purposes neither we thought could it be through a large double door at the side for that was bolted and seemed to have been made for something taller and broader than the human form after sauntering about the grand rush of words through the window still continuing in the interests of our connexion we moved towards a corner at the far end of the side opening passed up twelve narrow steps rushed past a charity box seventeen hats and caps and a small umbrella stand and then sat down we were surprised at the cleanness and neatness of the building and at the large number of people within it rumour had conveyed to us a notion that about three persons visited this chapel but we found between 100 and 200all welldressed orderly and pleasantin attendance we also noticed a policeman amongst the company he was present not to keep the peace but to get some good for heaven knows that policemen need much of the article and that they have very little sunday time to find it in the policeman behaved himself very well during the whole service the building will accommodate about 200 persons and the average attendance at the sunday services is 120 three or four middleclass persons several goodlooking young women a number of men including the policeman a wedding party and a numerous gathering of children made up the congregation we saw the service was simple and heartily joined in the singing supported by a small harmonium went off well and the minister preached a fair sermon but he is far too excitable to last out long the speed he goes at would kill a man directly if he were made of castiron mr lee the preacher is a ten times breezier man than his vivacious namesake at the parish church he is small like him dark complexioned like him wears spectacles like him but he travels at the rate of 1000 miles an hour and his namesake has never yet got beyond 500 the gentleman under review is a preeminently earnest man we never saw any minister throw himself head arms shoes and shirt so intensely into the business of praying and preaching as he nothing seems to impede his progress he rushes into space with terrible vehemence prays until the veins on his forehead swell and throb as if they would burst and when he sits down he pants as if he had been running himself to death in a dream whilst sweat pours off him as if he had been trying to burn up the sun at the equator in his preaching he is equally intense and earnest he puts on the steam at once drives forward at limited mail speed stops instantly then rushes onto the next stationsteam up instantly stops again in a moment without whistling is at full speed forthwith everybody holding on to their seats whilst the regulator is open and in this way he continues getting safely to the end at last but driving at such a frightfully rapid speed that travellers wonder how it is everything has not been smashed to atoms in readiness for coroners and juries and newspaper reporters as to his sincerity there cannot be a question he is not profound but is very honest he has nothing strongly ratiocinative in him but he has for ever of earnestness in his compositionindeed he burns himself up in a great blaze of zeal and blows himself to pieces in a selfgenerated whirlwind if he were quieter he would be more persuasive and if he expended less of his vital energy in trying to brew forty storms in one tea pot he would live longer easy does it is a phrase plucked from the plebeian lexicon of life which we recommend for his consideration if he doesnt attend to it we shall have a case of spontaneous combustion to record and we want to avoid that if possible there is not a more sincere man not a man more anxious to do good in preston than mr lee only he piles ossa upon olympus too stiffly and that was a job which the gods couldnt manage properly the building where the parkerstreet brethren meet is used for school purposes regularlybarring the periods when worship is being conducted in it on week days about 100 scholars attend it and on sundays about 150 the school and the chapel have done much good in the locality and we wish both prosperity whatever maybe the character of the building and however difficult it may be for strangers to get to it those living in the neighbourhood know its whereabouts many having derived improvement from it and if more went to it pigeonflying gambling sunday rat hunting tossing drinking and paganism generallythings which have long flourished in its localitywould be nearer a finish grimshawstreet independent chapel long before twothirds of the people now living were born there was a rather curious difficulty at the unitarian chapel in this town in 1807 the rev w manning walker who at that time had been minister of the chapel for five years changed his mind became more evangelical could not agree with the doctrines he had previously preached got into water somewhat warm with the members and left the place he took with him a few sympathisers and through their instrumentality a new chapel was built for him in grimshawstreet and opened on the 12th of april 1808 it was a small edifice would accommodate about 850 persons and was the original ancestor of the independent chapel in that street in 1817 the building was enlarged so as to accommodate between 500 and 600 and mr walker laboured regularly at it till 1822 when declining health necessitated his retirement the rev thomas mcconnell a gentleman with a smart polemical tongue succeeded him mr mcconnell drew large congregations and for a time was a burning and a shining light but in 1825 be withdrew became an infidel or something of the sort and subsequently gave lectures on theological subjects much to the regret of his friends and the horror of the orthodox on the 23rd of july 1826 the rev r slate began duty as regular minister of the chapel and remained at his post until april 7th 1861 when through old age and growing infirmity he resigned mr slate was a tiny careful smoothlyearnest man consistent and faithful as a minister made more for quiet sincere work than dashing labour or dazzling performance fond of the puritan divines a believer in old manuscripts disposed to tell his audiences every time he got upon a platform how long he had been in the ministry but in the aggregate well and deservedly respected no clergyman in preston has ever stayed so long at one place as mr slate and grimshawstreet chapel since it lost him has many a time had a slate off in more respects than one after mr slate retired from his post at grimshawstreet chapel the rev j briggs a young and vociferous gentleman fresh from college given to sunday evening lecturing corn exchange serenading virtuous speechmaking and otherwe were going to say evilslabours of love appeared upon the stage soon after he arrived a new black gown was presented to him and if one of the local papers which recorded the event at the time tells the truth he had it donned in the vestry after which there was a procession round the church mr briggs leading the way whilst the deacons including some mythological mr clinkscalesthat was the name givenand others brought up the rear if the towns beadle and macebearer had been present the procession would have been complete in october 1866 mr briggs retired with the gown and he has since like brother clapham formerly minister of lancaster road independent chapelpar nobile fratrumgone over to mother church on the 20th of january 1867 the rev evan lewis became minister of grimshawstreet chapel but after staying about a year and a half he on account of ill health resigned went south and died there mr lewis was a cautious cultured person had very many letters which were always coming in a row to the surface after his name was a man of ripe and polished intellect was clever in brain work had good strategic skill could manage an illnatured church meeting well and would have been a power in his own denomination and in the town if he had been physically stronger he was an invalided intellectualist well up in everything but defective in stamina muscle force and lung strength for about nine months after the retirement of mr lewis no fixed minister occupied the pulpit sunday supplies were tried in the meantime finally the rev g f newman was selected and about two months ago he commenced his ministerial labours the building as enlarged in 1817 remained without molestation for years but in 1850 it was thought that a better place was needed in 1856 it was decided to have a better place soon afterwards the old edifice was pulled down and in 1859 the congregational chapel we now see was opened it stands upon the original site but is extended nearer the street than its predecessor there used to be a considerable portion of the graveyard in front but owing to the enlarged character of the new chapel it was mainly covered over built upon and only a remnant of the old burial ground can now be seen in this quarter two small upright tombstones immediately adjoining the chapel and a few flat slabs on the ground below are the only sepulchural indications remaining here on the southern side of the building there is a dull and dreary square piece of ground railed round which constituted a portion of the old burial yard and which now contains a few forsakenlooking tombstones the new church cost between 3000 and 4000 pounds and it is not entirely finished yet at the front it has a onesided irregular look and this is owing to the noncompletion of a collateral spire in the original design the facade consists of a central elevation with two flanking towers and spires but one of the towers whilst being constructed gave way got seriously out of the perpendicular and it was decided to pull it down rather than allow the stonework to fall of its own accord new foundations ten feet deep had to be sunk into the old front burial ground for it and during the excavations 33 coffins were taken up and conveyed to a more peaceable place of sepulture they literally couldnt stand the pressure of the tower and for their sake as well as the safety of the building a change was necessary afterwards the tower was raised to its former elevation but it is still without a spire the reerection of the tower coat 380 pounds which was raised by a weekly offertory the chapel barring the incomplete masonry mentioned is a well made neatlooking building in front there is a large fourlight window which had to be taken right out when the tower was being re made on each side there is a long and very narrow window more for ornament than use and below there are two small triangular apertures of a similar character strong rails intended to prevent people from approaching the building too closely on weekdays surround the chapel there are three arched doorways immediately adjoining one another at the front and on a sunday you are at perfect liberty to use any of themto try all of them if so disposedand pass through that which appears most agreeable the chapel has a large and remarkably clean interior it is well lighted with numerous windows bordered with coloured glass and has a fine arched roof supported by four principals and filledin centrally with elaborate designs around the building there is a large octagonal gallery and whilst all the seats in it run up to a pretty fair height those at the western end approach quite an aerial altitude it is almost a question of being up in a balloon boys when you are perched in the loftiest of them all the pews are plain strong and without doors the central ones on the groundfloor are very uniform in design those at the sides are of various shapes and are whimsically disposedseem to be up and down straight diagonal and semicircular the first pew on the right side was occupied when we last saw it with three brushes an elderly shovel and two gasmeters one of them being a very fullgrown fatherly affaira sort of deacon amongst ordinary meters and looking very authoritatively upon its smaller colleague and the brushes the pulpit at the eastern end of the chapel is neatly made but when the parson sits in it you cant see him from the front when we went the other sunday evening we could see no one in it but after a hymn had been sung a spring seemed to be touched and up jumped the parson who had been reclining on his dorsal vertebra for eight minutes at the rear the pulpit formerly stood about a footandahalf higher than it does now mr slate who was a little man would have it a good height but a hole was afterwards made in the platform supporting the pulpit and it was dropped through it to the level of the ordinary floor where it now stands six chairs in gothic design with cushions of rich velvet are placed upon the platform near the pulpit in the centre there is a more patriarchallooking seata sort of pastoral throne and in the front of the whole there is a strong table the deacons and the minister sit here periodically feeling grand and furzy all over weighing up the universe on special occasions but endeavouring always to discharge their executive duties with due propriety and gravity we have seen them once or twice on this platformon those silk velvetbottomed chairs resting upon brussels carpetand they looked majestic one old gentleman we know who used to be a deacon here never would sit in any of these chairs he seemed to have either a dread of the eighteeninch elevation they conferred or a fear that the platform would give way or a dislike of the conspicuousness caused by it and on all occasions when his official brethren took possession of the chairs he sat upon an open bench adjoining an ancientlooking organ of gothic pattern and formerly used in a blackburn chapel is placed within an archway in the eastern gallery it is a moderately fair instrument and is decently played but it is not good enough for the place and it is quite time to sell it to some other chapel and get a better the choir contains about the usual complement of smiling young men and maidens with a central gentleman bearded like the pard who sits in state in an elaborately backed chair and conducts the proceedings with legitimate authority the singing of the choir is pretty exact and melodious but it is too weakneeds more harmonic energy and general strength the congregation do their duty mildly in the singing portion of the proceedings and at times when some good old tune is started they rush to the rescue with much dexterity and thoracic power there are about 200 members of the church at this place of worship and several young people are now we believe ready for admission the average congregation will be about 300 not a large number considering the size of the building but then through ministerial changes c the place has had much to contend with and it has not had a chance for some time of getting into proper working order peacefulness prevails now at the chapel prior to the advent of the late mr lewis there were many storms at the place the parson never got to literal fighting with any of the members the members never threatened to hit him but one or more of them have been heard to say that they would put him behind the fire in the vestry and he in turn has been heard to remark that he would return the compliment but all this sort of christian courtesy has disappearedlet us hope forever and the members now nestle in their seats lovingly casting calm glances at each other betimes and attending duly to the parson who eyes them placidly and encourages their affection if they had to nestle upon each others bosoms during the intervalsproperly and without falling asleep over the jobhe would not grow sullen and angry on sundays there are a couple of servicesmorning and eveningat the chapel and every wednesday evening there is a prayer meeting but it is not a very savage gathering men and women seldom lash themselves into a foam at it and nothing is uttered during its proceedings out of the ordinary run of queens english the rev g f newman a south of england gentleman who during the past seven or eight years through delicate health has spent much of his time in france is the minister he has an income independent of his clerical stipend from grimshawstreet chapel he gets about 3 pounds per week it is derived from pew rents which range from 1s to 2s 11d per seat per quarter so that its increase will depend upon the manner he fills the place mr newman is about 34 years of age is of middle stature has nothing physically ponderous or irrelevant about him is a dark complexioned moderatelysized person of gentlemanly taste deportment and expression knows mannersthey order this matter better in france as sterne would say his commingling with our lively neighbours has evidently given him the direct cue to them has a temperament of the nervousbilious order is more perceptive than reflective but has a calm clear intellect notwithstanding is rather fond of the sublime and likes a strong dash of the beautiful believes in good music and understands notes a little himself is an excellent readerone of the best we have heard is an average preacher has nothing flashy or terrific in his style but goes on quietly tastefully and with precision cares more for short than long sermons repeats himself rather often likes to give his own experience during illustrations talks much of france and never forgets to let his hearers know that he has been there takes long careful pauses in his sermons as if he were elaborating his conceptions or selecting the exact words in which to convey them most definitely has a special regard for the gas pendant on the left side of the pulpit which he handles affectionately as a rest dislikes being interrupted when either reading or praying or preaching cant stand coughing doesnt like a preston coughit has a halfharsh halfoily sound which he could detect if in london or paris believes more in faith than good works but respects both is scrupulous as to punctuality and is almost inclined to emulate the incumbent of christ church who once threatened to lock the doors of that building at a certain time after business commenced if all were not in their places particularly objects to a lady coming late because as a rule she makes a great noise with her dress on entering a place of worship and in addition induces all the other ladies present to turn round or look on one side for the purpose of seeing what she is wearing is more of a conversationalist than a speaker likes chit chat would be at home in a conversazione or al fresco tea party where the attendants walk about gossip merrily and whilst holding a tea cup in one hand poise with two fingers a piece of delicately buttered toast in the othera continental style quite aesthetic and refined in comparison with our feeding and gormandising and sweating exhibitions mr newman promises to be a good minister his commencement has been satisfactory and his prospects are encouraging he is a bachelor and seems mildly happy but his bliss might be consummatedlet no lady prick her ears too highly for mr newman has cautiousness largely developedif he would study and practically carry out that notion expressed at a meeting over which he recently presided the lecturer on that occasion saying that marriage is essential to the true happiness of man the young men at grimshawstreet are pretty intelligent and controversial they have a mutual improvement class which is one of the best of its kind in the town and they discuss the laws of lifemental physical political and spirituallike embryonic philosophers bent upon rectifying all creation their class is prosperous and is calculated if correctly managed to be of much importance to those visiting it all such classes ought to encouraged and we hope the grimshawstreet essayists will go on rectifying creationnever forgetting themselves at the same time for a long period there has been a sunday school in connection with the chapel several years in the earlier stages of the denominations career the scholars were taught in the vestry and in pews at the chapel but in 1836 a school was erected for them upon a plot of land adjoining and in 1846 it was enlarged to its present size the average sunday attendance is about 300 in january 1868 a day school for boys girls and infants was opened in the same building under the conductorship of mr j greenhalgh so far it has been very successful its average attendance is about 190 government reports speak very hopefully of the place more prizes have been awarded to it by the science and art department south kensington than to any other school in the town and its present status indicates a prosperous future an unsectarian night school is also held in the building and its average attendance is about 120 in addition there is a band of hope society at the place and it is better attended than any other similar association in preston all that grimshawstreet chapel wants is a fuller congregation that would develope every department of it and energy combined with continuity of service would secure this mr newman who understands french must adopt as his motto and have it embossed on the buttons of his own and his deacons coats and on the backs of the seven chairs they use in the chapel the words boutez en avant st pauls church there are nearly 13000 people in the district of this church what a difference time makes at the beginning of the present century the greater portion of the district was made up of fields whilst lanes with hedges set each side constituted what are now some of its busiest streets volunteers and militiamen used to meet for drill on a large piece of land in the very heart of the locality troops of charwomen formerly washed their clothes in water pits hard by and dried them on the greensward adjoining and everything about wore a rural and primitive aspect st pauls church is situated on a portion of land which 50 years ago was fringed with trees and called the park and this accounts for the name still given by many to the sacred edificenamely park church the sisters of the late j bairstow esq kept a school at one time on or contiguous to this park a road starting opposite the holy lamb in churchstreet and ending near the top of high street formerly passed through the park years ago a ducking or cucking stool was placed at the northern side of it adjoining a pit and at the edge of the thoroughfare known as meadow street this ducking stool was intended for the special benefit of vixens and scolding wives it consisted of a strong plank at the end of which was a chair the centre working upon a pivot and after the person to be punished had been duly secured she was ducked into the water if this system were now in force it would often be patronised for there are many lively termagants in the land and lots in preston the first stone of st pauls church was laid on tuesday 21st october 1823 out of the million pounds granted by parliament for the erection of churches some time prior to the date given preston through dr lawe who was then bishop of chester got 12500 pounds it was originally intended to expend this sum in the erection of one churchst peters but at the request of the rev r carus wilson vicar of preston the money was divided one half going to st peters and the other to st pauls some people might consider this like robbing peter to pay paul but it was better to halve the money for the benefit of two districts than give all of it for the spiritual edification of one and leave the other destitute the land forming the site of st pauls was given by samuel pole shawe esq the full cost of the building was about 6500 pounds around the edifice there is a very large ironrailed grave yard which is kept in pretty good order st pauls is built entirely of stone in the early english style of architecture it has a rather elegant appearance but it is defective in altitude has a broad flat and somewhat baldlooking roof and needs either a good tower or spire to relieve and dignify it in front there are several pointed windows a small circular hole above for birds nests two doorways with a window between them a central surmounting gable and a couple of featheryheaded perforated turrets one being used as a chimney and the other as a belfry there is only a single bell at the church and it is pulled industriously on sundays by a devoted youth who takes his stand in a boxedoff corner behind one of the doors at the opposite end of the church there are two turrets corresponding in height and form with those is front two screens of red cloth are fixed just within the entrance and whilst giving a certain degree of selectness to the place they prevent people sitting near them from being blown away or starved to death on very windy days when the doors happen to be open the interior consists of a broad ornamentally roofed nave resting upon twelve high narrow pillars of stone and two aisles the pillars seriously obstruct the vision of those sitting at the sides indeed in some places so detrimental are they that you can see neither the readingdesk nor the pulpit above there is a very large gallery set apart on the west for the organ and choir and on each side for general worshippers school children as a rule being in front and requiring a good deal of watching during the services in some parts of the gallery seeing is quite as difficult as in the sides beneath owing to the intervening nave pillars efforts have been made to rectify this evil not by trying to pull down the pillars but by removing the pulpit c so that all might have a glance at it the pulpit is situated on the southeastern side near the chancel and one sunday it was brought into the centre of the church but it could be seen no better there than in its old position so it was carried back and has remained unmolested ever since if it were put upon castors and pushed slowly and with becoming reverence up and down the church during sermon time all would get a view of its occupant but we believe the warders have an objection to pulpits on castors so that there is no hope in this respect the readingdesk stands opposite the pulpit and looks very broad and diminutive the chancel is plain a large neatly designed stained glass window occupies the end on each side there is a mural monumentone being to the memory of samuel horrocks esq guild mayor in 1842 and son of s horrocks esq of larkhill who for twentytwo years represented preston in parliament and the other raised by public subscription to the memory of the rev joseph rigg who was minister of st pauls for nineteen years and who died in 1847 the general fittings and arrangements of the church indicate plainness of design combined with medium strength and thorough respectability in no part of the building is there any eccentric flourishing or artistic meandering the roof the walls and the base of the window niches which have become blackened with rain need cleaning up and some day when money is plentiful they will no doubt be renovated the seats are strong broad and regular in shape all of them except one are let and it would speedily be tenanted if more conveniently located there is a pillar in it and in order to get a proper view of the officiating minister you must stand up lean forward and glance with a rolling eye round the corners of the obstructiona thing which many of the more bashful of our species would not like to do the church will accommodate about 1200 persons and the average sunday attendance may be calculated at 800 the gallery is patronised extensively by the million the ground floor pews are occupied by more select and fashionable individuals the great majority of the worshippers sit above and few vacant spaces can as a rule be seen there down stairs the crush is less severe the congregation is a mixture of working and middle class people the former kind being preponderant at the sides there are long narrow ranges of free seats but they are not often disturbed on two successive sundays we gave them a passing look and they appeared to be almost deserted a couple of little boys seated in the centre and engaged in the pleasing juvenile business of swinging their legs were the only occupants we saw on the right side during our first inspection and when we viewed the range on the other side the sunday after we could only catch tender glimpses of three females all very quiet and each belonging the antique school of life where will you sit said a largehearted young man when we made our second appearance there was our reply pointing at the same time to a wellcushioned and genially sequestered seat at the northwest corner and we were ushered into it with becoming decorum in two minutes afterwards five women and a festive infant dressed in a drab cloak and muffled all over to keep the cold out stopped at the pew door we stepped out three of the females with the baby stepped in the remainder went into the next pew and after condensing our nerve power we settled down in the corner from which we had been disturbed quietly lifting one hand over the door and latching it firmly at the same moment our idea being than an environment of five females with a baby thrown into the bargain was quite enough for the remainder of the morning after an inquiry as to the christening arrangements at the church for we fancied this was a christening gathering we got nearer the baby and in a delicately sympathetic whisper saidhow old is it the maiden who was holding it blushed and laconically breathed out the words three months we subsequently found out that the seat we were in was the incumbents and that the blessed baby whose lot we had been contemplating with such interest was his too six minutes before the commencement there were only nine persons in the body of the church but nearly 300 were congregated there when the service began whilst the gallery was well filled with worshippers of all ages and sizes all the responses here are congregationalnone of them being in any way intoned we believe that st pauls is the only protestant church in preston wherein this system is observed the effect when compared with the plans of intonation now so universal is very singular and it sometimes sounds dull and monotonouslike a long low rumbling of irregular voices as if there were some quaint oddlyhumoured contention going on in every pew but the worshippers seem to like the system and as they have a perfect right to be their own judges other people must be silent on the subject the music is not of an extraordinary sort it is plain and very well joined in by the congregation but the choir like many others lacks weight and symphony mrs myres the wife of the incumbent is a member of the choir and if all the other individuals in it had her musical knowledge an improvement would soon follow the organ is a very good one it was given by the late t miller esq and h miller esq and placed in the church in 1844 recently it has been put in firstrate condition for organs like the players of them get worse for wear by t h and w p miller esqrs the organist knows his work and is able to perform it with ability at st pauls there is morning and evening service on a sunday and every wednesday evening there is a short service but like the bulk of midweek devotional exercises it is not much cared for only about 150 joining it on the average on the second sunday in each month there is an early sacrament at st pauls at no other place of worship in the town that we know of save christ church is there a similar sacramental arrangement since st pauls was opened there have been five incumbents at it the first was the rev mr russell then came the rev j rigg who was a most exemplary clergyman next the rev s f page who was followed by the rev j miller the present incumbent being the rev w m myres son of mr j j myres of preston mr myres came to st pauls at the beginning of 1867 and when he made his appearance fidgetty and orthodox souls were in a state of mingled dudgeon and trepidation as to what be would do it was fancied that he was a ritualistfond of floral devices and huge candles with an incipient itching for variegated millinery beads and crosses but his opponents who numbered nearly twothirds of the congregation screamed before they were bitten and went into solemn paroxysms of pious frothiness for nothing subsequent events have proved how highly imaginative their views were no church in the country has less of ritualism in it than st pauls its services are pre eminently plain all those parts whereon the spirit of innovation has settled so strongly in several churches during the past few years are kept in their original simplicity and in the general proceedings nothing can be observed calculated to disturb the peace of the most fastidious of showdisliking churchmen mr myres is about 30 years of age is corporeally condensed walks as if he were in earnest and wanted to catch the train has a mild obliging halfdiffident look wears a light coloured beard and moustache each of which is blossoming very nicely is sharp yet eventempered bland and genial yet sincere has keen powers of observation has a better descriptive than logical faculty is not very imaginative cares more for prose than poetry more for facts than sallies of the fancy more for gentle devotion and quiet persevering labour in his own locality than for virtuous welterings and sacred acrobatism in other districts he has endeavoured since coming to preston to mind his own business and parsons often find that a hard thing to accomplish polished in education he is humble and social in manner he will never be an ecclesiastical showman for his disposition is in the direction of general quietude and good neighbourship if he ever gets into a sacred disturbance the fault will be through somebody else dragging him into it and not because he has courted it by natural choice he is more cut out for sincere labour pleasantly and strenuously conducted than for intellectual generalship or lofty theological display his brain may lack high range and large creativeness but he possesses qualities of heart and spirit which mere brilliance cannot secure and which simple cerebral strength can never impart we admire him for his courteousness his artless simplicity of nature his earnest kindlydevotedness to duty and his continual attention to everything affecting the welfare of those he has to look after mr myres is greatly respected by all in his district he has transmuted the olden ritualistic horror which prevailed in the district into one of love and reverence and all his sheep have a genial and affectionate bleat for him the rev c g acworth a learned young man whose facial capillary forces are coming gradually into play and who seems to have the entire book of common prayer off by heart is the curate of st pauls he is a good reader a steady sententious epigrammatic preacher and with a little more knowledge of the world ought to make a clever and most useful minister something which we do not think exists in connection with any other preston church for the management of affairs is established here it is a church committee it consists of the ministers the churchwardens and a dozen members of the congregation they discuss all sorts of matters appertaining to the district smooth down grievances when any are nursed and keep everything in good working order the outside machinery for mentally and religiously improving the district is very extensive and varied there are five day and sunday schools under the auspices of st pauls they are situated in pole and carlisle streets and are under the guidance of four superintendents and fiftyseven teachers mrs myres wife of the incumbent who is a great favourite throughout the district is one of the teachers the day or national schools are the largest in the town they have an average attendance of 934 and that in which boys are taught is the only one of its kind in preston which is selfsupporting the average attendance of sunday scholars is 800 night schools also form part of the educational programme and they are well attended a mutual improvement classthe oldest in the townlikewise exists in connection with st pauls it was established by the rev s f page and is conducted on principles well calculated to regulate illumine and edify the youths who mar and make empires at it a temperance society in which the rev mr acworth who is a bright water for me believer has taken praiseworthy interest has furthermore got a footing in st pauls and beyond that there is a band of hope society in the district which does its share of work every monday afternoon a mothers meeting conducted by mrs myres mrs isherwood miss wadsworth and the bible woman is held in a room of the carlislestreet school the mothers are pretty lacteous and docile in various parts of the district cottage lectures conducted by the curate and a number of energetic teachers are held weekly the district of st pauls is great in missionary work there are about fourandtwenty collectors in the field here and by the penny a week system they raise sums which periodical efforts would never realise by the way we ought to have said that there are a good many collections in st pauls church16 regular ones and 14 on the offertory principle every year those who consider it more blessed to give than receive should be happy at st pauls the sums collected at the church range from about 12 to 50 pounds the irish church missionary society receives much of its preston support from this district lastly we may remark that there is a good staff of tract distributors supervised by a ladies committee in connection with st pauls the distributors are chiefly young women belonging the schools owing to the vastness of the district it is contemplated to erect as early as possible a school chapel as an auxiliary of the church it will be built near the railway bridge in st paulsroad r newsham esq has offered to give a handsome sum towards the edifice which is much needed when opened a second curate will be required and towards the stipend of such gentleman e hermon esq mp has offered to contribute liberally the salary of the incumbent is about 280 pounds per annum the generality of the officials connected with the church and schools have been long at their postsa proof of even action and good harmony everything seems to be progressing steadily in the district and if st paul himself had to give it a visit he would shake hands warmly with mr myres the incumbent praise mrs myres and the baby and throw up his hat gleefully at the good work which is being done amongst the people st marysstreet and marshend wesleyan chapels and the tabernacle of the revivalists when shall we three meet again we cant telldont care about knowing you have met now and keep quiet if possible whilst being vivisected there are worse companions so shake hands and sigh for universal bliss we shall use the dissecting knife with a kindly sharpness the first of the places named is situated in st marys street opposite a very high wall which we believe is intended to prevent men from scaling it and is closely associated with the arrangements of the house of correction one hundred yards off it looks like a high modernised seaside hotel fifty yards off it seems like a wellarranged gentlemans residence in the wrong place two yards off it indicates its own mission and clearly shows that something embracing both education and religion is carried on within it it is a large wellbuilt quadrangular building with two roundheaded ranges of windows in front and a good roof above surmounted with an iron rail put up apparently for imaginary purposes nobody has yet got over that rail so far as we have heard and if the job is ever attempted nothing will be found on the other side worth carrying home the foundation stone of this buildingit is really a school chapelwas laid on good friday 1866 and the place was opened in the same year the place cost 2500 pounds and it is nearly out of debt internally it is full of rooms on the ground floor there are nine apartmentsall well disposed appropriately fit up and set apart for general scholastic and class purposes on week days some of them are used as school rooms the average attendance of pupils who are carefully looked after being about 120 and on sundays they are devoted to class business in a large room above children are also taught on sundays the general attendance on those days throughout the place being about 450 this schoolchapel owes its existence to the cotton famine during that trying period when people had nothing else to do but think live on 2s a week and grow good messrs wilding and strachan generously opened a room connected with their mill in new halllane for secular and religious instruction it was attended mainly by those belonging the wesleyan persuasion in time it became too little and the result was the erection of a schoolchapel in st marysstreet we have never seen a better arranged nor a more commodious place of its kind than this its class and ordinary scholastic departments we have alluded to let us now proceed above into the room used for worship you can reach it from either the northern or the southern side but from neither can you make headway without ascending a strong winding series of steps which must be trying and troublesome to heavy and asthmatic subjects if any of that sort ever show themselves at the building the room is large lofty clean and airy and will hold about 400 persons just within each doorway there is a box intended for contributions on behalf of sick and needy scholars but both have been put too near the side they often catch peoples clothes on entering and as everybody is not disposed to stop and exercise the organ of benevolence whilst the remainder wish to be judicious about the business and save their dresses it has been decided to shift them inwards a little from the centre of the ceiling gas burners in starshaped clusters are suspended and when the taps are on they give good lights the congregation which is generally constituted of workingclass people numbers about 350 the people attending this place are a quiet devoted lot with patches of pride and selfglorification here and there about them but on the whole kindlylooking and sincere some of them are closeminded and intensely orthodox but the majority are wideawake and wont pray for fair weather until it has given over raining the members of the choir sit on the eastern side and if not so refined and punctillious in their musical performances they are at least pretty stronglunged and earnest they are located near the wall the harmoniumplayer enjoys a closer proximity to it he manipulates with fair skill has a clock right above him and ought therefore to keep good time if he doesnt then let the clock be condemned as a deceiver and incumberer of the wall the pulpit is a broad neatlyarranged affairfixed upon a platform at the southern end and environed with rails of blue and gold colour just within and on its immediate left there is a small paper nailed up with four nails and containing is written english these words as a reminder for each preacher during his supplicationspray for gods ancient people of israel does this mean the jews said we to an elderly man near us whilst we were scrutinizing with a plaintive eye the pulpit and he replied bleeve it does that we thought was a bad speculation for a chapel containing two subscription boxes for sick and needy scholars the man who wrote out that exhortation in the interests of petticoatlane men and their kindred and the patriot who drove with a fierce virtue the four nails into it didnt we are afraid know clearly how much it costs to convert a genuine jew else more caution would have been exercised by each of them a jews eye is a costly thing but a jews conversion is much more expensive you cant get at the thing fairly for less than 10000 pounds and as five good wesleyan chapels could be built in ordinary districts for that sum we advise wesleyans to go in for chapels and not for jews if the pulpit had not been a broad and accommodating one in st marysstreet chapel we should have been inclined to think that the parson might have had a walk round there is just space enough in front of the pulpit for a mediumsized gentleman to pass between it and the front rails in a moment of high dudgeon a thin preacher with a passion for action might easily flank off and traverse it frontally but an easyminded individual would find plenty of room in the pulpit and if he did not presuming he were stout he would have to crush considerably in order to accomplish a full circular route beyond and in the immediate front of the pulpit rails there is a circular seat this we fancied during our inspection was the penitent formit seemed close and handy during a season of stern excitement and warm eruption but in a moment we were told it was for sacrament people who patronise it in turns on particular sundays two services are conducted on sundays here by regular and itinerent preachers the former coming from lunestreet chapel and the latter being furnished out of the general lay body nearly every night throughout the week class meetings c are held in the building and they are conducted with much rapture and peacefulness how the jewconverting business gets on we cannot tellbadly we imagine but in respect to the ordinary operations of the place they are successful and promise to be still more so a chapel whose members branched off from this place has been established at walton about 12 months ago it was opened a cottage situated on the road side leading to the church constitutes the walhallah of methodism there and the support accorded to it is increasing we have no more to say as to the st marysstreet mission we hope it will go on and agreeably grapple with the people in its own district whatever may become of the jews a mile and a half distant on the other side of the town and quietly resting amongst the desolate premises once occupied by the preston ship building company at the marsh end there is a small preaching place wherein the scriptures are expounded and the doctrines of john wesley duly inculcated about two and a half years ago a couple of cottages in this locality were thrown into one and arranged so as to moderately accommodate those caring about religion and willing to have it in a good old methodist style there was considerable briskness of trade hereabouts at that time ships were made in the adjoining yards the bubble of speculation was being strongly blown large numbers of strongarmed men caring more for ale in gallon jugs than either virtue in tracts or piety in sermons resided in the district the population was rapidly increasing a new section of the towns suburbs was being strongly developed and there being drinking houses skittle grounds and other accompaniments of a progressive age visible it was considered prudent to mix up a small wesleyan preaching room and school with the general confraternity of institutions in the locality at the beginning of this year owing to the insufficient accomodation of the premises a portion of the pattern room of the ship building company which in the meantime had resolved its organisation into thin air and evaporated was secured and arranged in a homely fashion for the required business after passing through a small door in the centre of a large one leading to the shipyard then turning to the right then mounting 18 steep awkward steps and then turning again to the right you arrive at the place the moment we saw it we knew it it was in this very room where grand champagne luncheons used to be given after ship launches and where dancing and genteel carousing followed the last time we had business at this place we saw twentythree gentlemen alcoholically merry in it six town councillors helpless yet boisterous in it thirty couples of ladies and gentlemen dancing in it four waiters smuggling halfused bottles of champagne rapidly down their throats in it an exmayor with his hat thrown right back looking awfully jolly and superintending the proceedings in it and in an adjoining room now used for vestry purposes three ladies in silk velvet winefreighted and just able to see blowing up everybody because their bonnets were lost the place where all this fou and unco happy work was transacted is now the school chapel of the wesleyans the room wherein the congregation meet is bare plain and primitivelooking with an open roof whitewashed all round and boarded off from a workshop at the southern end its furniture consists of eleven forms three stoves a pulpit with no back and a chair a strip of wood is placed across a window at the rear of the chair which is used by the officiating parson and this wood prevents him from breaking the glass if he should happen to throw his head back sharply on one side of the room there are 19 hat hooks and on the other 24 there are seats in the place for about 100 the members number about 20 and the average congregation entirely working people and of homely orderly character will range from 80 to 100 the room is connected with the wesley circuit every sunday there are two services in it a meeting for religious purposes is held each thursday night and the preaching is done by locals and regulars the singing is neither good nor bad nor indifferent but a mixture of the whole three qualities it is accompanied by a small harmonium played by a young lady in moderately tasteful style the services are simple and hearty and whilst there may be a little plaintive noisiness now and then in thema few penitent flutteringsthey are generally and remembering the complexion of the congregation respectably conducted its a regular bird nest and youll never get to it unless you ask the neighbouring folk said a friend to us whilst talking about the revivalists tabernacle to the bottom of pittstreet we then went and seeing two or three females and a man dart out of a dim looking passage beneath one of the side arches of the railway bridge there we concluded that we were near the nest having sauntered about for a few moments and assured ourselves that this was really the place we were in search of we went to the arch walked six or seven yards forward looked up a dark tortuous narrow passage on the right and entered it in the centre of the passage there was a hole through which you could see telegraph wires and the sky on one side a grim crevice running narrowly to the top of the railway bridge and ahead a shadowy opening like the front of an underground store with a wooden partition in the centre of which was a small square of glass theseus who got through the labyrinth would have been puzzled with this mystic passage we never saw such a timeworn and dumfounding road to any place and if those who patronise it regularly had done their best to discover the essence of dinginess and intractibility they could not have hit upon a better spot than this a warm air wave similar to that you expect on entering a bakehouse met us just when we had passed the wooden partition in the centre of the room there was a stove almost redhot this apartment which was filled with small forms was we ascertained a sundayschool at the bottom end there were some narrow steps leading through a large hole into a room abovethe chapel a fat man could never get up these steps and a tall one would injure his head if he did not stoop very considerably in ascending them the chapel is about five yards wide 15 yards long very low on one side and moderately high on the other it is plain ricketty and whitewashed the side wall of the railway bridge forms one end of it on the northern side there is a door fastened up with a piece of wood in the form of a large loadstone this door leads to the top of a pigstye the chapel will hold about 70 when we visited it the congregation consisted of 35 children of a very uneasy sort 11 men and five women every now and then railway goods trains kept passing and what with the whistling of the engines the shaking caused by the waggons the barking of a dog in a yard behind the grunting of a pig in a stye three yards off and the noise of the 35 children before us we had a very refreshing time of it the congregationa poor oneconsists of a remnant of the revivalists who were in preston last year and it has a kind of nominal connection with the orchard united methodists the building we have described was formerly a weaving shop or rubbish store its present tenants have occupied it about twelve months they are an earnest body seem obliging to strangers are not as fiery and wild as some of their class and might do better in the town if they had a better room they have no fixed minister the preacher we heard was a stranger he pulled off his coat just before beginning his discourse after a few introductory remarks in the course of which he said he had been troubled with stomach ache for six hours on the previous day and that just before his last visit to preston he had an attack of illness in the very same place a lengthy allusion was made to his past history he said that he had been a villain a gambler a drunkard and a sabbath breakerwe expected hearing him say as many of his class do that he had often abused his mother thrashed his wife and punished his children but he did not utter a word on the subject the remainder of his discourse was less personal and more orthodox at the close we descended the steps carefully groped our way out quietly and left wondering how ever we had got to such a place at all and how those worshipping in it could afford to sabbatically pen themselves up in such a mysterious ramshackle shanty st marys and st josephs catholic chapels in this combination the past and the present are linked into their history the elements of a vast change enter one is allied with saintly days followed by a reactive energy vigorous and crushing the other is amalgamated with an epoch of broadest thought and keenest iconoclasm both are now enjoying a toleration giving them peace and affording them ample room for the fullest progress unless it be our parish church which was originally a catholic place of worship no religious building in preston possesses historic associations so farreaching as st marys it is the oldest catholic chapel in preston directly it is associated with a period of fierce persecution relatively it touches those old times when religious houses with their quaintlytrimmed orders were in their halcyon days after the dissolution caused by henry viii it was a dangerous thing to profess catholicism and in preston as in other places those believing in it had to conduct their services privately and in outoftheway places in ribbletonlane there is an old barn still standing wherein mass used to be said at night time people living in the neighbourhood fancied for a considerable period that this place was haunted they could see a light in it periodically they couldnt account for it and they concluded that some headless woman or wandering gnome was holding a grim revel in it but the fact was a small band of catholics debarred from open worship and forced to secrete themselves during the hours of devotion were gathered there when the storm of persecution had subsided a little catholics in various parts of the country gradually though quietly got their worship into towns and ultimately we find that in preston a small thatched buildingsituated in chapelyard off friargatewas opened for the use of catholics this was in 1605 the yard no doubt took its name from the chapel which was dedicated to st mary there was wisdom in the selection of this spot and appropriateness tooit was secluded near the heart of the town and very close to the old thoroughfare whose very name was redolent of catholicity friargate is a word which conveys its own meaning an old writer calls it a fayre long and spacious street and adds upon that side of the town was formerly a large and sumptuous building belonging to the fryers minors or gray fryers but now 1682 only reserved for the reforming of vagabonds sturdy beggars and petty larcenary thieves and other people wanting good behaviour it is now the country prison and it is cald the house of correction this building was approached by friargate and was erected for the benefit of begging friars under the patronage of edward earl of lancaster son of henry iii the first occupants of it came from coventry to sow as we are told by an ancient document the seeds of the divine word amongst the people residing in the villa of preston in agmounderness in lancashire primarily it was a very fine edifice was built in the best style of gothic architecture and had accomodation for upwards of 500 monks upon its site now stands the foundry of mr stevenson adjoining lower pittstreet the catholics of preston satisfied themselves with the small building in chapelyard until 1761 when a new place of worship dedicated to st mary was erected upon part of the site of the convent of grey friars towards this chapel the duke of norfolk gave a handsome sum and presented for the altar a curious painting of the lords supper but this building did not enjoy a very prosperous career for in 1768 during a great election riot it was pulled down by an infuriated mob all the catholic registers in it were burned and the priestthe rev patrick barnewellonly saved his life by beating a rapid retreat at the rear and crossing the ribble at an old ford below frenchwood another chapel was subsequently raised upon the present site of st marys on the west side of friargate but when st wilfrids was opened in 1793 it was closed for religious purposes and transmuted into a cotton warehouse the following priests were at st marys from its opening in 1761 until its close in 1793 revs patrick barnewell joseph smith john jenison nicholas sewall joseph dunn and richard morgan the two last named gentleman lived together in a cottage on the left side of the entrance to the chapel behind which they had a fine room commanding a beautiful view of the ribble penwortham c for at that time all was open on the western side of friargate down to the river whittle speaking of father dunn says he was the father of the catholic school the house of recovery and the gasworks and adds with a plaintive bathos that on the very day he left this sublunary world he rose as was his custom very early and in the course of his rambles exchanged a sovereign for sixpences for distribution amongst the indigent in 1815 the chapel was restored but not long afterwards its roof fell in nobody however was hurt just because nobody was in the building at the time the work of reparation followed and the chapel was deemed sufficient till 1856 when it was entirely rebuilt and enlarged as it was then fashioned so it remains it is a chapel of ease for st wilfrids and is attended to a very large extent by irish people the situation of it is lofty it stands upon higher ground than any other place of worship in the town but it is so hemmed in with houses c that you can scarcely see it and if you could get a full view of it nothing very beautiful would be observed about the exterior the locality in which this chapel is placed is crowded darklooking and pretty ungodly all kinds of sinister looking alleys narrow yards dirty courts and smoky back streets surround it much drinking is done in each and a chorus of noise from lounging men in their shirt sleeves draggletailed women without bonnets and weird little youngsters given up entirely to dirt treacle and rags is constantly kept up in them the chapel has a quaint narrow awkward entrance you pass a gateway then mount a step then go on a yard or two and encounter four steps then breathe a little then get into a somewhat sombre lobby two and a half yards wide and inconveniently steep next cross a little stone gutter and finally reach a cimmerian square surrounded by high walls cracked house ends and other objects similarly interesting the front of the chapel is coldlooking and devoid of ornament upon the roof there is a square perforated belfry containing one bell it was put up a few years ago and before it got into use there was considerable newspaper discussion as to the inconvenience it would cause in the morning for having to be rung at the unearthly hour of six it was calculated that much balmy quietude would be missed through it some people can stand much sleep after six and on their account early bellringing was dreaded but the inhabitants have got used to the resonant metal and those who have time sleep on very excellently during its most active periods the chapel has a broad lofty and imposing interior but it is rather gloomy and requires a little extra light which would add materially to the general effect there is considerable decorative skill displayed in the edifice but the work looks opaque and needs brightening up the sanctuary end is rich and solemn has a finely elaborate and sacred tone and combines in its construction elegance and power at the rear and rising above the altar there is a large and somewhat imposing picture representing the taking down of our saviour from the cross it was painted by mr c g hill after a picture of carraccis in stonyhurst college and was originally placed in st wilfrids church st marys will accommodate about 1000 persons all the pews have open sides and there are none of a private character in any part of the church the poorest can have the best places at any time if they will pay for them and the richest can sit in the worst if they are inclined to be economical large congregations attend this chapel and the bulk as already intimated are of the milesian order at the rear where many of the poor choose to sit some of the truest specimens of the finest pisantry some of the choicest and most aromatic hibernians we have seen are located the old swallowtailed donnybrook fair coat the cutty kneebreeches the short pipe in the waistcoat pocket the open shirt collar the ancient family cloak with its broad shoulder lapelle the thick duncoloured shawl in which many a young patrick has been huddled up are all visible the elderly women have a peculiar fondness for large bonnets decorated in front with huge borders running all round the face like frilled nightcaps the whole of the worshippers at the lower end seem a preeminently devotional lot how they are at home we cant tell but from the moment they enter the chapel and touch the holy water stoops which somehow persist in retaining a good thick dark sediment at the bottom to the time they walk out the utmost earnestness prevails amongst them some of the poorer and more elderly persons who sit near the door are marvellous hands at dipping sacred manipulation and pious prostration like the islams they go down on all fours at certain periods and seem to relish the business which after all must be tiring remarkably well considering its general character the congregation is very orderly and we believe of a generous turn of mind the chapel is cleanly kept by an amiable old catholic who may if there is anything in a name be related to the grey friars who formerly perambulated the street he lives in and there is an air of freedom and homeliness about it which we have not noticed at several places of worship around its walls are pictures of saints they make up a fine family group and seem to have gathered from every catholic place of worship in the town to do honour to the edifice there are sundry masses every sunday in the chapel that which is the shortestheld at halfpast nine in the morningbeing as usual best patronised the scholars connected with st wilfrids attend the chapel every sunday each wednesday evening a service is also held in the chapel and it is most excellently attended although some who visit it put in a rather late appearance when we were in the chapel one wednesday evening ten persons came five minutes before the service was over and one slipped round the door side and made a descent upon the holy water fortyfive seconds before the business terminated of course it is better late than never only not much bliss follows late attendance and hardly a toothful of ecstacy can be obtained in threequarters of a minute the singing is of an average kind the choir being constituted of the school children whilst the organ which used to be in some place at accrington is only rather shaky and debilitated during the past ten years the rev thomas brindle of st wilfrids has been the officiating priest at st marys father brindle is a fylde man is about 45 years of age and is a thoroughly healthy subject he is at least 72 inches high is well built powerful straight as a die good looking keeps his teeth clean and attends most regularly to his clerical duties he is unassuming in manner blithe in company earnest in the pulpit his gesticulation is decisive his lungs are good and his vestments fit him well not a more stately yet homely looking honestfaced priest have we seen for many a day there is nothing sinister nor subtle in his visage the sad ferocity glancing out of some mens eyes is not seen in his we have not yet confessed our sins to him but we fancy he will be a kindly soul when behind the curtainwould sooner order boiled than hard peas to be put into ones shoes by way of penance would far rather recommend a fast on salmon than a feast on bacon and would generally prefer a soft woollen to a hard horse hair shirt in the moments of general mortification father brindlegive us your hand and may you long retain a kindly regard for boiled peas soft shirts and salmon they are amongst the very best things out if rightly used and we shouldnt care about agonising the flesh with them three times a week st josephs catholic church stands on the eastern side of preston and is surrounded by a rapidlydeveloping population the district has a south staffordshire lookis full of children little groceries publichouses and beershops brick kilns smoke smudge clanging hammers puddleholes dogs cats vagrant street hens unmade roads and general bewilderment when the new gasometer which looks like the skeleton of some vast colosseum is finished here an additional balminess will be given to the immediate atmosphere which may be very good for children in the hooping cough but anything except pleasant for those who have passed through that lively ordeal in 1860 a catholic school was erected in rigbystreet ribbletonlane directly afterwards divine service was held in the building which in its religious character was devoted to st joseph but either the walls of the edifice were too weak or the roof of it too strong for symptoms of giving way soon set in and the place had to be pulled down in 1866 having been rebuilt and enlarged it was reopened in the meantime religious services and scholastic training being essential and it being considered too far to go to st ignatiuss and st augustines which were the places patronised prior to the opening of st josephs mission another school with accomodation in it for divine worship was erected on a plot of land immediately adjoining nearly one half of the money required for this building which was opened in 1864 was given by protestants at the northern end of it there is a closedoff gallery used as a school for boys the remainder of the building is used for chapel purposes the exterior of the edifice is neat and substantial the interiorthat part used for worshipis clean spacious and light at the southern end there is a small but pretty altar and around the building are hung what in catholic phraseology are termed the stations there is not much ornament and only a small amount of paint in the place the chapel will hold 560 persons it is well attended and the congregations would be larger if there were more accomodation masses are said here and services held on the plan pursued at other chapels of the same denomination the halfpast nine oclock mass on a sunday morning is a treat for at it you can see a greater gathering of juvenile bazouks than at any other place in the town some of the roughestheaded lads in all creation are amongst them their hair seems to have been allowed to have its own way from infancy and it refuses to be dictated to now the congregation is a very poor one and this will be at once apparent when we state that the general income of the place the entire proceeds of it do not exceed 100 pounds a year nearly every one attending the chapel is a factory worker and the present depressed state of the cotton trade has consequently a special and a very crushing bearing upon the mission a new church is badly wanted here in no part of the town is a large place of worship so much required but nothing can be done in the matter until the times mend a plot of land has been secured for a church on the western side of the present improvised chapel and close to the house occupied by the priests in charge of the mission but until money can be found or subscribed or borrowed without interest it will have to remain as at present the first priest at st josephs was the rev r taylor then came the rev r kennedy next the rev w h bradshaw who was succeeded by the revs j walmsley and j parkinsonthe priests now at the place father walmsley the superior who originally came from brindle is a placid studiouslooking eventempered gentleman he is slender but wirey is inclined to be tall and has got on some distance with the work he is thoughtful but there is much sly humour in him he is cautious but free when aired a little he knows more than many would give him credit for whilst naturally reticent and cool he is by no means dull he is shrewd and farseeing but calm and unassuming and though evenly balanced in disposition be would manifest a crushing temper if roughly pulled by the ears his first mission was at the church of the english martyrs in this town then he went to wigan and after staying there for a time he landed at st josephs father parkinson is a native of the fylde and he has got much of the warm healthy blood of that district in his veins he has a smart gentlemanly figure has a sharp beaming rubicund face has buoyant spirits and likes a good stiff tale is full of life and has an eye in his head as sharp as a hawks has a hot tempera rather dignified irascible disposition believes in sarcasm in keen cutting hits can scold beautifully knows what he is about has a youngmanfromthecountrybutyoudontgetover me look is a hard worker a careful thinker and considers that this world as well as the next ought to be enjoyed he began his clerical career at lancaster in 1864 attended the asylum whilst at that town afterwards had charge of a workhouse at liverpool is now catholic chaplain of preston house of correction and fills up his spare time by labouring in st josephs district either the house of correction or the poor mission he is stationed at agrees with him for he has a sparkling countenance and seems to be thriving at a genial pace both father walmsley and father parkinson have been in spain they were in fact educated there both labour hard and mutually consoling each other in hours of trial tickling one another in moments of ecstacy and making matters generally agreeable the schools attached to st josephs are in a good condition they are well attended are a great boon to the district and reflect credit upon those who conduct them all the district wants is a new church and when one gets built we shall all be better off for a brighter day with full work and full wages will then have dawned st marks church not very far from the mark shall we be in saying that if this church were a little nearer it would not be quite so far off and that if it could be approached more easily people would not have so much difficulty in getting to it a right fair mark as benvolio hath it is soonest hit but you cant hit st marks very well because it is a long way out of ordinary sight is covered up in a faraway region stands upon a hill but hides itself and until very recently has entailed in its approach an expedition on one side up a breathexhausting hill and on the other through a world of puddle relieved by sundry ominous holes calculated to appal the timid and confound the brave we made two efforts to reach this church from the eastern side once in the night time during which and particularly when within 100 yards of the building we had to beat about mystically between scylla and charybdis and once at day time when the utmost care was necessary in order to avoid a mild mishap amid deep side crevices cart ruts two feet deep lime heaps and cellar excavations we shall long remember the time when after our first visit we left the church all the night had we been in a sadlysweet frame of mind listening to prayers and music and drinking in the best parts of a rather dull sermon but directly after we left a disheartening struggle amid mud ensued and all our devotional sentiment was taken right out of us an old man following us who had been manifesting much facial seriousness in the church stepped calmly but without knowing it into a pile of soft lime and the moment he got ankle deep his virtue disappeared amid a radiation of heavy english which consigned the whole road to perdition for several months this identical road spoiled the effect of numerous sunday evening sermons but it is now in a fair state of order st marks church is situated on the northwestern side of the town between wellingtonterrace and the preston and wyre railway and was opened on the 22nd of september 1863 for some time previously religious services were held on sundays in wellfieldroad school which then belonged christ church but the district being large and of an increasing disposition a new church was decided upon the late rev t clark incumbent at that time of christ church promoted its erection very considerably and when the building was opened those worshipping in wellfieldroad school which was afterwards handed over for educational purposes to st marks went to it st marks cost about 7000 poundswithout the steeple which is now being erected and will it is expected be finished about the beginning of march next it will be a considerable architectural relief to the building and will be some guide to strangers and outer barbarians who may want to patronise it either for business purposes or piety the late j bairstow esq left 1000 pounds towards the steeple which will cost about 1250 pounds in the district there are upwards of 6000 persons and not many of them are much better than they ought to be st marks is built in the cruciform style is mildly elaborate and moderately serene in outline but there is nothing very remarkable about any part of it rails run round it and on the roof there are eight boxedup angularheaded projections which may mean something but from which we have been unable to extract any special consolation at each end of the church there are doors those at the back being small and plain those in front being also diminutive but larger the principal entrance possesses some good points but it lacks capaciousness and clearnesshas a coveredup hotel doorway aspect which we dont relish it seems also to be very inconveniently situated the bulk of those attending the church come in the opposite direction and therefore if opposed to back door business which is rather suspicious at a church have to make a long roundabout march wasting their precious time and strength considerably in getting to the front the church which is fashioned externally of stone has a brick interior a feeling of snugness comes over you on entering small passages closed doors and an amplitude of curtainsthere are curtains at every door in the churchinduce a sensation of coziness but when you get within a sort of bewildering disappointment supervenes the place seems cold and unfinishedlooks as if the plasterers and painters had yet to be sent for but it has been decided to do without them the inside is complete there may be some wisdom in this style of thing but a welllined inside whether it appertains to men or churches is a matter worthy of consideration there is an uncomely fantastical plainness about the interior walls of st marks a want of tone and elegance all over them which may be very interesting to some but which the bulk of people will not be able to appreciate if they were whitewashed in even the commonest style they would look better than at present bands of cream coloured brick run round the walls and the window arches are bordered with similar material the roof is amazingly stocked with wood all dark stained as you look up at it a sense of solemn maddlement creeps over you and what such a profuse and complex display of timber can mean is a mystery which only the gods and sharp architects will be able to solve the roof is supported by ten long thin giltheaded iron pillars which relieve what would otherwise in the general aspect of the church amount to a heavy monotony of red brickwork and sombre timber on each side of the body of the church there are four neatlooking threelight windows at the western end there is a beautiful fivelight window but its effect is completely spoiled by a small pertlooking precocious organ which stands right before it at each end of the transept there are circular lights of condensed though pleasant proportions the chancel is spacious lofty and not too solemn looking the base is ornamented with illumined tablets and above there are three windows the central one bearing small painted representations of the sower and the good shepherd whilst those flanking it are plain this chancel owing to its good architectural disposition might by a little more decoration and the insertion of full stained glass windows be made very beautiful the church is an extremely draughty one and if it were not for a screen at the west end and a series of curtains at the different doors stiff necks sore throats coughs colds and other inconveniences needing much ointment and many pills would be required by the congregation just within the screen there is a massive stone font supported by polished granite pillars and surrounded at the base by a carpet upon which repose four small cushions bearing respectively on their surface a mystic injunction about thinking and thanking the church will accommodate about 1000 there are 500 free sittings in it the bulk being in the transept which is galleried and is the best and quietest place in the building and the remainder at the extreme western end all the seats are small open and pretty convenient but the backs are very low and people cant fall asleep in them comfortably the price of the chargeable sittings ranges from 8s to 10s each per year the average congregation numbers nearly 600 is constituted of working people with a seasoning of middleclass individuals is of a peaceable friendly disposition does not look black and illnatured when a stranger appears is quite gracious in the matter of seatfinding booklending and the like and is well backed up in its kindness by a roseatefeatured gentlemanmr ormandy one of the wardenswho sits in a free pew near the front door and does his best to prevent visitors from either losing themselves swooning or becoming miserable in this quarter there is also stationed another official a beadle or verger or something of the sort who is quite inclined to be obliging but he seems to have an unsettled wandering disposition is always moving about the place as if he had got mercury in him cant keep still for the life of him more than two minutes at a time and disturbs the congregation by his evolutions we dare say he tries to do his best and thinks that mobility is the criterion of efficiency but we dont care for his perpetual activity and shouldnt like to sleep with him for we are afraid he would be a dreadfully uneasy bedfellow the organ gallery appears to be a pleasant resort for a few hours gossip and smirking the musical instrument in it is diminutive rather elegant in appearance at a distance and is played with medium skill but somehow it occasionally sounds when it should not sometimes gives a gentle squeak in the middle of a prayer now and then is inclined to do a little business whilst the sermon is being preached and a lady member of the congregation has put this question to us on the subject would it sound if the organist kept his hands and feet off it and attended to the service that is rather a direct interrogation from so fair a source and lest we might give offence we will allow people to answer it for themselves in their own way after which they may if inclined communicate with the vivacious beadle and tell him to look after the organ as well as the doors c the singers in the gallery are spirited give their services like the organist gratislyone of the wardens told us soand if not preeminently musical make a very fair average ninthrate effort in the direction of melody they will mend we have no doubt eventuallymay finally get into the fastoso style in the meantime we recommend careful reading mingled with wise doses of salprunel and lococks wafers on the first sunday in every month sometimes in the morning and sometimes in the evening the sacrament is partaken of at st marks church and comparatively speaking the number of participants is considerable the business is not entirely left as in some churches to wornout old men and sacredlysnuffy old womento a miserable halfdozen of fogies nearly as ignorant of the vital virtues of the sacrament as the virginian old beldame who took it to cure the rheumatism at st marks the sacrament takers consist of all classes of people of various ages and considering the district they muster very creditably the first incumbent of st marks was the rev j w green who had very poor health and died on the 5th of october 1865 nineteen days afterwards the rev t johnson was appointed to the incumbency which he continues to retain mr johnson is apparently about 40 years of age he was first ordained as curate of st peters oldham stayed there two years and five months then was appointed curate of pontefract parish church a position he occupied for nearly two years subsequently took sole charge of a church at holcombe near bury four months afterwards came to preston as curate of the parish church remained there a considerable time then went to carnforth near lancaster stayed but a short period in that quarter and was afterwards appointed incumbent of st marks in this town although not very aged himself be lives in a house which is between 700 and 800 years old and which possesses associations running back to the roman era this is tulketh hall an ancient castellated exposed building on an eminence in ashton and facing in a direct line extending over a valley the front door of st marks church with a fair spyglass mr johnson may at any time keep an exact eye upon that door from his own front sitting room nobody can tell when the building altered considerably in modern times and now called tulketh hall was first erected some antiquaries say that a body of monks from the monastery of savigny in normandy originally built it in 1124 others state that the place was made before that time but this is certain that a number of monks from the monastery named occupied it early in the twelfth century and that they afterwards left it and went to furness abbey on the southwest of tulketh hall the remains of a fosse ditch or moat were up to recent times visible some old ruins adjoining could also be seen and it has been supposed by some persons that there was once a roman stronghold or castle here tulketh hall has been occupied by several ancient families and was once the seat of the heskeths of rossall near fleetwood the rev t johnson has lived in it for perhaps a couple of years and seems to suffer none from either its isolation or antiquity he thrives very well like the generality of parsons and will be a long liver if careful he has what a phrenological physiologist would call a vitally sanguine constitutionhas a good deal of temper excitability and determination in his character you may persuade him but he will be awkward to drive he has a somewhat tall gentlemanly elastic figure looks as if he had worn stays at some time is polished welldressed and careful respects scented soap hates the smell of raw onions is scrupulous in his toilet is sharp swellish and goodmannered rather likes platform speaking is inclined to get into a narrow groove of thought politically and theologically when crossed by opponents is eloquent when earnest talks rubbish like everybody else at times has a strong clear voice is a good preacher is moderate in his action has never even in his fiercest moments injured the pulpit has a refined rather affected and at times doubtful pronunciation gets upwards of 300 pounds a year from the church has been financially lucky in other ways has a homely class of parishioners who would like to see him at other times than on sundays is well respected on the whole and may thank his stars that fate reserved him for a parson his curatethe rev c f holtseems to be only just out of pin feather is rather afraid of hopping off the twig and needs sundry lessons in clerical flying before he will make much headway he is goodlooking but not eloquent precise in his shaving but short of fire and originality smart in features but bad in his reading has a very neat moustache but a rather mediocre mental grasp wears neat neckties and very clean shirts but often fills you with the east wind when preaching he is however a very indefatigable visitor works hard and cheerfully in the district has by his outside labours augmented the congregation and on this account deserves credit he is neither eloquent in expression nor sky scraping in thought but he labours hard amongst outside sinners and an ounce of that kind of service is often worth a ton of pulpit rhetoric and sermonising bespanglement at the schools in wellfield road the average day attendance is 310 whilst on sundays it reaches 470 the school is a good one the master is strong healthy and active and the mistress is careful antiquelooking and efficient zoar particular baptist chapel some good people are much concerned for the erection of new places of worship in our large towns labour hard for long periods in maturing plans for them and nearly exhaust their energies in securing that which is held to be the only potent agent in their constructionmoney but this is an ancient and roundabout process and may as it sometimes has done terminate in failure a stiff quarrel is about the surest and quickest thing we are acquainted with for multiplying places of worship for dissenters at any rate and probably it would be found to work with efficacy if tried amongst other bodies local experience shows that disputes in congregations invariably end in the erection of new chapels show us a body of hard fiercelyquarrelsome religious people and although neither a prophet nor the son of one we dare predict that a new place of worship will be the upshot of their contentions we know of four or five chapels in preston which here been raised on this plan and those requiring more need only keep the scheme warm it is not essential that persons anxious for new sacred edifices should expend their forces in pecuniary solicitations let them set a few congregations by the ears and the job will be done at once deucalion of thessaly was told by the oracle of themis that if he wished to renew mankind he must throw his mothers bones behind his back this was about as irreverent and illogical as telling people that if they want more religious accomodation they must commence fighting and yet whilst olden history gives some faint proof that the grecian prince was successful in stone if not in bone throwing modern experience ratifies the notion that a smart quarrel is certain to be followed by a good chapel there was a small feud in 184950 at vauxhallroad particular baptist chapel preston concerning a preacher several liked him some didnt a brisk contention followed and in the end the dissatisfied onesabout 50 in number including 29 membersfinding that they had got up a tree quietly retired they hired a place in cannonstreet which somehow has been the nursery of two or three stirring young bodies given to spiritual peculiarity here they worshipped earnestly looking out in the meantime for a plot of land in some part of the town whereon they could build a chapel and thus attend to their own business on their own premises singular to say they hit upon a site adjoining the most fashionable quarter of the townhit upon and bought the only piece of land in the belgravia of preston whereon they or anybody else could build a place of worship this was a little spot on the northeastern side of regentstreet abutting upon winckleysquare and freed from the restrictions as to church and chapel building which operated in respect to every other vacant piece of land in the same highlyspiced neighbourhood upon this land they raised a small chapel and dedicated it to zoar whether they did this because zoar means little or because it was fancied that they had escaped like lot of old from a very unsanctified place we cannot tell the chapel was opened in 1853 at a cost of 500 pounds onefifth of which apart from previous subscriptions was raised during the inaugural services as to the outward appearance of this chapel not so much can be said it is built of brick with stone facings at the front there is a gable pierced with a doorway flanked with two long narrow windows and surmounted by a small one above there is a stone tablet giving to the name of the chapel and the date of its opening on the left calmly nestling on the roof there is a sheet iron pipe and on the ground at the same side there are some good stables these stables do not belong to the chapel and never did there is no bell at the chapel but the name of mr bell who rents the stables is fixed at one side of it and in this circumstance some satisfaction may be found the chapel has a microscopical select sincere appearance has no architectural strength nor highlyfinished beauty about it is bashful clean unadorned and looks like what it isthe corneredup decorous tiny bethel of a particular people its internal arrangements are equally sedate condensed and snug a calm homeliness a quakerly simplicity runs all through it nothing glaring shining or artistically complex is visible neither fresco panellings nor chiaroscuro contrasts nor statuary groups adorn its walls if any of these things were seen the members would scream all is simple clean modest the walls slightly relieved on each side by two imitation columns are calmly coloured the ceiling containing a floriated centre piece is plainly whitewashed the gas stands have no pride in them the pulpit is small durable unpretentious there are 22 deep long narrow pews in the chapel and they will accommodate 200 persons a small and rather forlornlooking clock perches over the doorway and keeps time when going moderately well in the southwestern corner of the building there is a mural tablet in memory of the late mrs caroline walsh who gave 50 pounds towards the erection of the chapel if she had given 100 pounds probably two monuments would have been raised to her memory nearly all who visit the chapel are middleclass people the average attendance ranges from 70 to 80 there are 34 members at the place half of those who originally joined it are dead they did not die through attending the chapel but through ordinary physical ailment the congregation numerically speaking is stationary at present those attending the chapel profess the very same principles as the vauxhallroad baptists sing out of hymn books just like theirs and drink in with equal rapture the philpottian utterances of the gospel standardthe organ of the body they have four collections a year and the hat never goes round amongst them in vain their pulpit is specially reserved for men after their own heart they will admit to it neither general baptists nor methodists nor independents and however good a thing any of the preachers of these bodies might have to say they would have to burst before the zoar chapel brethren would find them rostrum accomodation for its expression all classes they fancy ought to mind their own affairs and preachers they consider should always keep to the pulpits of their own faith although touchy as to preachers they are somewhat liberal as to writers and have a great fondness for several of the works of church of england divines they esteem considerably we are informed the writings of gill romaine hawker parkes hewlett and others belonging that church there is a debt of 150 pounds upon zoar chapel and if any gentleman will give that sum to square up matters we can guarantee that good special sermons eulogistic of all his virtues since birth will be preached and that a monument will be erected to him in the chapel when he dies the first minister the zoar chapel people had after their secession was mr d kent a liverpool gentleman who came over to preston weekly for seven years and preached every sunday he got no salary was content with having his railway fare paid and his sunday meals provided and he gave much satisfaction in the end he had to retire through ill health mr j s wesson who evaporated quietly from preston some time ago followed mr kent and preached for the zoar folk six years his successor was mr edward bates of darwen who visited the chapel every sunday for 12 months and then withdrew since his departure there has been no regular minister at the chapel and whenever one does come he will have to be a mr and not a rev particular baptists dont believe in reverend gentlementhink none of them are really reverend and that it is presumption in any man however sublimated his virtue or learning may be to sacredly oil up his name with any such prefix we have visited zoar chapel twice it was exactly twenty minutes to seven one sunday evening when we first entered it the lights were burning the blinds were drawn and there were 23 people in the place in a pew on the lefthand side a little old man was holding forth as to the prodigal son it was the first time he had ever talked in the chapel and he has never said a word since he had a peculiarly free and easy style sometimes he leaned over the pew door and beat time with one foot whilst talking at other periods he would stand back a little push his right arm up to the elbow in his breeches pocket and scratch his leg quietly then he would turn half round and look up then make to the pew door again then leave it and so on to the finish he was an earnest plainspun sort of individual but he got through his parabolical exposition very satisfactorily we fancied he would afterwards ascend the pulpit which was lighted up but he kept out of it and nobody ever went near it at all except at the finish when a man quietly walked up the steps and put the gas out we could not exactly see the force of lighting the pulpit when nobody ever went into it but others in the place might for there are shrewd men amongst them and they may have found out some virtue in lighting gas burners when they are not wanted the music we heard was moderate the praying which followed was mildly exhilarating when we turned into the chapel the second timethis was during a forenoon servicethere were located in it an elderly fatherly farmerly man who occupied the pulpit eleven middleaged men with subdued countenances six young men with their eyes and ears open to every move nine blushing maidens with their back hair combed up stiffly and their mastoid processes bared all round nine matured members of the fair sex with larger bonnets and more antique hair arrangements five little girls four small boys and seven singers making in the aggregate fiftytwo the person in the pulpit was we learned a fylde farmer but he must at some time have lived in the north for he said dowter for daughter gert for great nather for neither natteral for natural and gave his rs capital good exercise turning them round well throughout his entire discourse and he cared very little for either singular or plural verbs if he got the sense out he deemed it sufficient he spoke in a conversational style was more descriptive than argumentative was homely discreet and neither too lachrymose nor too buoyant this preacher we have been told was mr james fearclough of hardhorn near blackpool who was the original organiser of the church the singers who collected themselves around a square conical headed table in a shylooking corner gave vent to their feelings without music books they had hymns before them and these they held to be sufficient their performances were rather of a timid character but this might be to some extent accounted for by the fact that the conductor was absent when they started a tune they sighed blushed held their heads down and looked up shyly into their eye lids but when they had proceeded a little and got the congregation into a sympathetic humour courage came to them and they moved on more exactly and courageously about a dozen preachers have been tried since the pulpit was vacated by the darwen gentleman but the exact man has not yet been found and until his advent the congregation will have to solicit supplies and be content with what they can get none of the members can preach nobody in the congregation can preach and their only hope at present consists in the foreign import trade the congregation has a homely unpretentious kindlyhearted social appearance and when in the midst of it you feel as if you were at home and as if the tea things had only to be brought out to make matters complete there are no loud talkers no scandalmongers no sanguine souls who get into a state of incandescence during prayers or sermons here a respectable homely smoothlyelegant serenity dominates in it two services are held in the chapel on sundays and on a wednesday evening there is a prayer meeting a sunday school opened in 1855 is held in the building and is attended by about 50 children at present the general business of the chapel is rather dull and there will be no perceptible improvement in it nor in the number attending it until a regular minister is appointed listening to stray sermons is like feeding upon windyou may get filled with it but will never get fat upon it we hope the zoarists will by and by be successful that having escaped to their present quarters they will keep theman effort has been once or twice made to purchase the building for a publichouse and that they will never like the party who first fled to zoar become troglodytes st lukes church with the district in which this church is situated we are not much acquainted with even the church itself we have never been very familiar it is in a queer farof unshaven region aged sparrows and men who like ale better than their mothers dwell in its surroundings phalanxes of young britons born without head coverings and determined to keep them off columns of wives beautiful for ever in their unwashedness and better interpreters of the 28th verse of the 1st chapter of genesis then all the biblical commentators put together occupy its district prior to visiting st lukes church we had some idea of its situation but the idea was rather inclined to be hazy when we desired to utilise it we couldnt bring it to a decisive point and as we objected to the common business of stopping every other person in order to get a perplexing explanation of the situation the question just resolved itself into one of find it out yourself exactly so we mentally muttered on entering ribbletonlane and we passed the thirty feet house of correction wall to the right thereof with an air of triumph redolent of intrepidity and independence to the left of the lane entered we knew st lukes was located but doubt overshadowed its precise whereabouts the first street in that direction down which we looked contained at the bottom six coal waggons and a gate those unhappylooking waggons and that serious gate couldnt we said be st lukes another street to the left but at the end of it we saw only a tavern some tall rails and an old engine shed convinced that st lukes was not here we proceeded to the head of the third street and down it were more rails sundry children a woman sweeping the parapet and the gable of a mill at the extreme end of the next a coal office and a gate met us number five street showed up the fading placards of a news shop and the cold stillness of a sunday morning factory down the sixth avenue we peered eagerly but more factory met us the termination of its successor consisted of pieces of timber three arches and some mill ends we had hope as to the bottom of the next but it was blighted and withered in its infancy as we gazed upon 25 tree trunks a mill and two tall chimneys additional wood an office and an entire mill formed the background of the street subsequently encountered extra mill buildings closed up the career of the road beyond it ditto beyond that partially ditto afterwards the front of the picture being relieved by a few thirsty souls looking plaintively at a landlord who stood with a rolling eye upon door step anxious to officiate as the good samaritan but afraid to exercise his benevolence after this there would surely we thought be something like the church we were seeking but not so a swampy wide road and more of the irrepressible mill element constituted the whole of the scene presented it is however a long lane which has no turning and at last we got to a small corner shop below which were two clothes props one being very much out of the perpendicular an open piece of ground numerous bricks in a heap and a railed round edifice rising calmly sedately and diminutively this was st lukesthe shrine we had been looking for the mecca we had been in search of plenty of breathing space has the church now on three of its sides there is a wide expanse but the cottage homes of england are steadily approaching it and in time the building will be tightly surrounded by innumerable dwellings whose occupants we hope will feel the spiritual salubrity of their situation st lukes has a serene minutelyneat exterior is proportionate evenly balanced and devoid of that tortuous masonry which some architects delight to honour it is a meeklyconceived yet substantiallybuilt little church with a rural placidity and neatness about it reminding one of goodness without showiness and use without sugarcoated detail a modest spire very sharppointed rises above the tower at the western side at the angles of the tower there are pinnacles supported not by monstrosities of the common gargoyle type but by pleasant featured angels duly pinioned for flying there appears to have been a rage for windows at this said western end from top to bottom there are fifteen four being moderately large and the bulk of the remainder remarkably small the interior of the church is particularly plain is stonecoloured all round has an unassuming modestlyserious halfrural appearance has no tablets no ornaments and no striking colouring of any kind on its main walls it consists of a nave depending upon fourteen arches and two aisles the centre is pretty high has a narrow open roof and is moderately crowded with timber the sides are small but in sitting in them you do not experience that buried alive sensation that bewilderment beneath a heavy ceiling elaborated with hugely awkward propwork and pillars which is felt in some church aisles here as at st marks there is a strong belief in the healthiness of red curtains at the various entrances the chancel is high and open and has rather a bare look within it there are three windows filled in with stained glass of sweet design but defective in representative effect the colours are nicely arranged but with the exception of a very small medallion in the centre referring to the last supper they give you no idea of anything living or dead or yet to be made alive the windows were put in by the late t miller esq c r fletcher lutwidge esq and j bairstow esq and they cost 90 pounds at the western end there are three stainedglass windows which look well the colours are rich and the designs artistic two of them we believe were fixed in memory of the late mrs winlaw the vestry stands on one side of the chancel and in the doorway of it there is a red curtain intended to keep out the tail end of whirlwinds and draughts in general when we looked into this vestry the idea flashed upon us that its occupant must be a specially studious and virtuous gentleman for upon the mantelpiece there were 14 large bibles surmounted by three sacramental guides but earth is very nigh to heaven and when we saw a series of begging boxes flanking the books and a lookingglass which must at some time have cost tenpence we retreated from the centre of the chancel the church looks very imposing indeed you get a full view of all its architectural details here and the conclusion previously arrived at through what you may have seen from other pointsnamely that the edifice is simple bucolic and prosaicis entirely changed the reading desk is a commendable article and with care will last a considerable period the pulpit circularshaped and somewhat small in proportionshas a seemly appearance but it looks only a homelybuilt affair when minutely inspected and might be pulled in pieces quickly by a passionate man two or three curious articles are associated with it at the base there is quietly lying an aged gutta percha pipe the object of which we could not make out and in the pulpit there is another gutta percha pipe with an elongated funnelshaped top put up probably for some very useful purposefor whispering or speaking or sneezing or coughingwhich alone concerns the preacher and need not be further inquired into by us there is a thermometer opposite the pulpit which probably is intended to test the atmosphere of the church but which may for aught we know be serviceable to the minister in moments of extreme mental coldness or in periods of high clerical enthusiasm if he can regulate the sacred temperature of either the reading desk or the pulpit by this thermometer and can in addition utilise the gutta percha tubes as exhaust pipes then we think he will derive a tangible advantage from their presence near the entrance to the centre aisle there is a somewhat handsome stone font octagonal in shape carved on four of its sides and resting upon a circular pedestal which is surrounded by eight small pillars not far from and on each side of the font there is an official wand carried at intervals with a decorum akin to majesty by the beadle st lukes church was opened on the 3rd of august 1859 the cost of itland building and everythingbeing 5350 pounds the late j bairstow esq was an admirable friend of st lukes he gave 700 pounds towards the building fund and 6000 pounds for the endowment the church will accommodate 800 persons threefourths of the sittings are free the average attendance on sundays including school children is 250 considering that there are about 5500 persons in the district this number is only trifling when we visited the church there were 280 present and out of this number 160 were children we fancied that the weather for it was rather unfavourable might have kept many away but when we recollected that we had passed groups of men standing idly at contiguous street corners discussing the merits of dogs and ale as we walked to the church and saw at least 40 young fellows within a good stone throw of it as we left hanging about drinkinghouse sides in the drizzling rain waiting for opening time and talking coolly about half gallons we grew doubtful as to the correctness of our supposition if men could bear a quiet drenching in the streets could leave their homes for the purpose of congregating on the sides of parapets in order to make a descent upon places essentially wet we fancied that moderately inclement weather could not after all be set down as the real reason for a thin congregation at st lukes the fact is there is much of that religion professed by the horse of shipag in this districtworking on week days and stuffing on sundays is the creed of the multitude the congregation worshipping at st lukes is formed chiefly of working people in summer the scholars sit in a small gallery at the west end in winter they are brought into 28 seats below it they seem to be of a rather active turn of mind for in their management they keep two or three men and a female hard at work and continue after all to have a fair amount of their own waynot perhaps quite so much of it as three youths who sat before us who appeared to extract more pleasure out of some verses on a tobacco paper than out of either the hymns or the sermonbut still enjoying a good share of personal freedom which children will indulge in there is a service at st lukes every wednesday evening but it is not much cared for only about 30 attend it and it is not known to what extent they enjoy the proceedings the instrumental music of the church has apparently been regulated on the darwinian theory of selection what it was at the very beginning we cancannot say but towards the commencement it appears to have been emitted from a small harmonium then a little organ was procured and it came from that then a large organ was obtained and from that it now radiates some day a still larger instrument may be procured but the present one which used to do duty in christ church preston is a respectable goodlooking tuneful apparatus and it is played with ability by an energetic clericallooking young gentleman who receives a small salary for his services the members of the choir manifest tolerable skill in their performances but they lack power and are hampered at line ends by the dragging melody of the scholars the incumbent of st lukes is the rev w winlawa grave sharp featured gentleman who comes from the north and like all his fellowcountrymen knows perfectly well what time it is mr winlaw was originally an independent minister and he looks like one to this day he was a fellowstudent of the rev g w clapham formerly of lancasterroad congregational chapel preston and now a minister of the church of england mr winlaw was the successor of the rev j h cuff father of messrs cuff of this town at an independent chapel in wellington in 1855 he was ordained by the bishop of manchester to st peters ashtonunderlyne in 1867 he came to preston as curate of st pauls and in 1859 he was appointed incumbent of st lukes mr winlaw is a slender carefullyorganised cute sharpeyed man is inclined to be fastidious punctillious and cold is a ready speaker talks with grammatical accuracy and laboured precision is rather wordy and unctuous can draw out his sentences to a high pitch of solemnity and tone them off in syllabic whispers has an active physiognomical expressioncan turn the muscles of his face in all directions shakes his head considerably in the readingdesk and pulpit as if constantly in earnest is keenly susceptible and has strong convictions couldnt be easily persuaded off a notion after once seeing it in his own light seems to have smiled but seldom has sharp perceptive powerslooks into you with a piercing eye cares little for the odd or the humoroushas a strong sense of clerical dignity would become sarcastic if touched in the quick is earnest cautious melancholy and felthatted has good strategic powers can see a considerable way is vigorous when roused maidenly when cool cutting when vexed meek when in smooth water is generally exact in composition and clear in style but preaches rather long sermons and has a difficulty in giving over when he has got to the end in one of his sermons we heard him say after a fiveandtwenty minutes run in conclusion lastly and finally and we had almost made up our mind for another sermon after he had finished but he decided to give over without preaching it mr winlaw in the main is a fair speaker with a rather eccentric modulation is a medium gentlemanlyseeming slightlyinflated polished precise minister who has earned the confidence of his flock and the goodwill of many about him like every other parson he is not quite perfect but he appears to be suitable for the district and with a salary of 300 pounds per annum is we hope happy day and sunday schools adjoin the church at the former there is an average attendance of 180 at the latter of 400 a capital library is attached to the schools orange and other societies for the maintenance of protestantism and the support of our glorious constitution exist in connection with the church and the members who are rather of the highpressure type enjoy the proceedings of them muchly emmanuel church and bairstow memorial chapel preston has been developing itself for several years northwards there was a period and not very long since either when nearly the whole of the land in that direction was a mere wastea chaos of little hills and large holes relieved with clay cuttings modified with loads of rubbish and adorned with innumerable stonesa barren starvedout sort of town common where persecuted asses found an elysium amid thistles where neglected ducks held high revel in small wornout patches of water and upon which rambling operatives aired their terriers smoked in gossiping coteries and indulged in the luxuries of jumping and running and tumbling but much of this land has been reclaimed many dwellings have been erected upon it and in the heart of it stands emmanuel churcha building which ought to have been opened some time since which might have been opened 90 days ago if two or three lawyers had exerted themselves with moderate energy in the conveyancing business and which it is expected will be consecrated and got ready for the spiritual edification of the neighbourhood in a few weeks the locality assigned to emmanuel church used to form part of st peters district but that church having enough on its hands nearer home it was decided to slice off a portion of its area and start a new auxiliary mission northwards thomas tomlinson esq of london gave land at the end of brookstreet sufficient for a new church and schools subscriptions for the erection of the necessary buildings were afterwards solicited sums of money were promised but enough could not be obtained to carry out the entire work so the building committee acting upon the sagacious plan that it is easier at any time to lift a pound than a ton concluded to make a start by constructing schools this was in 1865 after the lapse of a short time the schools were completed and up to the present dec 1869 worship has been held in them the schools are strong and good the principal room wherein the religious services are held has a tincture of the ecclesiastical element in its interior architecture but either those who attend it or those who exercise themselves about its precincts are of too active a disposition for nineteen squares of glass in its windows are cracked and this rather panes one at first sight there were about 240 persons 80 or 90 being children in the building when we paid our sunday visit to it the congregation was of the working class species at the northeast corner seven or eight singers somewhat vigorous and expert in their music were stationed a female who played a little harmonium was near them and in one corner in a small pulpit run up to the wall as tightly as human skill could devise was a condensed irish gentleman whom nobody seemed to know but who turned out in the end to be an oswaldtwistle minister who had exchanged pulpits with the regular clergyman he was a cute welleducated little party but awfully uneasywas never stillmoved his head arms and body about at the rate of 129 times a minute we timed him with a good centreseconds watch talked much out of the left corner of his mouth was full of rough vigour and warm blood would have been a boy with a shillelagh and yet he got along with his work excellently we couldnt help smiling when we saw during the preliminary portion of the service another surpliced gentleman join him just when the lessons came on a stout plumpfeatured and most fashionablywhiskered young man stepped into the pulpit crushed the little oswaldtwistle party into the northeastern corner of it and poured out for about twenty minutes a sharp monotonous volume of sacred verses the scene underwent further development when during the singing both stood up side by side the pulpit would hardly hold them but they stuck well to its inner sides cast tranquil fraternal glances at each other once threw a corsican brother affection into the scene looked now and then fierce as if feeling that each had as much right to the pulpit as the other and finally marched off with a twinly love beaming in their eyes to the vestry adjoining from which in a few minutes the oswaldtwistle minister emerged in a black gown and entered the pulpit whilst his companion followed in a buttonedup black coat to the front of the communion rails where he took a seat and became very quiet the sermon was briskly condemnatory of unbelief for ten minutes then got immensely pungent as to popery and ended in a coloured star shower concerning the excellence of the good old church of england we couldnt help admiring the preachers eloquence and a man who sat near us and at the finish said who is that fellow a rather vulgar kind of queryseemed to be fairly delighted with him the church in which the services will soon be held stands close to the school it is a curious piebaldlooking building is made of brick with intervening stone bands and facings and is something unique in this part of the country in the south of england particularly in the metropolitan districtssuch like buildings are not uncommon but hereabouts architecture of the emmanuel church type seems odd the edifice although quaint and rather poor looking at first sight owing to its bricky complexion will bear close examination indeed the more you look at it and the better you become reconciled to its proportions in general contour it is symmetrical and strong in detail it is neat and compact and whilst the colour of it may indicate some singularity and strike you as being eccentrically variegated there is nothing in any sense improper about the character of its materials and as time goes on and familiarity with them is increased they will cease to look whimsical and appear just as good as anything else the general architecture of the building is of the early english type the design c being furnished by messrs myres veevers and myres of preston at the west end there is a rather prettily shaped tower surmounted at each corner with a strong stone pinnacle the extreme height being 100 feet a few yards above the centre of the tower there are angular projectionsstretchedout dreadfullooking figures a cross between vampires and hyenasand you feel glad that they are only made of stone and in the next place that they are a good way off the man who carved them must have tightened up his courage to the sticking point many a time during the completion of these uniquelyunbeautiful figures the principal entrance to the church is at the western end where there is a pretty gabled and balconied porchway elaborated with carvings some of which are being executed at the expense of patriotic youths who pay for a yard or two each as they are in the humour and expect an apotheosis afterwards the doors at this end open into an inner vestibule which is well screened from the main building and may be used for class purposes the rendezvousing of christening parties or the halting plate of sinners who go late to church and hesitate until they get desperate or highly virtuous before proceeding further in a corner at the northwest there is a beautiful baptismal font made of caen stone ornamented with emblematic figures and monograms and supported by four small columns of leeds stone the font is covered up by a piece of strong calico in the shape of a huge nightcap and the arrangement suits it for however closely covered down the cap may be no grumbling of any sort is ever heard the building is cruciform in shape and has a strong yet tastefullyfinished galleried transept approached by collateral doers which also give ingress to the church on the ground floor the entrances are so arranged that everything in the shape of that most objectionable of all thingsa draughtis obviated it is expected that sufficient wind will be brought to bear upon the question by the organ blower without admitting additional currents through the doors the church has a solid substantial wellfinished interior and the only fault which can be found with it is that it is rather low if the roof could be lifted a yard or so higher the general effect would be wonderfully improved but it would be very difficult to do this now and we suppose the altitude which was regulated by the funds in hand during the process of building will have to remain as at present but the lowness of the roof may have some compensating advantages if higher the church might have been colder and its sounding properties which are good might have been interfered with at present the space is condensed and this tends to concentrate both warmth and what acoustical gentlemen term reverberation the roof is strongly filled in with diagonally laid darkstained timber is open and semicircular but looks rather heavy and gloomy there are no huge ungainly pillars in the body of the building an easy capacious freedom prevails in it seeing is not a difficult business the first sensation which increases as you remain in the church is calmly pleasurable and satisfactory there is nothing flimsey nor specious nor whimsical in the place evenness and harmony of proportion simplicity and solidity of style strength and straightforwardness of workmanship strike you as its characteristics the pulpit which is made of stone and approached by an internal staircase adorned on one side with open pillars is most durable and handsome in style every part of the church can be seen from it and several parsons might be accommodated in it and the balcony immediately adjoining the reading desk is of carved oak and although rather small has a tasteful and substantial appearance t tomlinson esq who gave the font presented both the pulpit and the desk and has likewise given the ceremonial books the lecternstrong ornamental and weightyis the gift of m myres esq the chancel is tolerably lofty and cheerfullooking good windows are inserted in it but the main one is inferior in design to those in the transept and that at the western end passages of scripture are painted round the arches of the chancel and transept the expense thereof having been defrayed by mr park decorator and mr veevers of the firm of myres veevers and myres there is a neat dado round the church which was made at the expense of mr j j myres the seats in the church are most conveniently arranged they are well fit up have good sloped backs and are so constructed as to accommodate either large or small families in separate sections emmanuel church the foundationstone of which was laid on the 18th of april 1868 by sir t g fermorhesketh mp has cost in round figures 6000 pounds it will accommodate 1000 people and all the seats except 359 are free the church considering its capacity and general finish is thought to be one of the cheapest buildings for miles round some time when the building fund has been replenished a parsonage house will be erected at the eastern end of the church the schools which adjoin are attended during week days by upwards of 220 scholars and on sundays the attendance including the various classes with their teachers c will be about 450 there is a conservative constitutional association in connection with emmanuel schools the members meet in a building which was once a farmhouse near the church they have for ever of courage can discuss the great concerns of the empire with ease and eloquence are prepared at any time to administer remedies for all the grievances of the five divisions of the human race as classified by blumenbach and would be willing to sit daily from ten till four on the highest peak of olympus and direct the affairs of the universe the minister of the church is the rev e sloane murdoch and we dare say if the cuilmenn of erin or the book of the uachongbhail or the cin droma snechta or the saltair of cashel could have been consulted his ancestors would have been found named therein mr murdoch is a young man hails from derry possesses a strong constitution has small sharp eyes and a very round head has remarkably smooth hair brushed close to the bone and well parted and is of a determined active disposition following the example of many other parsons he likes a closelybuttoned coat and a walking stick he is sharp quick in resenting aggressions would soon have his native blood stirred is tempted to be a little imperious considers that he is a power in the district has much endurance is systematical in thought wary in expression hesitates and flutters a little in some of his sentences has a strong hibernian brogue but is precise with it throws more recollection than original thought into his utterances visits his district well is a fair scholar is dry and prosaic until warmed up can feel more than he can express has little rhetorical display seems as if he would like to shake himself when at a white heat gets 195 pounds a year 135 pounds from emmanuel church and 60 pounds for his services at the workhouseand would not find any fault whatever if the sum were raised to 300 pounds mr murdoch was originally ordained curate of a parish in the diocese of kilmore the fatherinlaw of the present incumbent of st peters preston being bishop thereof at the time he stayed in the parish about a year then went into the diocese of derry taking a curacy near coleraine which he held for three years got a degree at trinity college dublin in 1858 was then ordained by the late bishop of killaloe came to st peters preston as curate in the spring of 1863 stayed there upwards of three years and was then agreeably translated to emmanuel church mr murdoch is a very useful minister in the district has striven much to illumine the sinners thereof is bringing them now to a very fair state of enlightenment and may in time get the whole district into a bright state of sacred combustion at the bottom of fishergate hill in birdstreet there is a small cleanlooking pleasantlyformed building which since the 14th of october 1869 has been used as a chapel of ease for christ church it cost 1000 pounds was built conjointly by mr r newsham mr j f higgins and mr w b roper in memory of the late j bairstow esq who left each of them several thousands will accommodate about 240 persons is tolerably well attended and is one of the tidiest little places of worship we have seen no effort at architectural display has been made in its construction it has a brick exterior has a comely little porch at the west end is surmounted in the centre by a turret has several yards of iron railing bending in various directions near the front and will require considerable protection if its general health has to be preserved none of the windows have yet been broken but we dare say they will be by and by for the neighbourhood possesses some excellent stonethrowers the ribble has not yet flowed into it but it may pay one of its peculiar visits some day for in this quarter it is no respecter of buildings whether they be chapels or public houses the edifice has a light simple unassuming interior chairs seem to constitute the principal articles of furniture there are 232 for the congregation and 232 little red buffets as well 11 for the choir one for the organ blower and two for the parson at the top of each chair back there is a thick piece of wood on which is plastered a printed paper requesting the worshippers to kneel during prayers and to join in the responses the paper also makes a quiet allusion to offertory business the defraying of expenses and the augmentation of the curates salary the chairs are planted down the church in two rows and they look very singular the organ at the south east corner is a pretty little instrument a reading desk on the opposite side standing upon a small platform suffices for the pulpit behind there is a strip of strong bluepainted canvas bearing a text in gilt letters referring to the sacrament above there is a threelight stained glass window at the western end just under the doorway a marble tablet is fixed and upon it is an allusion to the virtues of the late j bairstow esq and to the gentlemen who erected the building the average congregation consists of about 200 middle and working class people the services are generally conducted by the rev j d harrison curate of christ churcha young gentleman who works with considerable vigour and never sneezes at the offertory contributions however small they may be mr harding of this town designed the building which is a homely kindlylooking little affaira bashful tiny domesticated creature a nursling amid the matured and ancient a baby among the titans which may some day reach whiskerdom and manhood st marys church and now finally brethren to the beginning of the end have we got the journey has been long and tortuous when we have proceeded forty inches further we shall stop not with the last rose of summer nor with the last of all the romans nor with the last syllable of recorded time nor with the last words of marmion the mohicans are barred outhave we to deal but with the last place of worship fairly coming within the category of our churches and chapels st marys church is situated in a huge rudelyspun district known by the name of new preston that district used to be one of the wildest in this locality schimelendamowitchwagon was not known in it not much of that excellent article is yet known in it and tons of good seed saying nothing of manure will have to be planted in its hard ground before it either blossoms like the rose or pays its debts this district was originally brought into active existence by john horrocks esq the founder of the preston cotton trade prior to his time there were a few people in it who believed that 10s a week was a good wage and that nixons book of prophecies was an infallible guide but not before he planted in the locality a body of handloom weavers did it show signs of commercial vivacity and begin to develope itself handloom weaving is now about as hopeless a job as trying to extract sunlight out of cucumbers but at that time it was a paying air weavers could then afford to play two or three days a week earn excellent wages afterwards wear top boots and then thrash their wives in comfort without the interference of policemen they and their immediate descendants belonged to a crooked and perverse generation cock fighting badgerbaiting poaching drinking and dogworrying formed their sovereign delights and they were so amazingly rude and dangerous that even tax collectors durst not at times go amongst them for money men of this stamp would be much appreciated at present the population has thickened and civilisation has penetrated into the region since then and yet the animal preponderates rather largely in it now rats pigeons dogs and saturday night eye openerstoned down with canary breeding ale supping herbgathering and sunday afternoon bakingstill retain a mild hold upon the affections of the people and many of the youthful race are beginning to imitate their elders admirably in all these little particulars a pack of hounds was once kept for general enjoyment in new preston but that pack has gone to the dogs hasnt been heard of for years during the past quarter of a century what missionary breakfast men call a great work has been done by way of evangelising the people in this quarter of the town and very much of it has been achieved through st marys church and schools for a very long period the schools in connection with st marys have formed an excellent auxiliary of the church prior to the erection of the church scholastic work was carried on in some cottages on the north side of what is now termed new halllane the scholars were then in the care of the parish church when st pauls was erected they were handed over to it afterwards when st marys was raised a building was provided for them in a street just opposite which has undergone many alterations and enlargements since owing to the great increase in the number of scholars the principal room of the schools is the largest in preston with one exceptionthe assembly room of the corn exchange a little cottagehouse looking place up new hall lane constitutes a branch of the schools the average weekday attendance is about 900 whilst on a sunday the gathering of scholars is about 1200 at the schools on sundays there are male and female adult classes and on weekdays a number of earnest mothers meet therein for the purposes of instruction consolation and pious newsvending at the schoolswe shall get to the church and mr alker by and by so be patient if possiblethere is a church of england institute under whose auspices innocent games are indulged in and periodicals c read a conservative association established to guard the constitutional interests of fishwick ward also holds its gatherings in one of the rooms the rev robert lamb a very energetic man and formerly incumbent of st marys gave the first great impetus to the schools which are the largest of their kind in preston mr lamb is now at st pauls bennettstreet manchester and singular to say he has worked up the schools of that church until they have become the greatest in the city the late t miller esq was a warm friend of st marys schools and whenever any extensions were made at them he always on having the plans and estimates submitted to him defrayed one third of the expenses st marys church stands just at the rear of the preston house of correction that is better than standing inside such a grim establishmentany site before the insite oh of a prison and has for its south western support the storehouse of the third royal lancashire militia it forms one of the churches erected mainly through the exertions of the late rev r carus wilson and like its brethren is built in the norman style of architecture the designer being mr john latham the first stone of the edifice was laid in may 1836 in 1838 the church was opened and in 1853 it was enlarged by the erection of a transept at the northern end the late john smith esq gave the site for it the building is surrounded by a graveyard which might be kept in better order than it is the rev r lamb considerably impoverished himself in enclosing the ground and the rev h r smith one of the incumbents afterwards spent a sum of money in ornamenting it with shrubs c but nobody cares much for it now and nature is permitted to follow her own unfettered way in it formerly there was a road to the church from the west through some land adjoining the house of correction and it was a great convenience to those living on that side of the town but for some reason it was closed and one of the most roundabout ways imaginable has been substituted for it st marys is one of those churches which can be felt rather than seen until you get quite to it you hardly know you are at it approaching it from the west the first glimmering of it you have is over one end of the house of correction at this point you catch what seems to be a cluster of crossesthe surmountings of the tower visions of a ponderous cruetstand of five nine pins and other cognate articles then strike you afterwards the body of the church broadens slowly into view and having described threefourths of a wide circle with your feet and passed through a strong gateway it is found you are at the building st marys has a strong heavy compact appearance its front is arched below and storied above it has ivy creeping up its wallstrying probably to get to some of the five nondescript ornaments above the towerand has a half baronial half old hall look at first sight some years ago there was much ivy about the general building but the rare old plant engendered dampness and had to be pulled down at each side of the front there is a small pinnacle and flanking the gables of the transept there are four somewhat similar elevations they are mainly used by sparrows the church can be approached by a doorway at the eastern end of the transept but the bulk of the worshippers pass through those at the southern or front endthree in number and rather heavy and dim in appearance the centre one leads into the body of the building and we may as well take advantage of it we are just within above there is a serious looking groined roof with a lamp suspended from the middle of it before us there is a screen filled in with clear glass through which you can see the worshippers who seem thin and scattered formerly the back of a sharply drawn up dangerous gallery for scholars over which careless children might have fallen with the greatest ease occupied the place of this screen and a series of hot water pipesapparently intended for warming the doorway and the churchyard in front for they could have been of no use to people inside the buildingwere fixed there in 1866 when the church was renovated they were carried about fifteen yards into the edifice where they may be seen to this day we sat close to eight of them with a top coat on one sunday evening as a compensation for being nearly starved to death in one of the back side wings in the morning and felt charmingly cooked at the end of the service on the left side of the central entrance and near the glass door and the screen there is an elaborately carved box of gothic design intended for missionary contributions but it is fixed in such a dim corner that nobody can see it we have recommended the beadle to place this box in a more prominent position for it is worth looking at as an ornament even if nothing is put into it the aperture in the lid might be closed and the box could then be hung up beside the doorway lamp so that its proportions might be fairly realised the interior of the church is broad and lofty but through its norman configuration it is stiff and coldly ponderous in effect massive bare walls high narrow windows and a semisexagonal ceiling dependent upon rather ungainly beams and rafters like a series of hanging frames chill you a little but on looking northward to the end of the building the chancel and transept arches which are strong and elegantly moulded relieve you and as you advance the place seems to gradually assume a finer and more imposing aspect the chancel has a calm goodly look is in fact the best part of the building architecturally speaking at the base there is an archway of tablets upon which nobody ever bestows very close attention above there are three stapleshaped windows and surmounting all there is a round recessed light which can only be seen through by people who sit in the gallery on the left side of the chancel there are two windows there is no stained glass in the chancel if the windows were adorned with it and the walls more cheerfully painted a very beautiful effect would be produced five different kinds of carpetting all very well worn deck the floor of the chancel within the communion rails there is a rich carpet in needlework made by some of the members of the congregation at each side there is as antique chair being part of the furniture in the vestry which adjoins and which was given by the rev h r smith it consists altogether of ten piecesincluding chairs bookcase lookingglass dressingtable chest c and is about 200 years old the only stained windows in the building are in the west transept they are four in number two being of the merely ornamental type whilst the remainder are of the memorial order at the bottom of one of them there are these wordsin memory of mary smith born 1779 died 1845 erected by henry robert smith at the base of the other window there is this inscription in memory of john smith born 1773 died 1849 erected by the church 1855 the deceased persons referred to were the parents of the rev h r smith who as already said was a former incumbent of the church the ends of the transept are very dim and sometimes you can hardy tell who is sitting in them st marys will accommodate 1450 persons the pews on the ground floor excepting a few free ones at the entrance and at the top of the church are all of the closed kindhave doors to them when the church was renovated the pews were cut down about eight inches were remodelled and thoroughly cleaned previously they were painted and had a gummy sticky influence rearwards upon peoples clothes one or two bits of shawl fringe c drawn off by the old gluey paint still remain at the back of some of the seats notwithstanding the chemical cleansing they got reminding one of the saying of friend billings that a thing well stuck iz stuck for ever the gas burners hang far down in pendant clusters from the ceiling and with their glass reflectors which would cast off a better light if cleaner have a lamplike effect putting one in mind when lighted of some eastern mosque the font is a prettily shaped article is made of fossil marble and was given by the rev canon parr and the wardens of the parish church in which building it once stood it rests upon a platform of ornamental tiles bordered with stone and looks well above it is a carved wooden canopy surmounted by a dove the canopy is raised by a descending ball of equal weight when the ball falls the pigeon rises in ordinary life the ball rises when the pigeon falls but this is not the case at st marys although it amounts to the same thing in the end for after the pigeon has ascended three feet the ball descends upon its back and settles the question at the southern end there is a large gallery overshadowing the noisiest galaxy of sunday infants we ever encountered there are more infants at st marys schools than at any other place in preston and trouble combined with vexation of spirit must consequently exist there in the same ratio the bulk are kept from the church but a few manage to creep in and when we saw them they were having a very happy time of it some whistled a littlebut they seemed to be only learners and couldnt get on very well with tunes others tossed halfpennies about a few operated upon the floor with marbles and all of them were exceedingly lively the gallery above is large deep and long ingress to it is tortuous and strangers would have to inquire much before properly reaching it there is an old funeral bier in one part of it and we have failed to ascertain the precise object of the article it is not used when fainting fits are in season it is never taken advantage of in the case of people who fall asleep and require carrying home to bed it seems to be neither useful nor ornamental and it ought to be either taken off to the cemetery and quietly inurned or sold to one of the sextons there in the gallery there is a large organ it is a very respectable looking instrument has a healthy musical interior and is played moderately the members of the choir to whom several people in the bottom of the church look up periodically as if trying to find out either what they were doing or how they were dressed are only in embryo they are new singers but some of them have fair voices and in spite of occasional irregularity in tune and time they get along agreeably the elements of a good choir are within them and they have only to persevere in order to secure excellence saying nothing of medals and other tokens of appreciation the whole of the seats in the gallery generally used by scholars are free st marys is situated a district containing about 8000 persons and as they are nearly entirely of the working class sort the congregation is naturally made up of similar materials including 14 militia staff men the congregation will number on an average without the scholars about 500 more people appear to come late to this church than to any other in preston they keep dropping in at all timesparticularly in a morningup to within twenty minutes of the finish but they are connected with the schools visit the church after they have done duty there and this accounts for their lateness the beadle of this church has the strongest if not the longest official wand in the town and he is very modest blushing occasionally while carrying it the first incumbent of st marys was the rev james parker a relative of councillor parker of preston who had to retire through ill health he exchanged livings with the rev w watson of ellerburne in yorkshire who required a more active sphere and found it at st marys mr watson afterwards found higher preferment and went to the south of england then came the rev robert lamb who worked most vigorously in the district he is now rector of st pauls manchester his successor was the rev henry robert smith who after staying a while retired to st pauls at grange where he still labours the next incumbent was the rev george alker who came to st marys in december 1857 he is still at the church but we dare say he would be willing to leave it for a rectory if one were offered with 500 pounds a year mr alker is an irishman and is about 42 years of age he is rather tall is genteelly fashioned has good features wears an elegantlytrimmed pair of whiskers has pompous odorous pall mall appearance is grandiose and special looks like a nineteenth century numa pompilius would have made a spicey pontifex maximus ought to have lived in persia where he might have worn velvet slippers and been fanned with peacock feathers would have been a rare general director of either fireeaters or fire worshippers is inclined to run when he walks alone and to be stately slow regal and precise when like fadladeen he is in charge of lalla rookh is a man of determination and never sleeps with his clothes on is a sharp debater a brisklypompous eloquent talker has had a good deal of trouble at time and time in putting on his kid gloves which used to fit so mortally tight that he couldnt stir his thumbs in them stands with a fine commanding air in the pulpit as if about to shoulder arms preaches extempore says my brethren more frequently in his sermons than any minister we ever heard has a clear keen intellect is dexterous courageous impassioned imperious has a lofty threepencehalfpenny majesty about him has been a hard worker a stiff fighter and a stinging public lecturer after leaving ireland he took a curacy in liverpool in 1857 he accepted a similar post at st peters preston here he organised a class of young men 800 strong and whilst here he set the town on fire with antipopery denunciation and of him it might at that time have been said he comes from erins peaceful shore like fervid kettle bubbling oer with hot effusionshot and weak sound humbug all your hollowest drums he comes of erins martyrdoms to britains wellfed church to speak yes he was a regular mr blazeaway and what he said was equal to the strongest of the theatre thunder and the most dazzling of forked lightning other irish curates have tried the same game on since then in the town but they have not been so successful none of them have yet got into decent incumbencies and we are afraid they will have to rave on for a yet longer period ere the requisite balm of gilead is found after piling up the agony for a few months at st peters mr alker left for dublin stayed there a short time then retraced his steps to preston and in due time got the incumbency of st marysan event which seems to have toned down all his fury about the abomination of rome and made him nearly quite forget the existence of pope pius paraphrasing one of his own countrys poets we may say as bees on flowers alighting cease their hum so settling at st marys alkers dumb still be has occasional spells of antipopery hysteria he cant altogether get the old complaint out of his bones rome is yet his red rag when in a rage and he has latterly shown an inclination to wind up the clocks of the jews and the mahommedans he may have a fling at the calmuck tartars and a quiet pitch into the sioux indians after a bit when mr alker first went to st marys his salary was small but it has now reached the general panacea of incumbents300 pounds a year he has also a neat wellsituated parsonage on the south eastern side of the town a good garden which has been the scene of many lovely sights and a neat patch of ground beyond in his district mr alker has been an energetic worker and in connection with the schools particularly he has been most useful for his services in this respect he deserves much praise and we tender him our share his influence is hardly so great as it used to be still he is the great brahmin and the grand lama of the locality there have been five curates at st marys the rev w nesbit mguinness clever and ambitious the rev john wilson not of st jamess an industrious gentleman who had a row with the congregation in respect to his marriage and afterwards went away the rev r close a pretentious young man who appeared to use much hair oil and think well of pious gammon the rev e m david a welshman who couldnt speak plainly enough for the congregation and had to retire and lastly the rev bernard robinson who has been at st marys about twelve months and is evidently working satisfactorily in the district we have finished all is over the lime lights are burning the coloured fires are radiating their hues the curtain is falling and bidding adieu to
