sturdy health many people are kept ill because they do not know how to select food that their own particular bodies will take up and build upon what will answer for one will not do for another if one is ailing it is safe to change food entirely and go on a plain simple diet say for breakfast cooked fruit dish of grapenuts and cream or hot or cold milk two lightly boiled eggs one cup of our postum food coffee slice of toast no more our word but a diet like that makes one feel good after a few days use the most perfectly made food for human use is grapenuts theres a reason grapenuts co ltd 66

within the limit or this pamphlet should there appear in places an abruptness or incompleteness of treatment these limitations must be my excuse those who wish to thoroughly study the science of food are referred to the standard work food and dietetics by dr r hutchison e arnold 16s the effects of purin bodies in producing illness has been patiently and thoroughly worked out by dr alexander haig

pathological properties and the quantities in foods will be found in the purin bodies of food stuffs by dr i walker hall sherratt hughes manchester 1903 4s6d the us department of agriculture has made a large number of elaborate researches on food and nutrition my thanks are due to mr albert broadbent the secretary of the vegetarian society for placing some of their bulletins in my hands and for suggestions and help he has also written several useful popular booklets on food of a very practical character at from a penny to threepence each popular literature abounds in unsound statements on food it is unfortunate that many ardent workers in the cause of health are lacking in scientific knowledge especially of physiology and chemistry by their immature and sweeping statements from the platform and press they often bring discredit on a good cause matters of health must be primarily based on experience and we must bear in mind that each person can at the most have full knowledge of himself alone and to a less degree of his family and intimates the general rules of health are applicable to all alike but not in their details owing to individual imperfections of constitution difference of temperament and environment there is danger when one man attempts to measure others by his own standard for the opinions here expressed i only must be held responsible and not the society publishing the pamphlet vegetarians generally place the humane as the highest reason for their practice though the determining cause of the change from a flesh diet has been in most cases bad health a vegetarian may be defined as one who abstains from all animals as food the term animal is used in its proper scientific sense comprising insects molluscs crustaceans fish etc animal products are not excluded though they are not considered really necessary they are looked upon as a great convenience whilst free from nearly all the objections appertaining to flesh food awd the chemistry of food and nutrition by aw duncan fcs we may define a food to be any substance which will repair the functional waste of the body increase its growth or maintain the heat muscular and nervous energy in its most comprehensive sense the oxygen of the air is a food as although it is admitted by the lungs it passes into the blood and there reacts upon the other food which has passed through the stomach it is usual however to restrict the term food to such nutriment as enters the body by the intestinal canal water is often spoken of as being distinct from food but for this there is no sufficient reason many popular writers have divided foods into fleshformers heatgivers and boneformers although attractive from its simplicity this classification will not bear criticism fleshformers are also heatgivers only a portion of the mineral matter goes to form bone class iinorganic compounds subclass 1 water 2 mineral matter or salts class iiorganic compounds 1 nonnitrogeneous or ternary compounds a carbohydrates b oils c organic acids 2 nitrogenous compounds a proteids b osseids class iiinonnutritives food adjuncts and drugs essential oils alkaloids extractives alcohol c these last are not strictly foods if we keep to the definition already given but they are consumed with the true foods or nutrients comprised in the other two classes and cannot well be excluded from consideration water forms an essential part of all the tissues of the body it is the solvent and carrier of other substances mineral matter or salts is left as an ash when food is thoroughly burnt the most important salts are calcium phosphate carbonate and fluoride sodium chloride potassium phosphate and chloride and compounds of magnesium iron and silicon mineral matter is quite as necessary for plant as for animal life and is therefore present in all food except in the case of some highlyprepared ones such as sugar starch and oil children require a good proportion of calcium phosphate for the growth of their bones whilst adults require less the outer part of the grain of cereals is the richest in mineral constituents white flour and rice are deficient wheatmeal and oatmeal are especially recommended for the quantity of phosphates and other salts contained in them mineral matter is necessary not only for the bones but for every tissue of the body when haricots are cooked the liquid is often thrown away and the beans served nearly dry or with parsley or other sauce not only is the food less tasty but important saline constituents are lost the author has made the following experimentsgerman whole lentils egyptian split red lentils and medium haricot beans were soaked all night 16 hours in just sufficient cold water to keep them covered the water was poured off and evaporated the residue heated in the steamoven to perfect dryness and weighed after pouring off the water the haricots were boiled in more water until thoroughly cooked the liquid being kept as low as possible the liquid was poured off as clear as possible from the haricots evaporated and dried the ash was taken in each case and the alkalinity of the watersoluble ash was calculated as potash k2o the quantity of water which could be poured off was with the german lentils half as much more than the original weight of the pulse not quite as much could be poured off the others g lentils e lentils haricots cooked h proportion of liquid 15 125 120 soluble dry matter 097 338 143 766 per cent ash 016 040 028 126 alkalinity as k2o 002 0082 0084 021 the loss on soaking in cold water unless the water is preserved is seen to be considerable the split lentils having had the protecting skin removed lose most in every case the ash contained a good deal of phosphate and lime potatoes are rich in important potash salts by boiling a large quantity is lost by steaming less and by baking in the skins scarcely any the flavour is also much better after baking the usual addition of common salt sodiumchloride to boiled potatoes is no proper substitute for the loss of their natural saline constituents natural and properly cooked foods are so rich in sodium chloride and other salts that the addition of common salt is unnecessary an excess of the latter excites thirst and spoils the natural flavour of the food it is the custom especially in restaurants to add a large quantity of salt to pulse savoury food potatoes and soups bakers brown bread is usually very salt and sometimes white is also in some persons much salt causes irritation of the skin and the writer has knowledge of the salt food of vegetarian restaurants causing or increasing dandruff as a rule fondness for salt is an acquired taste and after its discontinuance for a time food thus flavoured becomes unpalatable organic compounds are formed by living organisms a few can also be produced by chemical means they are entirely decomposed by combustion the nonnitrogenous organic compounds are commonly called carbon compounds or heatproducers but these terms are also descriptive of the nitrogenous compounds these contain carbon hydrogen and oxygen only and furnish by their oxidation or combustion in the body the necessary heat muscular and nervous energy the final product of their combustion is water and carbon dioxide carbonic acid gas the carbohydrates comprise starch sugar gum mucilage pectose glycogen c cellulose and woody fibre are carbohydrates but are little capable of digestion they contain hydrogen and oxygen in the proportion to form water the carbon alone being available to produce heat by combustion starch is the most widely distributed food it is insoluble in water but when cooked is readily digested and absorbed by the body starch is readily converted into sugar whether in plants or animals during digestion there are many kinds of sugar such as grape cane and milk sugars the oils and fats consist of the same elements as the carbohydrates but the hydrogen is in larger quantity than is necessary to form water and this surplus is available for the production of energy during their combustion in the body they produce nearly twoandaquarter times 4 89 2225 as much heat as the carbohydrates but if eaten in more than small quantities they are not easily digested a portion passing away by the intestines the fat in the body is not solely dependent upon the quantity consumed as food as an animal may become quite fat on food containing none a moderate quantity favours digestion and the bodily health in cold weather more should be taken in the arctic regions the esquimaux consume enormous quantities nuts are generally rich in oil oatmeal contains more than any of the other cereals 27 analyses gave from 8 to 123 per cent the most esteemed and dearest oil is almond what is called peachkernel oil oleum amygdal persic but which in commerce includes the oil obtained from plum and apricot stones is almost as tasteless and useful whilst it is considerably cheaper it is a very agreeable and useful food it is often added to as an adulterant or substituted for the true almond oil the best qualities of olive oil are much esteemed though they are not as agreeable to english taste as the oil previously mentioned the best qualities are termed virgin extra sublime and sublime any that has been exposed for more than a short time to the light and heat of a shop window should be rejected as the flavour is affected it should be kept in a cool place not only does it vary much in freedom from acid and rancidity but is frequently adulterated two other cheaper oils deserve mention the colddrawn arachis oil peanut or earthnut oil has a pleasant flavour resembling that of kidney beans the colddrawn sesam oil has an agreeable taste and is considered equal to olive oil for edible purposes the best qualities are rather difficult to obtain those usually sold being much inferior to peachkernel and olive oils cottonseed oil is the cheapest of the edible ones salad oil not sold under any descriptive name is usually refined cottonseed oil with perhaps a little olive oil to impart a richer flavour the solid fats sold as butter and lard substitutes consist of deodorised cocoanut oil and they are excellent for cooking purposes it is claimed that biscuits c made from them may be kept for a much longer period without showing any trace of rancidity than if butter or lard had been used they are also to be had agreeably flavoured by admixture with almond walnut c cream the better quality oils are quite as wholesome as the best fresh butter and better than most butter as sold bread can be dipped into the oil or a little solid vegetable fat spread on it the author prefers to pour a little peachkernel oil upon some ground walnut kernels or other ground nuts in themselves rich in oil mix with a knife to a suitable consistency and spread upon the bread pinekernels are very oily and can be used in pastry in the place of butter or lard whenever oils are mentioned without a prefix the fixed or fatty oils are always understood the volatile or essential oils are a distinct class occasionally the fixed oils are called hydrocarbons but hydrocarbon oils are quite different and consist of carbon and hydrogen alone of these petroleum is incapable of digestion whilst others are poisonous vegetable acids are composed of the same three elements and undergo combustion into the same compounds as the carbohydrates they rouse the appetite stimulate digestion and finally form carbonates in combination with the alkalies thus increasing the alkalinity of the blood the chief vegetable acids are malic acid in the apple pear cherry c citric acid in the lemon lime orange gooseberry cranberry strawberry raspberry c tartaric acid in the grape pineapple c some place these under class iii or food adjuncts oxalic acid except when in the insoluble state of calcium oxalate and several other acids are poisonous proteids or albuminoids are frequently termed fleshformers they are composed of nitrogen carbon hydrogen oxygen and a small quantity of sulphur and are extremely complex bodies their chief function is to form flesh in the body but without previously forming it they may be transformed into fat or merely give rise to heat they form the essential part of every living cell proteids are excreted from the body as water carbon dioxide urea uric acid sulphates c the principal proteids of animal origin have their corresponding proteids in the vegetable kingdom some kinds whether of animal or vegetable origin are more easily digested than others they have the same physiological value from whichever kingdom they are derived the osseids comprise ossein gelatin cartilage c from bone skin and connective issue they approach the proteids in composition but unlike them they cannot form flesh or fulfil the same purpose in nutrition some food chemists wish to call the osseids albuminoids what were formerly termed albuminoids to be always spoken of as proteids only jellies are of little use as food not only is this because of the low nutritive value of gelatin but also on account of the small quantity which is mixed with a large proportion of water the vegetable kingdom is the prime source of all organic food water and to a slight extent salts form the only food that animals can derive directly from the inorganic kingdom when man consumes animal fooda sheep for examplehe is only consuming a portion of the food which that sheep obtained from grass clover turnips c all the proteids of the flesh once existed as proteids in the vegetables some in exactly the same chemical form flesh contains no starch or sugar but a small quantity of glycogen the fat in an animal is derived from the carbohydrates the fats and the proteids of the vegetables consumed the soil that produced the herbage grain and roots consumed by cattle in most cases could have produced food capable of direct utilisation by man by passing the product of the soil through animals there is an enormous economic loss as the greater part of that food is dissipated in maintaining the life and growth little remains as flesh when the animal is delivered into the hands of the butcher some imagine that flesh food is more easily converted into flesh and blood in our bodies and is consequently more valuable than similar constituents in vegetables but such is not the case fat whether from flesh or from vegetables is digested in the same manner the proteids of flesh like those of vegetables are converted into peptone by the digestive juicestaking the form of a perfectly diffusible liquidotherwise they could not be absorbed and utilised by the body thus the products of digestion of both animal and vegetable proteids and fats are the same formerly proteid matter was looked upon as the most valuable part of the food and a large proportion was thought necessary for hard work it was thought to be required not only for the construction of the muscle substance but to be utilised in proportion to muscular exertion these views are now known to be wrong a comparatively small quantity of proteid matter such as is easily obtained from vegetable food is ample for the general needs of the body increased muscular exertion requires but a slight increase of this food constituent it is the carbohydrates or carbohydrates and fats that should be eaten in larger quantity as these are the main source of muscular energy the fact that animals capable of the most prolonged and powerful exertion thrive on vegetables of comparatively low proteid value and that millions of the strongest races have subsisted on what most englishmen would consider a meagre vegetarian diet should have been sufficient evidence against the earlier view a comparison of flesh and vegetable food shows in flesh an excessive quantity of proteid matter a very small quantity of glycogen the animal equivalent of starch and sugar and a variable quantity of fat vegetable food differs much but as a rule it contains a much smaller quantity of proteid matter a large proportion of starch and sugar and a small quantity of fat some vegetable foods particularly nuts contain much fat investigation of the digestive processes has shown that the carbohydrates and fats entail little strain on the system their ultimate products are water and carbon dioxide which are easily disposed of the changes which the proteids undergo in the body are very complicated there is ample provision in the body for their digestion metabolism and final rejection when taken in moderate quantity as is the case in a dietary of vegetables the proteids in the human body after fulfilling their purpose are in part expelled in the same way as the carbohydrates but the principal part including all the nitrogen is expelled by the kidneys in the form of urea a very soluble substance and a small quantity of uric acid in the form of quadurates there is reciprocity between the teeth and digestive organs of animals and their natural food the grasses leaves c which are consumed by the herbivora contain a large proportion of cellulose and woody tissue consequently the food is bulky it is but slowly disintegrated and the nutritious matter liberated and digested the cellulose appears but slightly acted upon by the digestive juices the herbivora possess capacious stomachs and the intestines are very long the carnivora have simpler digestive organs and short intestines even they consume substances which leave much indigestible residue such as skin ligaments and bones but civilised man when living on a flesh dietary removes as much of such things as possible the monkeys apes and man comprised in the order primates have a digestive canal intermediate in complexity and in length to the herbivora and carnivora a certain quantity of indigestible matter is necessary for exciting peristaltic action of the bowels the carnivora with their short intestinal canal need the least the frugivora more and the herbivora a much larger quantity the consumption by man of what is commonly called concentrated food is the cause of the constipation to which flesheating nations are subject most of the pills and other nostrums which are used in enormous quantities contain aloes or other drugs which stimulate the action of the intestines highly manufactured foods from which as much as possible of the nonnutritious matter has been removed is often advocated generally by those interested in its sale such food would be advantageous only if it were possible to remove or modify a great part of our digestive canal we are omitting from consideration certain diseased conditions when such foods may be useful the eminent physiologist and bacteriologist elie metchnikoff has given it as his opinion that much of mans digestive organs is not only useless but often productive of derangement and disease in several cases where it has been necessary in consequence of serious disease to remove the entire stomach or a large part of the intestines the digestive functions have been perfectly performed it is not that our organs are at fault but our habits of life differ from that of our progenitors in past times when a simple dietary in which flesh food formed little or no part and today in those countries where one wholly or nearly all derived from vegetable sources and simply prepared is the rule diseases of the digestive organs are rare the englishman going to a tropical country and partaking largely of flesh and alcohol suffers from disease of the liver and other organs to which the natives and the few of his own countrymen living in accordance with natural laws are strangers indigestible matterfood is never entirely digested as a reason against confining ourselves solely to vegetable food it has been stated that such is less perfectly digested than animal food and that it therefore throws more work on the digestive organs it is also urged that on this account a greater quantity of vegetable food is required we have shown elsewhere that on the contrary vegetarians are satisfied with a smaller amount of food man requires a small quantity of woody fibre or cellulose in his food to stimulate intestinal action and prevent constipation it is difficult to determine how much of a food is unassimilated in the body this is for the reason of the intestinal refuse consisting not only of undigested food but also of residues of the digestive juices mucus and epithelial debris these latter have been shown to amount to from onethird to onehalf of the whole of the fces which is much more than had previously been supposed john goodfellow has shown that of very coarse wholemeal bread quite 14 per cent was undigested whilst bread made from ordinary grade wholemeal showed 125 per cent such a method of analysis was adopted as it was believed would exclude other than the food waste the experiments were made on a person who was eating nothing but the bread it seems probable that a smaller proportion would have remained unassimilated had the bread not formed the sole food it is advisable that wheatmeal he ground as finely as possible the coarse is not only to a less extent assimilated but apt to irritate the bowels notwithstanding that fine white bread gave only 42 per cent and a coarse white bread 49 per cent of waste a fine wheatmeal bread is more economical as the same quantity of wheat produces a greater weight of flour richer in proteid and mineral matter from a large number of experiments with man it has been calculated that of proteids there is digested when animal food is eaten 98 per cent from cereals and sugars 8 per cent from vegetables and fruits 80 per cent the difference between the proportions digested of the other food constituents was much less although there is here a theoretical advantage in favour of animal food there are other considerations of far more importance than a little undigestible waste the main question is one of health in some dietary experiments of a girl aged 7 living upon a fruit diet of whom we have given some particulars elsewhere professor jaffa gives the following particulars during the ten days trial the percentages absorbed were proteids 825 fat 869 nitrogen free extract 96 crude fibre 80 ash 57 heat of combustion in calories 867 he says generally speaking the food was quite thoroughly assimilated the coefficients of digestibility being about the same as are found in an ordinary mixed diet it is interesting to note that 80 per cent of the crude fibre appeared to be digested the results of a number of foreign experiments on the digestibility of crude fibre by man are from 30 to 914 per cent the former value being from mixed wheat and rye and the latter in a diet made of rice vegetables

notes on the table of analysisunder calories are shown kilocalories per pound of food in the analysis marked u the crude fibre or cellulose is included with the carbohydrate the figures being those given in atwaters table he has found that from 30 to 91 per cent of the crude fibre was digested according to the kind of food the term fibre or cellulose in analytical tables is not a very definite one it depends upon the details of the method of analysis in the analyses other than u the cellulose is excluded in calculating the calories nutrient ratio is the proportion of the sum of the carbohydrate and fat compared with the proteid as 1 the fat has first been multiplied by 2225 to bring it to the same nutrient value as the carbohydrate u indicates that the analyses are taken from the united states department of agriculture experimental station bulletin 28 the tests being chiefly made by dr wo atwater or under his direction they are average analyses of several samples the

the food has been analysed and under refuse in brackets is shown the quantity rejected before the analysis was made there is considerable variation in the same kind of food according to the variety of seed and conditions of growth c especially is this the case with wheat and flour whenever it has been possible the average of the analyses of many samples have been given the method of analysis has not always been uniform frequently the cellulose is included with the carbohydrates and the proteid sometimes includes a very appreciable quantity of nonproteid nitrogenous matter this is the case in

practice is abhorrent to every person of refinement cooking lessens the offensive appearance and qualities of flesh and changes the flavour thorough cooking also destroys any parasites that may be present raw flesh is more stimulating to the animal passions and excites ferocity in both man and animals if the old argument was valid that as flesh is much nearer in composition and quality to our own flesh and tissues it is therefore our best food we do wrong in coagulating the albuminoids hardening the muscle substance and scorching it by cooking fruits when ripe and in good condition are best eaten raw cooking spoils the flavour food requiring mastication and encouraging insalivation is the best food is frequently made too sloppy or liquid and is eaten too hot thus favouring indigestion and decay of the teeth the cereals and pulses can only with difficulty be eaten raw when cooked in water the starch granules swell and break up the plant cells are ruptured the fibres are separated and the nutritious matter rendered easy of digestion the flavour is greatly improved cooking increases our range and variety of food the civilised races use it to excess and overseason their dishes favouring overeating if baking powders are used they should only be of the best makes they should be composed of sodium bicarbonate and tartaric acid in such correct proportions that upon the addition of water only sodium tartrate and carbon dioxide carbonic acid should result some powders contain an excess of sodium bicarbonate selfraising flours should be avoided they are commonly composed ofin addition to sodium bicarbonateacid calcium phosphate calcium superphosphate and calcium sulphate common baking powders often consist of the same ingredients and sometimes also of magnesia and alum these are often made and sold by ignorant men whose sole object is to make money calcium superphosphate and acid calcium phosphate very frequently contain arsenic and as the cheap commercial qualities are often used there is danger in this direction a good formula for baking powder is tartaric acid 8 ozs sodium bicarbonate 9 ozs rice flour 10 to 20 ozs the last is added to baking powders to improve the keeping quality and to add bulk the ingredients must be first carefully dried the sodium bicarbonate at not too high a temperature or it decomposes and then thoroughly mixed this must be preserved in well closed and dry bottles another formula which is slow rising and well adapted for pastry is sodium bicarbonate 4 ozs cream of tartar 9 ozs rice flour about 14 ozs custard powders consist of starch colouring and flavouring egg powders are similar to baking powders but contain yellow colouring little objection can be taken to them if they are coloured with saffron turmeric would do if it were not that it gives a slightly unpleasant taste artificial colouring matters or coal tar derivatives are much used several of these are distinctly poisonous drinksit is better not to drink during eating or insalivation may be interfered with a drink is better taken at the end of a meal the practice of washing down food with hot tea is bad the refreshing nature of a cup of hot tea coffee or cocoa is to a very great extent due to the warmth of the water the benefit is felt at once before the alkaloid can enter the blood stream and stimulate the nerve centres hot water not too hot to cause congestion of the mucous membrane is one of the best drinks when the purity of the water supply is doubtful there is advantage in first bringing it to the boil as pathogenic bacteria are destroyed some find it beneficial to drink a cup of hot water the first thing in the morning this cleanses the stomach from any accumulation of mucus if fruit succulent vegetables or cooked food containing much water be freely used and there be little perspiration it is possible to do without drinking but there is danger of taking insufficient water to hold freely in solution the waste products excreted by the body aerated drinks except a very few of the best and nonalcoholic beers and wines are generally unwholesome from their containing preservatives foaming powders artificial flavourings c stimulantstea and coffee contain an alkaloid theine besides volatile oils tannin c cocoa contains the milder alkaloid theobromine they stimulate the heart and nervous systems tea and coffee have also a diuretic effect formerly they were erroneously thought to lessen tissue waste these alkaloids being purins are open to the general objections named elsewhere stimulants do not impart energy or force of any kind but only call forth reserve strength by exciting the heart nervous system c to increased activity this is followed by a depression which is as great generally greater than the previous stimulation except perhaps as an occasional medicine stimulants should be avoided analysis of cocoa shows a good proportion of proteids and a very large quantity of fat the claim that it is a valuable and nutritious food would only be true if it could be eaten in such quantities as are other foods bread fruits c were this attempted poisoning would result from the large quantity of alkaloid the food value of half a spoonful or thereabouts of cocoa is insignificant certain much advertised cocoa mixtures are ridiculous in their pretentions unscientific in preparation and often injurious cerealsthe most valuable is wheat from its proteid being chiefly in the form known as gluten from its tenacity gluten enables a much better loaf to be produced from wheat than from any other cereal the outer part of the grain is the richest in mineral matter and proteid wheatmeal bread shows a considerably higher proteid value than white a large proportion of the proteid in the outer coats of the wheat berry is however not digested and in some experiments the waste has been enough to quite nullify its seeming advantage over white bread coarsely ground sharp branny particles in bread irritate the intestines and cause excessive waste of nutriment but finely ground wheatmeal is free from this objection and is beneficial in preventing constipation the comparative value of white and brown bread has been much discussed it depends both on the quality of the bread and the condition of the digestive organs experiments on the digestion of bread and other things have often been made on persons unaccustomed to such foods or the foods have been given in excessive quantity to those accustomed to it good wheatmeal bread is much pleasanter more satisfying and better flavoured than white indeed the latter is described as insipid most bakers bread is of unsatisfactory quality flour and bread contain very little fat the absence of which is considered a defect this is remedied by the addition of butter fat or oil or by nuts c which are rich in oil these may be mixed with the flour prior to cooking or used afterwards oats contain a substance called avenin apparently an alkaloid which has an irritating action the quantity is variable it is to this that the socalled heating effect of oatmeal on some persons is due prepared cereals or breakfast foodsanalyses were made of 34 of these cereal preparations by weems and ellis iowa state college agricultural bulletin 1904 they report that the foods possess no nutritive value in excess of ordinary food materials that the claim made for many predigested foods are valueless and no reliance can be placed on the statement that they are remedies for any disease oatmeal and other cereals are sold in packets as being partially cooked we do not doubt that they have been subjected to a dry heat but this has scarcely any effect on their starch and other constituents the difference is a mechanical one in rolled oats the grains are so cracked and broken that on boiling with water the water readily penetrates and more quickly cooks them throughout there are other prepared cereal foods but we doubt whether they are thoroughly cooked after the short boiling directed on the labels they are a great convenience where it is difficult to get the time necessary for cooking the ordinary cereals coarsely ground wheat is too irritating when made into porridge but there are some granulated wheats sold in packets which are quite suitable the ralston breakfast food is excellent they are rich in the phosphates and salts found in the outer part of the grain one cereal preparation called grape nuts has had its starch converted into maltose and dextrin maltose being a sugar by a scientific application of the diastase of the grain it is consequently easier of digestion and requires no cooking it is beneficial for some forms of indigestion there are several competing foods of less merit the starch being less perfectly changed one at least of which is objectionably salt properly cooked starch is readily digested by healthy persons and for them malted food is of no special value pulse or legumes includes haricots and other beans peas and lentils the proteid contained is that variety known as legumin which is either the same or is closely allied to the casein of milk and cheese pulse is very rich in proteid the dried kinds in general use contain 24 or 25 per cent the richest is the soybean which is used in china and japan it contains 35 per cent besides 19 per cent of fat pulse requires thorough cooking haricots taking the longest time split lentils are cooked sooner and are better digested this is chiefly due to the removal of the skins the haricots bought from small grocers who have a slow sale are often old and will not cook tender pulse is best adapted to the labouring classes the sedentary should eat it sparingly it is liable to cause flatulence or accumulation of gas in the intestines and constipation haricots are easier to digest when mashed and mixed with other food pulse was formerly stated to leave much undigested residue recent experiments have shown that it is satisfactorily digested under favourable conditions strmpell found beans in their skins to leave a large proportion of proteid matter unabsorbed lentil meal mixed with other food was digested in a perfectly satisfactory manner another experimenter rubner found that when even the very large quantity of 118 pound of dried split peas per day were eaten only 17 per cent of proteid matter was unabsorbed which compares very well with the 11 per cent of proteid left from a macaroni diet with which the same man was fed at another time had a reasonable quantity of peas been eaten per day the quantity undigested would probably have differed little from that of other foods nuts are as a rule very rich in oil and contain a fair proportion of proteid when well masticated they are a very valuable food walnuts are one of the best and the kernels can be purchased shelled thus avoiding much trouble they can be finely ground in a nutmill and used for several purposes mixed in the proportion of about two ounces to the pound of wheatmeal they produce a rich flavoured bread they can also he used in sweet cakes and in rich puddings to increase their food value lightness and taste pine kernels being very oily can be used with flour in the place of lard or butter fruits are generally looked upon as luxuries rather than as food capable of supplying a meal or a substantial part of one they are usually eaten only when the appetite has been appeased by what is considered more substantial fare fresh fruits contain a larger proportion of water than nearly all other raw foods and consequently the proportion of nourishment is small but we must not despise them on this account milk contains as much or more water certain foods which in the raw state contain very little water such as the pulses and cereals when cooked absorb a very large quantity this is particularly the case in making porridge cabbage cauliflower spanish onions and turnips after cooking contain even 97 per cent of water roast beef contains on an average 48 per cent and cooked round steak with fat removed 63 per cent of water it is customary at meal times to drink water tea coffee beer wine c when a meal contains any considerable quantity of fresh fruits there need be no desire to drink notwithstanding that fruits contain so much water a dietary consisting of fruits with nuts to which may be added bread and vegetables will contain less water than the total quantity usually consumed by a person taking the more customary highly cooked and seasoned foods an advantage is that the water in fruits is in a wholesome condition free from the pollution often met with in the water used for drinking purposes raw fruits favour mastication with its consequent advantages whilst cooked and soft food discourages it plums and what are termed stone fruits if eaten in more than very small quantities are apt to disagree persons with good digestions can take fruit with bread biscuits and with uncooked foods without any inconvenience fruit is more likely to disagree when taken in conjunction with elaborately cooked foods many cannot take fruit especially if it be acid at the same time as cereal or starchy substances and the difficulty is said to be greater at the mornings meal if the indigestion produced is due to the acid of the fruit preventing the saliva acting on the starch scientific principles would direct that the fruit be eaten quite towards the end of the meal the same consideration condemns the use of mint sauce cucumber and vinegar or pickles with potatoes and bread or even mint sauce with green peas bananas are an exception as not interfering with the digestion of starch bananas are generally eaten in an unripe condition white and somewhat mealy they should be kept until the starch has been converted into sugar when they are both more pleasant and wholesome nuts and fruit go well together for a portable meal stoned raisins or other dried fruit and walnut kernels or other nuts are excellent what has been called a defect in most fruits is the fact that the proteid is small in proportion to the other constituents this has been too much dwelt upon owing to the prevailing exaggerated idea of the quantity of proteid required the tomato contains a large proportion though the water is very high bananas grapes and strawberries contain to each part of proteid from 10 to 12 parts of other solid nutritive constituents any oil being calculated into starch equivalents this is termed the nutritive ratio although this may seem a small proportion of proteid there are reasons for believing that it is sufficient taking the average of 29 analyses of american apples a nutritive ratio of 33 was obtained if it were suggested that life should be sustained on apples alone this small quantity of proteid would be an insurmountable difficulty as the addition of nuts or other nutritious food sufficiently increases the proteid no objection can with justice be made against the use of fruit a study of our teeth digestive organs and general structure and of comparative anatomy points to fruits nuts and succulent vegetables as our original diet the potash and other salts of the organic acids in fruits tend to keep the blood properly alkaline where there is a tendency to the deposition of uric acid in the body they hinder its formation citric tartaric malic and other organic acids exist in fruits in combination with potash and other bases as well as in the free state the free acids in fruits when eaten combine with the alkalies in the intestinal tract and are absorbed by the body and pass into the blood not as acids but as neutral salts here they are converted into potassium carbonate or some other carbonate fruit acids never make the blood acid but the reverse fruit salts and acids are antiscorbutic fruits have often proved of the greatest benefit in illness what is known as the grape cure has been productive of much good lemons and oranges have also been of great benefit strawberries have been craved for and have proved of the greatest advantage in some extreme cases of illness when more concentrated food could not be endured fruit is coming into greater use especially owing to its better distribution and lessened cost fruit is not as cheap as it should be as it can be produced in great abundance at little cost and with comparatively little labour the price paid by the public greatly exceeds the real cost of production a very large proportion often the greater part of the cost to the consumer goes in railway and other rates and in middlemens profits it is commonly cheaper to bring fruit from over the sea including land carriage on either side than it is to transport english produce from one part of our country to another english homegrown fruit would be cheaper were it not for the difficulty of buying suitable land at a reasonable price and the cost of transit for the production of prime fruit there is a lack of sufficient intelligence of scientific culture and cooperation vegetablesusing the name in its popular sensecontain valuable saline constituents or salts by the usual method of cooking a large proportion of the salts is lost it is better to steam than to boil them the fibrous portion of vegetables is not all digested but it is useful in stimulating the peristaltic action of the bowels and lessening any tendency to constipation vegetables are more especially useful to nonvegetarians to correct the defects of their other food the potato belongs to a poisonous orderthe solanac there is a little alkaloid in the skin but this is lost in the cooking the eyes and sprouting portions contain the most and should be cut out fungithere are about a hundred edible species in this country but many of the fungi are poisonous some intensely so it can scarcely be expected that these lowly organised plants differing so much in their manner of growth from the green or chlorophyll bearing plants can be particularly nourishing it is only the fructifying part which appears above the ground that is generally eaten it is of very rapid growth of 9 edible fungi of 4 species obtained in the belgrade market the average amount of water was 893 per cent leaving only 107 per cent of solid matter the average of fat was 055 per cent the food value of fungi has been greatly overrated in most of the analyses given in textbooks and elsewhere the total nitrogen has been multiplied by 625 and the result expressed as proteid the amount of nitrogen in a form useless for the purpose of nutrition is about a third of the whole of the remainder or proteid nitrogen it is said much is not assimilated sometimes quite half owing to the somewhat indigestible character of the fungi an analysis of the common mushroom gave proteids 22 per cent amides useless nitrogenous compounds 13 per cent and water 937 per cent the fungi are of inferior nutritive value to many fresh vegetables and are much more expensive their chief value is as a flavouring milk and eggs are permissible in a vegetarian dietary and as a rule vegetarians use them eggs with the exception of such as are unfertile are of course alive but they have no conscious existence and cannot be said to suffer any pain on being killed and eaten an objection to their use as food is that on an egg and poultry farm the superfluous male birds are killed and as the hens become unprofitable layers they are also killed a similar humane objection applies to the use of cows milk by man the calves are deprived of part of their natural food the deficiency being perhaps made up by unnatural farinaceous milk substitutes many of the calves especially the bull calves are killed thus leaving all the milk for human use when cows cease to yield sufficient milk they too are slaughtered milch cows are commonly kept in unhealthy houses deprived of exercise and pure air crowded together with filthy evil smelling floors reeking with their excrements tended by uncleanly people with no exercise and a rich stimulating diet they produce more milk but it is no matter for surprise that tuberculosis is common amongst them when the lesions of tubercle consumption are localised and not excessive the rest of the carcase is passed by veterinary surgeons as fit for food were it otherwise enormous quantities of meat would be destroyed as butchers meat is seldom officially inspected but a very small part is judged by the butchers as too bad for food in mitigation it may be said that poultry lead a happy existence and their death is or should be quickly produced with but little pain probably less pain than if left to die from natural causes the same cannot be said of cattle and sheep when the time arrives for their transport to the slaughter mans it is argued by vegetarians who take milk and animal products that they are not responsible for the death of the animals as they do not eat their flesh as vegetarians profit by conditions in which the slaughtering of the animals is a part they cannot be altogether exonerated cows milk is prone to absorb bad odours and it forms a most suitable breeding or nutrient medium for most species of bacteria which may accidentally get therein by means of milk many epidemics have been spread of scarlet fever diphtheria cholera and typhoid occasionally milk contains tubercle bacilli from the cows themselves by boiling all bacteria except a few which may be left out of consideration are destroyed such a temperature however renders the milk less digestible and wholesome for infants by heating to 160 f or 170 f for a few minutes such pathogenic germs as are at all likely to be in milk tubercle typhoid diphtheria c are killed and the value of the milk is but little affected this is called pasteurising it was until quite recently a common practice to add boric acid formaldehyde and other preservatives this has injured the vitality and caused the death of many infants they have not yet gone quite out of use for infants the only satisfactory food is that of a healthy mother on account of physical defects in the mother or often for merely selfish reasons the infant is deprived of its natural food many attempts have been made to bring cows milk to approximately the same composition as human milk it can be done by adding water milk sugar and cream of known composition in certain proportions great difficulties are met with when this is put into practice the simplest method is that of professor soxhlet the proper quantity of milk sugar is added but instead of adding the right quantity of cream or fata very difficult thing to dothe equivalent quantity of extra milk sugar is used although not theoretically satisfactory in practice it answers very well we have found it to agree very well with infants to cows milk of pure average quality add half its volume of water containing 123 per cent of milk sugar or what amounts to the same thing to a pint of cows milk add one and a quarter ounce of milk sugar and halfapint of water it is preferable to pasteurise by placing the bottle of milk in a vessel of water this water is to be heated until the milk shows a temperature of about 75 c or 165 f but must not exceed 80 c or a change in the albumen of the milk takes place which affects its digestibility keep at this temperature for about ten minutes if not required at once a plug of cotton wool should be placed in the neck of the bottle and it should be kept in a cold place until required professor soxhlet does not advise the addition of lime water the proteids are not of the same composition as in human milk the calf being a ruminating animaland it is a common plan to add water or barley water to milk until it is so watered down that it cannot curdle into tough curds an infant has thus either to distend its stomach with a large quantity of watery nourishment or else to get insufficient food sometimes it is necessary to peptonise the milk a little at the leipzig infants hospital and also the hygienic institute they give to infants up to 9 months old prof soxhlets mixture except that an equal volume of water is added to the milk milk cheese and especially hens eggs contain a very large proportion of proteid when added to food poor in proteid they improve its nutritive quality it has often been said and with truth that some vegetarians by the profuse use of animal products consume as much or even more proteid of animal origin than the average person who includes flesh food in his dietary an excess of proteid from these sources is less injurious as eggs contain no purins and milk but a very small quantity in support of the use of animal products it may be said that we have become so fond of animal foods and stimulating drinks that the use of milk butter cheese and eggs renders the transition to a dietary derived from the vegetable kingdom much easier by means of these cooked dishes can be produced which approach and sometimes can scarcely be distinguished from those of cooked flesh in the present state of society when really good vegetarian fare is difficult to procure away from home eggs cheese and milk are a great convenience digestionthe digestive juices contain certain unorganised ferments which produce chemical changes in the food if the food is solid it has to be liquefied even if already liquid it has generally to undergo a chemical change before being fitted for absorption into the body the alimentary canal is a tubular passage which is first expanded into the mouth and later into the stomach as the food passes down it is acted upon by several digestive juices and in the small intestine the nutritive matter is absorbed whilst the residue passes away the saliva is the first digestive juice it is alkaline and contains a ferment called ptyalin this acts energetically on the cooked and gelatinous starch and slowly on the raw starch starch is quite insoluble in water but the first product of salivary digestion is a less complex substance called solublestarch when time is allowed for the action to be completed the starch is converted into one of the sugars called maltose in infants this property of acting on starch does not appear in effective degree until the sixth or seventh month and starch should not be given before that time only a small quantity should be provided before the twelfth month when it may be gradually increased dr sims wallace has suggested that the eruption of the lower incisors from the seventh to the eighth month was for the purpose of enabling the infantin the precooking stage of mans existenceto pierce the outer covering of fruits so as to permit his extracting the soluble contents by suction and accordingly when these teeth are cut we may allow the child to bite at such vegetable substances as apples oranges and sugar cane dr harry campbell says that starch should be given to the young not as is the custom as liquid or pap but in a form compelling vigorous mastication for it is certain that early man from the time he emerged from the ape till he discovered how to cook his vegetable food obtained practically all his starch in such a form if it is given as liquid or pap it will pass down as starch into the stomach to setup disturbance in that organ while if it is administered in a form which obliges the child to chew it properly not only will the jaws the teeth and the gums obtain the exercise which they crave and without which they cannot develop normally but the starch will be thoroughly insalivated that much of it will be converted within the mouth into maltose hard well baked crusts constitute a convenient form in which to administer starch to children a piece of crust may be put in the oven and rebaked and spread with butter later we may give hard plain biscuits dr campbell continues that he does not say that starch in the pappy form or as porridge should find no place whatever in mans dietary at the present day but we should arrange that a large proportion of our food is in a form inviting mastication the teeth perform the very important function of breaking down our food and enabling it to be intimately incorporated with the saliva and afterwards with the digestive juices the anglosaxon race shows a greater tendency to degeneracy in the teeth than do other races the teeth of the present generation are less perfect than those of previous generations a dentist writes lancet 19032 p 1054 i have had the opportunity of examining the teeth of many natives in their more or less uncivilised state from the red indians of north america the negroes of africa to the more civilised chinese japanese and indians of the east and i have usually found them possessed of sound teeth but so soon as they come under the influence of civilised life in washington montreal london paris and other cities their teeth begin to degenerate though their general health may remain good in a long article on mastication in the lancet 19032 p 84 from which we have already quoted dr harry campbell gives as the effect of thorough and efficient mastication that it increases the amount of alkaline saliva passing into the stomach and prolongs the period of starch digestion within that organ that it influences the stomach reflexly by promoting the flow of gastric juice that the frequent use of the jaws and the tongue during the period of growth cause the jaws to expand if the jaws are not adequately exercised during this period owing to the use of soft food they do not reach their normal size the teeth are overcrowded do not develop fully and are prone to decay the effect of vigorous mastication is to stimulate the circulation in the tooth pulp which promotes nutrition and maintains a firm dental setting dr campbell writes i am perfectly at one with dr wallace in believing that the removal of the fibrous portion of food is the main cause of the prevalence of caries among moderns when the food reaches the stomach gastric juice is secreted this juice contains a ferment called pepsin and hydrochloric acid pepsin is only active in an acid media starch digestion proceeds in the stomach to such a timestated as from 15 to 30 minuteswhen the acid gastric juice has been poured out in sufficient quantity to neutralise the alkalinity of the saliva the gastric juice acts upon the proteids only after a time the liquefied contents of the stomach are passed into the first portion of the small intestine called the duodenum here it meets with the pancreatic juice which like the gastric juice attacks proteids but even more energetically and only in an alkaline media the proteolitic ferment is called trypsin the pancreatic the most important of the digestive fluids contains other ferments one called amylopsin takes up the digestion of any remaining or imperfectly converted starch left from the salivary digestion amylopsin is much more powerful and rapid than the ptyalin of the saliva especially on uncooked starch its absence from the pancreatic juice of infants is an indication that starch should not be given them another ferment stearopsin emulsifies fats the bile is alkaline and assists the pancreatic juice in neutralising the acid mixture that leaves the stomach it also assists the absorption of fats the digestion of proteids is not completed in the stomach there are some who look upon the stomach as chiefly of use as a receptacle for the large mass of food which is too quickly eaten to be passed at once into the intestines the food being gradually expelled from the stomach in such quantities as the duodenal digestion can adequately treat a frequently used table showing the time required for the digestion of various foods in the stomach is of little practical value there is ample provision for the digestion of food there is a duplication of ferments for the proteids and starch in health the ferments are not only very active but are secreted in ample quantities the digestive or unorganised ferments must not be confused with the organised ferments such as yeast the latter are living vegetable cells capable of indefinite multiplication the former are soluble bodies and though capable of transforming or digesting some thousands of times their mass of food their power in this direction is restricted within definite limits another and preferable name for them is enzymes the action of saliva on starch is powerfully retarded by tea this is due to the tannin coffee and cocoa are without effect tea infused for two minutes only was not found to have sensibly less restraining effect than when infused for thirty minutes on peptic digestion both tea and coffee had a powerful retarding effect when of equal strength cocoa was nearly as bad but as it is usually taken much weaker its inhibitory effect is of little consequence bacteria are minute vegetable organisms which exist in the dust of the air in water and almost everywhere on or near the surface of the earth they are consequently taken in with our food they exist in the mouth those in carious teeth are often sufficient to injuriously affect digestion and health the healthy gastric juice is to a great degree antiseptic but few bacteria being able to endure its acidity when the residue of the food reaches the large intestine bacteria are found in very great numbers the warmth of the body is highly favourable to their growth they cause the food and intestinal debris to assume its fcal character should the mass be retained the bacterial poisons accumutate and being absorbed into the body produce headaches exhaustion neurasthenia and other complaints proteid matter the products of its decomposition and nitrogenous matter generally are especially the food of bacteria this is shown in the offensiveness of the fces of the carnivora notwithstanding their short intestines compared with that of the herbivora also in the difference of the fces of the dog when fed on flesh and on a nearly vegetable diet on a rich proteid diet especially if it consists largely of flesh the bacterial products in the intestines are greater than on a vegetable diet on the latter such a disease as appendicitis is rare professor elie metchnikoff of the pasteur institute thinks that mans voluminous and highly developed large intestine fulfils no useful purpose and on account of its breeding a very copious and varied bacterial flora could with advantage be dispensed with he also has said that man who could support himself on food easily digestible has a small intestine which is disproportionately fully developed instead of having between 18 and 21 feet of small intestine man might do with onethird of that length according to him there is a disharmony of our food and our digestive system referring to such views and the desire of some surgeons to remove the vermiform appendix and portions of the intestines upon too little provocation sir w macewin md frs b medical jrn 1904 2 p 874 saysis this human body of ours so badly constructed that it contains so many useless parts and requires so much tinkering possibly i may be out of fashion with the times as i cannot find such imperfections in the normal human body as are alleged on the contrary the more one looks into the human body and sees it work the better one understands it and the more one is struck with the wondrous utility beauty and harmony of all its parts our food we can change but not our organsexcept by a dangerous surgical operations our teeth with our complex and very long intestines are adapted for fibrous bulky and solid food on such food mankind has lived for an immense period of time it is true that there are several theoretical advantages in cooked vegetable foods but unfortunately there is a want of conformity with our digestive organs if a flesh diet is taken the incongruity is greater concentrated food causes constipation an active man leading an outofdoor life can take unsuitable food with little or no apparent inconvenience the movements of his body favouring intestinal action whilst the same food to a sedentary person will prove distinctly injurious some persons have such a vigorous digestion that they can consume almost any food even that which is obviously unsuitable not only bad in kind but excessive in quantity other persons have to be very careful many have boasted that they can take of what they call the good things of life to their full without bad effect we know of such men who have been much esteemed for their joviality and good nature but who have broken down in what should have been a hearty and useful middle life there are others who were poorly equipped for the battle of life with indifferent constitutions never having had the buoyancy and overflowing of animal spirits but who by conserving such strength as they had have outlived all their more healthy but less careful comrades the errors of the parents are often most evident in the children or grandchildren there are many persons who cannot eat of some particular food although it may be quite wholesome to others sometimes it is a psychological rather than a physiological disability which may he overcome by an effort of the will at other times it seems to have no connection with the imagination although it is not always possible to give a sound reason for it in the main of course there are principles of dietetics applicable to all alike but in regard to details everyone should make rules for himself according to his experience when there appears no real reason for an idiosyncrasy a little humouring of our taste and digestion will often overcome it to our advantage it is generally those of delicate constitution who are most sensitive some cannot eat oatmeal except in small quantity olive and other vegetable oils even when of good quality cannot be taken by many people whilst others find them quite as wholesome or even better than butter vegetarians can generally detect lard in pastry both by its taste and its after effects although those accustomed to this fat do not object to it it is also surprising how some individuals tastes and habits will vary at different periods of their lives one form of dyspepsia is due to undigested starch remaining in the stomach and causing an excessive secretion of hydrochloric acid as long as proteid food is present the pepsin and acid expend themselves on it and are removed together the undigested starch continues to stimulate gastric secretion and the acid residuum causes pain heartburn and flatulence if there be also any butyric acid or some other fatty acid derived from milk butter cheese c there will be acid eructations for this form of indigestion there are several methods of treatment first the very thorough cooking of all starchy food and it is an advantage to take a little good extract of malt either at the time of eating or directly afterwards the diastase of the malt has the same action on starch as the ptyalin in the saliva it is better scientifically to have the farinaceous food at about 130 f as hot as the mouth can bear will do and then to add malt extract on keeping the mixture warm from a few minutes to half an hour or more the starch is digested and rendered soluble such food is not very pleasant to take the food known as grape nuts has been treated in a similar manner the use of malt extract however seems a clumsy substitute for salivary digestion second the eating of starch in the form of hard and dry biscuits crusts and other hard food which demand thorough mastication and insalivation and the keeping in the mouth for a long while during which the saliva has time to act this is the best plan third the taking of sodium bicarbonate towards the end of the period of digestion in order to neutralise the acid in the stomach this gives relief but does not cure as the dose has to be repeated after each meal in course of time the quantity of soda has sometimes to be increased to an alarming extent fourth the abstention from starchy foods and the substitution of an exclusive flesh dietary in the salisbury treatment raw minced beef is given this method often gives immediate relief but its ultimate effect on the kidneys and other organs is very bad no hard and fast rule can be laid down as to the number of meals into which the daily amount of food required should be divided the stomach appears to work to the best advantage when it is full or nearly so and the appetite is appeased three approximately equal meals seems to be a convenient division dr dewey and his followers advise only two meals a day and it seems incontestable that many persons find the plan advantageous these are generally adults with weak digestions or elderly persons who on account of their age and the sluggish action of their assimilative functions require comparatively little food children on account of their vigorous vitality rapid growth and hearty appetites ought not to be restricted to this number persons who have got into the pernicious habit of greatly overeating and whose stomachs have become distended and unusually large sometimes find it easier to restrict their daily food to a healthy quantity by taking only two meals the general objections against two meals are that either two little food is taken or the ingestion of such a large quantity is bad for the stomach and causes it to press on the adjacent viscera the large quantity of blood and nerve force drawn to the overdistended stomach depletes the brain and nervous system causing drowsiness and incapacity for mental and physical work the carnivora whose opportunity for obtaining foodunlike the herbivorais irregular and often at long intervals gorge themselves upon opportunity and are in the habit of sleeping after a meal the frugivora and herbivora however are alert and ready to fly from their enemies should such appear the conveying of so much nourishment to the liver and blood stream at one time is probably a greater tax on them a light lunch between the usual full meals has nothing to recommend it the stomach is burdened to little purpose often before it has finished with one meal another is imposed upon it no time being left for recuperation dietariesthe best proportions of proteids carbohydrates and fats required for the nourishment of the body has not yet been conclusively decided the common plan is to average the dietary of large bodies of persons particualrly of soldiers and prisoners these dietaries have been adjusted empirically the earlier ones at least and are generally considered as satisfactory they are chiefly of english and german origin another method is to laboriously analyse the injesta or food consumed and compare it with the dejecta or excretions until a quantity and kind of food is found which is just sufficient to keep the body in equilibrium this latter plan is the best but to be quite satisfactory must be tried on a large number of suitable persons under varying conditions both of quantity and kind of food nearly all the experiments have been made on persons accustomed to a stimulating dietary their usual food has included a considerable quantity of flesh and alcoholic drinks sufficient attention has not been paid to the dietaries of the more abstemious races who partake of little if any flesh food the standard daily dietary for a man of average weight doing a moderate amount of work is variously stated by the best authorities as proteids from 100 to 130 grammes fat 35 to 125 grammes and carbohydrates 450 to 550 grammes there is a surprising difference of opinion on the amount of fat but those who give least fat give the largest quantity of carbohydrate and viceversa dr r hutchison in food and dietetics sums up the quantities given by the highest authorities as follows proteid 125 g 44 oz x 41 512 cal 20 g n 62 c carbohydrate 500 g 176 oz 41 2050 200 fat 50 g 18 oz 93 465 38 675

kilocalories representing the amount of heat which would raise a kilogramme 1000 grammes of water 1 centigrade this is the same as raising 1 pound weight 4 fahrenheit according to the table given 125 grammes of dry proteid are required per day this contains 20 grammes of nitrogen and 62 of carbon when thoroughly consumed or utilised in the body the heat or its equivalent in muscular work equals 512 kilocalories proteids have of course an additional value as tissue formers the factors used here of 41 and 93 are those commonly employed but the latest and most reliable research taking account only of that part of the food which is actually available in the body gives for proteid and carbohydrate 4 calories and for fat 89 calories fat has a higher food value than the carbohydrates as 41 93

edition part ii p 839 the diet was bread fruit and oil the man was in apparently good health and stationary weight only 59 per cent of the proteids were digested leaving the small quantity of 32 grammes available for real use in commenting upon this professor foster writeswe cannot authoritatively say that such a reduction is necessarily an evil for our knowledge will not at present permit us to make an authoritative exact statement as to the extent to which the proteid may be reduced without disadvantage to the body when accompanied by adequate provision of the other elements of food and this statement holds good whether the body be undertaking a small or large amount of labour d the miller of billericays case is quoted by dr carpenter and also by dr pavy it was reported to the college of physicians in 1767 by sir george baker a remarkable degree of vigour is said to have been sustained for upwards of eighteen years on no other nutriment than 16 oz of flour made into a pudding with water no other liquid of any kind being taken a striking instance of abstemiousness is that of cornaro a venetian nobleman who died in the year 1566 at the age of 98 up to the age of 40 he spent a life of indulgence eating and drinking to excess at this time having been endowed with a feeble constitution he was suffering from dyspepsia gout and an almost continual slow fever with an intolerable thirst continually hanging upon him the skill of the best physicians of italy was unavailing at length he completely changed his habits of diet and made a complete recovery at the age of 83 he wrote a treatise on a sure and certain method of attaining a long and healthful life he says what with bread meat the yolk of an egg and soup i ate as much as weighed 12 ozs neither more nor less i drank 14 oz of wine when 78 he was persuaded to increase his food by the addition of 2 oz per day and this nearly proved fatal he writes that instead of old age being one of weakness infirmity and misery i find myself to be in the most pleasant and delightful stage of life at 83 i am always merry maintaining a happy peace in my own mind a sober life has preserved me in that sprightliness of thought and gaiety of humour my teeth are all as sound as in my youth he was able to take moderate exercise in riding and walking at that age he was very passionate and hasty in his youth he wrote other treatises up to the age of 95 kumagara lapicque and breisacher have as the result of their experiments reduced the quantity of proteid required per 24 hours to 45 grammes t hirschfeld states as the conclusion of his research that it is possible for a healthy man in one case for 15 days and in another for 10 days to maintain nitrogenous balance on from 30 to 40 grammes of proteid per day labb and morchoisne comptes rendus 30th may 1904 p 1365 made a dieting experiment during 38 days upon one of themselves the proteid was derived exclusively from vegetable food the food consisted of bread lentils haricots potatoes carrots chestnuts endives apples oranges preserves sugar starch butter chocolate and wine at the commencement the days food contained 141 grammes of nitrogen 893 proteid which was gradually diminished on the 7th day 116 g n 735 g proteid was reached during this time less n was eliminated indicating that the proteid food was in excess of that required for the wear and tear of the body as the quantity of nitrogenous food was diminished almost daily the n eliminated was found to diminish also this latter was in slight excess of that absorbed but when a day or twos time was allowed without further reduction in the food the body tended to adjust itself to the dimished supply and there was an approximation of income and expenditure the smallest quantity of food was reached on the 32nd day with 106 n 67 proteid which was obviously too little as 219 n 139 proteid was eliminated on the 21st day 412 n 26 proteid was injested and 405 n was eliminated the inference drawn from the research is that about 26 grammes of proteid per day was sufficient the weight of the body remained practically constant throughout and the subject did not suffer inconvenience of course the full amount of calories was kept up as each succeeding quantity of the proteid was left off it was replaced by a proper quantity of nonnitrogenous food these experiments were carried out in the usual approved scientific manner it may however be urged against any generalised and positive conclusions as to the minimum quantity of proteid required for the body being drawn from such experiments that the period covered by them was much too short a prolonged trial might have revealed some obscure physiological derangement we are quite justified in concluding that the usual socalled standard dietaries contain an unnecessarily large proportion of proteid in some practical dietaries 50 grammes and under have seemed enough but for the ordinary adult man who has been accustomed to an abundance of proteid and whose ancestors have also it is probably advisable not to take less than 70 or 80 grammes per day 212 to 3 ounces if it is desired to try less the diminution should be very gradual and a watch should be kept for any lessening of strength some comments may now be made upon the table of dietaries that of the london sewing girl contained 53 grammes of proteid which should have been ample according to some of the authorities we have given yet she was badly nourished the food was doubtless of bad quality and it appears deficient in carbohydrates this latter is shown by the low number of calories the long hours and unhealthy conditions of work and not a deficiency of food constituents is probably the cause of the bad health of such persons there is no reason to think the proteid insufficient although some persons have said as much we have no particulars of the german vegetarians but the calories appear satisfactory in the poor german labourers family the calories are too low in dr tr allinsons experiment on a wheatmeal dietary it will not do to assume that less than 82 grammes of proteid would have been insufficient it is probable that a smaller quantity of proteid would have been enough if the fat and carbohydrates had been increased the calories are below the usual standard in the succeeding example the calories are considerably higher being not far from the usual standard yet 54 grammes of proteid sufficed it is a common error to place an undue value on the proteids to the extent of overlooking the other constituents dr alexander haig in diet and food p 8 cites the case of a boy aged 10 fed on 214 pints of milk per day the boy lost weight and dr haig is of opinion that the quantity of milk was very deficient in proteid more than twice as much being required 214 pints of milk contain about 45 grammes of proteid whereas according to the usual figures 125 x 610 a boy of this age requires 75 g this quantity of 45 g is however higher allowing for the boys age than that in several of the dietaries we have given in our table a little consideration will show that dr haig has overlooked the serious deficiency of the milk in the other constituents which accounts for the boys loss of weight the quantity of milk contains only about 160 g of total solid matter whilst 400 g is the necessary quantity milk is too rich in proteid matter to form with advantage the sole food of a human being human milk contains much less in proportion to the other constituents the old doctrine enunciated by justus von liebig was that proteid matter is the principal source of muscular energy or strength he afterwards discovered and acknowledged his error and the subject has since been thoroughly investigated the makers of meat extracts and other foods either from their own ignorance of modern research or their wish to take advantage of the lack of knowledge and prejudice of the public call proteid matter alone nourishment the carbohydrates and fats are equally entitled to be called nourishment our reason for devoting so much space to the consideration of the quantity of proteid matter required is that in the opinion of many eminent writers it is the crux of vegetarianism they have stated that it is impossible to obtain sufficient from vegetable foods alone without consuming an excessive quantity of carbohydrates we will summarise the argument as given in kirkes physiology as edited by morrant baker a standard work and which is repeated in furneauxs animal physiology a book which is much used in elementary science schools the daily waste from the system amounts to carbon 4500 grains or 300 grammes and nitrogen 300 grains or 20 grammes now let us suppose a person to feed on bread only in order to obtain the necessary quantity of nitrogen to repair this waste he would have to eat nearly 414 lbs daily he would be compelled to take about double the quantity of carbon required in order to obtain the necessary weight of nitrogen next let us suppose that he feeds on lean meat only then in order to obtain the necessary quantity of carbon he must eat no less than 612 lbs daily in this case we notice a similar waste of nitrogen the removal of which would give an undue amount of work to the organs concerned but it is possible to take such a mixed diet of bread and meat as will supply all the requirements of the system and at the same time yield but little waste material these extracts are from furneaux the next is from kirke the figures and argument is the same in each but we have chosen those sentences for quotation which are the briefest and most suitable certain calculations being omitted a combination of bread and meat would supply much more economically what was necessary so that 34 lbs of meat and less than 2 lbs of bread would supply all the needful carbon and nitrogen with but little waste from these facts it will be plain that a mixed diet is the best and most economical food for man and the result of experience entirely coincides with what might have been anticipated on theoretical grounds only professor huxley in his elementary physiology uses almost the same figures and argument the adoption of this high proteid or nitrogen figure would lead to some ridiculous conclusions one writer states that 18 eggs would contain sufficient flesh forming substance for a days ration but a very much larger quantity would be required to supply enough carbon on the other hand professor church says that no less than 70 lbs of pears would have to be eaten per day to supply the necessary quantity of nitrogen although the carbon would be in excess the curious may calculate the proper quantity of each that would make a theoretically perfect dietary people are apt to assume that what they themselves eat or what their class race or nation eat is the proper and necessary diet at least as far as the elementary constituents and quantities are concerned the error is in attempting to make a vegetarian diet however contrary to common sense and the experience of the greater part of the earths inhabitants agree in composition with the ordinary lavish flesh dietary of the welltodo european it is significant that john bull is caricatured with a large abdomen and a coarse ruddy if not inflamed face indicative of his hearty dining on flesh coarse food and alcoholic drinks an unhealthy short lived individual even if we accept a high proportion of proteid it is possible to combine purely vegetable foods so as to give the required quantity of the various constituents without a superfluity of the carbohydrates in food grains of india professor ah church shows by elaborate analyses and dietary tables how this can be accomplished by various combinations of cereals pulses etc he takes forster and voits standard of 282 grains of nitrogen and 5060 grains of carbon with a suitable deduction for the smaller weight of the indians in his examples of daily rations he gives from 5 to 9 ounces of various beans balanced by the addition of the proper quantity of rice4 to 16 ounces and a little oil such a large quantity of pulse appears to us excessive and would cause discomfort to most persons we much doubt whether those indians who are strict vegetarians could consume such quantities some valuable investigations were made on the diet of a family of fruitarians at the californian agricultural experimental station july 1900 by professor me jaffa bulletin 107 the proportion of food both proteid and carbohydrate used was surprisingly small the research is particularly important as the diet was not an experimental one tried during a short period only but that to which the family were accustomed the family consisted of two women and three children they had all been fruitarians for five to seven years and made no change in their dietary during the experiment they only had two meals a day the food being eaten uncooked the quantities of all the foods and other particulars are detailed in the bulletin the first meal was at 1030 am and always consisted of nuts followed by fruits the other meal was about 5 pm when they usually ate no nuts substituting olive oil and honey the nuts used were almonds brazil pine pignolias and walnuts the fresh fruits were apples apricots bananas figs grapes oranges peaches and pears other foods were dates raisins pickled olives olive oil and honey one person b ate a little celery and tomatoes and another c a little cereal food in the following table are given the average daily quantities of the

from 20 to 28 days a the tentative standard for a woman at light work calls for 90 grammes of proteids and 2500 calories it is thus seen that the quantity of food eaten was far below that usually stated as being necessary the subject however was a very small woman 5 feet in height taking almost no physical exercise she believed as do fruitarians generally that people need far less raw than cooked food b the food eaten was even less in quantity than in the previous dietary one reason for this was the fact that the subject was for part of the time at least under great mental strain and did not have her usual appetite even this small amount of food judging by her appearance and manner seemed sufficient for her needs enabling her to do her customary housework and take care of her two nieces and nephew the subjects of the other experiments c this girl was given cereals and vegetables when she craved them but her aunt says she never looks nor feels so well when she has much starchy food and returns to her next meal of uncooked food with an increased appreciation of its superiority the commonly accepted dietary standard for a child 13 years old and of average activity is not far from 90 grammes of proteids and 2450 calories yet the girl had all the appearance of being well fed and in excellent health and spirits d during the 22 days of experiment there was an increase in weight of 2 pounds due to the fact that the family had been in straitened circumstances and the food provided was more abundant during the study e the subject had been very delicate as a baby she was very small for her age being 10 pounds under the average weight and 7 inches less than the average height it is interesting to note that her only gain in weight during the past year was made during this dietary and the one immediately following this was due to her being urged to eat all she wanted of what she most preferred as the food was provided by those making the study the proteid is less than the tentative standard for a child of 1 to 2 years old but the subject appeared perfectly well and was exceedingly active she impressed one as being a healthy child but looked younger than her age ee the subject is the same as in the previous experiment e but after an interval of 8 months her seventh birthday occurred during the time professor jaffa who made the investigation saysit would appear that all the subjects were decidedly undernourished even making allowance for their light weight but when we consider that the two adults have lived upon this diet for seven years and think they are in better health and capable of more work than they ever were before we hesitate to pronounce judgment the three children had the appearance of health and strength they ran and jumped and played all day like ordinary healthy children and were said to be unusually free from colds and other complaints common to childhood the youngest child and the only one who has lived as a fruitarian almost from infancy was certainly undeveloped she looked fully two years younger than she was still there are so many children who are below the average in development whose dietaries conform to the ordinary standards that it would be unfair to draw any conclusions until many more such investigations are made the research shows that not only is there need of a revision of the standard quantity of proteids but also of the carbohydrates and fats it is generally said by those who have no practical experience amongst vegetarians that the latter require a much larger quantity of food than do those who include flesh the truth is that vegetarians eat less often much less it is a common experience that vegetable food has a more staying power and a much longer period can be allowed between meals without the inconvenience that a flesheater especially a flesh and alcohol consumer suffers this is due in part at least to its less stimulating character and its slower digestion this fact has been shown by the success of vegetarians in feats of strength and endurance and especially in the comparatively fresh condition in which they have finished long walking cycling tennis and other matches those who attempt to prolong their powers of endurance by flesh extracts and stimulating foods and drinks usually finish in a very exhausted condition the superior endurance and recovery from wounds when compared with our english soldiers of simple feeding men such as the zulus turks and japanese has often been remarked it is often said that vegetable food as it contains more fibre and is slower of digestion taxes the bodily organs more if we attempted to eat uncooked the more fibrous vegetables the grains and unripe fruit it would be quite true but it is not so of the ordinary food of vegetarians a slowness of digestion does not necessarily imply a greater strain on the system as vegetables in particular are for the longest period of time in the intestines and undergo the greater part of their digestion there a gentle and slow process of digestion in that organ may be more thorough it may also entail less expenditure of nervous energy than if the food had been of such a stimulating character as to be hurried along the digestive tract digestion is for the most part a chemical process if the food is of right kind and quantity thoroughly masticated assisted if necessary by cookery and the digestive ferments are normal digestion proceeds without any sensible expenditure or energy or consciousness of its accomplishment there is nothing improbable in a flesheater requiring more food than a simple living vegetarian his food contains more proteid and excrementitious matter or extractives these stimulate the digestive organs and overtax the excretory ones generally he is fond of condiments salt and elaborate cooking often also of alcohol if a man probably of tobacco he lives as it were at high pressure there are on record certain experiments which appear to indicate the necessity of a large proportion of proteid especially when the diet has been of vegetable origin these experiments are inconclusive because the subject has been accustomed to an ordinary flesh diet perhaps also to alcoholic drinks the change to a comparatively nonstimulating diet cannot be made and the digestive organs expected to adapt themselves in a few days perhaps not even a month or a year would suffice for some people and yet that same diet would suit others in some experiments the food has not been appetising the subject has even taken it with reluctance or even loathing an excess of some food has been eaten which no vegetarian or anybody else would think of using in a practical dietary sometimes persons on changing from an ordinary flesh dietary lose weight and strength generally it is found that they have done little more than discontinue the flesh without substituting suitable foods authorities think it is from a deficiency of proteid and recommend an addition of such foods as pulse wheatmeal oatmeal eggs milk cheese and such as a reference to the table of analyses show a low nutrient ratio figure this may also be due to an insufficiency of food eaten owing to the comparatively insipid character of the food and want of appetite in making a change to a vegetarian diet such foods had better be taken that are rather rich in proteid and that approximate somewhat in their flavour and manner of cooking to that used previously a further change to a simpler diet can afterwards gradually be made according to conviction tastes and bodily adaptability it must not be expected that a change even an ultimately very advantageous one will always meet with an immediate and proper response from digestive and assimilative organs which have been accustomed for many years perhaps by inheritance for generations to another manner of living there are several preparations produced from centrifugalised milkthat is milk from which the butter fat has been removed which consist chiefly of proteid these have a value in increasing the proteid contents of foods which may be thought deficient the addition of these manufactured products appear unnecessary as most of our food contains an abundance of proteid and we can easily limit the quantity or avoid altogether those that are thought defective the later apologists for a flesh diet have had to admit that it is not a physiological necessity but they have attempted to justify its use by a theory somewhat as follows it is admitted that any excess of proteid over that necessary for its special province of producing tissue is utilised as a forceproducer in a similar manner to the carbohydrates when the molecule is split up and the carbon utilised the nitrogen passes off in the form of urea by the kidneys the theory propounded is that at the moment the nitrogen portion is liberated it in some manner stimulates the living protoplasm of the nerve cells in its immediate neighbourhood to a higher state of activity these views are given by dr hutchison in his book on food but there are no substantial grounds for them it is only prompted by a wish to excuse a cherished habit sir william roberts md in dietetics and dyspepsia p 16 says that high feeding consists mainly in a liberal allowance of meat and in the systematic use of alcoholic beverages and that lowfeeding consists in a diet which is mainly vegetarian and nonalcoholic and he proceeds to say that the highfed classes and races display on the whole a richer vitality and a greater brainpower than their lowfed brethren that it is remarkable how often we hear of eminent men being troubled with gout and gout is usually produced either by personal or ancestral highfeeding we can only spare room for a few remarks on this subject intellectual and business ability brings wealth wealth frequently leads to the pleasures of the table but such habits are detrimental to sustained effort and clearness of mind the children and grandchildren of such high livers are usually commonplace intellectually and of deteriorated physique the aristocracy who are generally high livers notwithstanding their great advantages of education travel and leisure are not as a rule famed for their intellectual gifts in the recent war the frugal living japanese soldier has proved himself the most enduring and bravest in history whilst the japanese officers are more resourceful and tactful than the wealthier highfed russian officers with their aristocratic lineage what is called highfeeding is of the greatest benefit to the doctors and the proprietors of remedies for digestive and nervous disorders food adjuncts and drugsin addition to the nutrients and the small quantity of indigestible fibre of which we have already written food generally contains small quantities of substances which are difficult to classify and whose action on the body is but imperfectly understood many of these possess pungent or strong odours and flavours to them various fruits meats etc owe much of their characteristic differences of taste when pure the proteids and starches are devoid of taste such oils and fats as are generally eaten have also but little flavour providing they are free from rancidity and of good quality the sugars differ from the other nutrients in possessing a more or less decided taste the free vegetable acids also strongly affect the sense of taste but they are only consumed in small quantities a drug may be defined as a substance which modifies the functions of the body or of some organ without sensibly imparting nourishment this action may be one of stimulation or of depression a drug is taken for its medicinal action a food adjunct for its modifying action on food it is impossible to give a quite satisfactory definition or to draw sharp distinctions for example tea coffee alcohol and tobacco are sometimes placed in one group and sometimes in another according to opinion of their action and the definition of the terms food adjuncts drugs and poisons the difference of grouping often depends upon intensity rather than of kind of action if taken frequently and not in quantity sufficient to have a markedly medicinal action such things are generally called food adjuncts or supplementary foods although much may be said in favour of a different view the volatile oils of mustard caraway cloves etc are used in medicine also the alkaloids of coffee and cocoa even honey is used as a mild laxative for infants that is as a drug the difference between a drug and a poison is one only of degree some of the most esteemed drugs have to be administered in very small quantities or they cause death eg strychnine and morphine classifications are necessary for methodical study and for assisting the memory in grasping large numbers of things which can be grouped together classifications however are artificial not due to natural lines of demarkation but according to mans knowledge and convenience hence a group is apt to approach and finally merge into another group although on first consideration they appeared quite distinct the disregard of this often leads to confusion and useless discussions plants like animals as the result of tissue change have certain usedup or waste matters to get out of the way animals have special excretory organs for the purpose waste matter remains in the flesh and blood of dead animals in plants are found a large number of powerful volatile oils alkaloids bitter resins etc many of these are in all probability excretory products of no assimilative value to the plant certain volatile oils may attract insects and in obtaining nectar from flowers insects assist fertilisation agreeable volatile oils and flavouring substances in fruits attract birds and animals the eating of the fruits cause the seeds which are uninjured by passing through the digestive system to be disseminated over wide areas to the advantage of the plant species on the other hand nauseous and poisonous alkaloids oils resins etc serve as a protection against the attacks of browsing animals birds caterpillars snails etc these nauseous substances are most abundant in the bark husk skin and outer parts it is commonly supposed that the food on which each animal including man subsists is especially produced by nature for the purpose this is an error for each species of plant and animal lives for itself alone and protects itself with more or less success against destruction by its competitors and enemies each species of animal selects from its surroundings such food as is most suitable such food may not be theoretically perfect that is it may not contain the maximum of nourishment free from innutritious matter but during the long period of evolution each species of animal has become possessed of organs suited to its environment if to such animals be given food containing less indigestible matter or food which is more readily digested by laboratory tests made independently of the living animal their digestive system will be thrown out of gear become clogged up or refuse to work properly just as the furnace of a steam boiler made to burn coal will act badly with wood or petroleum many scientific men have overlooked this fact and have endeavoured to produce food substances for general consumption in the most concentrated and soluble form thinking such food would be more easily assimilated the volatile and essential oils are contained in minute quantity in a very large number of animal and vegetable foods they contribute in part to the flavour of fruits they are the cause of the pungency and aroma of mustard horseradish cloves nutmegs cinnamon caraway seeds mint sage and other spices onions contain a notable quantity when extracted the essential oils become powerful drugs in moderate quantities they are stomachic and carminative in larger quantities irritant and emetic condiments and spices not only add flavour to food but stimulate the secretion of gastric juice and peristaltic movement the alkaloids most used are those of tea coffee kolanut cocoa coca tobacco and opium although the two last are generally smoked they must be classed amongst the food adjuncts it is of little consequence whether their active principles enter the body by the mouth and saliva or the lungs their action on the blood and nervous system is the same the extractives as they are called comprise a number of bodies of varying nature they especially exist in flesh and flesh extracts amongst these are the purins they will be treated at greater length hereafter alcohol is to some extent a true food but its stimulant and other action quite overshadows any food value it may possess there are other bodies such as the resins and bitters the active principle of indian hemp is a resin there is a great difference of opinion as to the extent to which stimulants may advantageously be used it is remarkable that amongst nearly all nations either alcohol in some form or one of the stronger alkaloids is in common use from this fact it is sometimes argued that stimulants must supply a physiological need the same method of reasoning will apply with greater force to the use of condiments such conclusions appear to us to be scarcely warranted if the extensive or even universal practice of a thing proves its necessity then has there been justification either now or in the past for war lying avarice and other vices it is strange that drugs differing so greatly in their immediate and obvious effects as for example alcohol and opium or coffee and tobacco should be used should it he said that only some of the much used stimulants are useful there is an end to the argument based on their universal use there is no doubt that the use of stimulants in more than very small quantities is distinctly injurious and it is difficult to see what physiological advantage there can be in their habitual use to what is vaguely called a moderate extent sometimes they are taken for a supposed medical necessity and where taste attracts little evidence satisfies those in the habit of taking them if honest must confess that it is chiefly on account of the apparent enjoyment the illnourished and the depressed in body and mind crave most for stimulants a food creates energy in the body including the nervous system and this is the only legitimate form of stimulation a mere stimulant does not create but draws on the reserve forces what was latent energyto become in the natural course gradually availableunder stimulation is rapidly set free there is consequently subsequent depletion of energy there may occasionally be times when a particular organ needs a temporary stimulus to increased action notwithstanding it may suffer an after depression but such cases are so rare that they may be left out of our present argument and stimulants should only be used like other powerful drugs under medical advice in the last 25 years the use of alcohol by the medical profession has steadily diminished its poisonous properties having become more evident there is a general similarity in the effects of stimulants on the digestive and nervous systems the most largely used stimulant is ethyl alcohol and as its action is best known it may be useful to name the principal effects alcohol in the form of wine and spirits in small quantities first stimulates the digestive organs large quantities inflame the stomach and stop digestion beer however retards digestion altogether out of proportion to the alcohol it contains alcohol increases the action of the heart increases the blood pressure and causes the vessels of the whole body to dilate especially those of the skin hence there is a feeling of warmth it the person previously felt cold he now feels warm the result of the increased circulation through the various organs is that they work with greater vigour hence the mental faculties are brightened for a time and the muscular strength seems increased the person usually feels the better for it though this is not always the case some have a headache or feel very sleepy it has been repeatedly proved that these good results are but transitory the heart although at first stimulated is more exhausted after the action of the alcohol has passed away than it was at first this is true of all the organs of the body which were stimulated in consequence of the dilatation of the blood vessels of the skin an unusual quantity of heat is lost and the body is cooled after taking alcohol persons are less able to stand cold when overtaken by snowstorms or subjected to excessive or prolonged cold it has often happened that those who resorted to spirit drinking have succumbed whilst the others have survived insurance statistics have conclusively shown that teetotallers are longer livers than the socalled moderate drinkers the terrible effects on both body and mind of the excessive drinking of alcohol or the use of other strong stimulants or narcotics are too obvious to need allusion to here we are only concerned with what is vaguely called their moderate use the stimulation produced by tea and coffee is in some respects like that of alcohol the heart is stimulated and the blood pressure rises the kidneys are strongly affected in those unaccustomed to the drug but this ceases after a week or more of use their chief effect is on the brain and nervous system many have boasted that they can take of what they call the good things of life to their full without any bad effect and looking over a few years or even many years it seems a fact some of us have known of such men who have been esteemed for their joviality and good nature who have suddenly broken down at what should have been a hearty middle life on the other hand there are men who were badly equipped for the battle of life with indifferent constitutions who never had the buoyancy and overflow of animal spirits but who with care have long outlived all their formerly more robust but careless companions simple versus highlyflavoured foodsit is very difficult to decide to what extent condiments and flavourings should be used these have stimulating properties although differing from the more complex properties of alcohol and the alkaloids the great differences in the dietetic practices of nations does not appear to be in conformity with any general rule it varies with opportunity climate and national temperament though doubtless the national temperament is often due in part to the dietetic habits some races are content with the simplest foods large numbers subsist chiefly on rice others on the richer cereals wheat oatmeal etc and fruit on the other hand there are races who enjoy stronger flavoured food including such things as garlic curry pickles pepper strong cheese meat extracts rancid fats dried and smoked fish high game or still more decomposed flesh offal and various disgusting things the greenlanders will eat with the keenest appetite the halffrozen halfputrid head and fins of the seal after it has been preserved under the grass of summer in burmah and sumatra a mess is made by pounding together prawns shrimps or any cheap fish this is frequently allowed to become partially putrid it is largely used as a condiment for mixing with their rice numerous examples of this sort could be given there is scarcely anything that it is possible to eat but has been consumed with relish by some tribe or other the strongest flavoured and to our minds most disgusting foods are eaten by the least intelligent and most brutal races it is hunger that compels the poor african bushman to eat anything he can get and the hottentot not only the flesh but the entrails of cattle which die naturally and this last he has come to think exquisite when boiled in beastblood all this shows a wonderful range of adaptability in the human body but it would not be right to say that all such food is equally wholesome the most advanced and civilised races especially the more delicately organised of them are the most fastidious whilst it is the most brutal that take the most rank and strongly flavoured foods even amongst the civilised there are great differences the assimilative and nervous systems can be trained to tolerate injurious influences to a remarkable degree a striking example is seen in the nausea commonly produced by the first pipe of tobacco and the way the body may in time be persuaded not only to tolerate many times such a quantity without manifesting any unpleasant feelings but to receive pleasure from the drug opium or laudanum may be taken in gradually increasing quantities until such a dose is taken as would at first have produced death yet now without causing any immediate or very apparent harm nearly all drugs loose much of their first effect on continued use not only is this so but a sudden discontinuance of a drug may cause distress as the body when free from the artificial stimulation to which it has become habituated falls into a sluggish or torpid condition for the enjoyment of food two things are equally necessary a healthy and keen appetite and suitable food without the first no food however good and skilfully prepared will give satisfaction the sense of taste resides in certain of the papilloe of the tongue and to a much less degree in the palate tastes may be classified into sweet bitter acid and saline sweet tastes are best appreciated by the tip acid by the side and bitter by the back of the tongue hot or pungent substances produce sensations of general feeling which obscure any strictly gustatory sensations which may be present at the same time to affect the taste the food must enter into solution like the other senses taste may be rendered more delicate by cultivation flavours are really odours and the word smell would be more appropriate for example what we call the taste of an onion the flavour of fruit etc independent of the sweetness or sourness of the fruit is due to the nose much has been written on the necessity of making food tasty so as to stimulate the appetite and digestion it is urged that unless this is done food will not be eaten in sufficient quantity innumerable receipts some very elaborate have been published for this purpose all this is supposed to increase the enjoyment of food the anglosaxon racethe race whose dietary is the most elaborateis especially subject to digestive derangements and without good digestion and the consequent healthy appetite no food will give full gustatory pleasure the most wholesome food and that which can be eaten most frequently without weariness is mildly flavoured and simply prepared plain bread is an example whereas sweet bread currant bread etc though agreeable in small quantity or as an occasional delicacy soon palls on the appetite rice is the poorest and mildest flavoured of the cereals it is therefore often perhaps generally made more tasty by the addition of fish curry etc the bulk of the chinese live on rice with the exception of only 3 or 4 ounces of fish per day and they are a fine big and strong race the japanese labourer lives on similar food in india rice is the food most in use though many other cereals are eaten there other races live chiefly on fruits it appears that the digestive organs will perform their functions perfectly with the mildest flavoured food there is nothing surprising in this the strongest most intelligent and largest animals are those which feed on grass herbs and fruits even the african lion is no match for the gorilla the lion and tiger are capable of great strength but they cannot put it forth for long periods as can the herbivora our most useful animal the horse can exert much more muscular energy weight for weight than any of the carnivora the cost of feeding one of the herbivora is much less than that of one of the carnivora of the same weight this is so whether we take the cost of purchasing the food or the expenditure of time labour and energy on the part of man or of natural forces in the production of the food herbs roots corn and fruit are produced much more abundantly and freely than the corresponding quantity of sheep deer etc on which the carnivora feed the restlessness craving for novelty and love of excitement so characteristic of the anglosaxon and to a less extent of some other european races has its correspondence in the food of these races highlyseasoned and nitrogenous foods act as a stimulant and favour spasmodic and for a time perhaps great intellectual and physical exertion with a succeeding period of exhaustion simpler food favours long sustained uniform muscular strength clearness of intellect and contentment let no one misunderstand us we do not assert that all who live on simple food have either clear intellects or are contented because there are other factors besides food but that such qualities are more easily retained or obtained under that condition it is well known that the overfed and badly fed are the most irritable and discontented those living on a stimulating dietary consisting largely of flesh have their chief successes in feats of short duration simple and abstemious living individuals or races excel in laborious work requiring endurance over long periods such as long walking cycling and other athletic feats and long military campaigns the digestive and assimilative organs need the food constituents of which we have written in proper proportion and quantity and in a fairly digestible condition within these very wide and comprehensive limits the organs can be trained very much of the great difference in food is due to the nonessential flavouring and stimulating part rather than to that part which is essential and nourishing what is the best interests but few whilst what is at present the pleasantest influences the many the ego the superphysical conscious and reasoning entity should rule its material body its temporary vehicle the body being the servant of the ego just as a horse dog or other of the lower animals recognises its master becomes a docile subject the body can be led into good habits nearly as easily as into bad ones often more easily as bad habits are sometimes painfully acquired the body being once habituated to certain movements conditions foods or drinks within reasonable limits derives pleasure therefrom and resists change it is only when the food etc transgresses certain elementary principles that the result is more or less painful we may on scientific principles condemn fleshfoods stimulants and elaborately prepared foods but after ruling all this out there is still left a very great variety of foods and methods of preparing them hereon each individual must form his own opinion of the foods thus left the same kind is not equally suitable to everyone nor even to the same person at different periods a delicately balanced finegrained hightoned mind and body responds to every tender influence and is painfully jarred by that which is coarse to such fruits and delicately flavoured and easily digested foods are doubtless best and conducive to purity and clearness of thought a coarsegrained badly poised roughly working body and spirit is nonresponsive except to loud or coarse impulses and such a ones appetite is gratified not by simple but by coarsely seasoned foods a person who is accustomed to a stimulating dietary of fleshfoods especially if wellseasoned finds a simple diet unsatisfying should such persons dine off simple vegetarian food there is a tendency to overeating the less stimulating food fails to rouse the digestive organs and to appease the appetite although an ample supply of nourishment be consumed this is the reason why so many imagine that it is necessary to eat a larger quantity of food if it be vegetable should a distressing fulness and flatulence result from their overfeeding they lay the blame to the vegetarian dietary instead of to themselves most persons on changing to a vegetarian dietary commence by imitating flesh dishes in appearance and flavour and even in the names there is the additional inducement that the food may be attractive and palatable to friends who lack sympathy with the aesthetic and humane principles of the diet after a while many of them incline to simpler flavoured foods they revert to the unperverted taste of childhood for children love sweets fruits and mildflavoured foods rather than savouries one who loves savouries as a rule cares much less for fruits by compounding and cooking a very great variety of foods can be prepared but the differences in taste are much less than is usually supposed the effect of seasoning instead of increasing the range diminishes it by dulling the finer perception of flavours the predominating seasoning also obscures everything else the mixture of foods produces a conglomeration of tastes in which any particular or distinct flavours are obscured resulting in a general sameness it is often stated that as an ordinary flesheater has the choice of a greater range of foods and flavours than a vegetarian he can obtain more enjoyment and that the latter is disagreeably restricted certainly he has the choice but does he avail himself of it to any considerable extent no one cares to take all the different kinds of food whether of animal or vegetable that are possible of edible animals but a very few kinds are eaten a person who particularly relishes and partakes largely of fleshfoods will reject as insipid and unsatisfying many mildflavoured foods at one end of the scale the vegetarian may abstain from foods at the opposite end of the scale not always from humane reasons but because they are unpleasant thus there may be little to choose between the mere range of flavours that give enjoyment to each class of persons the sense of taste is in its character and range lower than the sense of sight and hearing the cultivation of the taste for savouries seems to blunt the taste for fruits and the delicate foods the grass and herbs on which the herbivora subsist seems to our imagination of little flavour and monotonous but they eat with every sign of enjoyment deliberately munching their food as though to get its full flavour in all probability they find a considerable range of flavours in the great varieties of grasses commonly found together in a pasture our elaborate cooking customs entail a vast amount of labour they necessitate the cost trouble and dirt from having fires in great excess of that required for warmth the extra time in preparing mixing and attending to food which has to be cooked and the large number of greasy and soiled utensils which have to be cleaned cooked savoury food is generally much nicer eaten hot and this necessitates fires and attention just previous to the meal we have already said that soft cooked food discourages mastication and leads to defective teeth our elaborate cookery is mainly due to our custom of eating so largely of flesh whilst the eating of flesh would receive a great impetus on the discovery of the art of cooking flesh can only be eaten with relish and with safety when cooked such a large proportion of it is infected with parasites or is otherwise diseased that it would he dangerous to eat it raw even were it palatable in such a state in those countries where man eats flesh in a raw or semicooked form parasitic diseases are common there is not the least doubt that our habit of eating so much cooked food is responsible for much overeating hasty eating dyspepsia and illness in regard to the making of bread porridge and many other comparatively simple prepared foods the advantages of cooking seem overwhelmingly great with our present imperfect knowledge and conflicting opinions it is impossible to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion and the whole question requires careful and impartial investigation experiments have been made with animals chiefly pigs with cooked and uncooked clover hay corn meal etc us department of agriculture it was found that the food was more or less diminished in digestibility by cooking at least 13 separate series of experiments with pigs in different part of the country have been reported in 10 of these trials there has been a positive loss from cooking the food the amount of food required to produce in the animal a pound gain in weight was larger when the food had been cooked than when it was given raw in some cases the increased quantity of food required after cooking was considerable those who live on uncooked food contend that a smaller quantity of nourishment is required as uncooked food requires more mastication and is eaten more slowly there is a better flow of saliva and time is given for the digestive organs to be gradually brought into complete action and finally for the appeasing of the appetite in the case of the members of the fruitarian family whose food was uncooked and of whom we have previously written the quantity of nutriment taken was much less than that thought necessary even after making full allowance for their small stature and weight meat extractsjustus von liebig the great german chemist was the first to attempt to make these on the commercial scale he described a method in 1847 and this not proving satisfactory another one in 1865 he stated that the only practicable plan on a manufacturing scale was to treat the chopped flesh with eight to ten times its weight of water which was to be raised to 180 f in another passage he says it is to be boiled for halfanhour after straining from all the undissolved meat fibre etc and carefully cleansing from all fat the decoction is to be evaporated to a soft extract such a preparation is practically free from albumin gelatin and fat all the nutritive principles except the saline matter having been extracted liebig states that 34 pounds of meat are required to produce 1 pound of extract in 1872 he wrote neither tea nor extract of meat are nutritive in the ordinary sense and he went on to speak of their medicinal properties druit in 1861 in describing the effect of a liquid preparation of meat states that it exerted a rapid and stimulating action on the brain and he proposed it as an auxiliary and partial substitute for brandy in all case of great exhaustion or weakness attended with cerebral depression or despondency in like manner a feast of animal food in savages whose customary diet was almost exclusively vegetable has been described by travellers as producing great excitement and stimulation similar to that of intoxicating spirits similar effects have been observed from a copious employment of liebigs extract voit asserts from the results of his experiments that extract of meat is practically useless as a food and other authorities are quite of the same opinion although they may value it as a stimulant and drug the extra pharmacopia 1901 states that liebigs extract or lemco consists of creatin creatinin globulin and urea with organic potash and other salts it has been much overestimated as a food either for invalids or healthy persons still it is often valuable as a flavouring to add to soups beeftea etc and it is a nerve food allied to tea meat extracts stimulate the action of the heart and the digestive processes but as in the case of other stimulants there is a succeeding period of depression the british medical journal says that the widespread belief in the universal suitability of concentrated beeftea is frequently responsible for increasing the patients discomfort and is even capable in conditions of kidney inefficiency of producing positive harm some of the meat bases the leucomaines have been found to possess marked poisonous effects on the body the manfacturers of meat extracts continue to mislead the public by absurdly false statements of the value of their products they assert that their extracts contain the nutritive matter of 30 40 or 50 times their weight of fresh meat or that one or two meatlozenges are sufficient for a meal one company asserts by direct statement or imply by pictorial advertisement that the nutritive matter in an ox can be concentrated into the bulk of a bottle of extract and another company that a teacup full is equivalent in food value to an ox professor halliburton writes instead of an ox in a teacup the oxs urine in a teacup would be much nearer the fact for the meat extract consists largely of products on the way to urea which more nearly resemble in constitution the urine than they do the flesh of the ox professor robert bartholow has also stated that the chemical composition of beeftea closely resembles urine and is more an excrementitious substance than a food those whose business it is to make a pure meatbroth for the purpose of preparing therefrom a nutrient for experimenting with bacteria cannot fail to recognise its similarity both in odour and colour to urine little consideration is needful to show the untruthfulness and the absurdity of the statements made by manufacturers as to the food value of these extracts fresh lean beef contains about 25 per cent of solid nutriment and 75 per cent of water if lean beef be desiccated one pound will be reduced to four ounces of perfectly dry substance this will consist of about 80 per cent of proteid matter and nearly 20 per cent of fat including a little saline matter and the extractives this is as far as it is possible to concentrate the beef if it were possible to remove without interfering with the nutritious constituents the membraneous matter the creatin creatinine and purin bodies we should reduce it to a little less than four ounces it is very remarkable that the most nutritious matter of the beef the muscle substance or proteid and the fat are rejected in making liebigs extract whilst the effete or waste products are retained in bovril and some other preparations some meat fibre has been added with the object of imparting a definite food value hence in some advertisements now withdrawn it was alleged that the preparations were immensely superior in nutritive value to ordinary meat extracts the bovril company extensively circulated the followingit is hard for ladies to realise that the beef tea they make at home from the choicest fresh beef contains absolutely no nourishment and is nothing more than a slight stimulant it is so however and many a patient has been starved on beef tea whether made from fresh beef or from the meat extracts that are sold to the public from these bovril differs so much that one ounce of its nutritious constituents contains more real and direct nourishment than fifty ounces of ordinary meat extract if analyses of meat extracts are referred to it will be seen that the principal part of bovril is the meat bases and other things common to all such extracts and which the company in their circular so emphatically condemn if the meat fibre which is the principal if not the sole difference is the only nourishing constituent it is difficult to see the advantage over ordinary beef which can be procured at a very small proportionate cost concerning this added meat fibre ca mitchell in flesh foods writes as this amounts to at most some 8 or 10 per cent it is obvious that a large quantity of the substance would be required to obtain as much unaltered proteid as is contained in an egg on the other hand it has been pointed out that there is nothing to show that flesh powder suspended in meat extract is more digestible than ordinary flesh in the same fine state of division whilst the amount of flesh bases the principal stimulating agents is correspondingly reduced concerning added albumin and meat fibre ah allen in commercial organic analysis vol iv writes the amount of these constituents present in such a quantity of meat extract as is usually or could be taken at a time is too insignificant to give it any appreciable value as nutriment notwithstanding such statements by analysts and others bovril is advertised to contain the entire nourishment of prime oxbeef the great extent of the extract of meat trade is shown by a circular issued by the lemco and oxo company they give the number of their cattle killed since 1865 as 5550000 stock of cattle 160000 employees in works farms and branches 3200 this is only one out of many such companies it is a sad thing that myriads of animals should be slaughtered with all the horrible and brutalising surroundings of the slaughterhouse to such a purposethe nutritious matter being nearly all wasted reliance on these extracts is responsible for much sickness and death instead of their preventing colds influenza and other complaints as is professed they predispose to them by overloading the body with waste products taxing the excretory organs and reducing the vitality the

1650 some of the liebigs extract of meat so called contains yeast extract some even is almost entirely if not altogether made from yeast the latter can be manufactured at a very low cost from brewers and distillers waste products and there is a strong incentive for unscrupulous dealers to substitute it secretly artificial meat extracts prepared from yeast have the appearance and taste of meat extracts but some at least have a considerably sharper flavour in one method of manufacture common salt is added and this renders it unfit for use in more than very small quantities as a flavouring j graff has made analyses of ten yeast extracts and contrasted them with meat extracts see analyst 1904 page 194 and says it will be seen that the chemical composition of yeast extract does not greatly differ from that of meat extract yeast extracts contain purin bodies and are probably equally as injurious as meat extracts such strong and rank flavours the odour is suggestive to us of putrefaction should be discouraged by those who would cultivate a refined taste in food flesh bases and waste productsas the result of destructive metamorphosis or the wearing out of the body there remain certain waste products which have to be expelled as soon as is possible their retention and accumulation would soon produce death a part is expelled by the lungs as carbondioxide or as it is generally though less correctly termed carbonic acid upon the breaking down of the complex proteid and other nitrogenous matter the nitrogen is left in comparatively simple combinations these effete nitrogen compounds are commonly termed flesh bases or nitrogenous extractives they exist in small quantity in flesh meat but are concentrated and conserved in the making of beeftea or beefextract the spleen lymphatic and other glands and especially the liver break these down into still simpler compounds so that the kidneys may readily separate them from the blood that they may pass out of the body by far the largest part of this waste nitrogen is expelled from the bodies of men and many other mammals in the form of urea pure urea is an odourless transparent crystalline substance of cooling saline taste like nitre it is soluble in an equal volume of water and is expelled from the body with great ease in the herbivora the nitrogenous waste takes the form of another body called hippuric acid the nearly solid lightcoloured urinary excretion of birds and serpents consists of urates this is uric acid in combination with alkalies in man in addition to the urea excreted there is also a little hippuric and uric acid or compounds of these uric acid is a transparent colourless crystalline body almost insoluble in water but soluble as urates in the presence of alkalies as deposited from urine it is of a dull red sandlike appearance as it has a great affinity for any colouring matter that is present it is only possible to make a brief reference to the chief organic bases the xanthine bases are closely related to uric acid some of these occur in small quantity in the urine and animal tissues others such as caffeine occur in plants creatine is a constant constituent of muscle substance in fowls flesh there is said to be 032 per cent in codfish 017 per cent and in beef 007 per cent creatinine is produced from creatine with great facility it exists in urine both creatine and creatinine are readily soluble in water a series of bases closely allied to creatinine have been isolated from the flesh of large animals by a gautier they are known as gautiers flesh bases when administered to animals these act more or less powerfully on the nerve centres inducing sleep and in some cases causing vomiting and purging in a manner similar to the alkaloids of snake venom but less powerfully than the ptomaines these bases are formed during life as a result of normal vital processes and are termed leucomaines another class of bases of an alkaloidal nature are termed ptomaines these differ from the leucomaines being produced by putrefactive or bacterial agency from dead flesh the poisoning which has occasionally resulted from the eating of sausages porkpies tinned meats etc is due to their having contained ptomaines such quantities of waste products as are produced in the healthy body are excreted with ease but it is otherwise in certain diseases either specially noxious substances are produced or the usual substances are in excessive quantity and not eliminated with sufficient rapidity in consequence the body is poisoned those who eat largely of flesh introduce into their system the excretory matter contained therein which superadded to the excretory matter resulting from the vital processes of the body puts an unusual and unnatural strain upon the liver and kidneys it has been observed that the eating of the flesh of some trapped animals has produced severe symptoms of poisoning the pain and horror of having a limb bleeding and mangled in a most cruel steel trap the struggles which only add to the misery slowly being done to death during hours or even days of torture has produced in their bodies virulent poisons leucomaine poisons have also been produced by the violent and prolonged exertions of an animal fleeing from its pursuers until its strength was completely spent cases are also known where a mother nursing her infant has given way to violent anger or other emotion and the child at the breast has been made violently ill we must not expect the flesh of any hunted or terrified animals to be wholesome animals brought in cattle ships across the atlantic suffer acutely after rough weather they will often arrive in a maimed condition some being dead to this is added the terror and cruelty to which they are subjected whilst driven by callous drovers often through a crowded city to the slaughter house to which they have an instinctive dread it is only to be expected that the dead flesh from such animals should contain an unusually large quantity of the more poisonous flesh bases purin bodiesthe term purin has been applied to all bodies containing the nucleus c5n4 it comprises the xanthine group and the uric acid group of bodies the principal purins are hypoxanthin xanthin uric acid guanin adenin caffeine and theobromine purins in the body may either result from the wear and tear of certain cell contents when they are called endogenous purins or they are introduced in the food when they are distinguished as exogenous purins these purins are waste products and are readily converted into uric acid the production of some uric acid by tissue change is of course unavoidable but that resulting from the purins in food is under control an excess of uric acid is commonly associated with gout and similar diseases the morbid phenomena of gout are chiefly manifested in the joints and surrounding tissues the articular cartilages become swollen with ensuing great pain there is an accumulation of mortar like matter about the joints this is calcium urate not sodium urate as is generally stated these nodular concretions are called tophi or chalkstones very many are the hypotheses which have been propounded on the cause of gout and the part played by uric acid many have had to be discarded or greatly modified though much light has recently been thrown on the subject there remains much that is obscure the subject is one which is surrounded with great difficulties and would not be suitable for discussion here were it not for the following reason certain views on uric acid as the cause of gout and several other diseases are at the present time being pushed to the extreme in some health journals and pamphlets unfortunately many of the writers have very little knowledge either of chemistry or physiology and treat the question as though it were a simple one that had been quite settled our purpose is to clear the ground to some extent for a better understanding of its fundamentals and to warn against dogmatism our remarks however must be brief it is undeniable that great eaters of meat especially if they also take liberally of alcoholic drinks are prone to diseases of the liver and kidneys about or soon after the time of middle life flesh meat contains relatively large quantities of purins purins are metabolised in the body to uric acid about half of the uric acid produced in the body disappears as such being disintegrated whilst the other half remains to be excreted by the kidneys one view is that whilst the organs of the body can readily dispose of its endogenous uric acid or that produced by its own tissue change together with the small amount of uric acid derived from most foods the organs are strained by the larger quantity introduced in fleshfood or any other food rich in purins that there is an accumulation in the system of some of this uric acid vegetable foods tend to keep the blood alkaline flesh possesses less of this property alkalinity of the blood is thought to be favourable to the elimination of uric acid whilst anything of an acid nature acts contrarily dr alexander haig writes i consider that every man who eats what is called ordinary diet with butchers meat twice a day and also drinks acid wine or beer will by the time he is 50 have accumulated 300 to 400 grains of uric acid in his tissues and possibly much more and about this time owing to the large amount of uric acid in his body he will probably be subject to attacks of some form of gout or chronic rheumatism dr haig ascribes to the presence of uric acid in the system not only gout and rheumatism but epilepsy hysteria mental and bodily depression diseases of the liver kidneys brain etc the opinion of the majority of eminent medical men during recent years is that uric acid is not a cause but a symptom of gout that uric acid is not an irritant to the tissues and that it is readily excreted in the healthy subject some of the reasons for this latter and against the previously stated hypothesis are as followsbirds very rarely suffer from goutthe nodular concretions sometimes found about their joints and which have been ascribed to gout are of tuberculous originyet their blood contains more uric acid than that of man and the solid matter of their excretion is mainly urates if uric acid caused gout we should expect the disease to be common in birds it is a remarkable fact that the waste nitrogen should be excreted in the form of uric acid or urates from such widely differing classes of animals as birds and serpents birds have a higher body temperature than man they are very rapid in their movements and consume a large amount of food proportionate to their weight they live as it were at high pressure serpents on the other hand have a low body temperature they are lethargic and can live a long while without food there is no obvious reason why some animals excrete urea and others uric acid as uric acid is a satisfactory and unirritating form in which waste nitrogen is expelled from the body of the active alert bird as well as from the slow moving reptile it is surprising if a very much smaller quantity acts as a poison in man many physicians are convinced that uric acid is absolutely unirritating uratic deposits may occur to an enormous extent in gouty persons without the occurrence of any pain or paroxysms urates have been injected in large amounts into the bodies of animals as well as administered in their food with no toxic result whatever or more than purely local irritation the most careful investigations upon the excretions of persons suffering from gouty complaints have failed to show uric acid in the excretions in excess of that in normal individuals except during the later stage of an acute attack there is an excess of uric acid in the blood of gouty subjects some eminent medical men say it is in the highest degree probable that this excess is not due to over production or deficient destruction but to defective excretion by the kidneys the excess may arise from failure of the uric acid to enter into combination with a suitable substance in the blood which assists its passage through the kidneys under the head of gout are classed a number of unrelated disturbances in the gastrointestinal tract and nutritive organs whose sole bond of union is that they are accompanied by an excess of urates and in well developed cases by deposits in the tissues this is why there are so many different causes curative treatments theories contradictions and vagaries in gout there are good reasons for believing that uric acid is not in the free state in the body in the urine it is in combination with alkalies as urates perhaps also with some organic body it has been shown that the blood of the gouty is not saturated with uric acid but can take up more and that the alkalinity of the blood is not diminished the excess over the normal is in many cases small it is said to be absent in some persons and rarely if ever reaches the quantity found in leukaemia leukaemia is a disease marked by an excessive and permanent increase in the white blood corpuscles and consequent progressive anmia neither does the uric acid of gout reach the quantity produced in persons whilst being fed with thymus gland sweetbread for medical purposes in neither of these cases are any of the symptoms of gout present in the urine of children it is not unusual to find a copious precipitate of urates yet without any observed effect on them the symptoms of gout point to the presence of a toxin in the blood and it is this which produces the lesions the deposition of urates in the joints being secondary this poison is probably of bacterial origin derived from decomposing fcal matter in the large intestine this is due to faulty digestion and insufficient or defective intestinal secretions and constipation this explains why excessive feeding especially of proteid food is so bad the imperfectly digested residue of such food when left to stagnate and become a mass of bacteria and putrefaction gives off poisons which are absorbed in part into the system this bacterial poison produces headache migraine gouty or other symptoms because of the general failure of gouty persons to absorb the proper amount of nutriment from their food they require to eat a larger quantity this gives a further increase of fcal decomposition and thus aggravates matters the voluminous bowel or colon of man is a legacy from remote prehuman ancestors whose food consisted of bulky fibrous and slowly digested vegetable matters it was more useful then than now that most of our food is highly cooked about a third part of the fcal matter consists of bacteria of numerous species though chiefly of the species known as the bacillus coli communis one of the less harmful kind which is a constant inhabitant of the intestinal tract in man and animals this species is even thought to be useful in breaking down the cellulose which forms a part of the food of the herbivora flesh meat leaves a residue in which the bacteria of putrefaction find a congenial home poisons such as ptomaines fatty acids and even true toxins are produced it is believed that there exists in the colons of gouty persons either conditions more favourable to the growth of the bacteria of putrefaction or that they are less able to resist the effect of the poisons produced it has generally been found that milk is a very good food for gouty patients this seems due to its being little liable to putrefaction the bacterial fermentation to which it is liable producing lactic acidthe souring of milk the growth of most bacteria particularly the putrefactive kinds are hindered or entirely stopped by acids slightly alkaline media are most favourable this explains how it is that milk will often stop diarrhoea dr haig condemns pulse and some other vegetable foods because he says they contain uric acid pulse he states contains twice as much as most butchers meat vegetable foods however contain no uric acid and meat but a very small quantity the proper term to use is purins or nucleins dr haig has used a method of analysis which is quite incapable of giving correct results many vegetarians have accepted these figures and his deductions therefrom and have given up the use of valuable foods in consequence we therefore give some of the analyses of dr i walker hall from the purin bodies in food stuffs the determination of the purins has proved a very difficult process dr hall has devoted much time to investigating and improving the methods of others and his figures may be accepted with confidence the first column of figures indicates purin bodies in parts per 1000 the second column purin bodies in grains per pound sweet bread

showed a very small quantity and cheese consequently must contain still less the researches of dr hall show that the purins of food are metabolised or broken down by gouty patients almost as well as by normal individuals any slight retention being due to increased capillary pressure a portion of the purins remain undigested the quantity depending upon the particular purin and the vigour of the digestive organs two rabbits had the purin hypoxanthin given to them daily in quantities which if given to a man in proportion to his weight would have been 17 and 3 grains respectively these rabbits showed malnutrition and after death degenerative changes were visible in their liver and kidneys dr hall has made a large number of personal experiments and says that when he has taken large doses of purin bodiessuch as 7 grains of hypoxanthin 15 to 77 grains of guanin or 7 to 15 grains of uric acid apparently associated symptoms of general malaise and irritability have frequently appeared in gouty subjects such moderate or small quantities of purins which are without effect on the healthy subject may prove a source of irritation to the already weakened liver and kidneys professor carl von noorden says of gout with regard to treatment we are all agreed that food containing an excess of purin bodies should be avoided and those words embody almost all there is to be said as to dietetics alcohol is very injurious in gout salicylic acid is a dangerous remedy alkalies in every form are utterly useless dr j woodshutchinson says the one element which has been found to be of the most overwhelming importance and value in the treatment of gout and lithmia water would act most admirably upon a toxic condition from any source first by sweeping out both the alimentary canal primarily and the liver kidneys and skin secondarily and secondly by supplying to the body cells that abundant saltwater bath in which alone they can live and discharge their functions dr woodshutchinson proceeds to state that the one active agent in all the much vaunted mineral waters is nothing more or less than the water their alleged solvent effects are now known to be pure moonshine the value consists in plain water plus suggestionnot to say humbugaided of course by the pure air of the springs and the excellent hygienic rules it is a common experience amongst rheumatic patients that they cannot take lentils haricots and some other foods sometimes even eggs and milk are inadmissible this is not for the alleged reason that they contain purins or as some misname it uric acid but because the digestive organs are unequal to the task it will be seen that although dr haigs hypothesis of uric acid as a cause of gout and some other diseases is disputed by many eminent physicians his treatment by excluding flesh and other foods which contain purins and also pulse which is difficult of digestion by the weakly is a wise one it has proved of the greatest value in very many cases digestion and nutrition is a complex process and it may be faulty at various stages and in several ways there may be either deficient or excessive secretions or inaction thus there are exceptions where gouty symptoms including an excessive quantity of urates in the urine have only been relieved by the giving up of milk foods or starch foods see lancet 1900 i p 1 and 1903 i p 1059 those particularly interested in the subject of the purins and gout are referred to the lecture on the meaning of uric acid and the urates by dr woodshutchinson in the lancet 1903 i p 288 and the discussion on the chemical pathology of gout before the british medical association at oxford see british medical journal 1904 ii p 740 dr george s keith in fads of an old physician has a chapter on rheumatic fever he says that the disease is much more common than it was fifty years ago he has never met with it in the young or old except when the diet had consisted largely of beef and mutton and this although he has been on the outlook for at least forty years for a case of the disease in a child or youth who had not been fed on red meat he speaks of it as being exceedingly common in buenos ayres and rosario in the argentine republic amongst the young and that it leads to most of the heart disease there the amount of meat especially of beef consumed by old and young is enormous the main evils there were anmia in children and neuralgia both in old and young dr haig relates how he suffered from migraine all his life until the time of his discontinuing butchers meat as meat contains a comparatively large quantity of purins and other bodies called extractives it is probable that such quantities have an injurious effect quite apart from the question of uric acid production that an excessive meat diet lessens the vitality of the body and predisposes to disease is undoubted but opinions differ as to how the injury is brought about on thorough masticationwe have written at some length on the quantity and constituents of food required per day and have criticised the usually accepted standards we have since read a valuable contribution to the subject by mr horace fletcher in his book the abz of our own nutrition fa stokes co new york ten years previous to the writing of the book when of the age of 4 he was fast becoming a physical wreck although he was trained as an athlete in his youth and had lived an active and most agreeable life he had contracted a degree of physical disorder that made him ineligible as an insurance risk this unexpected disability and warning was so much a shock that it led to his making a strong personal effort to save himself he concluded that he took too much food and too much needless worry his practice and advice is be sure that you are really hungry and are not pampering false appetite if true appetite that will relish plain bread alone is not present wait for it if you have to wait till noon then chew masticate munch bite taste everything you take in your mouth until it is not only thoroughly liquefied and made neutral or alkaline by saliva but until the reduced substance all settles back in the folds at the back of the mouth and excites the swallowing impulse into a strong inclination to swallow then swallow what has collected and has excited the impulse and continue to chew at the remainder liquid though it be until the last morsel disappears in response to the swallowing impulse in a very short time this will become an agreeable and profitable fixed habit mr fletcher has been under the observation of several eminent scientific men professor rh chittenden of yale university in his report refers to the experiments of kumagawa sivn and other physiologists who have shown that men may live and thrive for a time at least on amounts of proteid per day equal to only onehalf and onequarter the amount called for in the voit standard see p 32 even without unduly increasing the total calories of the food intake such investigations however have always called forth critical comment from writers reluctant to depart from the current standards as extending over too short periods of time dr chittenden writes that he has had in his laboratory for several months past a gentleman hf who for some five years practised a certain degree of abstinence in the taking of food and attained important economy with as he believes great gain in bodily and mental vigour and with marked improvement in his general health the gentleman in question fully satisfies his appetite but no longer desires the amount of food consumed by most individuals for a period of thirteen days in january he was under observation in professor chittendens laboratory the daily amount of proteid metabolised was 4125 grammes the bodyweight 165 pounds remaining practically constant analysis of the excretions showed an output of an equivalent quantity of nitrogen in february a more thorough series of observations was made the diet was quite simple and consisted merely of a prepared cereal food milk and maple sugar this diet was taken twice a day for seven days and was selected by the subject as giving sufficient variety for his needs and quite in accord with his taste no attempt was made to conform to any given standard of quantity but the subject took each day such amounts of the above foods as his appetite craved the daily average in grammes was proteid 449 158 ounces fats 380 carbohydrates 2530 calories 1606 the total intake of nitrogen per day was 719 while the output was 690 it may be asked says professor chittenden was this diet at all adequate for the needs of the bodysufficient for a man weighing 165 pounds in reply it may be said that the appetite was satisfied and that the subject had full freedom to take more food if he so desired the bodyweight remained practically constant and the nitrogen of the intake and output were not far apart an important point is can a man on such food be fit for physical work mr fletcher was placed under the guidance of dr wg anderson the director of the gymnasium of yale university dr anderson reports that on the four last days of the experiment in february 1903 mr fletcher was given the same kind of exercises as are given to the varsity crew they are drastic and fatiguing and cannot be done by beginners without soreness and pain resulting they are of a character to tax the heart and lungs as well as to try the muscles of the limbs and trunk my conclusion given in condensed form is this mr fletcher performs this work with greater ease and with fewer noticeable bad results than any man of his age and condition i have ever worked with to appreciate the full significance of this report it must be remembered writes professor chittenden that mr fletcher had for several months past taken practically no exercise other than that involved in daily walks about town sir michael forster had mr fletcher and others under observation in his cambridge laboratories and in his report he remarks on the waste products of the bowel being not only greatly reduced in amount as might be expected but that they are also markedly changed in character becoming odourless and inoffensive and assuming a condition which suggests that the intestine is in a healthier and more aseptic condition than is the case under ordinary circumstances if we can obtain sufficient nourishment as mr fletcher does on half the usual quantity of food we diminish by half the expenditure of energy required for digestion by thorough mastication the succeeding digestive processes are more easily and completely performed what is also of great importance is that there is not the danger of the blocking up of the lower intestines with a mass of incompletely digested and decomposing residue to poison the whole body even where there is daily defcation there is often still this slowly shifting mass the end portion only being expelled at a time one or more days after its proper period all this improved condition of the digestive tract leaves more vitality for use in other directions a greater capacity for work and clearness of brain professor rh chittenden in physiological economy in nutrition writesour results obtained with a great variety of subjects justify the conviction that the minimum proteid requirements of the healthy man under ordinary conditions of life are far below the generally accepted dietary standards and far below the amounts called for by the acquired taste of the generality of mankind body weight health strength mental and physical vigour and endurance can be maintained with at least onehalf of the proteid food ordinarily consumed from these and other considerations we see that it is not only unnecessary but inadvisable to diet ourselves according to any of the old standards such as that of voit or even to any other standard until they have been very thoroughly revised we shall probably find that as the body becomes accustomed to simpler food a smaller quantity of the food is necessary the proportion of proteids to other constituents in all the ordinary not over manfactured vegetable foods such as are generally eaten may be taken as sufficient several cookery books have been compiled in conformity with certain proteid standards and also with some more or less fanciful requirements these give the quantities and kinds of food which it is imagined should be eaten each day theoretically this should be calculated to accord with the weight temperament age and sex of the eater and the work he or she has to perform the dietaries that we have seen have their proteid ratio placed unnecessarily high this high proteid ratio can be got by the use of the pulses but except in small quantities they are not generally admissible and in some of the dietaries they are ruled out the difficulty is got over by the liberal use of eggs cheese and milk to admit a necessity for these animal products is to show a weakness and want of confidence in the sufficiency of vegetable foods some of these cookery books are of use in sickness especially as replacing those of the beeftea chickenbroth jelly and arrowroot order they provide a halfway stage between flesh and vegetable food such as is palatable to those who have not quite overcome a yearning for flesh and stimulating foods the liberal use of animal products is less likely to excite the prejudice of the ordinary medical practitioner or nurse possibly also a higher quantity of proteid may be required on first giving up flesh foods the use of saltone of the most remarkable habits of these times is the extensive use of common salt or sodium chloride it is in all ordinary shop bread in large quantity in a special and much advertised cereal food even in a largely sold wheat flour and often in pastry it is added to nearly all savoury vegetable food and many persons not content add still more at the time of eating no dinner table is considered complete without one or more saltcellars some take even threequarters of an ounce or an ounce per day the question is not of course whether salt is necessary or not but whether there is a sufficient quantity already existing in our foods some allege that there is an essential difference between added salt and that natural to raw foods that the former is inorganic nonassimilable and even poisonous whilst the latter is organised or in organic combination and nutritive the writer is far from being convinced that there is a difference in food value some herbivorous animals are attracted by salt but not the carnivora this has been explained by the fact that potassium salts are characteristic of plants whilst sodium chloride is the principal saline constituents of blood and of flesh in their food the herbivora take three or four times as much potash salts as the carnivora of course the sodium chloride in the flesh of the herbivora and frugivora is obtained from the vegetable matter forming their food and very few of them have the opportunity of obtaining it from saltlicks and mineral sources they must have the power of storing up the sodium chloride from plants in sufficient quantity whilst the potash salts pass away there is no justification for saying that they are worse off by being deprived of salt if the ape tribe can thrive without added salt why should not man bunge considers that a restriction to vegetable food causes a great desire for salt opposed to this is the fact that certain tribes of negroes who cannot obtain salt add to their vegetable food wood ashes or a preparation of wood ashes this is chiefly potash one preparation used in british central africa was found to contain about 21 per cent of potassium chloride to only 05 per cent of sodium chloride it has been said that vegetarians consume more salt than those who take flesh food we doubt this we know of many vegetarians who have a strong objection to added salt and have abstained from it for years some find that it predisposes to colds causes skin irritation and other symptoms at many vegetarian restaurants the food is exceedingly salty the writer on this account cannot partake of their savoury dishes except with displeasure nearly all who patronise these restaurants are accustomed to flesh foods and it is their taste which has to be catered for flesh and particularly blood which of course is in flesh contains a considerable quantity of sodium chloride and most flesh eaters are also in the habit of using the salt cellar these people are accustomed to a stimulating diet and have not a proper appreciation of the mildly flavoured unseasoned vegetable foods only those who have for a time discontinued the use of added salt and lost any craving for it can know how pleasant vegetables can be even those vegetables which before were thought to be nearly tasteless unless seasoned are found to have very distinct flavours it is then perceived that there is a much greater variety in such foods than was previously imagined it is commonly urged that salt and other condiments are necessary to make food palatable and to stimulate the digestive functions we on the contrary say that condiments are the cause of much overeating and that if food cannot be eaten without them it is a sign of disorganisation of the digestive system and it is better to abstain from food until the appearance of a natural and healthy appetite an excess of salt creates thirst and means more work for the kidneys in separating it from the blood prior to its expulsion even should it be admitted that certain vegetables contain too little sodium salts a very little salt added to such food would be sufficient there is no excuse for the general use of it and in such a great variety of foods it is thought that some cases of inflammation of the kidneys originate in excessive salt eating certain it is that patients suffering from the disease very soon improve on being placed on a dietary free from added salt and also poor in naturally contained sodium and potassium salts it is also possible to cause the swelling of the legs oedema to which such invalids are subject to disappear and reappear at will by withdrawing and afterwards resuming saltcontaining foods the quantity of onethird of an ounce added to the usual diet has after a continuation of several days produced oedema in one patient on a diet of nearly two pounds of potatoes with flesh but without added salt the oedemia disappeared and the albumin in the urine diminished as potatoes are particularly rich in potash salts this case is significant as showing contrary to expectations that such quantity as they contained had not the irritating effect of added common salt salt and other chlorides have been shown by several observers to be injurious not only in diseases of the kidneys but also of the liver and heart in these diseases the excess of salt is retained in the tissues it causes a flow of fluid into them and so produces oedema and favours the increase of dropsy the good effect of milk in such diseases has long been known it is probably due to its relative poverty in sodium and potassium chlorides even in the case of three healthy men by an abrupt change from a diet extremely rich in chlorides to one deficient they were able to reduce the bodyweight by as much as two kilos 4 lbs 6 oz this was by the loss of an excess of water from their connective tissues sodium chloride diminishes the solvent action of water on uric acid and the urates but potassium salts on the contrary do not they may even increase the action although nearly all the medical experience recorded has to do with diseased persons such cases are instructive it is only reasonable to suppose that more than a very small quantity of salt in excess of that natural to the food is a source of irritation in the body even of the ordinarily healthy individual summaryenjoyment of food is dependent upon appetite quite as much as upon the nature of the food better a simple repast with good appetite than sumptuous fare with bad digestion there is indeed a causal relationship between simplicity and health the savage likes the noise of the tomtom or the clatter of wooden instruments what a contrast this is to the trained ear of the musician uncivilised man has little enjoyment of scenery or of animal life except as in respect to their power of providing him with food clothing or other physical gratification what an enormous advance has taken place in the case of the painter his eye and mind can appreciate a wide range and delicacy of colour man has improved on the crabapple and the wild strawberry from a wild grass he has produced the largegrained nutritious wheat vegetables of all kinds have been greatly improved by long continued cultivation in tropical and subtropical climates where wild fruits are more plentiful high cultivation is of less importance than in temperate regions in sparsely inhabited or wild temperate and cold regions in times past when deer and other animals were plentiful and edible fruits few flesh could be obtained at less labour or such intelligence and industry as is required for the cultivation of fruits cereals and other foods scarcely existed flesh almost requires to be cooked to be palatable certainly this much improves its flavour the eating of flesh tends to produce a distaste for mild vegetable foods especially if uncooked in process of time not only flesh but vegetable foods were more and more subjected to cooking and seasoning or mixed with the flesh blood or viscera of the animals killed next food was manufactured to produce a still greater variety to increase the flavour or less frequently to produce an imagined greater digestibility or nutritiveness man has taken that which seemed most agreeable rarely has he been intentionally guided by scientific principles by that which is really best only of late years can it be said that there is such a thing as a science of dietetics although cookery books innumerable have abounded of recent years many diseases have enormously increased some even seem to be new digestive disturbances dental caries appendicitis gout rheumatism diabetes nervous complaints heart disease baldness and a host of other diseases are due in a great measure to abuse of food one of the most learned and original of scientific men professor elie metchnikoff in his remarkable book on the nature of man referring to the variety of food and its complexity of preparation says that it militates against physiological old age and that the simpler food of the uncivilised races is better most of the complicated dishes provided in the homes hotels and restaurants of the rich stimulate the organs of digestion and secretion in a harmful way it would be true progress to abandon modern cuisine and to go back to the simpler dishes of our ancestors a few have lived to a hundred years and physiologists including metchnikoff see no inherent reason why all men apart from accident should not do so most men are old at 70 some even at 60 if we could add 20 or 30 years to our lives what an immense gain it would be instead of a man being in his prime a useful member of the community from about 25 to 60 or perhaps to 70 he would have the same physical and mental vigour to 80 or 90 or even longer this later period would be the most valuable part of his life as he would be using and adding to the accumulated experience and knowledge of the earlier period some perceiving the mischief wrought by luxurious habits urge us to go back to nature to eat natural food this is ambiguous to speak of animals as being in a state of nature conveys the distinct idea of their living according to their own instinct and reason uninterfered with in any way by man the phrase applied to man is either meaningless or has a meaning varying with the views of each speaker if it has any definite meaning it must surely be the giving way to the animal impulses and instincts to cast off all the artifices of civilisation to give up all that the arts and sciences have done for man all that he has acquired with enormous labour through countless failures and successes during hundreds of thousands of years and to fall back to the lowest savageryeven the savages known to us use art in fashioning their arms clothing and shelter to the time when man was a mere animal civilised man is not only an animal but an intellectual and spiritual being and it is as natural for him to clothe himself as for a cow to eat grass our intellect has been made to wait on our animal nature whilst our spiritual has lagged far behind animal food and all else of a stimulating character stimulates the lower nature of man his selfish propensities whilst mild food makes it easier to lead a pure life in the treatment of habitual drunkards in retreats it has been found that a permanent cure is rare upon the usual abundant flesh dietary only by the use of vegetable food particularly farinaceous can a permanent cure be assured the editor of the clarion mr r blatchford or nunquam has lately adopted a vegetarian diet he remarks with surprise that although he has been a heavy smoker for more than 30 years using not less than eight ounces of tobacco a week often two ounces in a day he has found his passion for tobacco nearly gone he has had to get milder tobacco and is now not smoking halfanounce a day he says it does not taste the same i am not nearly so fond of it he finds with regard to wine that he now cannot drink it it tastes like physic he writes these things have come upon me as a revelation i begin to see that the great cure for the evil of national intemperance is not teetotal propaganda but vegetarianism we have given reasons of a scientific character for abstaining from flesh as food but higher than these are those relating to ethics everything relating to the slaughterhouse is revolting to a refined and humane person in the great slaughterhouses of chicago in those huge hideous boxshaped buildings five or six storeys high about ten millions of animals are killed every year they are treated as if they were bales of merchandise and as destitute of feeling bullocks are struck on the head with a mallet and let fall into the basement of the building they are whilst stunned or halfstunned at once strung up by their hind legs to some machinery which moves them along their heads hanging downwards regardless of their agony men run after them to cut their throats followed by others with great pails to catch the blood much of the warm blood is spilt over the men or on the floors but this is of no consequence if but a small fraction of a minute is economised in a short time whether the animal has bled long enough or not it reaches the lowest and darkest and worst ventilated portion of the gloomy building where it is disembowelled the walls and floors are caked with blood the place is filthy there is no proper lavatory accommodation everything both to eyes and nose is detestable even if the windows were kept clean light could not penetrate into the centre of the buildings consequently a large part of the work is done by artificial light tuberculosis is prevalent amongst the workpeople living under such unsanitary conditions serious crime is much more common amongst them than amongst any other class we englishspeaking people who pride ourselves on our civilisation and religion who call ourselves the followers of the gentle jesus the prince of peace yet hunt shoot trap and torture animals for food sport and science our main reason for eating flesh is that of personal gratification we are loath to admit that the lower animals have any rights those eastern peoples who are adherents to the teachings of the gentle buddha hold life sacred mr h fielding who lived many years amongst the simpleminded burmese says that though there is now no law against the sale of beef yet no respectable burman will even now kill cattle or sell beef no life at all may be taken by him who keeps to buddhistic teaching and this is a commandment wonderfully well kept he believes that all that is beautiful in life is founded on compassion and kindness and sympathythat nothing of great value can exist without them do you think that a burmese boy would be allowed to birdsnest or worry rats with a terrier or go ferreting not so these would be crimes that this kindess and compassion for animals has very farreaching results no one can doubt if you are kind to animals you will be kind too to your fellowmen by participating in any form of cruelty or injustice not only to our fellowmen but also to the lower animals we retard our progress towards the higher life the subtler forces in man cannot find their full expression and we are less responsive to spiritual influences printed by hurst bros shaw heath stockport the standard nut meat protose made
