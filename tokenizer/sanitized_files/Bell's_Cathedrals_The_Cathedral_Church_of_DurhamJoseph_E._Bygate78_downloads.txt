published march 1899 second edition revised september 1900 reprinted 1905 the riverside press limited edinburgh general preface this series of monographs has been planned to supply visitors to the great english cathedrals with accurate and well illustrated guidebooks at a popular price the aim of each writer has been to produce a work compiled with sufficient knowledge and scholarship to be of value to the student of archology and history and yet not too technical in language for the use of an ordinary visitor or tourist to specify all the authorities which have been made use of in each case would be difficult and tedious in this place but amongst the general sources of information which have been almost invariably found useful are1 the great county histories the value of which especially in questions of genealogy and local records is generally recognised 2 the numerous papers by experts which appear from time to time in the transactions of the antiquarian and archological societies 3 the important documents made accessible in the series issued by the master of the rolls 4 the wellknown works of britton and willis on the english cathedrals and 5 the very excellent series of handbooks to the cathedrals originated by the late mr john murray to which the reader may in most cases be referred for fuller detail especially in reference to the histories of the respective sees authors preface as much as possible of this brief description of durham is from the personal acquaintance of the writer with the building yet many authorities have of necessity been consulted in its preparation notably a pamphlet by the rev canon w greenwell and the county of durham by jr boyle fsa thanks are also due to the authorities of the cathedral for having freely given permission to make drawings and measurements and to the late mr weatherall chief verger for his kindly assistance and information the illustrations are chiefly from sketches and drawings by the writer

cannot fail to be struck by the beauty of the city of durham with its redroofed houses nestling beneath the majestic site of the cathedral and castle for splendid position the cathedral of durham stands unequalled in this country on the continent perhaps that of albi can alone be compared with it in this respect the cathedral and norman castle are upon the summit of a lofty tongue of land which is almost surrounded by the river wear in parts the banks are rocky and steep in others thickly wooded the river itself is spanned here and there by fine and historic bridges the early history of durham is obscure there are many vague legends in existence a natural consequence perhaps when we remember the various and often speedy changes of ownership to which that part of the country was for centuries subjected to lead up clearly to the founding of the cathedral of durham it will be necessary to describe briefly the earliest introduction of christianity into the north of england that christianity was known in this country during the time of the romans there is sufficient evidence to prove there is however little to show that it existed in the north to any appreciable extent all or nearly all the carved stones altars etc disinterred in that part of the country have been of undoubted pagan origin the ancient kingdom of northumbria comprised the present counties of durham northumberland and yorkshire and a part of the southeast of scotland as far north as the firth of forth this kingdom was subdivided into two portions the southern or deira extended from the tees to the humber and the northern or bernicia reached from the tees to the firth of forth the province of bernicia was settled about ad 547 by ida a chief of the angles who made his headquarters on a steep rock on the seacoast about sixteen miles south of berwick he was succeeded by his son ethelric who built himself a stronghold which he named after his wife bebbanburgh a name still retained in a shortened formbamburgh ethelric was followed by ella whose son edwin was driven into exile by his fierce brotherinlaw ethelfrith and took possession of deira the southern province of northumbria after attaining his majority edwin assisted by redwald regained his kingdom and eventually ruled over the whole of northumbria it is during his reign that we find the first authentic history of christianity in the north edwin married ethelburga a daughter of ethelbert king of kent who had been converted to christianity by the preaching of s augustine he himself received baptism at the hands of paulinus 625633 the great roman missionary who was sent north with the princess ethelburga paulinus fixed his headquarters at york where he built his church the forerunner of the present cathedral this attempt of the romans to christianise northumbria was however of short duration cadwalla and penda rose against them and edwin fell in battle at hatfield moor in yorkshire paulinus despairing of the cause returned to kent with the queenwidow ethelburga and her children and under cadwalla and penda the kingdom soon relapsed into paganism we must now direct our attention to a small barren island on the west coast of scotland iona here came a voluntary exile ad 563 columba a monk said to have been a descendant of the irish kings here he lived and founded a great missionary monastery which afterwards became the centre of christian influence in scotland and the north of england he and his followers were active workers they wrote gospels and devotional books preached and built churches of wood columba died ad 597 but his work was continued in 634 oswald a son of ethelfrith became king of northumbria in his youth he with his brothers had been obliged to flee to scotland where during his exile oswald was converted to christianity by the teachers of iona on his return he defeated and killed cadwalla at hevenfeld or heavenfield near hexham in 634 and became the means of finally introducing christianity into his kingdom soon after he became king oswald sent to iona for help and in reply came a monk who for some reason said by old writers to be his harshness failed in his mission he was replaced by another monk named aidan 635651 who was eminently successful beda speaks of him as a man of great piety and zeal combined with tender charity and gentleness aidan became intimately associated with king oswald the two working together and he chose for his headquarters the small sandy island of lindisfarne off the northumbrian coast which we now know as holy island lindisfarne thus resembled iona and it is probable that the similarity of position and surroundings influenced aidan in his choice however that may be aidan there founded his monastery and directed the work of his monks passing over a short period we find at lindisfarne a monk who is so intimately connected with this cathedral that he demands special attentionthe great s cuthbert sixth bishop of lindisfarne and the patron saint of durham little is known of his birth and parentage some writers give him a scotch origin others irish1 and others again say he was born of humble parents on the banks of the tweed the latter is most probable certain it is that at an early age he was left an orphan and was employed as an undershepherd near to melrose from his earliest youth he was thoughtful and pious and watched and imitated in his mode of life the monks of melrose there are numerous legends and stories of s cuthberts youth he is said to have wrought many miracles even to the extent of stilling a tempest one of these may be told here on account of the share it played in his choice of monastic lifeon a certain night in ad 651 while tending his sheep his companions being asleep cuthbert saw in the heavens a brilliant shaft of light and angels descending these very shortly reascended bearing among them a spirit of surpassing brightness in the morning it was found that the good s aidan was dead the vision had a marked and lasting effect on cuthbert and eventually resulted in his entering the monastery at melrose for ten years cuthbert led a holy and studious life at melrose under prior boisil when he was chosen among others to proceed to the newlyfounded monastery at ripon his sojourn there was however short as owing to doctrinal differences concerning the celebration of easter he and the other scottish monks returned to melrose some four years later on the death of boisil cuthbert was elected his successor as prior of melrose in ad 664 we find him holding the same office at lindisfarne where he remained for twelve years he then retired from his position in order to attain a higher degree of christian perfection by living a solitary life first on a small island near lindisfarne and afterwards on the island of farne near bamburgh there are many stories told of his great piety at this time so that even the wild seabirds are said to have obeyed him 1 sanderson in his edition of rites of durham 1767 says he is said to be descended from the blood royal of the kings of ireland being son of one muriardach and sabina his wife a kings daughter he was educated in the abbey of mailrose in the year ad 685 cuthbert was though against his own wishes consecrated bishop of lindisfarne his great activity and usefulness in this office was soon cut short for in less than two years on the 20th of march ad 687 he died obediently to his own request his body was wrapped in a linen cloth which had been given him by the abbess yerca and placed in a stone coffin the gift of the abbot cudda was interred in the church at lindisfarne he was not to rest however in ad 698 the monks disinterred his remains in order to place them in a speciallyprepared wooden coffin it is said they found the saints body perfectly incorrupt to quote the quaint hegge but whiles they opened his coffin they start at a wonder they lookt for bones and found flesh they expected a skeleton and saw an entire bodie with joynts flexible his flesh so succulent that there only wanted heate to make his bodie live without a soul and his face so dissembling death that elsewhere it is true that sleep is the image of death but here death was the image of sleep nay his very funerall weeds were so fresh as if putrefaction had not dared to take him by the coat2 2 county of durham by jk boyle fsa whatever may be the truth of this his body was placed in a wooden coffin portions of which are still preserved in the chapter library at durham over a century and a half after these events the coast of northumbria was disturbed and troubled by the piratical invasions of the danes the number and violence of these incursions so increased that the whole country lay practically at their mercy becoming alarmed for their own safety and that of their holy relics the monks of lindisfarne fled taking with them the body of their saint and all their sacred vessels and books this occurred in ad 875 here commenced that long wandering which eventually ended in the founding of the cathedral church of durham where the bones of s cuthbert found their final restingplace bishop eardulph and his monks with their sacred charge travelled for seven years over a great portion of the north of england and part of the south of scotland many churches dedicated to s cuthbert in the north are thought to mark their restingplaces from a list of these given by prior wessington the probable route of the wanderers can be approximately made out as followsfirst to elsdon and down the rede to haydon bridge up the south tyne to beltinghame and then following the route of the roman wall to bewcastle turning south to salkeld and thence by eden hall and plumbland into lancashire towards the river derwent here they came to a determination to cross to ireland and took ship from the mouth of the derwent very soon a violent storm arose the vessel became unmanageable and was nearly filled with water which according to symeon immediately turned into blood a return was inevitable it was during this attempt that the famous copy of the gospels known as the durham book was washed overboard into the sea this book is perhaps the most beautiful example of anglosaxon writing and illumination extant and is surpassed only by the celebrated irish ms the book of kells it was shortly afterwards found on the coast in a comparatively uninjured condition and is now preserved in the british museum the wandering monks next turned northwards as far as witherne on the galloway coast and then returned to england through westmoreland and across stainmoor into teesdale staying for a time at a village which no doubt owes it present name cotherstone to this circumstance leaving here and crossing the hills through marske forcett and barton they arrived at the abbey of craike near easingwold where they were kindly treated by the abbot and remained about four months on resuming their journey the monks removed the body of s cuthbert to cuncachester or as we now know it chesterlestreet a former roman camp here the fraternity remained for a hundred and thirteen years and here was the seat of the bishopric of bernicia until ad 995 many are the legends clustering round these journeyings how when leaving lindisfarne the sea opened a passage for them and how in more than one difficulty the dead saint himself gave them assistance notably on one occasion when the bearers were worn out and weary he appeared and showed them where they would find a horse and car in which to carry their burden this horse and car were afterwards used on their journeys in the year 995 again for safety they removed once more under bishop aldhun first for a short time to ripon and then finally to durham it is of this last journey the following story is told coming with him v sanderson on the east side of durham to a place calld wardenlawe they could not with all their force remove his body further for it seemed fastened to the ground which strange and unforeseen accident produced great astonishment in the hearts of the bishop the monks and their associates whereupon they fasted and prayed three days with great devotion to know by revelation from god what to do with the holy body which was soon granted to them it being revealed to eadmer a virtuous man that he should be carried to dunholme where he was to be received to a place of rest they were again in great distress in not knowing where dunholme lay but as they proceeded a woman wanting her cow called aloud to her companion to know if she had seen her who answered she was in dunholme this was an happy and heavenly sound to the distressed monks who thereby had intelligence that their journeys end was at hand and the saints body near its restingplace thereupon with great joy they arrived with his body at dunholme in the year 997 illustration the dun cow arrived at dunholm they raised a little church of wands and branches to protect the sacred relics until a building more worthy of such a charge could be erected this was the beginning of the cathedral and city of durham the condition of the place at this time must have been very wild and it certainly was a natural stronghold the only open spot seems to have been the plateau where the cathedral now stands the site is curiously described in a saxon poem from which the following is a translation the city is celebrated in the whole empire of the britons the road to it is steep it is surrounded with rocks and with curious plants the wear flows round it a river of rapid waves and there live in it fishes of various kinds mingling with the floods and there grow great forests there live in the recesses wild animals of many sorts in the deep valleys deer innumerable as soon as possible a stone chapel was built in which the body of s cuthbert was placed bishop aldhun not satisfied with this determined to establish a great church work was immediately commenced and progressed so rapidly that the building known as the white church was consecrated in ad 999 of this there would seem to be no authentic remains existing although some authorities think portions of it are included in the present cathedral bishop aldhun died in 1018 the next date of importance is the year 1081 when william of saint carileph was appointed bishop by the conqueror he was a monk of the benedictine order and at once drove out and dispossessed the secular clergy at durham replacing them from the benedictine monasteries which were established at jarrow and monkwearmouth bishop carileph is the man to whom we owe the present cathedral of durham in 1088 he was obliged to flee into exile in normandy where he remained three years through his having taken part in the rebellion against william ii it was probably during this time of banishment that he conceived the idea that if he returned to durham he would build a more worthy church such as were already erected and in course of construction in normandy soon after his return in 1091 he commenced to carry out his scheme and we learn that on the 11th of august 1093 the foundation stone of the new church was laid with great pomp the work proceeded rapidly commencing at the east end by the time of bishop carilephs death which occurred in 1096 the walls of the choir the eastern walls of the transepts the tower arches and a portion of the first bay of the nave were completed it is also very probable that the lower portion of the walls of the whole church are of carilephs time after the death of bishop carileph the see of durham remained vacant for three years the monks however were not idle during this period and they continued the work vigorously completing the west walls of the transepts and the vaulting of the north transept in 1099 ralph flambard was appointed bishop and he held the office until 1128 he carried on the building as the funds at his disposal would allow sometimes rapidly and at others more slowly before his death it would appear that he completed the nave as high as the wall plates and altogether finished and roofed the aisles the western towers as far as the height of the roof of the nave are also the work of flambard in 1104 the work was so far advanced as to permit the removal of the body of s cuthbert from the temporary shrine which bishop carileph had erected over it into the new church this ceremony was performed on august 29th 1104 and the coffin was placed in a shrine behind the high altar on flambards death in 1128 the see was again left vacant for five years but we are told that the monks continued the work and completed the nave the portion built by them at this time must of necessity have been the vaulting and roof the architectural features of which are quite in accordance with the date being late norman flambards successor was galfrid rufus who was bishop from 1133 to 1140 during his episcopate the chapterhouse which had been commenced by the monks was completed rufus also replaced the then existing north and south doorways of the nave by those standing today the next bishop william de st barbara 1143 to 1152 does not appear to have added anything to the cathedral during his time of office the see was usurped by william cummin and building operations were no doubt neglected through the troubles arising from the usurpation his successor hugh pudsey 1153 to 1195 was however a great builder appointed to the see at a comparatively early age and living as he did at a time when very great changes were taking place in architectural style he was able to carry out a great deal of beautiful work he began to build a lady chapel at the east end of the choir but although he had made careful preparations and engaged skilled architects and workmen great cracks appeared in the walls before the work had proceeded far and the building was stopped bishop pudsey taking this as a divine revelation that the work was not pleasing to god and the patron s cuthbert abandoned it and commenced another chapel at the west end of the church using in its erection the purbeck marble bases and columns which he had had prepared for his eastern chapel this second attempt was successful and remains to us in that beautiful and unique specimen of transitional work the galilee chapel its date may be taken says canon greenwell as about the year 1175 besides this work pudsey built the hall and solar now called at the top the norman gallery of durham castle little or nothing further seems to have been done until the translation of bishop poore from the see of sarum to durham in 1229 the name of bishop poore is inseparably connected with the building of the present salisbury cathedral and after his removal to durham he conceived the idea of and made preparations for commencing the eastern transept of the cathedral which is a special feature of durham now known as the chapel of the nine altars he was not however destined to live to see his idea carried out the eastern termination of carilephs choir had been apsidal it was found to be in a very unsafe condition cracks and fissures appearing in the walls various bishops and priors sent aid towards the new work but actual building did not commence until after the death of bishop poore in 1237 the erection was commenced by prior melsanby and of course necessitated the taking down of carilephs apses the revaulting of the choir was undertaken at this time doubtless for artistic reasons to bring the new work into harmony with the old the chapel of the nine altars is a rare and valuable specimen of early english gothic architecture of remarkable and graceful design below each of its nine lancet windows was originally an altar dedicated to different saints its great height was obtained by lowering the floor so that the unity of the whole exterior should not be destroyed prior melsanby is also said to have put a new roof on the church prior hugh de derlington who was at the head of affairs from 1258 to 1272 and later from 1285 to 1289 added a belfry to the central tower john fossor made prior of durham in 1342 inserted the large window in the north transept and the west windows of the nave bishop thomas de hatfield 1346 to 1381 seems to have done no architectural work beyond the erection of his own throne and tomb in which he was afterwards buried on the south side of the choir this is an elaborate and sumptuous piece of work and shows remains of rich colouring and gilding about this time also the beautiful altar screen known as the neville screen was erected its cost was principally borne by lord john neville though the priors fossor and berrington and the subordinate cells of jarrow and monkwearmouth were also contributors the screen is of stonevery light and graceful and originally contained in the niches 107 figures which have unfortunately been destroyed bishop walter de skirlaw who occupied the episcopal throne from 1388 to 1405 was a great builder to him mainly we owe the present cloisters though they were completed by his successor cardinal langley in 1418 the monks dormitory on the western side of the cloister is also of this time on the southern side was the refectory this portion was rebuilt by dean sudbury between 1661 and 1684 and converted into a library and such it remains today near the refectory is the kitchen built by prior fossor it is octagonal in plan and possesses a fine groined roof it is now attached to the deanery and known as the deans kitchen we must now turn our attention to the erection of the present central tower the belfry added by hugh de derlington was in 1429 struck by lightning and set on fire it must after this have been repaired in some way but in 1456 it was in a very unsafe and dangerous condition as the following letter written by the prior william ebchester to bishop neville testifies the belfry of your church both in its masonry and timber in consequence of winds and storms is so enfeebled and shaken that doubts are entertained of its standing for any length of time we have called in workmen in both capacities and they have reported to us that three of its sides are out of perpendicular that many of the key and cornerstones of its windows have fallen out that in other respects it is defective and that besides its woodwork is in a state of great decay so that it cannot be expected to stand for any length of time some are of opinion that the belfry should be totally removed as it cannot stand longer others on the contrary wish it to be perfectly restored a thing which exceeds our means unless we have the advantage of charitable aid in this state of doubt and hesitation we have recourse to you as members to their head presuming not to engage in any such great and stupendous alteration with reference to your church without your advice if which god forbid the tower should fall the solemn fabric of our choir and the shrine of our most holy patron would without doubt be broken down and irrevocably laid flat on the ground for that is the direction in which it leans we confess that whenever winds and storms are high and we are standing at our duty in that part of the church we tremble for our fate having positive danger before our eyes shortly afterwards the rebuilding of all the upper part of the central tower was commenced and continued for some years it was not complete in 1474 when richard bell was prior as in a letter written at the time he mentions the reedificacion of our steeple begun but nogt fynyshed in defaulte of goods as god knoweth it is therefore most probable that the upper portion was not completed until towards the close of the fifteenth century we have now reached a period when the glories of gothic architecture were fading during which many of our finest churches suffered considerably durham is no exception to the rule and we find during the next two centuries a long record of destruction and socalled improvement this perhaps reached its worst stage during the time of wyatt who in 1796 pulled down the magnificent norman chapterhouse during the last decade however this has been completely rebuilt from as nearly as possible the original design wyatt also rebuilt the turrets on the eastern transept or nine altar chapel from his own design and removed the great early english rose window in the east end and replaced it by the present one the original stained glass was taken out of all the windows of the east end and raine in his history tells us that it lay for a long time afterwards in baskets upon the floor and when the greater part of it had been purloined the remainder was locked up in the galilee at a still later period about fifteen years ago portions of it were placed in the great round window and the rest still remains unappropriated this was written in 1833 it is also on record that wyatt formed a scheme to reopen the great western doorway of the cathedral by the pulling down of the galilee chapel from which he intended constructing a carriagedrive to the castle this abomination was actually commenced when dean cornwallis arrived and he with the assistance of john carter and the society of antiquaries was fortunately able to put a stop to it thus was this beautiful and unique specimen of transitional norman architecture preserved to us wyatt contemplated several other improvements of a similar character one of which was the surmounting of the central tower by a spire but fortunately he was not allowed to carry them out during the present century many restorations have been made of which we will mention only the most notablethe central tower was restored by sir gilbert scott in 1859 during 1870 to 1876 extensive internal alterations were made a new choir screen and pulpit were erected the floor of the choir laid in marble mosaic the choir stalls returned to their original positions and the walls of the church scraped in order to clear them from the many coats of lime and distemper which lay on them illustration the west end from an old print the norman chapterhouse has lately been restored and in great part rebuilt as a memorial to the late bishop lightfoot illustration the exterior from palace green chapter ii description of the exterior approaching the cathedral church of durham from the north by the large open space between it and the castle known as the palace green we obtain a complete elevation of the whole structure there is little room to doubt though the details naturally vary with the date of erection that the original plan of carilephs church has been carried out in its entirety with two exceptions these are the addition of the eastern transept or nine altar chapel at the east and the galilee or lady chapel at the west end the entire length of the building not including the galilee chapel is 431 feet which is made up as followsnine altar chapel 51 feet the choir 120 feet the transept 57 feet and the nave 203 feet the western towers are square and solid and were evidently included in carilephs own scheme as the wall arcades on both the interior and exterior are carried round them the norman work is continued as far as the nave roof and it is extremely probable that they were originally terminated at this height in accordance with the norman custom with low pyramidal spires probably of wood exactly at what date they were raised is not on record but the style of architecture of the upper portion suggests the early part of the thirteenth century the added portion namely that above the clerestory consists of four stages and is beautifully varied by moulded arcading with blind and open arches the first and third stages have pointed arches while those of the second and fourth are round above this again were tall wooden spires covered with lead these were removed about the year 1657 and towards the close of the eighteenth century the present pinnacles and open parapets were added at this time also much of the surface of the towers was renewed the central towerthe present central tower is noble in proportion and forms a fitting and harmonious summit to the whole group it must needs be of a very different character from the old norman tower of which no trace now remains and was most probably of the usual type low and square and surmounted by a short pyramidal spire the existing structure may be attributed to bishop booth and prior richard bell about 1474 when the letter previously quoted was written externally the tower is divided into two storeys the lower portion contains on each side a pair of twolight windows glazed each divided by a transom and their heads having an ogee label crocketed and finished with a tall finial also crocketed between and on either side of these windows are panelled pilasters and brackets carrying figures the lower and upper stages are divided by a narrow external gallery running round the tower and protected by a pierced embattled parapet this is known as the bell ringers gallery and certainly adds greatly to the effect of the tower as a whole the upper stage which is much less lofty has also two twolight windows on each face surmounted by crocketed ogee label mouldings and finials these lights are louvred the whole is surmounted by a deep openwork parapet on each angle of the tower are two buttresses which are decorated with panelling and canopied and crocketed niches containing figures the interior of the tower or lantern is remarkable for the gallery which runs round it which is reached from the roofs of the nave and choir transepts by doors it rests on corbels each alternate one being carved with grotesque heads and is protected by a parapet pierced in quatrefoils the four doorways are ogeeheaded with crockets and finials there is strong evidence in the construction of the present tower that it was the original intention to surmount it by some other erection probably a spire each interior angle contains strong and massive squinches which are of no constructive use at present and must have been originally inserted to carry some superstructure the buttresses at the angles are also carried up to the parapet which would seem to point to the same conclusion why this project was never carried out cannot be said but probably it would not have added to the artistic effect of the tower the belfry contains a peal of eight bells illustration the central tower the east frontthe circumstances which led to the removal of carilephs apses and the erection of the eastern transept have already been referred to the present east end is divided into three bays by massive buttresses each of which contains three lofty lancet windows separated by smaller buttresses over all and in the gable is the famous large rose window the north and south ends of the transept are finished with the tall pyramidal pinnacles erected by wyatt the west front of durham has curiously enough also lost its original character the western doorway of the cathedral is hidden on the exterior by the galilee or lady chapel which was added by pudsey in 1175 above the galilee roof is the large window inserted about the year 1346 while john fossor was prior the pointed arch of this window has over it on the exterior the original great semicircular arch above this again and between the two flanking western towers is a small gable the west end of the cathedral when seen from the opposite side of the river is extremely picturesque the projecting mass of the galilee the western towers the foreshortened nave roof and the majestic central tower behind and above form a group of high and rare excellence the north door is now the principal entrance to the cathedral externally the present porch is the work of wyatt the first porch was norman of four orders depth with detached shafts in the recesses above this was a highpitched gable and roof the front being ornamented with a semicircularheaded wall arcading the inner side of the doorway is of two orders only and is probably the only remaining portion of the original the outer shaft is left plain while the inner one in each case is most elaborately carved the capitals are all carved and the arch moulds richly ornamented with chevrons foliage and lozenges as well as many curious figure subjects while examining this doorway notice should be taken of the ironwork of the door itself and particularly of the sanctuary knocker in medival times all churches afforded sanctuary to wrongdoers but at places where the shrines of saints existed the sanctuary privileges were much greater durham being one of these there are many curious cases on record of persons claiming the privilege and protection from the secular law the earliest instance of which any record has been kept of sanctuary being claimed at the shrine of s cuthbert is during the episcopate of cynewulf who was bishop from 740 to 748 and the last recorded was in 1524 criminals claiming sanctuary were admitted by two janitors who occupied two small chambers over the doorway traces of which may still be observed the knocker itself as may be seen from the illustration is a great grotesque head made of bronze and hanging from its grinning mouth is a ring originally there is no doubt the eyes were filled with crystals or enamel as small clawlike pieces of bronze remain by which the filling was attached the age of this piece of work is probably the same as that of the doorway itself illustration detail of ironwork illustration the sanctuary knocker illustration ironwork on doors of cloisters the south doorwaysthere are two doorways into the south aisle one known as the monks door opening from the western portion of the cloisters and immediately opposite the north porch just described on the cloister side this shows a norman arch resting on double shafts which are enriched with a lozenge pattern on the inner or aisle side there are two orders with shafts in the recesses which are also decorated with the lozenge the inner arch is carved with chevrons and the outer with conventional foliage and medallions the capitals are richly carved with foliage and grotesques on the abacus and arch of this doorway occurs a leaf pattern strongly suggesting the byzantine influence which at one time was found in norman decoration here again on the door itself we have a fine specimen of very elaborate and characteristic norman ironwork the second known as the priors door opens into the south aisle from the eastern alley of the cloister is also norman the outer or cloister side is of the time of bishop pudsey and has an arch of four orders with three shafts in the recesses on either side its once elaborate sculpture is now much decayed not enough remaining to suggest that in its original state this doorway must have been a noble specimen of the architectural design of its period on the inner side it exhibits work of carilephs time with an early arch cushion capitals and shafts illustration ornament on south doorway the western doorwaythe exterior of this great doorway is now within the galilee chapel it was built by flambard 10991128 and is comparatively plain on the galilee side it consists of an arch of four orders ornamented with chevrons the inner face is very similar to the outer but is shallower having only two orders the shafts and capitals are without decoration and the arch ornamented with chevron and a leaf pattern with medallions carved with grotesque animals in order to reopen this doorway and make a carriage road up to it wyatt proposed pulling down the galilee chapel illustration the cloister the cloister occupies a large open space bounded on the south east and west by the various monastic buildings and on the north by the cathedral itself the existing cloister was commenced during the time of bishop skirlaw 1388 to 1406 and was completed by cardinal langley who held the see from 1406 till 1438 probably in the earlier part of his episcopate the contracts the first dated 1398 for building the cloister are still preserved in the treasury we are indebted to bishop skirlaw for their very existence as it is recorded that he contributed sums of money for this purpose both during his life and by his will the cloister as seen today has been very much altered and restored and probably the only original feature remaining is the fine oaken ceiling this is panelled and moulded and decorated with shields upon which are painted and gilded various coats of arms in the centre of the cloister garth are the remains of what was the monks lavatory it was erected in the years 1432 and 1433 and was of octagonal shape some of the stone for its construction was brought from egglestoneontees on payment of rent to the abbot of that place to quarry it it is said to have had twentyfour brass spouts seven windows and in its upper storey a dovecote the roof of which was covered with lead there is no doubt that there was a cloister attached to the monastery in its early days but of this no trace remains it is also probable that one was erected by bishop pudsey though this also has entirely vanished unless as suggested by canon greenwell some marks of a leanto roof on the north and east walls may be traces of its presence in the western alley of the cloister is the old treasury rich in records and the vestries for canons kings scholars and choristers the alley opens at the end into what is now called the crypt see p 85 this was undoubtedly the common hall of the monks it is a spacious stonevaulted chamber the columns are low and massive with simple moulded caps from which the chamfered vaulting ribs diverge over the hall or crypt is the dormitory which for a long time formed part of a residence attached to one of the stalls it is now however used as a library it occupies the whole of the western side of the cloister and is 194 feet long it was originally subdivided by wooden partitions into separate sleepingrooms for each monk its massive roof of oak is worthy of attention the tree trunks being merely roughly squared with an axe see p 99 in the south alley was the refectory and the monks common dininghall the original building is now entirely altered though there remains beneath it a very early crypt with plain short square piers and a simple quadripartite vault without ribs another portion is covered by a wagonhead vault whether the original refectory was of similar architectural character it is now impossible to say as whatever it may have been it was removed early in the sixteenth century and rebuilt and after the dissolution of the monastery was used by the minor canons of the church as a common hall it seems to have fallen into a bad state of repair and was again entirely reconstructed by dean sudbury 16611684 who was elected to that office immediately after the restoration he converted it into a library to which use it is still put the account of this building given in the antiquities of durham is of sufficient interest to bear quotation in the south alley of the cloysters says our authority is a large hall called the fraterhouse finely wainscotted on the north and south sides and in the west and nether part thereof is a long bench of stone in masonwork from the cellar door to the pantry or cove door above the bench is wainscot work two yards and a half high finely carved and set with imbossd work in wainscot and gilded under the carved work above the wainscot was a large picture of our saviour christ the blessed virgin mary and s john in fine gilt work and most excellent colours which pictures having been washed over with lime did long appear through it this wainscot had engraven on the top of it thomas castell prior anno domini 1518 mensis julij whence it is manifest that prior castell wainscotted the fraterhouse round about within the fraterhouse door on the left hand at entering is a strong almery in the wall wherein a great mazer called the grace cup stood which every day served the monks after grace to drink out of round the table which cup was finely edged about with silver and double gilt in the same place were kept many large and great mazers of the same sort every monk had his mazer severally by himself to drink in and had all other things that served the whole convent and the fraterhouse in their daily service at their diet and at their table at these times at meals the master observed these wholesom and godly orders for the continual instruction of their youth in virtue and learning that is one of the novices appointed by the master read some part of the old and new testament in latin during dinner having a convenient place at the south end of the high table within a beautiful glass window encompassd with iron and certain stone steps with iron rails to go up to an iron desk whereon lay the holy bible this fabrick retained the name of the petty canons hall till dr sudbury dean of the cathedral generously erected a beautiful library in its place but he not living to finish it compleatly did by a clause in his last will bind his heir sir john sudbury to the due execution thereof illustration s cuthberts chest the contents of the library are both numerous and interesting there are several thousands of volumes many of them being rare and valuable numerous ancient illuminated mss among which is a copy of the gospels of s mark s luke and s john written before the year 700 and several books given by bishops carileph and pudsey among the latter is a bible in four volumes in its original stamped leather binding a collection of ancient copes belonging to the cathedral and the remains of the robes of s cuthbert and other relics taken from his coffin when it was exhumed in 1827 may also be seen here numerous specimens of roman altars tablets and sculptured stones from various roman stations in durham and northumberland notably from hexham are preserved in this library which is open to the public on tuesday and friday in each week from eleven to one the room is finely proportioned and has a magnificent open timber roof illustration the chapterhouse the chapterhouse opens upon the eastern alley of the cloister the present building is a very recent restoration of the original which is acknowledged to have been the finest existing norman chapterhouse remaining in england it was erected or more probably completed during the time of bishop galfrid rufus 11331140 and was in existence until 1796 during the episcopate of bishop barrington at that time it was almost totally destroyed on the advice of wyatt who reported to the chapter that it was in a ruinous state the truth of this report is doubtful but the partial demolition of the building was ordered in november 1795 and also the construction of a new room on the site the work of destruction was begun by knocking out the keystones of the vaulting and allowing the roof to fall in the eastern half of the building was then altogether removed and the remaining portion enclosed by a wall its interior was faced with lath and plaster a plaster ceiling and a boarded floor being added fortunately authentic records of its original appearance both exterior and interior are in existence they are the drawings made for the society of antiquaries by john carter in 1795 its dimensions were 78 by 35 feet the east end being apsidal and the roof a vault of one span round the wall of the interior ran a stone bench raised on two steps which was surmounted except at the west end by a wall arcade of roundheaded intersecting arches similar to that in the aisles of the cathedral but with single instead of double shafts above the arcade was a string course carved with zigzag ornament the entrance was from the west end and the east end was occupied by two seats one for the bishop and one for the prior in the apse were five threelight windows of the decorated period and above the western door a fivelight perpendicular window which contained coloured glass illustrating the root of jesse on either side of this was a window of two lights divided by a shaft and enclosed under one arch carved with chevron ornament there was also a roundheaded norman window in each of the north and south walls a doorway in the south wall led to three chambers one larger and two smaller which are stated in the rites of durham to have been used as a prison for the monks the chapterhouse was used in early times as a burialplace for the bishops and many of their graves with inscriptions were in existence previous to the demolition of 1796 during excavations in 1874 the graves of bishops flambard galfrid rufus s barbara de insula and kellaw were opened when various rings and the head of a crozier were discovered and removed to the dean and chapter library the chapterhouse has now been entirely restored as a memorial to the late bishop lightfoot the northern alley of the cloister running along the south wall of the church contains little of interest except the two doorways previously described the effect of the cloister as a whole in its original condition with the windows glazed many containing fine stained glass the oak roof with its heraldry and colour and the lavatory in the centre of the garth must have been exceptionally fine illustration the exterior from the southeast a sculptured panel on the northwest turret of the nine altar chapel is now known as the dun cow the original sculpture was replaced in the last century by the existing panel but the legend connected with it is interesting after their flight from chesterlestreet the monks bearing the body of s cuthbert remained some time at ripon while trying to return to chesterlestreet at a place called wardlaw the coffin stuck fast and remained absolutely fixed a fast of three days was proclaimed and kept when it was revealed to them that they were to carry their saint to dunholme still they were in difficulties not knowing where dunholme was but fortune or providence again favoured them a woman who had lost a cow passed calling to a companion to inquire if she had seen the animal the reply was that her cow was in dunholme and to the relief of the monks they and their precious charge soon safely arrived there in grateful commemoration of the incident flambard erected this monument of a milkmaid and her cow see p 9 the exterior of durham cathedral as a whole may at first sight be disappointing to the visitor seen from a near view there is a certain flatness of effect and want of light and shade which is perhaps slightly unpleasant this is however largely attributable to the scaling and scraping process to which the building was subjected during the last century when some inches of the outer surface of the stone and with it much architectural detail were removed the result is the flatness previously alluded to and a general newness of appearance pervades the structure seen however from a distance where only the finelygrouped and proportioned masses of masonry towers and turrets stand against the sky the result is magnificent giving an impression of grandeur and dignity unsurpassed by any other english cathedral illustration the nave looking west chapter iii description of the interior if the exterior of durham is in any way disappointing the interior more than compensates for its shortcomings the general impression on entering the church is one of simple dignity and solemnity the great massiveness of the structure and absence of elaborate ornament no doubt contribute to this feeling the pious builders of old have certainly contrived to stamp on their work their own feeling of awe in the presence of the allpowerful and eternal god whatever has been lost through vandalism and the restorer this remains unaltered the general design of the church exclusive of detail which of course changed and developed with the progress of gothic art has undoubtedly been carried out on the plan intended by bishop carileph the only important variation being the addition of the transept at the east end known as the nine altars chapel the original plan consists of a nave and aisles transepts with aisles on their eastern side a choir also with aisles and the three apses of the east end with a central tower over the junction of transepts nave and choir and towers flanking the west end illustration one bay of the nave measured drawing each bay of the nave is divided into two subbays the main bays have massive piers with engaged shafts on the recessed faces the bases of these are cruciform in plan though the arms of the cross are very short at the height of the springing of the arch the shafts are surmounted by plain cushion capitals the division into subbays is effected by the introduction midway of a massive round column on a square base these columns are ornamented in various ways by channels cut on the face some take the form of a zigzag some a spiral others a spiral in two directions forming a trellislike pattern and others again are reeded vertically their capitals are octagonal cushions the arches of the subbays are recessed square with the usual norman roll moulding decorated with chevrons and on the wall face a square billet the chevron ornament is absent in the earlier work in the choir and transepts the triforium is almost uniform throughout the whole church in each subbay it consists of two small arches under one larger one with the tympanum solid here also the capitals are cushions and perfectly plain illustration triforium and clerestory above the triforium is the clerestory which contains one light to each subbay and surmounting all is the vaulting which springs from the piers and from grotesquely carved corbels between the triforium arches the vaulting ribs are ornamented with chevrons on either side of a bold semicircular moulding so much for the general arrangement of the bays some idea of the massiveness of the structures may be gathered when it is known that each group of the clustered pillars separating the bays covers an area of two hundred and twentyfive square feet at its base while those of the cylindrical columns of the subbays are twelve feet square and the columns themselves have a circumference of over twentythree feet there is little room to doubt that the effect obtained by the old builders of durham was intentional the masterly way in which great masses of solid masonry greater than was constructively necessary are handled and the reticence and delicacy of the ornament combine to prove this there is in the whole scheme a delightful union of great power and vigour in the masses and of tenderness and loving care in the detail the choir is the earliest part of the church its two western bays show carilephs work but the eastern piers have been considerably altered owing to the addition at a later period of the eastern transept when carilephs apses were taken down this bay contains some very rich and beautiful detail the piers on either side of the choir are decorated with arcades the lower stage having six arches and the upper three all richly carved with foliage in the caps and hood moulds and with heads and half figures there is also a square aumbry on each pier above the upper arcade which breaks through the level of the triforium string course which is also carried round it there is on each pier a figure of an angel beneath a canopy these are the only two figures remaining of many which formerly added to the beauty of the interior of the church the vaulting of the choir is thirteenthcentury work quadripartite the ribs decorated with dogtooth ornament and square leaves and has fine bosses at the intersections of the diagonal ribs the choir of durham is especially interesting to the student of architecture showing as it does the early norman work of carileph combined with the early english and early decorated work of the newer eastern portion on the south side of the choir stands the monument of bishop hatfield who directed the see of durham from 1345 until 1381 this monument is beneath the episcopal throne which was erected by bishop hatfield himself it consists of an altar tomb surmounted by a recumbent effigy of the bishop in richlyworked robes beneath a canopy richly groined with foliated bosses at the intersections of the ribs on the walls at the east and west ends may still be seen the remains of fresco painting representing in each case two angels beneath the staircase leading up to the throne is a very fine decorated arcade containing several shields bearing the bishops and other arms the whole structure was originally richly coloured and gilded and remains of this work can still be made out it is a noble specimen of the work of its date immediately opposite the tomb of bishop hatfield on the north side of the choir the visitor will notice the recentlyerected memorial to the late bishop lightfoot this is an altar tomb of black and coloured marble the sides are ornamented with panels of perpendicular tracery containing shields round the upper mouldings runs a latin inscription in brass the whole is surmounted by a recumbent figure of the bishop in white marble his hands on his breast and his feet resting against three books originally designed by sir edgar boehm ra at his death the monument was completed by alfred gilbert ra the beautiful altar screen is usually known as the neville screen and was erected about the year 1380 mainly from moneys supplied by john lord neville of raby it spans the whole of the choir and is continued along the sides of the sacrarium forming sedilia of four seats on either side it is pierced by two doors which lead to the shrine of s cuthbert immediately behind the screen though very light and graceful in appearance the screen as it is at present can give the beholder little idea of what its appearance must have been when each of its canopied niches contained a figure aglow with gold and colour there were originally 107 of these statues the centre one representing our lady supported on either side by s cuthbert and s oswald unfortunately none of the figures remain in situ immediately in front of the steps of the high altar will be seen the matrix of a large brass it covers the grave of ludovick de bellomonte bishop of durham from 1318 to 1333 the slab which is in two pieces measures fifteen feet ten inches by nine feet seven inches and an examination will show the brass to have been an elaborate and sumptuous composition unfortunately all the metal work has disappeared the stalls as they originally existed were destroyed in 1650 by the scottish prisoners who were kept in the cathedral after the battle of dunbar the present stalls we owe to bishop cosin 1660 to 1672 and they are remarkable pieces of carving for that date in general character they imitate perpendicular work though the details do not adhere altogether to that style before leaving this part of the church a note may be devoted to the alterations and additions made during the years 1870 to 1876 a new screen between the nave and choir was then erected the choir floor relaid with marble mosaic the stalls replaced in their old positions and new portions made to replace those destroyed in 1846 a new organ pulpit and lectern were also added the new choir screen is very much open to criticism though no doubt beautiful in detail and of excellent workmanship its effect as a whole is not pleasant when seen from the west end silhouetted against the light of the choir a screen previously existed in this position erected by bishop cosin this was removed in 1846 with the idea of improving the appearance of the church from the west end by obtaining a vista through to the neville screen and rose window of the eastern transept the effect seems however to have been disappointing hence the erection of the present screen which may or may not have improved matters in the two western piers of the choir holes may be seen cut in the stonework these received the roodbeam from which during lent the lenten curtain was suspended illustration the choir looking west the north aisle of the choir again shows the joining and harmonising of the new work of the eastern transept with the earlier norman work inside the church the most easterly bay appears to be altogether of early english date but on the exterior it will be seen that the norman wall runs right up to the western wall of the eastern transept the interior of the bay however is enriched with a wall arcade similar to that in the nine altars chapel and the arch and vault are decorated with foliage and dogtooth ornament along the side wall of this aisle runs a stone bench bearing the arms of bishop walter de skirlaw 1388 to 1405 near which he was buried but his monument and brass erected by himself have disappeared slightly westward of the bench is a doorway which at one time opened into the sacrists exchequer erected by prior wessington but it has long ago been destroyed the piers of the west end of this aisle bear marks which were originally holes cut in the stone these served to support a porch having a rood and altar which is thus described in the rites of durham right over the entrance of this north alleye going to the songe scoole the exchequer mentioned above there was a porch adjoyninge to the quire on the south and s benedicks altar on the north the porch having in it an altar and the roode or picture of our saviour which altar and roode was much frequented in devotion by docteur swalwell sometime monk of durham the said roode havinge marveilous sumptuous furniture for festivall dayes belonginge to it the south aisle of the choir is similar architecturally to the north aisle here may be seen a doorway of late thirteenthcentury work which originally led to the revestry now destroyed here again the eastern piers bear marks left by holes in the stonework which originally earned the supports of a screen in front of which the black rood of scotland which was taken from king david at the battle of nevilles cross 1346 was placed the rood is described as having been brought from holyrood by david bruce and was made of silver with effigies of our saviour s john and our lady having crowns of gold on their heads the black rood was restored to its original possessors at the close of the war the windows of both the choir aisles originally contained very fine old stained glass representing various saints and scenes in the life of s cuthbert the transeptsleaving the choir by its western end the visitor at once enters the transepts a large portion of these including the great piers and arches which carry the central tower are without doubt of the time of carileph the eastern side of both is certainly his work while the western is probably the building which was carried on by the monks in the interval between carilephs death in 1096 and the appointment of flambard to the see in 1099 the work on the eastern sides differs little from that of the choir while that of the western sides being plainer has been thought by some to indicate a want of means on the part of the monks while carrying on the work in the interval just alluded to each transept consists of two bays with an aisle on the eastern side access to which is gained by the ascent of three steps each of the three subbays nearest the north and south extremities originally contained an altar those in the north transept being dedicated to s nicholas and s giles s gregory and s benedict over the site of the latter may still be seen remains of fresco painting the altars in the south transept were dedicatedone to s faith and s thomas the apostle one to our lady of bolton and the other to our lady of houghall the north transept is closed by a large window which is the work of prior fossor probably about the year 1362 the window is of six lights and the head contains late geometrical tracery the architectural feature of this window especially for its date is the transom which crosses the mullions and which is not visible from the exterior below the transom is a second inner set of mullions supporting a small gallery by means of which access may be had to the triforium in the year 1512 the window was repaired by prior castell who filled it with stained glass containing large figures among others of s augustine s ambrose s gregory and s jerome from this circumstance the window became known as the window of the four doctors of the church prior castell also contrived to introduce a figure of himself kneeling at the feet of the virgin the large window at the end of the south transept also named from the glass it contained the te deum window is in the perpendicular style and is of six lights it may possibly have been the work of prior wessington 1416 to 1446 along the sill of this window also access may be had to the triforium illustration the transepts looking north both the northwest and southwest corners of the transepts contain stairways opening at their various levels on to the triforium clerestory and the space between the vaulting and the roof that in the south transept also gives access to the central tower and belfry an ascent of which if the day be clear will repay the visitor for his fatiguing climb of three hundred and forty steps by the magnificent view spread at his feet the transepts were no doubt the earliest part of the building to be vaulted that of the northern arm being plain is probably the earlier while that of the south arm though of similar character has zigzag ornaments several of the priors of durham were buried in the transepts the first prior fossor 1364 and the last robert ebchester who died in 1484 on the piers of the transepts projecting brackets may be noticed these are of perpendicular date and originally carried statues the crossing or space between the four piers supporting the central tower gives us a fine view of the interior of the lantern the tower is carried on four large clustered norman piers with semicircular arches over the arches and seventyseven feet above the floor of the church is the lower stage of the lantern round which is a gallery with an open pierced parapet it rests on corbels each alternate one being carved with a grotesque head the walls are panelled up to the base of the great windowseach panel having two cinquefoiled arches under a crocketed canopy and final while between them are small buttresses also panelled and ending in a finial which reaches the same height as the canopy over the panelling is a string course ornamented with that characteristic ornament of the perpendicular period the tudor flower and above this on each face two tall windows near together each window has two lights and is divided by a transom the roof of the lantern is groined with fine bosses at the intersections of the ribs the whole seen from below has a very fine effect and must be very different in appearance from the original norman structure the whole of the lantern was refaced and the statues which had been removed from their niches were replaced some thirty years ago by the dean and chapter of durham illustration corbel in choir the norman east endthe original form of the norman east end has long been the subject of discussion and conjecture it was practically safe to assume that the choir ended in an apse though whether the aisles were also apsidal or continued round a great apse as an ambulatory was a debatable point this question has now been finally settled illustration the choir looking east during some operations necessitating the opening of the floor in january 1895 certain indications were found which led the diocesan architect mr ch fowler and canon greenwell to continue the excavation the result was the discovery that carilephs church certainly possessed three apsesa large one terminating the choir and smaller ones the aisles the apses of the aisles were square externally and apsidal internally the great apse consisted of five bays one on either side next to the choir forming an oblong between the choir and the springing line of the curve of the apse over which would be the great sanctuary arch the remainder or apse proper was divided into three bays by engaged clustered shafts similar to those of the choir and nave it was surrounded by a wall arcade of the same character as that of the rest of the church the base of one of the shafts of the arcade was found in position an extremely interesting point in this discovery is the fact that the levels are the same as those of the nave and choir the foundations are on the rock at the same depth and the aisle walls and apse walls are in the same line the external square line of the aisle apses is in line with the springing of the choir apse the foundations of the apse to the north aisle have been thoroughly excavated and there is every reason to believe that that on the south side of the church entirely corresponds the width of the north aisle apse from north to south is nine feet eight inches there can be little doubt judging from the remainder of carilephs work that all three apses were covered with stone vaults though of precisely what character can only be a matter of conjecture the cracking previously spoken of which led to this part of the church being taken down and the new eastern transept being erected cannot have arisen from any subsidence of the foundations it in all probability was the result of the thrust of the apse vaults on to walls which were insufficiently buttressed the marks on some of the stones found during this excavation and the shape of others seem to point to the conclusion that here we have the earliest part of the church and that carileph used up in his foundations much of the stone of aldhuns white church of the two usual eastern endings to norman churchesviz those with three apses and those having the aisle carried round as an ambulatorythe latter is far more common in england and the former on the continent there are two other notable instances of the three apsidal arrangement in england s albans 1077 which is earlier than durham and peterboro 1117 which is later than and was probably modelled on durham there are many examples of ambulatoriesthe white tower church london winchester gloucester worcester and norwich being among them illustration corbel in choir the apses of durham are of considerable depth from east to west the oblong bay previously mentioned which is fourteen feet wide in that direction adding greatly to this effect the width of the foundations is fourteen feet and the width of the wall has been seven feet the diameter of the choir apse from north to south was about thirtytwo feet illustration plan of norman east end these discoveries are specially interesting completing as they do the whole chain and leading us with very little imagination to see in its original condition what must have been and may even now claim to be the most noble example of norman architecture in our country illustration triforium of nave and choir illustration capital in the nine altars chapel the nine altars chapelleaving the consideration of what once occupied the site of the east end of durham we will turn our attention to the beautiful erection which now stands there the eastern transept or as it is named from the altars of the saints it once contained beneath its windows the chapel of the nine altars it is approached from the aisles by steps the floor level being lower than that of the church proper it is altogether a remarkable and interesting structure with its lightness and loftiness contrasting grandly with the massive norman nave and choir its clustered columns of polished marble alternating with stone its fine bold sculpture its splendid vaulted roof and rich arcading it forms a perfect example of the early english style though regular and symmetrical in general design the detail shows great variety and even irregularity a quality so often present in old work and so much to its advantage in general character it may be compared with that at fountains abbey which was built during the same time illustration capital in the nine altars chapel the circumstances leading to its erection have been already referred to the norman apses having been partly removed owing to their dangerous condition the new work as it was always called was commenced in the year 1242 the eastern wall with its rose and nine lancet windows is the earliest part of the chapel the north and south walls being later the joining and blending of the work with the norman of carilephs choir had evidently been accomplished when the chapel was almost completed the eastern wall is of three bays each bay having three lofty lancet windows the bays are not of equal width the centre one being regulated by the width of the nave of the church and narrower than the north and south bays illustration sections of hood and arch mouldings a very beautiful arcade runs completely round the walls it is of trefoil arches deeply and richly moulded supported on marble columns carved with foliage over the arches is a hood mould terminating with heads in the spandrels are a series of deeplysunk and moulded quatrefoils two of which contain sculpture the bases of the columns rest on a plinth surmounting this arcade is a moulded string from the level of which rise the windows and above the windows another string course and a second range of windows in the centre bay however is the large rose window which is over thirty feet in diameter illustration the nine altars chapel the division of the chapel into three bays is effected by two main vaulting arches which spring on the western side from the piers of the east end of the choir and on the eastern side from responds of clustered shafts alternately of marble and stone banded at intervals and having richly carved capitals the arches themselves are deeply moulded and ornamented with dogtooth ornament and foliage the vault of the central bay has eight ribstwo springing from each of the clusters just described and two from each of the choir piers the vaulting of the remaining bays is quadripartite but has peculiarities which are worthy of notice arising from inequality of width we must not omit to call attention to the exquisite sculpture of the vaulting the centre has figures of the four evangelists while in the north is a beautifully executed carving of vine and grapes and in the south figure subjects among the sculptured heads on the wall arcade at the south end at the western side of the two bays into which the south wall is divided are two which are portraits of the men to whom we owe the design and execution of the beautiful sculpture of this chapel one is an elderly man the other much younger and both wear linen dustcaps over their heads the nine lancet windows were originally filled with ancient stained glass which as the reader will remember was removed below each window was an altar they were dedicated a follows beginning at the south end of the chapel 1 s andrew and s mary magdalene 2 s john the baptist and s margaret south bay 3 s thomas of canterbury and s catherine 4 s oswald and s lawrence 5 s cuthbert and s bede middle bay 6 s martin 7 s peter and s paul 8 s aidan and s helen north bay 9 s michael the archangel the rose window over the lancets of the middle bay is wyatts restoration of the original one it consists of an outer circle of twentyfour and an inner circle of twelve radiating lights the mullions of which are received on a foliated circle in the centre in the north wall of the chapel is a very fine window known as the joseph window on account of the stained glass it originally contained which illustrated the lifehistory of joseph it is a beautiful example of early decorated or geometrical gothic and is of six lights there is an inner plane of tracery resting on clustered shafts which is connected to the mullions of the window proper by through stones the window occupies the complete width of the north end of the chapel the painted glass which it once contained is thus described in the rites of durham in the north alley of the said nine altars there is another goodly faire great glass window called josephs window the which hath in it all the whole storye of joseph most artificially wrought in pictures in fine coloured glass accordinge as it is sett forth in the bible verye good and godly to the beholders thereof this window deserves the attention of the architectural student as it is an exceedingly fine specimen of the tracery of its date the south wall of the chapel contains two windows each divided by a central mullion and having an inner mullion connected by through stones they are widely splayed inwards and separated by a group of vaulting shafts one or both of these windows contained stained glass with the history of the life and miracles of s cuthbert as seen at present they contain tracery of the perpendicular period a restoration of that inserted by prior wessington each window is of two lights crossed by a transom entry to the nine altars was provided for as well as from the choir and aisles by two doors on the western side of its north and south walls the northern doorway is now walled up they enter through the wall arcade the writer of the rites of durham says the north door was made in order to bring in the body of bishop anthony bek who is buried in the chapel the architectural features of the doorway would however seem to contradict this theory and there is little room to doubt that both north and south doorways formed part of the original design of the structure before leaving this interesting portion of the building we must direct our attention to its most important contents the tomb of s cuthbert this as at present to be seen is a great oblong platform thirtyseven feet long by twentythree feet wide and its upper surface or floor six feet above the floor of the chapel beneath a slab in the centre the bones of the patron saint rest the shrine of s cuthbert at one time stood upon this platform but of that no vestige remains the floor of the platform is reached by two doors through the neville screen in the choir and by a small stairway from the south aisle the wanderings of the monks of lindisfarne with the body of their saint their many difficulties and trials and their ultimate settlement at dunholme or durham have already been described the shrine was eventually set up in its present position by bishop carileph in 1104 when he brought it from the cloister garth from the tomb he had there set up for its temporary reception until his church was sufficiently advanced to permit of its removal thither it was visited by large numbers of pilgrims and many important personages were among them of these may be mentioned william the conqueror henry iii 1255 edward ii 1322 and henry vi 1448 the shrine was destroyed soon after the surrender of the monastery to the crown in 1540 when the body was buried beneath the place where its former receptacle had stood there have since this time been traditions that the exact place of the burial was secret and known only according to one account to three benedictine monks who each handed the secret down to a successor the other tradition places the knowledge of the place of burial in the hands of the roman catholic bishops of the northern province one of these traditions was made public in the year 1867 and gave the place of interment as being under the second and third steps leading to the tower from the south transept this place was excavated and examined but no trace of any burial could be found there it is to these traditions that scott refers in marmion in the following lines chesterlestreet and ripon saw his holy corpse ere wardilaw hailed him with joy and fear and after many wanderings past he chose his lordly seat at last where his cathedral huge and vast looks down upon the wear there deep in durhams gothic shade his relics are in secret laid but none may know the place save of his holiest servants three deep sworn to solemn secrecy who share that wondrous grace in may 1827 the grave in the nine altars chapel was opened in the presence of two of the church dignitaries and other persons dr raine who was also present has left a careful account of the discoveries then made3 the outer coffin that made in 1542 was first removed revealing a second and much decayed coffin and many bones after the removal of these relics the lid of a third oak coffin was revealed in a very advanced state of decay this innermost coffin was covered over its entire surface with carvings of human figures the heads surrounded by a nimbus when this coffin was removed the skeleton was exposed to view wrapped in coverings the outer of which had been of linen the robes beneath were much decayed and only portions of them could be preserved on the breast of the body among the robes a comb was found answering exactly to that described by reginald in 1104 among the most interesting of the finds were a stole and maniple 3 raine s cuthbert the stole is of very early date and is of needlework in colours and gold the centre design is a quatrefoil inside which is a lamb with nimbus and the letters agnv di on either side are figures of old testament prophets with their names near the ends the embroidery occurs on both sides of the stole on the back of one of which among foliage is the inscription aelfflaed fieri precepit which is continued on the back of the opposite end thuspio episcopo fridestano the translation of this inscription is to the effect that aelfled commanded the stole to be made for the pious bishop frithestan the maniple is of a similar character and also bears ornament figures and inscriptions4 frithestan was made bishop of winchester in 905 aelfled who was queen of eadward the son and successor of alfred died in 916 it was therefore during these ten years that she caused this stole and maniple to be made for the bishop frithestan it is recorded that the son and successor of eadward by name athelstan when on a journey in the north visited chesterlestreet and the shrine of s cuthbert which was then at that place among other presents he left as offerings a stole and maniple and a girdle and two bracelets of gold it is a curious fact that a girdle and two gold bracelets were found along with the stole and maniple in the grave in 1827 and leaves very little doubt that they are the ones mentioned above the bones of the saint were quite intact and none were missing they were with the other relics placed in a new coffin and the grave recovered some portions of the inner coffin with the stole two maniples the girdle and bracelets and fragments of the robes are now carefully preserved in the dean and chapter library a large gold cross found among the robes decorated with garnets and of workmanship of the time of s cuthbert is also preserved in the library these discoveries seem to speak for themselves and to leave very little room for doubt that the body exhumed and examined in 1827 was really that of the patron saint of the church 4 photographs coloured by the late ji williamson are exhibited in the south kensington museum there were also found in the grave bones of infants supposed to be relics of the holy innocents and a skull most probably that of s oswald which was known to have been placed in the coffin of s cuthbert two smooth grooves may be observed on the platform which are said to have been worn into the stone by the knees or feet of generations of pilgrims visiting the shrine there are several other tombs and monuments in this chapel chiefly wall tablets of not exceptional interest at the north end however is a colossal statue of the last of the prince bishops bishop van mildert who died in 1836 the monument is of white marble the figure seated on a throne and holding a book it was erected by public subscription the sculptor being john gibson ra near this monument is a blue slab covering the remains of bishop anthony bek patriarch of jerusalem who died in 1310 it was to bring in the body of this bishop that some writers have thought the north doorway of the nine altars chapel was constructed this is as we have seen already extremely improbable the student of architecture will find very much to interest him in this chapel of the nine altars the beautiful sculpture and variety in the capitals of the shafts of wall arcading not to mention the rich carving of the vaulting bosses and capitals of the vaulting shafts will well repay his earnest study illustration the galilee chapel illustration the galilee chapel illustration capital in galilee chapel the galilee or lady chapel is situated at the west end of the nave it is well known that for some reason women were not allowed to enter any church where s cuthberts shrine stood nor even any church dedicated to him at lindisfarne a separate church was provided for them and at durham the galilee chapel was added for the same purpose it was alleged that s cuthbert himself had made this rule but there is no proof that he ever issued such a command the venerable bede makes no mention of any special feeling of antipathy to women on the part of the saint bede was contemporary with and survived s cuthbert fortyeight years whatever may have been the origin of the practice it is certain that in later times women were jealously excluded from the churches of s cuthbert and to this circumstance we owe in the chapel under our consideration the most beautiful and perfect example of transitional norman architecture existing in england illustration paintings in the galilee chapel let us recall briefly the circumstances attending its erection hugh pudsey who occupied the episcopal throne 1153 to 1195 commenced to build a lady chapel at the east end of the church the work had not gone far before accidents happened and cracks and fissures appeared in the walls which the builder thought gave manifest indication that it was not acceptable to god and his servant s cuthbert5 the work was therefore abandoned and another chapel was commenced at the west end of the church into which women might lawfully enter so that they who had not bodily access to the secret things of the holy place might have some solace from the contemplation of them geoffrey de coldingham pudsey caused to be moved here the marble shafts and bases he had previously brought from beyond the sea and intended to be used in the construction of his chapel at the east end entering the chapel by the steps leading from the norman nave the visitor is at once impressed with the lightness and delicacy of the work before him as compared with the massive grandeur of the norman cathedral behind here we have in fact one of the latest uses of the round arch influenced by the rapidly developing early english gothic in plan the chapel consists of a nave with double aisles which perhaps might be more properly called five aisles these are divided by arcades each of which is of four bays these arches and the columns which support them are the chief beauty and characteristic of the chapel the arches are semicircular of one order with three lines of chevron one on each face and one on the soffit between two roll mouldings the capitals are light and graceful and carved with a volute and the columns clusters of marble and freestone shafts the arches however rest on the marble columns which are no doubt those previously alluded to the whole seems to have been coloured in fresco and remains of this are still to be seen the stone shafts which alternate with those of marble do not carry any of the weight of the arch and are undoubtedly an addition probably in the time of cardinal langley when they must have been added with a view to improving the appearance the dimensions of the chapel are fortyseven feet from east to west and seventysix feet from north to south the existing roof and the three perpendicular windows on the west end are also additions by cardinal langley on the walls above what were once the altars of the virgin and our lady of pity remains of fresco painting may be noticed all that remains of what has evidently been beautiful work these were only brought to light by the removal of successive coats of whitewash with which they had been covered 5 geoffrey de coldingham illustration detail of the galilee chapel when the galilee was erected access from the church was by the great west door of the cathedral this was however closed up by cardinal langley who constructed the two doorways at the end of the aisles by which the chapel is now entered those portions of the norman wall arcading which had to be removed by reason of the breaking through of the new doorways were used to fill up the lower part of the great west door the latter was again removed in 1846 when the west doorway was reopened langleys two doorways have four centred arches enclosed beneath a square label moulding with shields bearing the cardinals coatofarms in each spandrel to langley also may be attributed the five massive buttresses on the exterior of the western wall of the chapel which partly cover the arcading and panelling with which it was decorated in adding the new roof langley raised the walls above the arches to carry it giving a somewhat peculiar effect to the interior the original roof lines can still be made out on the west wall of the contents of the chapel remaining perhaps the most interesting to the visitor is the grave and site of the shrine of the venerable bede the shrine like that of s cuthberts is gone and all that remains is the stone slab on which it once stood and which bears the inscription placed there in 1831 hac sunt in fossa bd venerabilis ossa this remarkable man was contemporary with s cuthbert whom as we have said he survived fortyeight years his holiness and piety together with his great learning earned for him the title venerable and after his death in 735 his bones were enshrined of his parentage we know nothing except that from his own writings he was born in the territory of the abbey of wearmouth at the age of seven he was being educated in that monastery and by the time he was ten years old he moved to the newlyfounded abbey on the tyne at jarrow he had able and learned teachers in benedict bishop and ceolfrid and appears to have turned his advantages to the best account deacon at nineteen and priest at twentynine years of age he led a holy and studious life after his ordination he wrote his commentaries on the scriptures and writings on all the known sciencesgeography arithmetic and astronomy the greatest work of his life is however his ecclesiastical history of the english nation to which we owe all our knowledge of the introduction of christianity into great britain and the early history of the english church it is dedicated to king ceolwulf his information was collected from various sourcesby letter as to canterbury by communication with bishops and priors as to england generally and from personal knowledge and very recent tradition as to northumbria he lived most of his long life between the monasteries of monkwearmouth and jarrow and was buried at the latter in the year 1022 his remains were secretly removed from jarrow by elfrid who was the most unscrupulous relichunter of that time who deposited a portion of them in the same coffin with those of s cuthbert from here they were removed by bishop pudsey and placed in the newlyerected galilee chapel where he caused them to be enclosed in a magnificent shrine there in a silver casket gilt with gold hee laid the bones of venerable bede and erected a costly and magnificent shrine over it6 when the shrine was destroyed at the suppression of the monastery in 1542 the bones were interred beneath the place it occupied where they remained undisturbed till the year 1831 in that year they were exhumed and examined and after being enclosed in a leadlined coffin were replaced in the tomb with a parchment giving full details of the exhumation some coins and a ring which were found at this time are preserved in the dean and chapter library the inscription previously quoted was then cut on the upper slab of the tomb 6 rites of durham in the galilee chapel is also the tomb of its restorer cardinal langley which was erected by himself in front of the principal altar on its head may be seen three shields bearing the arms of the cardinal four of the western windows of the chapel originally contained beautiful stained glass a most careful description of which may be found in the rites of durham why this chapel has always been known as the galilee chapel has been the subject of much discussion and conjecture and is still a matter of uncertainty that it was erected for a lady chapel there can however be no doubt in the nave of the church between the piers immediately to the west of the north and south doorways the visitor will notice a darkcoloured marble cross beyond which no woman was allowed to pass eastward monuments in the nave and transeptsthe church of durham is not rich in tombs and monuments to the dead this is to be accounted for partly by the fact that for some centuries the bishops of the diocese were interred in the chapterhouse and even most of these tombs have been lost or destroyed another reason for the scarcity of monuments is that no layman was allowed to be buried in the church until 1367 when lord ralph neville obtained that distinction for himself and his wife the lady alice de neville who was buried in 1374 this monument occupies the third subbay from the east on the south side of the nave it is an altar tomb and though it has suffered severely from mutilation during the unsettled times of the reformation sufficient remains to enable us to see that it was once a welldesigned and noble monument its mouldings are bold and there are indications of the places where figures were once attached to the sides the recumbent effigies of the noble lord and his wife on the top of the tomb are however hopelessly smashed it is probable that lord ralph neville obtained this honour for himself through his services and victory at the battle of nevilles cross near durham in 1346 in the next bay westward is the tomb of lord john neville who died in 1386 this is also an altar tomb and has suffered severely though it remains in a better state of preservation than the one just described its sides each have six niches with elaborately ornamented canopies and containing figures while the ends have three similar niches with figures the carving of the canopies is exceedingly beautiful between each of the niches are two square panels with trefoiled heads each panel bearing a shield with the arms of neville and percy both above and below the niches much delicate carving may be noticed surmounting all are the broken effigies of lord john and his wife who was the daughter of lord henry percy the wellknown hotspur all the figures on this tomb including the recumbent figures are headless but sufficient remains to show that they were of great excellence remains of colouring and gilding can also be distinguished in places on the monument close to this is the slab and matrix of a brass to robert neville who was bishop of the diocese from 1438 to 1457 the brass has all been removed but the matrix shows a dignified figure of the bishop holding a crozier and a scroll while an inscription formerly existed on a plate at his feet bishop neville was known for his generous qualities as well as for his high descent in the western wall on its south side near to the entrance to the galilee is a mural tablet to a former prebendary in the cathedral and a wellknown antiquary sir george wheler who died in the latter part of the seventeenth century on the northern side is a slab to the memory of captain rm hunter who was killed while charging a sikh battery at ferozeshah opposite to the monument of ralph neville is a modern altar tomb to a former headmaster of durham grammar school the rev james britton dd erected by his pupils it is surmounted by a reclining figure of dr britton in academic robes reading a book in the south transept is a fine monument by chantrey to the memory of bishop barrington who held the see from 1791 to 1826 dying at the advanced age of 92 years beloved by all he was a great prelate and used his immense powers as prince palatine with great wisdom the kneeling figure with bowed head the left hand resting on a book in an attitude of deep reverence is worthy of the name of its sculptor on the west wall of the same transept is a tablet to the memory of the officers noncommissioned officers and privates of the durham light infantry who were slain or died during the crimean war near to this is a recently inserted brass to the memory of the officers and men of the 2nd durham regiment who died in egypt and the soudan in the north transept we may give some attention to a monument to the rev john carr a former headmaster of durham school it was erected to his memory by his pupils the monument was designed by rickman and is in the style known as decorated gothic illustration the font and cover the font stands at the west end of the nave it is a comparatively modern work covered by a tall wooden canopy which was erected by bishop cosin in 1663 the original norman font was destroyed by the scottish prisoners in 1650 and was replaced by a large marble basin by bishop cosin this font in its turn was removed to pittington church where it is now in use its place being filled by the present modern one it is designed in the norman style and is square supported on short columns the sides are carved with medallions copied from illuminated mss which represent scenes from the life of s cuthbert the cover deserves attention as a specimen of the woodwork of the seventeenth century exhibiting a curious and characteristic mixture of classic and gothic forms and details chapter iv history of the see the earlier history of the see of durham has already been referred to in order to lead up to the founding of the cathedral we have seen how the bishop and monks of lindisfarne fled and wandered with the relics of their beloved s cuthbert eventually settling at chesterlestreet until in the year 990 bishop aldhun in terror of the danes again fled southward to ripon the country at this time was ruled by that weak monarch ethelred the unready and the danes finding no determined opposition continually made piratical incursions and eventually through the treachery of three chieftains the castle of bamburgh fell into their hands after an interval of three or four months peace was made with the invaders and aldhun and his monks ventured to return towards chesterlestreet it was during this journey at a place called wredelau that the car carrying the saint stuck fast and the incidents previously related occurred which led to the founding of the bishopric of durham aldhun may therefore be called the first bishop of durham he held the see for twentynine years and died in 1018 aldhun it was who built the first or white church now destroyed it is extremely probable that some of the stones of this church were used in the foundations of carilephs choir and apses after aldhuns death the see remained vacant for three years when he was succeeded by edmund 10201040 it is said that the monks could not agree as to who should succeed aldhun when one day edmund a presbyter asked in a joke why not appoint me being a pious and a faithful man they took him at his word and after much persuasion and fasting and prayer he was consecrated the choice was a good one edmund was an energetic and beloved prelate he died at gloucester in 1041 one of the most important events during his episcopate was the invasion of northumbria by duncan king of the scots he besieged durham but was beaten off with great slaughter and the heads of many of his men were exposed in the marketplace egelric 10421056 was the next bishop he was an alien and made himself obnoxious to the clergy and people with the intention of rebuilding he pulled down the wooden church at chesterlestreet which had been the seat of the bishopric for one hundred and thirteen years a large quantity of treasure was found while digging foundations and this egelric appropriated and sent to his monastery at peterborough where he soon followed it before resigning the see of durham however he secured the appointment of his brother to the bishopric some years later william the conqueror called him to account for his behaviour in the matter of the treasure and threw him into prison at westminster where he died in 1072 egelwin 10561071 succeeded through the influence of his brother he took part in the rebellion of eadwin and morcar and like his predecessor died in prison he was the last of the saxon bishops walcher 10711080 william i found the church in great disorder and made many changes he filled most of the sees by the appointment of norman bishops to durham he elected walcher the latter was a man of gentle disposition but his chaplain leobwin and gilbert a kinsman of his own to whom he entrusted most of his affairs were hated by the people over whom they exercised great tyranny at length a noble named lyulph ventured to remonstrate with them and in their rage they had him assassinated the people were furious and the bishop vainly denied any knowledge of the deed he called a meeting at gateshead here a tremendous tumult arose the mob crying good rede short rede slay ye the bishop and eventually setting fire to the church the bishop was eventually reduced to a choice of facing the mob or being burnt in the church he chose the former and covering his face with his robe went out he was immediately slain on the threshold and dreadfully mutilated his body was removed by the monks to jarrow and afterwards to durham where he was buried william of s carileph 10801096 was next appointed bishop he was a man of great attainments to him we owe the founding of the present cathedral carileph also made an important change by the removal from durham of the secular clergy and their replacement by benedictine monks drawn from jarrow and monkwearmouth the foundations of the new church were laid on 29th july 1093 the bishop and prior turgot being present he did not live to see it very far advanced being taken ill at windsor he died about christmas 1096 ranulph flambard 10991128the see was kept vacant for three years by william rufus when he appointed flambard a great builder he built the nave and aisles the west doorway and lower part of the western towers and vaulted the aisles he also built framwellgate bridge over the wear at durham erected and endowed s giles church durham and was the founder of norham castle on the tweed galfrid rufus 11331140 was his successor his episcopate was much disturbed by wars with the scots the chapterhouse was finished during his time of office william de s barbara 11431152 was next appointed extraordinary events marked his election william cumin chancellor of the scottish king attempted to take the bishopric for himself and succeeded so far as to capture the castle with the aid of the scots the rightful bishop was not able to gain possession for sixteen months after his election cumin submitted in 1144 illustration the crypt hugh pudsey 11531195 now succeeded to the bishopric at the age of twentyfive he bought for life the earldom of northumberland and the manor of sadberg in 1187 the news of the capture of jerusalem by the saracens spread consternation in the church and pudsey prepared to accompany king henry to the east he fitted out ships and galleys in a most sumptuous manner his own having a seat for himself of solid silver neither he nor king henry embarked in the crusade however the king died and richard his son undertook the expedition leaving bishop pudsey and longchamp bishop of ely as justiciaries for the northern and southern portions of the kingdom respectively these two quarrelled and pudsey was decoyed to london by longchamp and committed to the tower he soon obtained his release but was compelled to resign the earldom of northumberland in 1195 he undertook a journey to london to see the king and endeavour to obtain restitution of his honours and possessions but was taken ill and died on the way at howden his work in the cathedral we have seen he also built the great hall of the castle most of the beautiful church of s cuthbert at darlington and the elvet bridge over the wear at durham and founded the hospital at sherburn near durham darlington church which would well repay a visit is a fine specimen of early pointed architecture second only to the galilee of durham the two showing in a wonderful manner the rapid development of the change which was taking place in architectural style during pudseys time philip de pictavia 11971208 elected at the urgent request of the king he was continually at loggerheads with his clergy he supported king john against the pope and was for this excommunicated died in 1208 and was buried in unconsecrated ground this bishop is said to have had the permission of the king to coin money at durham richard de marisco 12171226 was elected after an interval of nearly ten years the feud with the monks continued during his episcopate and the bishop swore the church of durham should have no peace while he lived threatened that if a monk should show himself beyond his cloister he should lose his head and once when his servants had beaten a monk and the man complained he replied that it was a pity they did not kill him he died at peterborough in 1226 richard le poore 12291237 who was the next bishop elected after the see had been vacant two years and four months was translated from salisbury where he had commenced building the new cathedral he ended the dispute between the monks and the bishop of durham by an agreement known as le convenit nicholas de farnham 12411248 became bishop after a three years dispute with the king he resigned in 1248 walter de kirkham 12491260 dean of york was next elected robert de stitchill 12611274 prior of finchale succeeded him dissensions again arose between the bishop and the monks he died on his return from france where he had attended a council at lyons he was buried in a monastery in france but his heart was brought to durham and buried in the chapterhouse robert de insula 12741283 a native of holy island as his name suggests was then elected bishop his tenure of office was peaceful illustration stone coffin lid anthony bek 12831310 the next bishop was of noble birth the son of walter bek baron of eresby in lincolnshire he took part with edward i in his expedition to scotland and being very wealthy was of great assistance to the king his following consisted of twentysix standard bearers one hundred and forty knights and an army of five thousand foot and five hundred horse he was employed by the king with success in many important state matters in the year 1300 trouble again arose with the monks some of them being dissatisfied with the prior hotoun the bishop proposed to hold a visitation the prior refusing to admit him unless he came unattended the bishop deposed and excommunicated him the convent took sides some with the bishop and some with the prior and it was only on the interference of the king that a partial peace was restored the quarrel soon reopened some men made a complaint against the bishop he had compelled them to take arms under him in the scottish war and had imprisoned some who had returned without leave the barons upheld the men and it led to them taking sides with prior hotoun in his dispute the bishop calling the monks together ordered them to elect a new prior which they promptly refused to do on this the bishop appointed henry de luceby of holy island to be prior of durham and brought men from weardale and tynedale to expel the old prior they laid siege to the convent and for three days prior hotoun and fortysix monks were shut up with only six loaves and sixteen herrings they continued the services however on the third day a tynedale man was sent to pull the prior out of his stall but was so awed by his venerable appearance that he dared not touch him a monk on the bishops side however did the work prior luceby was installed and prior richard seized and imprisoned he soon escaped however and carried his complaint before parliament and afterwards to the pope boniface viii the pope decided in his favour and hotoun returned to durham and luceby and his friends were obliged to go though they tried when doing so to carry off some silver plate and other valuables bek continued in great splendour until his death in 1310 when he died he was king of the isle of man patriarch of jerusalem bishop of durham and prince palatine richard de kellaw 13111316 formerly a monk of durham succeeded bek he was a good and learned man and lived in harmony with the monks louis de beaumont 13181333 was next appointed bishop after great competition and intrigue he was chosen in opposition to the wishes of the chapter who had elected stamford prior of finchale to succeed kellaw on his way to durham for consecration and enthronement accompanied by two cardinals and a large retinue he was waylaid at rushyford by a band of ruffians under gilbert middleton they plundered the cardinals but carried the bishop a prisoner to mitford castle his release was only secured on payment by the monastery of a heavy ransom he was an ignorant man and so innocent of latin that he could not read his profession of obedience being continually prompted later at an ordination he stumbled over the words in oenigmate and cried in french par seynt lewis il ne fuit pas curtays qui cest parole ici escrit by saint lewis he was no gentleman who wrote this word richard de bury 13331345 who succeeded was a great scholar tutor to edward iii and author of philobiblon a book still extant he was a good man and very kind to the poor thomas de hatfield 13451381 was like bishop bek a warrior ecclesiastic soon after his election he led eighty archers to the siege of calais his episcopate was notable for the wars with the scots and the great victory obtained over them with the capture of king david and many nobles at nevilles cross near durham fifteen thousand scots were slain the victory was attributed to the presence of the sacred banner of s cuthbert which prior john fossor took to a place near the battlefield kneeling in prayer the while for success a hymn of thanksgiving was appointed to be sung on the top of the cathedral tower on each anniversary of the battle this custom is still carried out though the day has been changed to the twentyninth of may hatfield was a liberal supporter of durham college at oxford he erected his own tomb in the choir of the cathedral in which he was afterwards buried john fordham 13811388 secretary to richard ii and canon of york was next elected suspected of giving bad advice to the king he was compelled to resign but was given the inferior bishopric of ely where he lived to extreme old age dying in 1425 walter de skirlaw 13881405 translated from bath and

ancestors laurance booth 14571476 canon of york and lichfield archdeacon of richmond and dean of s pauls was the next bishop he was a supporter of the house of lancaster he was translated to the archbishopric of york in 1476 the first of the bishops of durham who was raised to that dignity william dudley 14761483 dean of windsor succeeded him john sherwood 14831494 who was appointed next was a learned man and made a large collection of greek manuscripts he died in rome in 1494 richard fox 14941501 was translated from bath and wells after the see had remained vacant for eleven months

christopher bainbridge 15071508 dean of york was next elected and after an episcopate of one year was translated to york in 1511 he was sent to rome as ambassador by henry viii and while there was created cardinal he died in rome poisoned by a servant whom he had struck in anger thomas ruthall 15091522 dean of salisbury was the next bishop he was immensely wealthy and his love of money brought him into disgrace king henry commanded him to draw up an account of the lands and revenues of the crown the bishop in error sent to the king the wrong book in which was set forth an account of his own possessions the king though tampered with by wolsey made no use of the knowledge thus obtained but the affair rankled in the mind of the bishop and is said to have hastened his death thomas wolsey 15221528 was appointed to succeed him the famous cardinal held the see for six years as well as that of york during the whole of his episcopate he never visited durham and in 1528 he resigned it for the see of winchester cuthbert tunstall 15301559 was translated from london by a papal bull the last used for this purpose tunstall was a remarkable man and he occupied the see during an important period of church history the reformation all the stages of which he saw during his episcopacy the great privileges of the bishops of durham as princes palatine were very much curtailed in 1526 while tunstall was bishop of london the english translation of the new testament by tyndall appeared causing great alarm among the clergy the part played by tunstall in relation to this is well known he opposed the supremacy of king henry as head of the church but eventually gave up the struggle and preached in its favour the monastery of durham was suppressed in 1540 and a dean and twelve canons appointed soon after the accession of edward vi bishop tunstall was committed to the tower and deprived of his see on a charge of having encouraged rebellion in the north on the accession of mary to the throne he was released and restored but there would seem to be no grounds for supposing that he took any part in the cruelties practised during her reign when elizabeth became queen tunstall refused to take the oath and was again deprived of his see and being now an old man was committed to the custody of his friend archbishop parker canterbury with whom he lived till his death in 1559 he was a scholarly prelate of a kindly nature and was held in universal esteem james pilkington 15601575 left the buildings of the see in a ruinous condition richard barnes 15751587 translated from carlisle he is said to have been removed to durham in order to spy upon the correspondence and messengers of the unfortunate mary queen of scots matthew hutton 15891594 dean of york was the next bishop a man of great learning and considered one of the best preachers of his day he was translated to york in 1594 tobias matthew 15951606 dean of durham was his successor he was also a great preacher and was celebrated for his wit he was translated to york william james 16061617 dean of durham was next elected richard neile 16171627 was translated from lincoln he was remarkable as being the only bishop who held six sees successivelyviz 1608 rochester 1610 lichfield 1613 lincoln 1617 durham 1627 winchester and 1631 archbishop of york he did much to help forward men of learning and ability by giving them preferment in his see and reserving apartments for their use in durham house london which became known as durham college he spent large sums of money on repairs to the buildings at durham george monteigne 1628 bishop of london only held the see of durham for three months when he was translated to york john howson 16281631 bishop of oxford held the see for two years and died in 1631 thomas morton 16321659 translated from lichfield the north of england was much disturbed in 1640 by the invasion of the scots and bishop morton fledfirst to stockton afterwards to yorkand never returned to his diocese the successful scots levied heavy taxes on the district for the maintenance of their troops as much as 850 a day being demanded in 1646 episcopacy was abolished and the estates of the bishops ordered to be sold thus we find at durham the castle sold to the mayor of london for 1267 and durham borough and framwellgate disposed of to the corporation for 200 the bishop lived a life of suffering in london cared for by his friends till his death in 1659 at the age of ninetyfour during his episcopate in 1656 oliver cromwell arranged for the founding of a college in durham but his death prevented him carrying out his scheme his son however did so and it flourished until the restoration which by giving back property to its rightful owners put an end to its existence john cosin 16601671 canon of durham was the first bishop after the restoration he was a most munificent prelate leaving many charitable bequests he spent large sums in the restoration of the cathedral and castle and the palace at bishop auckland he built a hospital for eight poor people and erected a library on the palace green nathaniel crewe 16421722 translated from oxford he was a strong supporter of king james ii but afterwards took the oath of allegiance to william and mary he was noted for his charity and munificence and left large sums to the poor and in scholarships tenable by natives of durham william talbot 17221730 translated from salisbury edward chandler 17301750 bishop of lichfield was next elected he gave 2000 to be laid out for the benefit of the widows of clergymen of his diocese joseph butler 17501752 was translated from bristol he is best known as the author of the analogy of religion natural and revealed richard trevor 17521771 bishop of s davids a learned pious and unostentatious man he left 200 in his will to the poor of durham and auckland john egerton 17711787 bishop of lichfield was next elected he married the daughter of henry duke of kent and his eldest son afterwards became earl of bridgewater thomas thurlow 17871791 was translated to durham from lincoln he was brother of the lord chancellor shute barrington 17911826 was the next bishop having previously held the sees of llandaff and salisbury a most beneficent prelate his charities especially those for the founding of schools and augmentation of poor livings were magnificent during his episcopacy external repairs to the cathedral having become absolutely necessary james wyatt who had already done such mischief at salisbury was given charge of the work then it was that the paring process spoken of previously was completed the chapterhouse destroyed and the galilee chapel only saved from destruction by the intervention of dean cornwallis wyatts other wild schemes to extend the choir eastwards to the utter ruin of the nine altar chapel to remove the beautiful neville screen and surmount the central tower of the church by a spire were happily checked in time or there is no saying to what extent the building would have been mutilated bishop barrington died in london in his ninetythird year william van mildert 18261836 bishop of llandaff succeeded to the see during his episcopate many important changes were made the ecclesiastical commission appointed in 1833 to consider in what manner the funds of the church might be made more available for the purposes for which they were intended decided to give future bishops a fixed yearly payment and to reduce the number of canons from twelve to six on the appointment of a new bishop the palatinate was to be annexed by the state thus van mildert was the last count palatine before these changes came into force however the bishop and the dean and chapter founded and endowed the university out of the revenues of the see for the use of which the bishop gave up the castle bishop van mildert was a man of great charity and though his income was immense he died comparatively poor he died in february 1836 and was interred in the chapel of the nine altars edward maltby 18361856 his successor was translated from chichester and held the see for twenty years when owing to advanced age and increasing infirmity he resigned in 1856 charles thomas longley 18561860 first bishop of ripon was next elected he was a popular and muchbeloved prelate in 1860 he was created archbishop of york and two years later was translated to canterbury hon henry montague villiers 18601861 was translated from carlisle a fine preacher his episcopate was all too short he died after much suffering in 1861 charles baring 18611878 bishop of gloucester and bristol succeeded him a man of unbounded charity and goodness he won the affection of all who knew him personally he was compelled through illness to resign the see in 1878 and did not long survive his retirement joseph barber lightfoot 18791889 was then elected to the see a man of scholarly attainments he is still too well known and remembered to need any detailed note he came to durham pledged to accomplish as soon as possible the division of the diocese which promise he carried out by restoring the suppressed see of hexham to newcastleontyne a fine tomb to the memory of dr lightfoot has been placed on the north side of the choir of the cathedral and as a memorial of his episcopate the mutilated chapterhouse has been restored the present bishop is the right rev brooke foss westcott dd in this place may conveniently be given the rough draft of the settlement of the see by king henry viii at the reformation although departed from in

xiii s iiii d mdccxii li x s chapter v the castle and university no notice of durham and its cathedral would seem complete without some mention being made of its fortress the growth of which has been contemporary with and we might almost say inseparable from that of the monastery itself there can be little doubt that other than the miraculous considerations assigned to them by tradition influenced the monks and the congregation of s cuthbert in their final choice of a restingplace for the bones of their beloved saint the almost impregnable position of the rocky promontory upon which both cathedral and castle stand suggests a careful selection on their part with a view to the prevention of attack and consequent further disturbance of their sacred relics what the first fortification was is a matter of doubt most probably it was merely a wall or rampart of earth with a large artificial mound at the weakest point this seems to have been the usual practice at an early date at many other places in england and in some cases their date is known and corresponds to the time at which durham was probably first fortified whatever the earliest protections were we know that in 1072 william the conqueror on his way from scotland passed through durham he quickly perceived the natural advantages and strength of the position and gave orders for the erection of a castle this was at once set about during the episcopacy of bishop walcher and continued under carileph and flambard of this building which might be styled the conquerors castle not much remains the most important is the chapel or crypt which belongs no doubt to the earlier part of the period named 1080 to 1096 in plan the chapel has a nave and two aisles the roof is vaulted the ribs being plain semicircular and square recessed and is supported by six circular columns the capitals of these columns are a somewhat interesting feature owing to their lombardic character the abaci are square and moulded while the caps proper carry at their angles rudely carved volutes such as occur in the white tower london each capital is also carved differently with curious and rude devices of the three windows which terminated the nave and aisle at the east end one has been destroyed to make way for a staircase and the other two are built up the original windows of the chapel were very narrow and widely splayed in the walls are an aumbrey and the remains of two altars illustration the chapel or crypt durham castle other remains of this date are somewhat scattered two windows in the undercroft of bishop beks or what is now known as bishop hatfields hall are examples they have converging jambs the semicircular heads being cut from one stone and the inside very widely splayed the wall from the keep to the chapel and that from the keep to the gateway are also norman work as are also portions of the gateway itself the next important changes in the castle were made by bishop pudsey 11531195 who not only repaired the existing work but built a hall known as pudseys hall although this hall has now almost entirely disappeared through repairs and alterations sufficient evidence as to its whereabouts and general plan is forthcoming it was of two storeys the lower and upper halls entrance to the lower hall was originally gained by a staircase which led from the courtyard to the splendid doorway now enclosed in tunstalls gallery this magnificent entrance having been covered with lath and plaster and for long completely forgotten was unearthed by and at the expense of bishop barrington early in the present century it is in good preservation and is a splendid specimen of rich norman architecture it consists of five orders all richly carved and moulded three orders rest on carved capitals and shafts and two are carried down the jambs of the doorway the stairway has entirely disappeared but there is little room to doubt that it would be of much the same character as that in the close at canterbury and to the protection afforded by the staircase roof we are no doubt indebted for the good preservation of the arch mouldings of the doorway itself what was originally pudseys upper hall is now styled the norman gallery the greater portion of this gallery is at the present time divided into chambers of residence for the students of the university it is reached by the black staircase and a doorway in the early english gothic style the interior of the south and west walls are enriched by arcades in groups of three the central bay of each of which is larger than those flanking it and is pierced by a window the arches of the arcade rest on shafts and cushion capitals and are carved with chevron ornament the whole arrangement hereabouts bears the impress of having been a portion of one great building which an examination of the roof lead and general outline makes even more certain on the western side of the courtyard stands the great beks hall built by the bishop of that name it is above the norman undercroft previously mentioned much of its original character is now lost owing to restorations curtailments and alterations beks doorway is still in existence though much hidden by the porch erected later by bishop cosin it has a pointed arch of two orders with detached shafts in the jambs another original relic unrestored is part of the window nearest the fireplace which is valuable as evidence of the date of the erection of the hall the tracery is geometrical and the shafts in the angles of the splays are banded about the year 1350 bishop hatfield enlarged and altered beks hall at the west end he inserted two light windows which are now blocked though the tracery may be seen from students rooms inside and partly from the outside the open oak roof with the exception of some necessary later repairs is of bishop hatfields time hatfield repaired and altered pudseys upper hall by the addition of east and west windows and probably a new roof he also rebuilt the keep which time and war had greatly injured the existing keep which was erected in 1840 is similar to hatfields and in many places stands upon the old foundations it is now used entirely as apartments for students of university college bishop fox 14941501 is responsible for the next important changes he curtailed the great hall by a partition wall near its south end which still exists the wall bears his badge in two placesa pelican feeding her young with blood from her breast he also adapted part of pudseys buildings near the southwest corner of the castle to the purposes of a kitchen erected three fireplaces and windows and the oak buttery hatch which opens from the kitchen and which again has carved upon it the pelican in her piety bishop tunstall 15301558 built tunstalls gallery which extends from the great hall to the clock tower it is entered by cosins staircase erected later and by an eastern stair built by tunstall himself a curious feature of this stairway is a porthole which commands the main entrance to the courtyard the present beautiful little chapel is also the work of bishop tunstall it contains some notable carved oak stalls of earlier date than the chapel itself which were brought from the castle at bishop auckland the carved devices of the miserere seats of these stalls are curious and worthy of attention the doors in the gateway of the courtyard are the work of tunstalls time bishop cosin 16601672 found the castle in a dilapidated condition during the commonwealth it had been sold to the then lord mayor of london who used it badly to say nothing of the ruin caused by the scots he spent large sums in its restoration he added the present porch or entrance from the courtyard to the great hall the great staircase in the northwest corner of the courtyard is his and bears his arms within and leading to tunstalls gallery is the black staircase also the work of cosin he enlarged the chapel and constructed and fitted several apartments in the castle besides several minor works in his will he says he spent the greater part of his temporal estate in rebuilding and repaireing the two episcopall castles of durham and bishop auckland this he states cost him seventeen thousand pounds including the furnishing and ornamenting of the chapels which he did for the use of my successors in those chappells for ever many of the agreements between bishop cosin and his masons plasterers carpenters and painters from which the exact dates and prices paid for the work may be learned are preserved the latest important work at the castle was the rebuilding of the keep in 1840 which was described at that time as a picturesque ruin it was entirely rebuilt on its original plan the gateway to the courtyard was repaired and modernised by bishop barrington with the existing inartistic result durham castle owes its picturesque appearance to two causesfirst its magnificent and commanding position on a rocky escarpment and second no doubt to the many vicissitudes through which it has passed the alterations and additions made necessary by time and constant war and later the entirely different uses to which the building is put illustration staircase in the castle it is now chiefly used as a hall of residence for university men and as lodging for the judges of assize the most favourable time for the architectural student to visit the castle is during one of the university vacations otherwise many interesting features would be denied him many portions except students chambers are however open to the public every week day the university of durhamfrom an early date frequent mention is made in the history of the see of durham of a college at oxford called the durham college its origin is not exactly known but by the liberality of several bishops and priors its original endowment increased until provision was made for eight fellows and eight scholars this was the case at the time of the suppression of the monasteries by king henry viii when owing to its connection with the monastery of durham the college was also dissolved its revenues were however rescued and in 1541 were handed over by the king to the newly created dean and chapter thus the matter stood till 1650 when a petition was presented to the protector showing the great disadvantages to the north of england arising from the long distance of oxford and cambridge and praying that the houses of the dean and prebendaries might be converted into a college cromwell took a favourable view of the idea and in a letter to lenthall the speaker in its support he says truly it seems to me a matter of great concernment and importance as that which by the blessing of god may much conduce to the promotion of learning and piety in these poore rude and ignorant parts there being also many concurring advantages to this place as pleasantness and aptness of situation healthfull aire and plenty of provisions which seeme to favour and pleade for theire desires therein7 7 hutchinson vol i various delays occurred however and it was not until 1657 that the lord protector issued his patent for the erection of the proposed college in a document consisting of twentythree heads the college thus commenced made great progress and would no doubt have continued to do so but for the constant opposition of the two great universities of oxford and cambridge then followed the restoration and with it came a reaction against all measures established during the protectorate this feeling combined with persistent petitions from the universities soon accomplished the downfall of the college bishop van mildert who was translated to durham in 1826 during his short episcopate saw many changes not the least of which was the successful revival of the scheme for a university powers were obtained in 1832 for the training of students in divinity and the conferring of degrees in other faculties the new foundation was endowed out of the revenues of the cathedral and the bishop gave up the castle of durham for the use of the college besides financial assistance of 1000 for the first year and 2000 for the following years until his death in 1836 the first warden was dr charles thorp archdeacon and canon of durham but it was provided by an order on the recommendation of the ecclesiastical commissioners that in future the office of warden should be permanently attached to the deanery and that a canonry in the cathedral be annexed to each of the professorships of divinity and greek the government of the university is in the hands of the dean and chapter and the affairs administered by a warden senate and convocation a royal charter was obtained in 1837 making the university a corporate body with perpetual succession and a common seal the university besides its original schools of arts and divinity has established schools of physical science and medicine in connection with the durham college of science at newcastleontyne and has recently admitted women students to its courses and lectures there are many foundation scholarships and exhibitions in arts classics mathematics and theology besides a long list of private foundations and fellowships the university consists of one college and one hall the former university college occupies the castle and the latter bishop hatfields hall it is well supplied with libraries the university library founded at the opening to which bishop van mildert contributed a valuable collection the library given in 1855 by the late dr martin routh president of magdalen college oxford the library presented by the late bishop maltby in 1856 which he endowed with 1000 a library was also bequeathed to the university in 1859 by the late tm winterbottom md of westoe south shields a large collection of books was bequeathed by the late bishop lightfoot two other important libraries may here be mentioned though they do not belong to the universityviz the chapter library and bishop cosins library chapter vi the city besides the cathedral and castle the city of durham possesses several churches of decided interest to the student of architecture which deserve a brief notice the parish church of s mary in the north baileythis small church is generally known as s mary le bow owing to the fact that in its original steeple was an arch through which the roadway passed this steeple fell in 1637 and the ancient structure was allowed to lapse into complete ruin the present church was built in 1685 and its most noticeable feature is the open carved screen between the nave and chancel erected in 1707 the site of the church is the oldest in the city and some writers have thought it probably identical with that of the white church in which the body of s cuthbert was placed during the building of the cathedral s marytheless is a small but picturesque church situated in the south bailey and is of norman date its original architectural character is however almost entirely lost owing to extensive restorations which took place in 18467 the roundheaded window now in the south wall of the chancel but formerly in the west wall of the nave is the only remaining original feature the church is entered by a porch on the south side and consists of a nave and chancel only some stones in the churchyard which were removed from their position when the church was restored are carved with chevron ornament and would seem to show that the date of the original structure was the earlier part of the twelfth century s oswaldthis church stands on high ground overlooking the river wear at the head of new elvet and is the parish church of the ancient borough of elvet the first church was erected by bishop carileph though the earliest parts of the existing building are of the time of bishop pudsey who also built the bridge across the river known as the elvet bridge to this date about 1190 belongs the eastern part of the nave arcade the arches of which are semicircular and rest upon tall round piers early in the fourteenth century a new chancel was built the aisles rebuilt and extended to the west end and two new arches added to the west end of the nave arcades in the early part of the fifteenth century a clerestory and open parapet were added and a new oak roof placed over the nave this was most probably a hammerbeam roof and was coloured and gilded and decorated with angels holding shields the only parts remaining at the present day are the grotesque carved corbels and the angels the tower was also constructed at this time in 1834 owing to subsidence of the ground it became necessary to rebuild the south aisle and a large part of the chancel which caused the destruction of much architectural beauty the open parapet was removed the clerestory windows replaced by the present inferior ones and the fine oak roof destroyed the east end of the chancel was rebuilt in 1864 special attention should be directed to the fine oak stallwork in the chancel boldly carved in the style of the early part of the fifteenth century the tower which forms a beautiful and conspicuous landmark is reached by a stone staircase of unusual character it is placed in the thickness of the wall and is covered in with twentyfour gravestones of thirteenth and fourteenth century date on which may yet be seen portions of inscriptions and symbols built into the tower was part of a saxon cross which has now been removed for preservation to the dean and chapter library this cross is interesting as evidence of the existence on the same site of a prenorman church the tower was carefully restored in 1863 it contains a peal of six bells which were recast in 1694 and bear the following inscriptions 1 glovia in altissmiss deo pex forster a vic christo hodson me fecit 1694 3 devm timete

steep hill called crossgate it is opposite to and across the river from the castle and from its churchyard a fine western view of the cathedral is obtained the church was built during the early part of the episcopate of bishop pudsey 1154 and was formerly a chapel under the church of s oswald here again alterations and restorations have obliterated much that originally existed the church at present consists of a nave and aisles a chancel with aisles a western tower and north and south porches the existing portions of the original church are the chancel arch and the south arcade of four bays together with part of the clerestory and the north wall of the chancel the arcade consists of low massive circular piers with cushion capitals and plain chamfered abaci which support semicircular arches of one order also chamfered the north arcade is also norman and very similar in character to that of s oswald no doubt it is of the same date and probably built by the same architect the chancel arch has two orders recessed square and chamfered with a plain chamfered hood mould on both north and south sides of the arch is a squint with the exception of two which are norman the windows are nearly all of modern date one is in the north wall of the chancel and is widely splayed it is not seen on the outside owing to the vestry which now covers it the other a very interesting specimen is situated over the western bay of the south arcade and is a portion of the original clerestory and the earliest known clerestory window in the county the roof of the nave is of oak and a good specimen of perpendicular work the tower is of fifteenthcentury date and exceedingly plain externally but vaulted in the interior it opens on to the church by an arch which has been inserted in the west wall there is an interesting font of frosterley marble which is apparently of the same date as the chancel the vestry which is raised above the level of the church floor is of the fifteenth century and has on its gable the original gable cross illustration the cathedral and castle from the north the parish church of s giles occupies a very elevated position at the northeast end of the city and commands one of the finest views of the cathedral castle and city which it is possible to obtain it was built by bishop flambard and finished as early as 1112 but the north wall of the nave containing two small norman windows widely splayed inwards and a walledup doorway is all that remains of this early church the chancel is of later norman of the time of pudsey both within and without a bold chamfered string course runs round the chancel on the south side is a semicircular headed window with a carved dripstone and nook shafts the capitals of which bear a similar character to those in the galilee chapel of the cathedral in the north wall of the chancel is the priests door now walled up and the corbels and springers of the original chancel arch built by pudsey the present arch was erected in 1876 in 1414 considerable alterations were made during the episcopate of bishop langley when the walls of the nave were raised the upper stage of the tower built and the west window inserted the font is a fine stone bowl resting on a shaft and is undoubtedly of the time of flambard the chancel contains some monuments of the tempest and heath families who were the ancestors of the marchioness of londonderry patroness of the church and parish of s giles the tower contains three bells the first and second of which are prereformation and the third bears the date 1646 on the north side of gilesgate near to the northeastern goods station are the ruins of the little chapel of s mary magdalen of which only a small portion remains at the west end of the north and south walls are two doorways the latter walled up portions of the east window are still in position but it would appear to have been of earlier date than the surrounding walls and probably had been brought from some other building in the interior are the remains of a frosterley marble font and a gable cross of thirteenthcentury date is in the custody of the dean and chapter the chapel was 43 feet by 16 feet wide it is supposed to have been founded by sir john fitz alexander in 1370 it was almost entirely rebuilt and again in 1449 on a site near the original one the reason for this was the moisture of the ground which caused the foundations to become insecure the government was in the hands of the almoner of the cathedral who distributed doles to the poor the chapel was used as a place of worship until nearly the end of the seventeenth century when owing to its ruinous condition services were finally discontinued illustration plan and dimensions principal dimensions of the cathedral feet inches
