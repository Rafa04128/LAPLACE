sir william herschel i have been obliged to depend strictly upon data already in printthe memoir of his sister his own scientific writings and the memoirs and diaries of his cotemporaries the review of his published works will i trust be of use it is based upon a careful study of all his papers in the philosophical transactions and elsewhere a life of herschel which shall be satisfactory in every particular can only be written after a full examination of the materials which are preserved at the family seat in england but as two generations have passed since his death and as no biography yet exists which approaches to completeness no apology seems to me to be needed for a conscientious attempt to make the best use of the scanty material which we do possess this study will i trust serve to exhibit so much of his life as belongs to the whole public his private life belongs to his family until the time is come to let the world know more of the greatest of practical astronomers and of the inner life of one of its most profound philosophersof a great and ardent mind whose achievements are and will remain the glory of england contents page chapter i early years 17381772 1 chapter ii life

william herschel chapter i early years 17381772 of the great modern philosophers that one of whom least is known is william herschel we may appropriate the words which escaped him when the barren region of the sky near the body of scorpio was passing slowly through the field of his great reflector during one of his sweeps to express our own sense of absence of light and knowledge hier ist wahrhaftig ein loch im himmel herschel prepared about the year 1818 a biographical memorandum which his sister carolina placed among his papers this has never been made public the only thoroughly authentic sources of information in possession of the world are a letter written by herschel himself in answer to a pressing request for a sketch of his life and the memoir and correspondence of caroline herschel london 1876 a precious memorial not only of his life but of one which otherwise would have remained almost unknown and one too which the world could ill afford to lose the latter which has been ably edited by mrs mary cornwallis herschel1 is the only source of knowledge in regard to the early years of the great astronomer and together with the all too scanty materials to be gained from a diligent search through the biography of the time affords the data for those personal details of his life habits and character which seem to complete the distinct though partial conception of him which the student of his philosophical writings acquires the letter referred to was published in the gttingen magazine of science and literature iii 4 shortly after the name of herschel had become familiar to every ear through his discovery of uranus but while the circumstances of the discovery and the condition of the amateur who made it were still entirely unknown the editor lichtenberg says herr herschel was good enough to send me some time since through herr magellan copies of his dissertations on double stars on the parallax of the fixed stars and on a new micrometer in the letter which conveyed to him my thanks for his gift i requested him to note down a few facts in regard to his life for publication in this magazine since various accounts more or less incorrect had appeared in several journals in answer i received a very obliging letter from him and what follows is that portion of it relating to my request which was sent me with full permission to make it public datchet near windsor nov 15 1783 i was born in hanover november 1738 my father who was a musician destined me to the same profession hence i was instructed betimes in his art that i might acquire a perfect knowledge of the theory as well as of the practice of music i was set at an early age to study mathematics in all its branchesalgebra conic sections infinitesimal analysis and the rest the insatiable desire for knowledge thus awakened resulted next in a course of languages i learned french english and latin and steadfastly resolved henceforth to devote myself wholly to those sciences from the pursuit of which i alone looked for all my future happiness and enjoyment i have never been either necessitated or disposed to alter this resolve my father whose means were limited and who consequently could not be as liberal to his children as he would have desired was compelled to dispose of them in one way or another at an early age consequently in my fifteenth year i enlisted in military service only remaining in the army however until i reached my nineteenth year when i resigned and went over to england my familiarity with the organ which i had carefully mastered previously soon procured for me the position of organist in yorkshire which i finally exchanged for a similar situation at bath in 1766 and while here the peculiar circumstances of my post as agreeable as it was lucrative made it possible for me to occupy myself once more with my studies especially with mathematics when in the course of time i took up astronomy i determined to accept nothing on faith but to see with my own eyes everything which others had seen before me having already some knowledge of the science of optics i resolved to manufacture my own telescopes and after many continuous determined trials i finally succeeded in completing a socalled newtonian instrument seven feet in length from this i advanced to one of ten feet and at last to one of twenty for i had fully made up my mind to carry on the improvement of my telescopes as far as it could possibly be done when i had carefully and thoroughly perfected the great instrument in all its parts i made systematic use of it in my observations of the heavens first forming a determination never to pass by any the smallest portion of them without due investigation this habit persisted in led to the discovery of the new planet georgium sidus this was by no means the result of chance but a simple consequence of the position of the planet on that particular evening since it occupied precisely that spot in the heavens which came in the order of the minute observations that i had previously mapped out for myself had i not seen it just when i did i must inevitably have come upon it soon after since my telescope was so perfect that i was able to distinguish it from a fixed star in the first minute of observation now to bring this sketch to a close as the king had expressed a desire to see my telescope i took it by his command to greenwich where it was compared with the instruments of my excellent friend dr maskelyne not only by himself but by other experts who pronounced it as their opinion that my instrument was superior to all the rest thereupon the king ordered that the instrument be brought to windsor and since it there met with marked approval his majesty graciously awarded me a yearly pension that i might be enabled to relinquish my profession of music and devote my whole time to astronomy and the improvement of the telescope gratitude as well as other considerations specified by me in a paper presented to the royal society of which i am a member has induced me to call the new planet georgium sidus georgium sidusjam nunc assuesce vocarivirgil and i hope it will retain the name we know but little of the family of herschel the name is undoubtedly jewish and is found in poland germany and england we learn that the ancestors of the present branch left moravia about the beginning of the xviith century on account of their change of religion to protestantism they became possessors of land in saxony hans herschel the greatgrandfather of william was a brewer in pirna a small town near dresden of the two sons of hans one abraham born in 1651 died 1718 was employed in the royal gardens at dresden and seems to have been a man of taste and skill in his calling of his eldest son eusebius there appears to be little trace in the records of the family the second son benjamin died in infancy the third isaac was born in 1707 jan 14 and was thus an orphan at eleven years of age isaac was the father of the great astronomer he appears to have early had a passionate fondness for music and this added to a distaste for his fathers calling determined his career he was taught music by an oboeplayer in the royal band and he also learned the violin at the age of twentyone he studied music for a year under the cappelmeister pabrich at potsdam and in august 1731 he became oboist in the band of the guards at hanover in august 1732 he married anna ilse moritzen she appears to have been a careful and busy wife and mother possessed of no special faculties which would lead us to attribute to her care any great part of the abilities of her son she could not herself write the letters which she sent to her husband during his absences with his regiment it was her firm belief that the separations and some of the sorrows of the family came from too much learning and while she could not hinder the education of the sons of the family she prevented their sisters from learning french and dancing it is but just to say that the useful accomplishments of cooking sewing and the care of a household were thoroughly taught by her to her two daughters the father isaac appears to have been of a different mould and to him no doubt the chief intellectual characteristics of the family are due his position obliged him to be often absent from hanover with his regiment but his hand appears to have been always present smoothing over difficulties and encouraging his sons to such learning and improvement as was to be had his health was seriously injured by the exposures of the campaigns and he was left after the seven years war with a broken constitution after his final return home in 1760 his daughter gives this record of him copying music employed every vacant moment even sometimes throughout half the night with my brother dietrichnow a little engaging creature of between four and five years oldhe was very much pleased and on the first evening of his arrival at home before he went to rest the adempken a little violin was taken from the shelf and newly strung and the daily lessons immediately commenced i do not recollect that he ever desired any other society than what he had opportunities of enjoying in many of the parties where he was introduced by his profession though far from being of a morose disposition he would frequently encourage my mother in keeping up a social intercourse among a few acquaintances whilst his afternoon hours generally were taken up in giving lessons to some scholars at home who gladly saved him the troublesome exertion of walking he also found great pleasure in seeing dietrichs improvement who young as he was and of the most lively temper imaginable was always ready to receive his lessons leaving his little companions with the greatest cheerfulness to go to his father who was so pleased with his performances that he made him play a solo on the adempken in rakes concert being placed on a table before a crowded company for which he was very much applauded and caressed particularly by an english lady who put a gold coin in his little pocket it was not long before my father had as many scholars as he could find time to attend and when they assembled at my fathers to make little concerts i was frequently called to join the second violin in an overture for my father found pleasure in giving me sometimes a lesson before the instruments were laid by after practising with dietrich for i never was missing at those hours sitting in a corner with my knitting and listening all the while here as in all her writing carolina is simple true direct to awkwardness and unconsciously pathetic even in joy the family of isaac and anna herschel consisted of ten children six of these lived to adult age they were 1 sophia elizabeth born 1733 married griesbach a musician in the guard by whom she had children five of her sons were afterwards musicians at the court in england where they obtained places through the influence of william 2 henry anton jacob born 1734 november 20 4 frederic william the astronomer born 1738 november 15 6 john alexander born 1745 november 13 8 carolina lucretia born 1750 march 16 10 dietrich born 1755 september 13 of this family group the important figures to us are william alexander and carolina jacob was organist at the garrison church of hanover in 1753 a member of the guards band in 1755 and first violin in the hanover court orchestra in 1759 afterwards he joined his brother william in bath but again returned to hanover in 1771 he published in amsterdam his opus i a set of six quartettes and later in london he published two symphonies and six trios he appears to have been a clever musician and his letters to his younger brother william are full of discussion on points of musical composition etc he died in 1792 dietrich the youngest brother shared in the musical abilities of his family and when only fifteen years old was so far advanced as to be able to supply his brother jacobs place in the court orchestra and to give his lessons to private pupils there is no one of the family except the eldest daughter whom we do not know to have possessed marked ability in music and this taste descended truly for four generations in the letters of chevalier bunsen2 he describes meeting in 1847 the eldest granddaughter of william herschel who he says is a musical genius three members of the family william alexander and carolina formed a group which was inseparable for many years and while the progress of the lives of alexander and carolina was determined by the energy and efforts of william these two lent him an aid without which his career would have been strangely different it is necessary to understand a little better the early life of all three the sons of the herschel family all attended the garrison school in hanover until they were about fourteen years old they were taught the ordinary rudiments of knowledgeto read to write to cipherand a knowledge of french and english was added william especially distinguished himself in his studies learning french very rapidly and studying latin and arithmetic with his master out of hours the household life seems to have been active harmonious and intelligent especially during the presence of the father who took a great delight in the rapid progress of all his sons in music and who encouraged them with his companionship in their studies and in their reading on all intellectual subjects from the memoir of carolina on which we must depend for our knowledge of this early life we take the following paragraph my brothers were often introduced as solo performers and assistants in the orchestra of the court and i remember that i was frequently prevented from going to sleep by the lively criticism on music on coming from a concert or by conversations on philosophical subjects which lasted frequently till morning in which my father was a lively partaker and assistant of my brother william by contriving selfmade instruments often i would keep myself awake that i might listen to their animating remarks for it made me so happy to see them so happy but generally their conversation would branch out on philosophical subjects when my brother william and my father often argued with such warmth that my mothers interference became necessary when the names leibnitz newton and euler sounded rather too loud for the repose of her little ones who ought to be in school by seven in the morning but it seems that on the brothers retiring to their own room where they shared the same bed my brother william had still a great deal to say and frequently it happened that when he stopped for an assent or reply he found his hearer was gone to sleep and i suppose it was not till then that he bethought himself to do the same the recollection of these happy scenes confirms me in the belief that had my brother william not then been interrupted in his philosophical pursuits we should have had much earlier proofs of his inventive genius my father was a great admirer of astronomy and had some knowledge of that science for i remember his taking me on a clear frosty night into the street to make me acquainted with several of the most beautiful constellations after we had been gazing at a comet which was then visible and i well remember with what delight he used to assist my brother william in his various contrivances in the pursuit of his philosophical studies among which was a neatly turned 4inch globe upon which the equator and ecliptic were engraved by my brother the mechanical genius was not confined to william for we read that alexander used often to sit by us and amuse us and himself by making all sorts of things out of pasteboard or contriving how to make a twelvehour cuckoo clock go a week this ability of alexanders was turned later to the best account when he became his brother williams right hand in the manufacture of reflectors eyepieces and stands in england his abilities were great and a purpose which might otherwise have been lacking was supplied through the younger brothers ardor in all that he undertook his musical talent was remarkable he played divinely on the violoncello he returned to hanover in 1816 where he lived in comfortable independence through the neverfailing generosity of his brother until his death in 1821 a notice of him in a bristol paper says died march 15 1821 at hanover alexander herschel esqr well known to the public of bath and bristol as a performer and elegant musician and who for fortyseven years was the admiration of the frequenters of concerts and theatres of both those cities as principal violoncello to the extraordinary merits of mr herschel was united considerable acquirement in the superior branches of mechanics and philosophy and his affinity to his brother sir william herschel was not less in science than in blood we shall learn more of the sister carolina as time goes on now in these early years she was a silent and persistent child growing up with a feeling that she was uncared for and neglected and lavishing all her childish affection as she did all that of her womanly life on her brother william throughout her long life my brother was william my nephew his son the brothers jacob and william were with their father members of the band of the guards in 1755 when the regiment was ordered to england and they were absent from hanover a year william then seventeen years old went as oboist and out of his scanty pay brought back to hanover in 1756 only one memento of his staya copy of locke on the human understanding he appears to have served with the guard during part of the campaign of 1757 his health was then delicate and his parents determined to remove him from the servicea step attended by no small difficulties3 this removal was hurriedly and safely effected so hurriedly that the copy of locke was not put in the parcels sent after him to hamburg by his mother she dear woman knew no other wants than good linen and clothing thus at last the young william herschel the son of an oboeplayer in the kings guard is launched in life for himself in the year 1757 at the age of nineteen all his equipment is the good linen and clothing a knowledge of french latin and english some skill in playing the violin the organ and the oboe and an uncommon precipitancy in doing what there is to be done a slender outfit truly but we are not to overlook what he said of himself on another occasion i have nevertheless several resources in view and do not despair of succeeding pretty well in the end from 1757 to 1760three yearswe know nothing of his life we can imagine what it was his previous visit to england had given him a good knowledge of the language and perhaps a few uninfluential acquaintances on his return he would naturally seek these out and by means of his music he could gain a livelihood we first hear of him as charged with the organization of the music of a corps of the militia of durham under the auspices of the earl of darlington la manire dont il remplit cette mission le fit connatre avantageusement4 the nature of the service of these militia corps which were then forming all over england is well described in the autobiography of gibbon every countygentleman felt constrained to serve his country and the regimental messrooms were filled with men of rank and fashion in 1760 we hear of him again he has attracted the notice of those about him about the year 1760 as miller5 was dining at pontefract with the officers of the durham militia one of them knowing his love of music told him they had a young german in their band as a performer on the hautboy who had only been a few months in england and yet spoke english almost as well as a native and who was also an excellent performer on the violin the officer added that if miller would come into another room this german should entertain him with a solo the invitation was gladly accepted and miller heard a solo of giardinis executed in a manner that surprised him he afterwards took an opportunity of having some private conversation with the young musician and asked him whether he had engaged himself for any long period to the durham militia the answer was only from month to month leave them then said the organist and come and live with me i am a single man and think we shall be happy together and doubtless your merit will soon entitle you to a more eligible situation the offer was accepted as frankly as it was made and the reader may imagine with what satisfaction dr miller must have remembered this act of generous feeling when he hears that this young german was herschel the astronomer my humble mansion says miller consisted at that time but of two rooms however poor as i was my cottage contained a library of wellchosen books and it must appear singular that a foreigner who had been so short a time in england should understand even the peculiarities of the language so well as to fix upon swift for his favorite author he took an early opportunity of introducing his new friend at mr cropleys concerts the first violin was resigned to him and never says the organist had i heard the concertos of corelli geminiani and avison or the overtures of handel performed more chastely or more according to the original intention of the composers than by mr herschel i soon lost my companion his fame was presently spread abroad he had the offer of pupils and was solicited to lead the public concerts both at wakefield and halifax a new organ for the parish church of halifax was built about this time and herschel was one of the seven candidates for the organists place they drew lots how they were to perform in succession herschel drew the third the second fell to dr wainwright of manchester whose finger was so rapid that old snetzler the organbuilder ran about the church exclaiming te tevel te tevel he run over te keys like one cat he will not give my piphes room for to shpeak during mr wainwrights performance says miller i was standing in the middle aisle with herschel what chance have you said i to follow this man he replied i dont know i am sure fingers will not do on which he ascended the organ loft and produced from the organ so uncommon a fulness such a volume of slow solemn harmony that i could by no means account for the effect after this short ex tempore effusion he finished with the old hundredth psalmtune which he played better than his opponent ay ay cried old snetzler tish is very goot very goot indeet i vil luf tish man for he gives my piphes room for to shpeak having afterwards asked mr herschel by what means in the beginning of his performance he produced so uncommon an effect he replied i told you fingers would not do and producing two pieces of lead from his waistcoat pocket one of these said he i placed on the lowest key of the organ and the other upon the octave above thus by accommodating the harmony i produced the effect of four hands instead of two6 the dates in this extract are not so well defined as might be wished herschel had certainly been more than a few months in england at the time of his meeting with dr miller which was probably about 1760 the appointment as organist at halifax was in 1765 and the pupils and public concerts must have filled up the intervening five years during a part of this time he lived in leeds with the family of mr bulman whom he afterwards provided with a place as clerk to the octagon chapel in his usual generous manner all during his life he was placing some of the less fortunate and energetic members of his family we cannot be too grateful to dr miller who seeing his opportunity used it their frank friendship does honor to both herschels organplaying which no doubt had been begun when his brother was the organist of the garrison chapel at hanover must have been perfected at this time and it was through his organplaying that he was able to leave the needy life in yorkshire he was sure to have emerged sooner or later but every year spared to him as a struggling musician was a year saved to astronomy during all this period a constant correspondence was maintained between the family at hanover and the absent son many of williams letters were written in english and addressed to his brother jacob and treated of such subjects as the theory of music in which he was already far advanced his little sister was still faithful to the memory of her dearest brother and his father whose health was steadily declining became painfully eager for his return in 1764 april 2 he returned to hanover on a very brief visit he was attached to england he was prospering there and he had no inclination towards returning to a life in hanover his sister says of the joys and pleasures which all felt at this longwishedfor meeting with mylet me say my dearestbrother but a small portion could fall to my share for with my constant attendance at church and school besides the time i was employed in doing the drudgery of the scullery it was but seldom i could make one in the group when the family were assembled together in the first week some of the orchestra were invited to a concert at which some of my brother williams compositions overtures etc and some of my eldest brother jacobs were performed to the great delight of my dear father who hoped and expected that they would be turned to some profit by publishing them but there was no printer who bid high enough sunday the 8th was theto meeventful day of my confirmation and i left home not a little proud and encouraged by my dear brother williams approbation of my appearance in my new gown the engagement of herschel at halifax did not long continue in 1766 he obtained an advantageous engagement as oboist at bath and soon after the position of organist at the octagon chapel was offered to him and accepted this was a great and important change bath was then as now one of the most beautiful cities in england and the resort of the fashion and rank of the kingdom who came to take the waters it is beautifully situated on both sides of the avon and has many fine walks and public buildings the aspect of the city is markedly cheerful and brilliant owing to the nature of the white stone of which the principal houses are built and to the exquisite amphitheatre of hills in which they lie the society was then gay and polite and herschel was at once thrown into a far more intelligent atmosphere than that he had just left in yorkshire it was easy to get new books to see new faces to hear new things the assembly rooms built in 1771 were noted for their size and elegance the theatre was the best out of london his position as organist of the fashionable chapel placed him in the current his charming and engaging manners made him friends his talents brought him admirers and pupils and pupils brought him money7 he began in 1766 a life of unceasing activity which continued in 1768 he published in london a symphony in c for two violins viola bass two oboes and two horns and in the same year two military concertos for two oboes two horns two trumpets and two bassoons8 he wrote pieces for the harp glees catches and other songs for the voice one of these the echo catch was published and had even considerable vogue a competent musical critic writes to me of this work the counterpoint is clear and flowing and is managed with considerable taste and effect it would be difficult to explain the great cleverness shown in the construction of the catch without diagrams to illustrate the movements of the parts it is certainly an ingenious bit of musical writing when he left bath in 1782 many of these musical writings were lost in his great haste to take up his new profession one specially his sister remembers to have written out for the printer but he could not find a moment to send it off nor answer the printers letters this was a fourpart song in thee i bear so dear a part he wrote very many anthems chants and psalmtunes for the excellent cathedral choir of the octagon chapel unfortunately most of this music is now not to be found a notice of herschels life which appeared in the european magazine for 1785 january gives a very lively picture of his life at this time and it is especially valuable as showing how he appeared to his cotemporaries although mr herschel loved music to an excess and made a considerable progress in it he yet determined with a sort of enthusiasm to devote every moment he could spare from business to the pursuit of knowledge which he regarded as the sovereign good and in which he resolved to place all his views of future happiness in life his situation at the octagon chapel proved a very profitable one as he soon fell into all the public business of the concerts the rooms the theatre and the oratorios besides many scholars and private concerts this great run of business instead of lessening his propensity to study increased it so that many times after a fatiguing day of fourteen or sixteen hours spent in his vocation he would retire at night with the greatest avidity to unbend the mind if it may be so called with a few propositions in maclaurins fluxions or other books of that sort it was in these years that he mastered italian and made some progress in greek we may hazard a natural conjecture respecting the course of herschels early studies music conducted him to mathematics or in other words impelled him to study smiths harmonics now this robert smith was the author of a complete system of optics a masterly work which notwithstanding the rapid growth of that branch of the science is not yet wholly superseded it seems to us not unlikely that herschel studying the harmonics conceived a reverence for the author who was at that time still living so that from the philosophy of music he passed to the optics a work on which smiths great reputation chiefly rested and thus undesignedly prepared himself for the career on which he was shortly about to enter with so much glory9 there is no doubt that this conjecture is a true one the optics of dr smith is one of the very few books quoted by herschel throughout his writings and there is every evidence of his complete familiarity with its conclusions and methods and this familiarity is of the kind which a student acquires with his early textbooks one other work he quotes in the same way lalandes astronomy and this too must have been deeply studied during the years 17651772 while herschel was following his profession and his studies at bath the family life at hanover went on in much the same way in 1765 his father isaac had a stroke of paralysis which ended his violinplaying forever and forced him to depend entirely upon pupils and copying of music for a livelihood he died on march 22 1767 leaving behind him a good name and living in the affectionate remembrance of his children and of all who knew him carolina had now lost her best friend and transferred to her brother william the affection she had before divided between him and her father my father wished to give me something like a polished education but my mother was particularly determined that it should be a rough but at the same time a useful one and nothing farther she thought was necessary but to send me two or three months to a sempstress to be taught to make household linen my mother would not consent to my being taught french and my brother dietrich was even denied a dancingmaster because she would not permit my learning along with him though the entrance had been paid for us both so all my father could do for me was to indulge me and please himself sometimes with a short lesson on the violin when my mother was either in good humor or out of the way though i have often felt myself exceedingly at a loss for the want of those few accomplishments of which i was thus by an erroneous though wellmeant opinion of my mother deprived i could not help thinking but that she had cause for wishing me not to know more than was necessary for being useful in the family for it was her certain belief that my brother william would have returned to his country and my eldest brother not have looked so high if they had had a little less learning but sometimes i found it scarcely possible to get through with the work required and felt very unhappy that no time at all was left for improving myself in music or fancy work in which i had an opportunity of receiving some instruction from an ingenious young woman whose parents lived in the same house with us but the time wanted for spending a few hours together could only be obtained by our meeting at daybreak because by the time of the familys rising at seven i was obliged to be at my daily business though i had neither time nor means for producing anything immediately either for show or use i was content with keeping samples of all possible patterns in needlework beads bugles horsehair etc for i could not help feeling troubled sometimes about my future destiny yet i could not bear the idea of being turned into an abigail or housemaid and thought that with the above and such like acquirements with a little notion of music i might obtain a place as governess in some family where the want of a knowledge of french would be no objection a change was soon to come in her life too her brother william wrote to propose that she should join him at bath to make the trial if by his instruction i might not become a useful singer for his winter concerts and oratorios he advised my brother jacob to give me some lessons by way of beginning but that if after a trial of two years we should not find it answer our expectation he would bring me back again this at first seemed to be agreeable to all parties but by the time i had set my heart upon this change in my situation jacob began to turn the whole scheme into ridicule and of course he never heard the sound of my voice except in speaking and yet i was left in the harassing uncertainty whether i was to go or not i resolved at last to prepare as far as lay in my power for both cases by taking in the first place every opportunity when all were from home to imitate with a gag between my teeth the solo parts of concertos shake and all such as i had heard them play on the violin in consequence i had gained a tolerable execution before i knew how to sing i next began to knit ruffles which were intended for my brother william in case i remained at homeelse they were to be jacobs for my mother and brother d i knitted as many cotton stockings as would last two years at least in august 1772 her brother arrived at hanover to take her back to england with him the journey to london was made between august 16th and 26th and soon after they went together to herschels house no 7 new kings street bath footnotes 1 wife of major john herschel of the royal engineers grandson

jacob herschel 9 foreign quarterly review volume 31 chapter ii life in bath 17721782 it was to a busy life in bath that herschel took his sister carolina then twentytwo years old she was a perfectly untried girl of very small accomplishments and outwardly with but little to attract the basis of her character was the possibility of an unchanging devotion to one object for the best years of her life this object was the happiness and success of her brother william whom she profoundly loved her love was headstrong and full of a kind of obstinate pride which refused to see anything but the view she had adopted as long as her life continued to be with her dearest brother all was well with her she had a noble aim and her heart was more than full later on this very singleness of character brought her other years of wretchedness it is necessary to understand the almost spaniellike allegiance she gave in order to comprehend the value which her services were to herschel she supplied him with an aid which was utterly loyal entire and devoted her obedience was unquestioning her reverence amounted almost to adoration in their relation he gave everything in the way of incentive and initiative and she returned her entire effort loyally at first her business was to gain a knowledge of the language and to perfect herself in singing so that she might become a soloist in the concerts and oratorios which he was constantly giving in the beginning it was not easy as the season for the arrival of visitors to the baths does not begin till october my brother had leisure to try my capacity for becoming a useful singer for his concerts and oratorios and being very well satisfied with my voice i had two or three lessons every day and the hours which were not spent at the harpsichord were employed in putting me in the way of managing the family on the second morning on meeting my brother at breakfast he began immediately to give me a lesson in english and arithmetic and showed me the way of booking and keeping accounts of cash received and laid out by way of relaxation we talked of astronomy and the bright constellations with which i had made acquaintance during the fine nights we spent on the postwagen travelling through holland my brother alexander who had been some time in england boarded and lodged with his elder brother and with myself occupied the attic the first floor which was furnished in the newest and most handsome style my brother kept for himself the front room containing the harpsichord was always in order to receive his musical friends and scholars at little private concerts or rehearsals sundays i received a sum for the weekly expenses of which my housekeeping book written in english showed the amount laid out and my purse the remaining cash one of the principal things required was to market and about six weeks after coming to england i was sent alone among fishwomen butchers basketwomen etc and i brought home whatever in my fright i could pick up my brother alex who was now returned from his summer engagement used to watch me at a distance unknown to me till he saw me safe on my way home but all attempts to introduce any order in our little household proved vain owing to the servant my brother then had and what still further increased my difficulty was that my brothers time was entirely taken up with business so that i only saw him at meals breakfast was at seven oclock or beforemuch too early for me who would rather have remained up all night than be obliged to rise at so early an hour the three winter months passed on very heavily i had to struggle against heimwehe home sickness and low spirits and to answer my sisters melancholy letters on the death of her husband by which she became a widow with six children i knew too little english to derive any consolation from the society of those who were about me so that dinnertime excepted i was entirely left to myself so the winter passed the time when i could hope to receive a little more of my brothers instruction and attention was now drawing near for after easter bath becomes very empty only a few of his scholars whose families were resident in the neighborhood remaining but i was greatly disappointed for in consequence of the harassing and fatiguing life he had led during the winter months he used to retire to bed with a basin of milk or glass of water and smiths harmonics and optics fergusons astronomy etc and so went to sleep buried under his favorite authors and his first thoughts on rising were how to obtain instruments for viewing those objects himself of which he had been reading there being in one of the shops a twoandahalffoot gregorian telescope to be let it was for some time taken in requisition and served not only for viewing the heavens but for making experiments on its construction it soon appeared that my brother was not contented with knowing what former observers had seen for he began to contrive a telescope eighteen or twenty feet long i believe after huyghens description i was much hindered in my musical practice by my help being continually wanted in the execution of the various contrivances and i had to amuse myself with making the tube of pasteboard for the glasses which were to arrive from london for at that time no optician had settled at bath but when all was finished no one besides my brother could get a glimpse of jupiter or saturn for the great length of the tube would not allow it to be kept in a straight line this difficulty however was soon removed by substituting tin tubes my brother wrote to inquire the price of a reflecting mirror for i believe a five or six foot telescope the answer was there were none of so large a size but a person offered to make one at a price much above what my brother thought proper to give about this time he bought of a quaker resident at bath who had formerly made attempts at polishing mirrors all his rubbish of patterns tools hones polishers unfinished mirrors etc but all for small gregorians and none above two or three inches diameter but nothing serious could be attempted for want of time till the beginning of june when some of my brothers scholars were leaving bath and then to my sorrow i saw almost every room turned into a workshop a cabinetmaker making a tube and stands of all descriptions in a handsomely furnished drawingroom alex putting up a huge turning machine which he had brought in the autumn from bristol where he used to spend the summer in a bedroom for turning patterns grinding glasses and turning eyepieces etc at the same time music durst not lie entirely dormant during the summer and my brother had frequent rehearsals at home where miss farinelli an italian singer was met by several of the principal performers he had engaged for the winter concerts finally in 1774 he had made himself a gregorian telescope10 and had begun to view the heavens he was then thirtysix years old the writer in the european magazine describes this period all this time he continued his astronomical observations and nothing now seemed wanting to complete his felicity but sufficient leisure to enjoy his telescopes to which he was so much attached that at the theatre he used frequently to run from the harpsichord to look at the stars during the time between the acts in an extract from his journal no 1 now at the rooms of the royal society may be seen a copy of his first observation of the nebula of orion on march 4 1774 this was made with his fiveandahalffoot gregorian reflector it was at this time 1775 between the acts of the theatre that he made his first review of the heavens with a newtonian telescope of an aperture of four and a half inches and a magnifying power of 222 times this telescope was one of the first made by himself the review consisted of the examination of every star in the sky of the first second third and fourth magnitudes and of all planets visible there are no records of these observations now extant and they are noteworthy only as a preparation for more serious work he was carrying out his resolve to see everything for himself his assiduity may be judged of by the fact that between 1774 and 1781 herschel had observed a single objectthe nebula of orionno less than fourteen times the success of his first telescopes incited him to new efforts his house became a complete atelier where everything that could tend to excellence in this manufacture was tried and retried a hundred different ways when a difficulty arose experiments were begun which continued till it was conquered when a success was gained it was prosecuted to the utmost in 1775 the first sevenfoot reflector was made in 1777 a tenfoot was finished in 1778 a very good tenfoot took its place it must not be thought that the telescopes mentioned were the only ones completed on the contrary they were but the best ones selected out of many in 1774 a new house had been engaged which had more room for workshops and whose roof gave space for observing the grassplat near it was soon utilized to hold the stand of a twentyfoot telescope which he had even then projected his projects were unending no success was final his mind was at the height of activity his whole effort was thrown into every undertaking the mirrors for all these telescopes were made by hand every portion of the grinding down to rough dimensions the shaping to something near the correct form the polishing till the accurately exact curves were obtained all this must be done by hand the machines for the purpose were not invented until 178811 alexander and william worked together at this but most of the work was done by the latter the sisters part was to attend in the workshop and lend a hand wherever and whenever it was needed my time was taken up with copying music and practising besides attendance on my brother when polishing since by way of keeping him alive i was constantly obliged to feed him by putting the victuals by bits into his mouth this was once the case when in order to finish a sevenfoot mirror he had not taken his hands from it for sixteen hours together in general he was never unemployed at meals but was always at those times contriving or making drawings of whatever came in his mind generally i was obliged to read to him whilst he was at the turninglathe or polishing mirrors don quixote arabian nights entertainment the novels of sterne fielding etc serving tea and supper without interrupting the work with which he was engaged and sometimes lending a hand i became in time as useful a member of the workshop as a boy might be to his master in the first year of his apprenticeship but as i was to take a part the next year in the oratorios i had for a whole twelvemonth two lessons per week from miss fleming the celebrated dancingmistress to drill me for a gentlewoman god knows how she succeeded so we lived on without interruption my brother alex was absent from bath for some months every summer but when at home he took much pleasure in executing some turning or clockmakers work for his brother news from hanover put a sudden stop for a time to all these labors the mother wrote in the utmost distress to say that dietrich had disappeared from his home it was supposed with the intention of going to india with a young idler not older than himself his brother immediately left the lathe at which he was turning an eyepiece in cocoanut and started for holland whence he proceeded to hanover failing to meet his brother as he expected meanwhile the sister received a letter to say that dietrich was laid up very ill at an inn in wapping alexander posted to town removed him to a lodging and after a fortnights nursing brought him to bath where on his brother williams return he found him being well cared for by his sister about this time another change was made to the house 19 new king street which was the last move in bath it was here that the georgium sidus was discovered the music still went on the oratorios of the messiah judas maccabeus and samson were to be performed under herschels direction with an orchestra of nearly one hundred pieces the scores and vocal parts of these carolina copied with her own hands and the soprani were instructed by her she being the leading soloist along with the music went the astronomy not only were new telescopes made but they were made for immediate use the variable star mira ceti was observed and a long series of lunar observations begun in 1779 1780 and 1781 i measured the heights of about one hundred mountains of the moon by three different methods some of these observations are given in philosophical transactions vol lxx but most remain uncalculated in my journal till some proper opportunity12 while herschel was measuring these lunar mountains in december 1779 he made by chance an acquaintance of much value to him dr william watson a fellow of the royal society distinguished for his researches in electricity happened to see him at his telescope and this led to a visit and an invitation to herschel to join the philosophical society of bath then forming this he gladly did and it was of use to him in many ways he there formed acquaintance with men of his own way of thinking and he himself became known better than all he learned to measure himself with other men and by his early papers read to the society he gained skill in putting his thoughts before his hearers this skill he never lost and the merely literary art of his memoirs would make his papers remarkable without their other merits he is always clear and in his early papers especially he appeals to his particular audiencethe royal societyin a way which shows that he is conscious of all its weaknesses as well as of its dignity later his tone slightly changed he became less anxious to win his audience for he had become an authority this knowledge lent a quiet strength to his style but never induced the slightest arrogance of spirit or manner the bath philosophical society has left no printed proceedings herschel was one of its earliest members and many papers were communicated to it by his hand these appear to have been of a very miscellaneous nature some of them at least would be of the highest interest to us now in the philosophical transactions for 1789 p 220 herschel tells us that he communicated to that society certain mathematical papers relating to central forces other than the force of gravity which are or may be concerned in the construction of the sidereal heavens this early idea was still entertained by herschel in 1789 and the mathematical papers referred to must be contained in the minutes of the society which on its dissolution were torn from the minutebook and returned to the writers the earliest published writing of herschel is the answer to the prize question in the ladies diary for 1779 proposed by the celebrated landen namely the length tension and weight of a musical string being given it is required to find how many vibrations it will make in a given time when a small given weight is fastened to its middle and vibrates with it in the philosophical transactions of the royal society for 1780 are two papers of his the title of the first is astronomical observations on the periodical star in collo ceti by mr william herschel of bath this was communicated to the society by dr william watson jr and was read may 11 1780 at the same time as the other paper on the mountains of the moon it is to be noted that herschel was at this time plain mr william herschel of bath it was only in 1786 that he became dr herschel through the oxford degree of lld neither of these two papers is specially remarkable on its purely astronomical side the problems examined were such as lay open before all and the treatment of them was such as would naturally be suggested the second of these two contained however a short description of his newtonian telescope and he speaks of it with a just pride i believe that for distinctness of vision this instrument is perhaps equal to any that was ever made he was at least certain of having obtained excellence in the making of his instruments in his next paper however read january 11 1781 a subject is approached which shows a different kind of thought it is the first obvious proof of the truth of the statement which he made long afterwards 1811 when he said a knowledge of the construction of the heavens has always been the ultimate object of my observations the title of this paper was astronomical observations on the rotation of the planets round their axes made with a view to determine whether the earths diurnal motion is perfectly equable here the question is a difficult and a remote one and the method adopted for its solution is perfectly suitable in principle it marks a step onward from mere observations to philosophizing upon their results in practical astronomy too we note an advance not only are his results given but also careful estimates of the errors to be feared in them and a discussion of the sources of such errors the same volume of the philosophical transactions which contains this paper also contains another account of a comet read april 26 1781 this comet was the major planet uranus or as herschel named it georgium sidus he had found it on the night of tuesday march 13 1781 in examining the small stars in the neighborhood of h geminorum i perceived one that appeared visibly larger than the rest being struck with its uncommon appearance i compared it to h geminorum and the small star in the quartile between auriga and gemini and finding it so much larger than either of them i suspected it to be a comet the comet was observed over all europe its orbit was computed by various astronomers and its distance from the sun was found to be nineteen times that of our earth this was no comet but a new major planet the discovery of the amateur astronomer of bath was the most striking since the invention of the telescope it had absolutely no parallel for every other major planet had been known from time immemorial13 the effect of the discoveries of galileo was felt almost more in the moral than in the scientific world the mystic number of the planets was broken up by the introduction of four satellites to jupiter that venus emulated the phases of our moon overthrew superstition and seated the copernican theory firmly the discovery of an innumerable multitude of fixed stars in the milky way confounded the received ideas this was the great mission of the telescope in galileos hands the epoch of mere astronomical discovery began with the detection of the large satellite of saturn by huyghens in 1655 even then superstition was not dead huyghens did not search for more moons because by that discovery he had raised the number of known satellites to six14 and because these with the six planets made the perfect number twelve from 1671 to 1684 cassini discovered four more moons revolving about saturn since 1684 no new body had been added to the solar system it was thought complete for nearly a century in england the remarkable discoveries of bradley 172762 had been in the field of practical astronomy and his example had set the keynote for further researches france was just about beginning the brilliant period of her discoveries in mathematical astronomy and had no observatory devoted to investigations like herschels with the possible exception of darquiers and flaugergues the observatories of schroeter and von hahn in germany were not yet active the field which herschel was created to fill was vacant the whole world over it was especially so in england the royal observatory at greenwich under maskelyne a skilful observer whose work was mostly confined to meridian observations was no rival to a private observatory like herschels the private observatories themselves were but small affairs those of the king at kew of dr wilson at glasgow of mr aubert at loampit hill of the count von bruhl in london being perhaps the most important the whole field was open what was perhaps more remarkable there was in england during herschels lifetime no astronomer public or private whose talents even as an observer lay in the same direction it hardly need be said that as a philosopher in his science he had then no rival as he has had none since his only associates even were michell and wilson15 without depreciating the abilities of the astronomers of england his cotemporaries we may fairly say that herschel stood a great man among a group of small ones let us endeavor to appreciate the change effected in the state of astronomy not only in england but in the whole world simply by the discovery of uranus suppose for example that the last planet in our system had been saturn no doubt herschel would have gone on in spite of one and another difficulty he would have made his tenfoot his twentyfoot telescopes his fortyfoot would never have been built and the two satellites which he found with it might not have been discovered certainly mimas would not have been his researches on the construction of the heavens would have been made those were in his brain and must have been ultimated the mass of observations of saturn of jupiter of mars of venus would have been made and published the researches on the sun on the invisible rays of heat on comets and nebulall these might have been made printed and read but these would have gone into the philosophical transactions as the work of an amateur astronomer mr herschel of bath they would have been praised and they would have been doubted it would have taken a whole generation to have appreciated them they would have been severely tried entirely on their merits and finally they would have stood where they stand todayunrivalled but through what increased labors these successes would have been gained it is not merely that the patronage of the king the subsidies for the fortyfoot telescope 4000 the comparative ease of herschels life would have been lacking it is more than this it would have been necessary for him to have created the audience to which he appealed and to have conquered the most persistent of enemiesindifference certainly if herschels mind had been other than it was the discovery of uranus which brought him honors from every scientific society in the world and which gave him authority might have had a hurtful effect but as he was there was nothing which could have aided his career more than this startling discovery it was needed for him it completed the solar system far more by affording a free play to a profoundly philosophical mind than by occupying the vacant spaces beyond saturn his opportunities would have been profoundly modified though his personal worth would have been the same the star that from the zenith darts its beams visible though it be to half the earth though half a sphere be conscious of its brightness is yet of no diviner origin no purer essence than the one that burns like an untended watchfire on the ridge of some dark mountain or than those that seem humbly to hang like twinkling winter lamps among the branches of the leafless trees to show how completely unknown the private astronomer of bath was at this time i transcribe a sentence from bodes account of the discovery of uranus in the gazette littraire of june 1781 this worthy man is called mersthel in julius journal encyclopdique hertschel in a letter from mr maskelyne to m messier herthel in another letter of maskelynes to herr mayer at mannheim herrschell m darquier calls him hermstel what may his name be he must have been born a german16 this obscurity did not long continue the news spread quickly from fashionable bath to london on the 6th of december 1781 herschel was elected a fellow of the royal society to which he was formally admitted may 30 1782 he was fortythree years old he also received the copley medal in 1781 for his discovery of a new and singular star17 he was now frequently interrupted by visitors who were introduced by some of his resident scholars among whom i remember sir harry engelfield dr blagden and dr maskelyne with the latter he was engaged in a long conversation which to me sounded like quarrelling and the first words my brother said after he was gone were that is a devil of a fellow i suppose their names were often not known or were forgotten for it was not till the year 1782 or 1783 that a memorandum of the names of visitors was thought of my brother now applied himself to perfect his mirrors erecting in his garden a stand for his twentyfoot telescope many trials were necessary before the required motions for such an unwieldy machine could be contrived many attempts were made by way of experiment before an intended thirtyfoot telescope could be completed for which between whiles not interrupting the observations with seven ten and twentyfoot and writing papers for both the royal and bath philosophical societies gauges shapes weight etc of the mirror were calculated and trials of the composition of the metal were made in short i saw nothing else and heard nothing else talked of but these things when my brothers were together alex was always very alert assisting when anything new was going forward but he wanted perseverance and never liked to confine himself at home for many hours together and so it happened that my brother william was obliged to make trial of my abilities in copying for him catalogues tables etc and sometimes whole papers which were lent him for his perusal among them was one by mr michell and a catalogue of christian mayer in latin which kept me employed when my brother was at the telescope at night when i found that a hand was sometimes wanted when any particular measures were to be made with the lamp micrometer etc or a fire to be kept up or a dish of coffee necessary during a long nights watching i undertook with pleasure what others might have thought a hardship since the discovery of the georgium sidus march 13 1781 i believe few men of learning or consequence left bath before they had seen and conversed with its discoverer and thought themselves fortunate in finding him at home on their repeated visits sir william watson was almost an intimate for hardly a day passed but he had something to communicate from the letters which he received from sir joseph banks and other members of the royal society from which it appeared that my brother was expected in town to receive the gold medal the end of november was the most precarious season for absenting himself but sir william watson went with him and it was arranged so that they set out with the diligence at night and by that means his absence did not last above three or four days when my brother returned alone sir william remaining with his father now a very busy winter was commencing for my brother had engaged himself to conduct the oratorios conjointly with ronzini and had made himself answerable for the payment of the engaged performers for his credit ever stood high in the opinion of every one he had to deal with he lost considerably by this arrangement but though at times much harassed with business the mirror for the thirtyfoot reflector was never out of his mind and if a minute could but be spared in going from one scholar to another or giving one the slip he called at home to see how the men went on with the furnace which was built in a room below even with the garden the mirror was to be cast in a mould of loam of which an immense quantity was to be pounded in a mortar and sifted through a fine sieve it was an endless piece of work and served me for many an hours exercise and alex frequently took his turn at it for we were all eager to do something towards the great undertaking even sir william watson would sometimes take the pestle from me when he found me in the workroom where he expected to find his friend in whose concerns he took so much interest that he felt much disappointed at not being allowed to pay for the metal but i do not think my brother ever accepted pecuniary assistance from any one of his friends and on this occasion he declined the offer by saying it was paid for already among the bath visitors were many philosophical gentlemen who used to frequent the leves at st jamess when in town colonel walsh in particular informed my brother that from a conversation he had had with his majesty it appeared that in the spring he was to come with his sevenfoot telescope to the king similar reports he received from many others but they made no great impression nor caused any interruption in his occupation or study and as soon as the season for the concerts was over and the mould etc in readiness a day was set apart for casting and the metal was in the furnace unfortunately it began to leak at the moment when ready for pouring and both my brothers and the caster with his men were obliged to run out at opposite doors for the stone flooring which ought to have been taken up flew about in all directions as high as the ceiling before the second casting was attempted everything which could insure success had been attended to and a very perfect metal was found in the mould but a total stop and derangement now took place and nearly six or seven months elapsed before my brother could return to the undisturbed enjoyment of his instruments and observations for one morning in passion week as sir william watson was with my brother talking about the pending journey to town my eldest nephew arrived to pay us a visit and brought the confirmation that his uncle was expected with his instrument in town we had not one night in the week except friday but what was set apart for an oratorio either at bath or bristol soon after easter a new organ being erected in st jamess church it was opened with two performances of the messiah this again took up some of my brothers time in may of 1782 herschel went to london but when almost double the time had elapsed which my brother could safely be absent from his scholars alex as well as myself were much at a loss how to answer their inquiries for from the letters we received we could learn nothing but that he had been introduced to the king and queen and had permission to come to the concerts at buckingham house where the king conversed with him about astronomy it was during his absence at this time that the three following letters were written and received dear lina i have had an audience of his majesty this morning and met with a very gracious reception i presented him with the drawing of the solar system and had the honor of explaining it to him and the queen my telescope is in three weeks time to go to richmond and meanwhile to be put up at greenwich where i shall accordingly carry it today so you see lina that you must not think of seeing me in less than a month i shall write to miss lee myself and other scholars who inquire for me you may tell that i cannot wait on them till his majesty shall be pleased to give me leave to return or rather to dismiss me for till then i must attend i will also write to mr palmer to acquaint him with it i am in a great hurry therefore can write no more at present tell alexander that everything looks very likely as if i were to stay here the king inquired after him and after my great speculum he also gave me leave to come to hear the griesbachs play at the private concert which he has every evening my having seen the king need not be kept a secret but about my staying here it will be best not to say anything but only that i must remain here till his majesty has observed the planets with my telescope yesterday i dined with colonel walsh who inquired after you there were mr aubert and dr maskelyne dr maskelyne in public declared his obligations to me for having introduced to them the high powers for mr aubert has so much succeeded with them that he says he looks down upon 200 300 or 400 with contempt and immediately begins with 800 he has used 2500 very completely and seen my fine double stars with them all my papers are printing with the postscript and all and are allowed to be very valuable you see lina i tell you all these things you know vanity is not my foible therefore i need not fear your censure farewell i am your affectionate brother wm herschel saturday morning probably may 25 1782 to miss herschel monday evening june 3 1782 dear lina i pass my time between greenwich and london agreeably enough but am rather at a loss for work that i like company is not always pleasing and i would much rather be polishing a speculum last friday i was at the kings concert to hear george play the king spoke to me as soon as he saw me and kept me in conversation for half an hour he asked george to play a soloconcerto on purpose that i might hear him and george plays extremely well is very much improved and the king likes him very much these two last nights i have been stargazing at greenwich with dr maskelyne and mr aubert we have compared our telescopes together and mine was found very superior to any of the royal observatory double stars which they could not see with their instruments i had the pleasure to show them very plainly and my mechanism is so much approved of that dr maskelyne has already ordered a model to be taken from mine and a stand to be made by it to his reflector he is however now so much out of love with his instrument that he begins to doubt whether it deserves a new stand i am introduced to the best company tomorrow i dine at lord palmerstons next day with sir joseph banks etc etc among opticians and astronomers nothing now is talked of but what they call my great discoveries alas this shows how far they are behind when such trifles as i have seen and done are called great let me but get at it again i will make such telescopes and see such thingsthat is i will endeavor to do so to miss herschel july 3 1782 dear carolina i have been so much employed that you will not wonder at my not writing sooner the letter you sent me last monday came very safe to me as dr watson has been so good as to acquaint you and alexander with my situation i was still more easy in my silence to you last night the king the queen the prince of wales the princess royal princess sophia princess augusta etc duke of montague dr heberden m de luc etc etc saw my telescope and it was a very fine evening my instrument gave general satisfaction the king has very good eyes and enjoys observations with telescopes exceedingly this evening as the king and queen are gone to kew the princesses were desirous of seeing my telescope but wanted to know if it was possible to see without going out on the grass and were much pleased when they heard that my telescope could be carried into any place they liked best to have it about eight oclock it was moved into the queens apartments and we waited some time in hopes of seeing jupiter or saturn meanwhile i showed the princesses and several other ladies who were present the speculum the micrometers the movements of the telescopes and other things that seemed to excite their curiosity when the evening appeared to be totally unpromising i proposed an artificial saturn as an object since we could not have the real one i had beforehand prepared this little piece as i guessed by the appearance of the weather in the afternoon we should have no stars to look at this being accepted with great pleasure i had the lamps lighted up which illuminated the picture of a saturn cut out in pasteboard at the bottom of the garden wall the effect was fine and so natural that the best astronomer might have been deceived their royal highnesses and other ladies seemed to be much pleased with the artifice i remained in the queens apartment with the ladies till about half after ten when in conversation with them i found them extremely well instructed in every subject that was introduced and they seemed to be most amiable characters tomorrow evening they hope to have better luck and nothing will give me greater happiness than to be able to show them some of those beautiful objects with which the heavens are so gloriously ornamented carolinas diary goes on sir william watson returned to bath after a fortnight or three weeks stay from him we heard that my brother was invited to greenwich with the telescope where he was met by a numerous party of astronomical and learned gentlemen and trials of his instrument were made in these letters he complained of being obliged to lead an idle life having nothing to do but to pass between london and greenwich sir william received many letters which he was so kind as to communicate to us by these and from those to alexander or to me we learned that the king wished to see the telescope at windsor at last a letter dated july 2 arrived from therese and from this and several succeeding ones we gathered that the king would not suffer my brother to return to his profession again and by his writing several times for a supply of money we could only suppose that he himself was in uncertainty about the time of his return in the last week of july my brother came home and immediately prepared for removing to datchet where he had taken a house with a garden and grassplat annexed quite suitable for the purpose of an observingplace sir william watson spent nearly the whole time at our house and he was not the only friend who truly grieved at my brothers going from bath or feared his having perhaps agreed to no very advantageous offers their fears were in fact not without reason the prospect of entering again on the toils of teaching etc which awaited my brother at home the months of leisure being now almost gone by appeared to him an intolerable waste of time and by way of alternative he chose to be royal astronomer with a salary of 200 a year sir william watson was the only one to whom the sum was mentioned and he exclaimed never bought monarch honor so cheap to every other inquirer my brothers answer was that the king had provided for him on the 1st of august 1782 the family removed to datchet the last musical duty was performed on whitsunday 1782 in st margarets chapel bath when the anthem for the day was of herschels own composition the end of the introductory epoch of his life is reached henceforth he lived in his observatory and from his fortyfourth year onwards he only left it for short periods to go to london to submit his classic memoirs to the royal society even for these occasions he chose periods of moonlight when no observations could be made he was a private man no longer henceforth he belongs to the whole world footnotes 10 probably on the model of one of shorts gregorian telescopes which were then the best instruments of the kind 11 for a description of the main points of herschels processes of making reflectors which will illustrate his strong mechanical talents see encyclopdia britannica eighth edition article telescope 12 these have never been published nor is it likely at this day when our measuring instruments are so greatly improved that they would be of any material value to science although of interest as giving the proofs of herschels assiduity and skill he was always more than the maker of telescopes for he was never content until they were applied to the problems of astronomy 13 arago has implied that if herschel had directed his telescope to uranus only eleven days earlier than he did this discovery would have escaped him since at that time march 2 1781 the planet was at its station and had no motion relative to the star this is an entire misconception since the new planet was detected by its physical appearance and not by its motion does any one suppose that a new and singular star like this would have been once viewed and then forgotten 14 four of jupiter one of the earth and one of saturn 15 john michell had been a member of the royal society since 1760 he died in 1793 he was a philosophical thinker as is shown by his memoirs on the distances of the stars and by his invention of the method for determining the earths density it is not certain that he was personally known to herschel although his writings were familiar to the latter alexander wilson was professor of astronomy at glasgow and is chiefly known to us by his theory of the nature of the solar spots which was adopted and enlarged by herschel he died in 1786 but the families of wilson and herschel remained close friends 16 berliner jahrbuch 1784 p 211 in the connaissance des tems for 1784 he is called horochelle 17 at the presentation sir joseph banks the president of the royal society said in the name of the royal society i present to you this gold medal the reward which they have assigned to your successful labors and i exhort you to continue diligently to cultivate those fields of science which have produced to you a harvest of so much honor your attention to the improvement of telescopes has already amply repaid the labor which you have bestowed upon them but the treasures of the heavens are well known to be inexhaustible who can say but your new star which exceeds saturn in its distance from the sun may exceed him as much in magnificence of attendance who knows what new rings new satellites or what other nameless and numberless phenomena remain behind waiting to reward future industry and improvement chapter iii life at datchet clay hall and slough 17821822 the new house at datchet which was occupied from 1782 till 1785 was a source of despair to carolina herschel who looked upon its desolate and isolated condition with a housekeepers eyes this was nothing to her brother who gayly consented to live upon eggs and bacon now that he was free at last to mind the heavens the ruinous state of the place had no terrors in his eyes for was there not a laundry which would serve as a library a large stable which was just the place for the grinding of mirrors and a grassplat for the small twentyfoot reflector here they set to work at astronomy the brother with the twentyfoot the sister aiding him and at odd times sweeping for comets in the course of her life she discovered no less than eight and five of these were first seen by her in 1787 herschel wrote his paper on three volcanoes in the moon which he had observed in april of that year in this he mentions previous observations of the same sort i do not remember that the following account of these has ever been put on record in english baron von zach writes from london to bode18 probably you have heard also of the volcanoes in the moon which herschel has observed i will give you an account of it as i heard it from his own lips dr lind a worthy physician in windsor who has made himself known through his two journeys in china and who is a friend of our herschels was with his wife one evening on a visit to herschel in datchet 1783 may 4 on this evening there was to be an occultation of a star at the moons dark limb this was observed by herschel and doctor lind mrs lind wished also to see what was occurring and placed herself at a telescope and watched attentively scarcely had the star disappeared before mrs lind thought she saw it again and exclaimed that the star had gone in front of and not behind the moon this provoked a short astronomical lecture on the question but still she would not credit it because she saw differently finally herschel stepped to the telescope and in fact he saw a bright point on the dark disc of the moon which he followed attentively it gradually became fainter and finally vanished the life at datchet was not free from its annoyances much of my brothers time was taken up in going when the evenings were clear to the queens lodge to show the king etc objects through the sevenfoot but when the days began to shorten this was found impossible for the telescope was often at no small expense and risk of damage obliged to be transported in the dark back to datchet for the purpose of spending the rest of the night with observations on double stars for a second catalogue my brother was besides obliged to be absent for a week or ten days for the purpose of bringing home the metal of the cracked thirtyfoot mirror and the remaining materials from his workroom before the furnace was taken down at bath a second twentyfoot mirror twelve inches diameter was cast which happened to be very fortunate for on the 1st of january 1783 a very fine one cracked by frost in the tube in my brothers absence from home i was of course left alone to amuse myself with my own thoughts which were anything but cheerful i found i was to be trained for an assistant astronomer and by way of encouragement a telescope adapted for sweeping consisting of a tube with two glasses such as are commonly used in a finder was given me i was to sweep for comets and i see by my journal that i began august 22d 1782 to write down and describe all remarkable appearances i saw in my sweeps which were horizontal but it was not till the last two months of the same year that i felt the least encouragement to spend the starlight nights on a grassplot covered with dew or hoarfrost without a human being near enough to be within call i knew too little of the real heavens to be able to point out every object so as to find it again without losing much time by consulting the atlas but all these troubles were removed when i knew my brother to be at no great distance making observations with his various instruments on double stars planets etc and when i could have his assistance immediately if i found a nebula or cluster of stars of which i intended to give a catalogue but at the end of 1783 i had only marked fourteen when my sweeping was interrupted by being employed to write down my brothers observations with the large twentyfoot i had however the comfort to see that my brother was satisfied with my endeavors to assist him when he wanted another person either to run to the clocks write down a memorandum fetch and carry instruments or measure the ground with poles etc etc of which something of the kind every moment would occur for the assiduity with which the measurements on the diameter of the georgium sidus and observations of other planets double stars etc etc were made was incredible as may be seen by the various papers that were given to the royal society in 1783 which papers were written in the daytime or when cloudy nights interfered besides this the twelveinch speculum was perfected before the spring and many hours were spent at the turningbench as not a night clear enough for observing ever passed but that some improvements were planned for perfecting the mounting and motions of the various instruments then in use or some trials were made of new constructed eyepieces which were mostly executed by my brothers own hands wishing to save his time he began to have some work of that kind done by a watchmaker who had retired from business and lived on datchet common but the work was so bad and the charges so unreasonable that he could not be employed it was not till some time afterwards in his frequent visits to the meetings of the royal society made in moonlight nights that he had an opportunity of looking about for mathematical workmen opticians and founders but the work seldom answered expectation and it was kept to be executed with improvements by alexander during the few months he spent with us the summer months passed in the most active preparation for getting the large twentyfoot ready against the next winter the carpenters and smiths of datchet were in daily requisition and as soon as patterns for tools and mirrors were ready my brother went to town to have them cast and during the three or four months alexander could be absent from bath the mirrors and optical parts were nearly completed but that the nights after a day of toil were not given to rest may be seen by the observations on mars of which a paper dated december 1 1783 was given to the royal society some trouble also was often thrown away during those nights in the attempt to teach me to remeasure double stars with the same micrometers with which former measures had been taken and the small twentyfoot was given me for that purpose i had also to ascertain their places by a transit instrument lent for that purpose by mr dalrymple but after many fruitless attempts it was seen that the instrument was perhaps as much in fault as my observations in 1783 herschel says i have now finished my third review of the heavens the first was made with a newtonian telescope something less than seven feet focal length a power of 222 and an aperture of four and a half inches it extended only to stars of the first second third and fourth magnitudes my second review was made with an instrument much superior to the other of 852 inches focus 62 inches aperture and power 227 it extended to all the stars of harriss maps and the telescopic ones near them as far as the eighth magnitude the catalogue of double stars and the discovery of the georgium sidus were the results of that review the third was with the same instrument and aperture but with a power of 460 this review extended to all the stars of flamsteeds catalogue together with every small star about them to the amount of a great many thousands of stars i have many a night in the course of eleven or twelve hours of observation carefully and singly examined not less than 400 celestial objects besides taking measures and sometimes viewing a particular star for half an hour together the fourth review began with the twentyfoot in 1784 my brother began his series of sweeps when the instrument was yet in a very unfinished state and my feelings were not very comfortable when every moment i was alarmed by a crack or fall knowing him to be elevated fifteen feet or more on a temporary crossbeam instead of a safe gallery the ladders had not even their braces at the bottom and one night in a very high wind he had hardly touched the ground before the whole apparatus came down some laboring men were called up to help in extricating the mirror which was fortunately uninjured but much work was cut out for carpenters next day i could give a pretty long list of accidents which were near proving fatal to my brother as well as myself to make observations with such large machinery where all around is in darkness is not unattended with danger especially when personal safety is the last thing with which the mind is occupied even poor piazzi did not go home without getting broken shins by falling over the rackbar in the long days of the summer months many ten and seven foot mirrors were finished there was nothing but grinding and polishing to be seen for tenfoot several had been cast with ribbed backs by way of experiment to reduce the weight in large mirrors in my leisure hours i ground sevenfoot and plain mirrors from rough to fining down and was indulged with polishing and the last finishing of a very beautiful mirror for sir william watson an account of the discoveries made with the twentyfoot and the improvements of the mechanical parts of the instrument during the winter of 1785 is given with the catalogue of the first 1000 new nebul by which account it must plainly appear that the expenses of these improvements and those which were yet to be made in the apparatus of the twentyfoot which in fact proved to be a model of a larger instrument could not be supplied out of a salary of 200 a year especially as my brothers finances had been too much reduced during the six months before he received his first quarterly payment of fifty pounds which was michaelmas 1782 travelling from bath to london greenwich windsor backwards and forwards transporting the telescope etc breaking up his establishment at bath and forming a new one near the court all this even leaving such personal conveniences as he had for many years been used to out of the question could not be obtained for a trifle a good large piece of ground was required for the use of the instruments and a habitation in which he could receive and offer a bed to an astronomical friend was necessary after a nights observation it seemed to be supposed that enough had been done when my brother was enabled to leave his profession that he might have time to make and sell telescopes the king ordered four tenfoot himself and many sevenfoot besides had been bespoke and much time had already been expended on polishing the mirrors for the same but all this was only retarding the work of a thirty or forty foot instrument which it was my brothers chief object to obtain as soon as possible for he was then on the wrong side of fortyfive and felt how great an injustice he would be doing to himself and to the cause of astronomy by giving up his time to making telescopes for other observers sir william watson who often in the lifetime of his father came to make some stay with us at datchet saw my brothers difficulties and expressed great dissatisfaction on his return to bath he met among the visitors there several belonging to the court to whom he gave his opinion concerning his friend and his situation very freely in consequence of this my brother had soon after through sir j banks the promise that 2000 would be granted for enabling him to make himself an instrument immediately every preparation for beginning the great work commenced a very ingenious smith campion who was seeking employment was secured by my brother and a temporary forge erected in an upstairs room the sale of these telescopes of herschels must have produced a large sum for he had made before 1795 more than two hundred sevenfeet one hundred and fifty tenfeet and eighty twentyfeet mirrors for many of the telescopes sent abroad no stands were constructed the mirrors and eyepieces alone were furnished and a drawing of the stand sent with them by which the mirrors could be mounted in 1785 the cost of a sevenfoot telescope six and fourtenths inches aperture stand eyepieces etc complete was two hundred guineas a tenfoot was six hundred guineas and a twentyfoot about 2500 to 3000 guineas he had made four tenfoot telescopes like this for the king in 1787 schroeter got the mirrors and eyepieces only for a fourandthreequarterinch reflector for five guineas those for his sevenfoot telescope were twentythree guineas later a sevenfoot telescope complete was sold for one hundred guineas and the twentyfivefoot reflector made for the madrid observatory cost them 75000 francs 1500019 it was ordered in 1796 but not delivered for several years the spanish government being short of money for a ten and a seven foot telescope the prince of canino paid 2310 von magellan writes to bode concerning a visit to herschel20 i spent the night of the 6th of january at herschels in datchet near windsor and had the good luck to hit on a fine evening he has his twentyfoot newtonian telescope in the open air and mounted in his garden very simply and conveniently it is moved by an assistant who stands below it near the instrument is a clock regulated to sidereal time in the room near it sits herschels sister and she has flamsteeds atlas open before her as he gives her the word she writes down the declination and right ascension and the other circumstances of the observation in this way herschel examines the whole sky without omitting the least part he commonly observes with a magnifying power of one hundred and fifty and is sure that after four or five years he will have passed in review every object above our horizon he showed me the book in which his observations up to this time are written and i am astonished at the great number of them each sweep covers 2 15 in declination and he lets each star pass at least three times through the field of his telescope so that it is impossible that anything can escape him he has already found about 900 double stars and almost as many nebul i went to bed about one oclock and up to that time he had found that night four or five new nebul the thermometer in the garden stood at 13 fahrenheit but in spite of this herschel observes the whole night through except that he stops every three or four hours and goes in the room for a few moments for some years herschel has observed the heavens every hour when the weather is clear and this always in the open air because he says that the telescope only performs well when it is at the same temperature as the air he protects himself against the weather by putting on more clothing he has an excellent constitution and thinks about nothing else in the world but the celestial bodies he has promised me in the most cordial way entirely in the service of astronomy and without thinking of his own interest to see to the telescopes i have ordered for european observatories and he will himself attend to the preparation of the mirrors it was at this time 1783 may 8 that herschel married his wife was the daughter of mr james baldwin a merchant of the city of london and the widow of john pitt esq she is described as a lady of singular amiability and gentleness of character she was entirely interested in his scientific pursuits and the jointure which she brought removed all further anxiety about money affairs they had but one child john frederick william born march 7 179221 the house at datchet became more and more unfit for the needs of the family and in june 1785 a move was made to clay hall in old windsor the residence here was but short and finally a last change was made to slough on april 3d 1786 the ardor of the work during these years can be judged of by a single sentence from carolina herschels diary the last night at clay hall was spent in sweeping till daylight and by the next evening the telescope stood ready for observation at slough from 1786 until his death herschel remained at slough his life truly speaking was in his observatory it is indeed true as arago has said in his eloquent tribute to him on peut dire hardiment du jardin et de la petite maison de slough que cest le lieu du monde o il a t fait le plus de dcouvertes le nom de ce village ne prira pas les sciences le transmettront religieusement nos derniers neveux herschels first contribution to the philosophical transactions was printed in the volume for 1780 his last in that for 1818 of these thirtynine volumes there are only two 1813 and 1817 which contain no paper from his hand and many volumes contain more than one as he published no less than sixtyeight memoirs in this place and yet it must not be thought that his was an austere and grave existence music which he loved to enthusiasm was still a delight to him all the more that his devotion was free the glimpses which we get of his life with his friends show him always cheerful ardent and devoted even in his later years he had not lost a boyish earnestness to explain his simplicity and the charm of his manner struck every one herschel you know and everybody knows is one of the most pleasing and wellbred natural characters of the present age says dr burney who had opportunity to know the portrait which is given in the frontispiece must have been painted about this time 1788 and the eager ardent face shows his inner life far better than any words can do even in his scientific writings which everything conspired to render grave and sober the almost poetic nature of his mind shows forth in one of his unpublished notebooks now in the royal societys library i found this entry 640th sweepnovember 28 1786the nebula of orion which i saw by the front view was so glaring and beautiful that i could not think of taking any place of its extent he was quite alone under the perfectly silent sky when this was written and he was at his post simply to make this and other such observations but the sky was beautiful to him and his faithful sister carolina sitting below has preserved for us the words as they dropped from his lips on the 11th of january 1787 herschel discovered two satellites to uranus after he had well assured himself of their existence but before he communicated his discovery to the world he made this crucial test he prepared a sketch of uranus attended by his two satellites as it would appear on the night of february 10 1787 and when the night came the heavens displayed the original of my drawings by showing in the situation i had delineated them the georgian planet attended by two satellites i confess that this scene appeared to me with additional beauty as the little secondary planets seemed to give a dignity to the primary one which raises it into a more conspicuous situation among the great bodies of the solar system in a memoir of 1789 he has a few sentences which show the living way in which the heavens appeared to him this method of viewing the heavens seems to throw them into a new kind of light they are now seen to resemble a luxuriant garden which contains the greatest variety of productions in different flourishing beds and one advantage we may at least reap from it is that we can as it were extend the range of our experience to an immense duration for is it not almost the same thing whether we live successively to witness the germination blooming foliage fecundity fading withering and corruption of a plant or whether a vast number of specimens selected from every stage through which the plant passes in the course of its existence be brought at once to our view the thought here is no less finely expressed than it is profound the simile is perfect if we have the power to separate among the vast variety each state of being from every other and if the very luxuriance of illustration in the heavens does not bewilder and overpower the mind it was precisely this discriminating power that herschel possessed in perfection there is a kind of humor in the way he records a change of opinion i formerly supposed the surface of saturns ring to be rough owing to luminous points like mountains seen on it till one of these was kind enough to venture off the edge of the ring and appear as a satellite in 1782 he replies with a certain concealed sharpness to the idea that he used magnifying powers which were too high there is a tone almost of impatience as if he were conscious he was replying to a criticism based on ignorance we are told that we gain nothing by magnifying too much i grant it but shall never believe i magnify too much till by experience i find that i can see better with a lower power 1782 by 1786 when he returns to this subject in answer to a formal request to explain his use of high magnifiers he is quite over any irritation and treats the subject almost with playfulness soon after my first essay of using high powers with the newtonian telescope i began to doubt whether an opinion which has been entertained by several eminent authors that vision will grow indistinct when the optic pencils are less than the fiftieth part of an inch would hold good in all cases i perceived that according to this criterion i was not entitled to see distinctly with a power of much more than about 320 in a sevenfoot telescope of an aperture of six and fourtenths inches whereas in many experiments i found myself very well pleased with magnifiers which far exceeded such narrow limits this induced me as it were by way of apology to myself for seeing well where i ought to have seen less distinctly to make a few experiments it is needless to say that these experiments proved that from the point of view taken by herschel he was quite right and that his high powers had numerous valuable applications he goes on to say had it not been for a late conversation with some of my highly esteemed and learned friends i might probably have left the papers on which these experiments were recorded among the rest of those that are laid aside when they have afforded me the information i want the last sentence seems to be a kind of notice to his learned friends that there is yet more unsaid as a warning to those to whose criticisms he had replied he gives them this picture of the kind of assiduity which will be required if some of his observations on double stars are to be repeated it is in vain to look for these stars if every circumstance is not favorable the observer as well as the instrument must have been long enough out in the open air to acquire the same temperature in very cold weather an hour at least will be required 1782 we may gain some further insight into his character from the following chance extracts from his writings i have all along had truth and reality in view as the sole object of my endeavors 1782 not being satisfied when i thought it possible to obtain more accurate measures i employed a more delicate apparatus 1783 to this end i have already begun a series of observations upon several zones of double stars and should the result of them be against these conjectures i shall be the first to point out their fallacy 1783 there is a great probability of succeeding still farther in this laborious but delightful research so as to be able at last to say not only how much the annual parallax is not but how much it really is 1782 the nature of his philosophizing and the limits which he set to himself may be more clearly seen in further extracts by taking more time before printing these observations i should undoubtedly be enabled to speak more confidently of the interior construction of the heavens and of its various nebulous and sidereal strata as an apology for this prematurity it may be said that the end of all discoveries being communication we can never be too ready in giving facts and observations whatever we may be in reasoning upon them 1785 in an investigation of this delicate nature we ought to avoid two opposite extremes if we indulge a fanciful imagination and build worlds of our own we must not wonder at our going wide from the path of truth and nature on the other hand if we add observation to observation without attempting to draw not only certain conclusions but also conjectural views from them we offend against the very end for which only observations ought to be made i will endeavor to keep a proper medium but if i should deviate from that i could wish not to fall into the latter error 1785 as observations carefully made should always take the lead of theories i shall not be concerned if what i have to say contradicts what has been said in my last paper on this subject 1790 no course of reasoning could be more simple more exact more profound and more beautiful than this which follows as it has been shown that the spherical figure of a cluster is owing to the action of central powers it follows that those clusters which cteris paribus are the most complete in this figure must have been the longest exposed to the action of these causes thus the maturity of a sidereal system may be judged from the disposition of the component parts hence planetary nebul may be looked on as very aged though we cannot see any individual nebula pass through all its stages of life we can select particular ones in each peculiar stage 1789 there is something almost grandiose and majestic in his statement of the ultimate destiny of the galaxy to him the fates were known of orbs dim hovering on the skirts of space since the stars of the milky way are permanently exposed to the action of a power whereby they are irresistibly drawn into groups we may be certain that from mere clustering stars they will be gradually compressed through successive stages of accumulation till they come up to what may be called the ripening period of the globular form and total insulation from which it is evident that the milky way must be finally broken up and cease to be a stratum of scattered stars the state into which the incessant action of the clustering power has brought it at present is a kind of chronometer that may be used to measure the time of its past and future existence and although we do not know the rate of going of this mysterious chronometer it is nevertheless certain that since the breaking up of the milky way affords a proof that it cannot last forever it equally bears witness that its past duration cannot be admitted to be infinite 1814 herschels relations with his cotemporaries were usually of the most pleasant character though seldom intimate this peace was broken but by one unpleasant occurrence in the philosophical transactions for 1792 schroeter had communicated a series of observations made with one of herschels own telescopes on the atmospheres of venus the moon etc it was not only an account of phenomena which had been seen it was accompanied by measures and the computations based on these led to heights and dimensions for mountains on venus which were to say the least extravagant the adjective will not seem too strong when we say that the very existence of the mountains themselves is today more than doubtful the appearances seen by schroeter were described by him in perfectly good faith and similar ones have been since recorded his reasoning upon them was defective and the measures which he made were practically valueless this paper printed in the transactions of the royal society to which schroeter had not before contributed appears to have irritated herschel no doubt there were not wanting members of his own society who hinted that on the continent too there were to be found great observers and that here at least herschel had been anticipated even in his own field i have always thought that the memoir of herschel which appeared in the next volume of the transactions 1793 observations on the planet venus was a rejoinder intended far more for the detractors at home than for the astronomer abroad the review is conceived in a severe spirit the first idea seems to be to crush an opposition which he feels the truth is established but its establishment is hardly the first object it seems as if herschel had almost allowed himself to be forced into a position of arrogance which his whole life shows was entirely foreign to his nature all through the review he does not once mention schroeters name he says a series of observations on venus begun by me in april 1777 has been continued down to the present time the result of my observations would have been communicated long ago if i had not flattered myself with the hope of some better success concerning the diurnal motion of venus which has still eluded my constant attention as far as concerns its period and direction even at this present time i should hesitate to give the following extracts if it did not seem incumbent on me to examine by what accident i came to overlook mountains in this planet of such enormous height as to exceed four five or even six times the perpendicular height of chimborao the highest of our mountains the same paper contains other particulars concerning venus and saturn all of which being things of which i have never taken any notice it will not be amiss to show by what follows that neither want of attention nor a deficiency of instruments would occasion my not perceiving these mountains of more than twentythree miles in height this jagged border of venus and these flat spherical forms on saturn the reply of schroeter 1795 is temperate and just it does him honor and he generously gives full justice to his critic it would hardly be worth while to mention this slight incident if it were not that during these years there certainly existed a feeling that herschel undervalued the labors of his cotemporaries this impression was fostered no doubt by his general habit of not quoting previous authorities in the fields which he was working a careful reading of his papers will i think show that his definite indebtedness to his cotemporaries was vanishingly small the work of michell and wilson he alludes to again and again and always with appreciation certainly he seems to show a vein of annoyance that the papers of christian mayer de novis in coelo sidereo phnomenis 1779 and beobachtungen von fixsterntrabanten 1778 should have been quoted to prove that the method proposed by herschel in 1782 for ascertaining the parallax of the fixed stars by means of observations of those which were double was not entirely original with himself there is direct proof that it was so22 and if this was not forthcoming it would be unnecessary as he has amply shown in his catalogue of double stars one is reminded of his remarks on the use of the high magnifying powers by the impatience of his comments his proposal to call the newly discovered minor planets asteroids 1802 was received as a sign that he wished to discriminate between the discoveries of piazzi and olbers and his own discovery of uranus23 he takes pains to quietly put this on one side in one of his papers showing that he was cognizant of the existence of such a feeling i am tempted to resurrect from a deserved obscurity a notice of herschels observations on the two lately discovered celestial bodies philosophical transactions 1802 printed in the first volume of the edinburgh review simply to show the kind of envy to which even he the glory of england was subject the reviewer sets forth the principal results of herschels observations and after quoting his definition of the new term asteroid goes on to say if a new name must be found why not call them by some appellation which shall in some degree be descriptive of or at least consistent with their properties why not for instance call them concentric comets or planetary comets or cometary planets or if a single term must be found why may we not coin such a phrase as planetoid or cometoid then follows a general arraignment of herschels methods of expression and thought as distinguished from his powers of mere observation this distinction it may be said exists only in the reviewers mind there was no such distinction in fact if ever a series of observations was directed by profound and reasonable thought it was herschels own dr herschels passion for coining words and idioms has often struck us as a weakness wholly unworthy of him the invention of a name is but a poor achievement for him who has discovered whole worlds why for instance do we hear him talking of the spacepenetrating power of his instrumenta compound epithet and metaphor which he ought to have left to the poets who in some future age shall acquire glory by celebrating his name the other papers of dr herschel in the late volumes of the transactions do not deserve such particular attention his catalogue of 500 new nebul though extremely valuable to the practical astronomer leads to no general conclusions of importance and abounds with the defects which are peculiar to the doctors writingsa great prolixity and tediousness of narrationloose and often unphilosophical reflections which give no very favorable idea of his scientific powers however great his merit may be as an observerabove all that idle fondness for inventing names without any manner of occasion to which we have already alluded and a use of novel and affected idioms to the speculations of the doctor on the nature of the sun we have many similar objections but they are all eclipsed by the grand absurdity which he has there committed in his hasty and erroneous theory concerning the influence of the solar spots on the price of grain since the publication of gullivers voyage to laputa nothing so ridiculous has ever been offered to the world we heartily wish the doctor had suppressed it or if determined to publish it that he had detailed it in language less confident and flippant one is almost ashamed to give space and currency to a forgotten attack but it yields a kind of perspective and it is instructive and perhaps useful to view herschels labors from all sides even from wrong and envious ones the study of the original papers together with a knowledge of the circumstances in which they were written will abundantly show that herschels ideas sprung from a profound meditation of the nature of things in themselves what the origin of trains of thought prosecuted for years may have been we cannot say nor could he himself have expressed it a new path in science was to be found out and he found it it was not in his closet surrounded by authorities but under the open sky that he meditated the construction of the heavens as he says my situation permitted me not to consult large libraries nor indeed was it very material for as i intended to view the heavens myself nature that great volume appeared to me to contain the best catalogue his remarkable memoirs on the invisible and other rays of the solar spectrum were received with doubt and with open denial by many of the scientific bodies of europe the reviews and notices of his work in this direction were often quite beyond the bounds of a proper scientific criticism but herschel maintained a dignified silence the discoveries were true the proofs were open to all and no response was needed from him he may have been sorely tempted to reply but i am apt to believe that the rumors that reached him from abroad and at home did not then affect him as they might have done earlier he was at his grand climacteric he had passed his sixtythird year his temper was less hasty than it had been in his youth and his nerves had not yet received the severe strain from whose effects he suffered during the last years of his life we have some glimpses of his personal life in the reminiscences of him in the diary and letters of madame darblay who knew him well 1786in the evening mr herschel came to tea i had once seen that very extraordinary man at mrs de lucs but was happy to see him again for he has not more fame to awaken curiosity than sense and modesty to gratify it he is perfectly unassuming yet openly happy and happy in the success of those studies which would render a mind less excellently formed presumptuous and arrogant the king has not a happier subject than this man who owes it wholly to his majesty that he is not wretched for such was his eagerness to quit all other pursuits to follow astronomy solely that he was in danger of ruin when his talents and great and uncommon genius attracted the kings patronage he has now not only his pension which gives him the felicity of devoting all his time to his darling study but he is indulged in license from the king to make a telescope according to his new ideas and discoveries that is to have no cost spared in its construction and is wholly to be paid for by his majesty this seems to have made him happier even than the pension as it enables him to put in execution all his wonderful projects from which his expectations of future discoveries are so sanguine as to make his present existence a state of almost perfect enjoyment mr locke himself would be quite charmed with him he seems a man without a wish that has its object in the terrestrial globe at night mr herschel by the kings command came to exhibit to his majesty and the royal family the new comet lately discovered by his sister miss herschel and while i was playing at piquet with mrs schwellenburg the princess augusta came into the room and asked her if she chose to go into the garden and look at it she declined the offer and the princess then made it to me i was glad to accept it for all sorts of reasons we found him at his telescope the comet was very small and had nothing grand or striking in its appearance but it is the first ladys comet and i was very desirous to see it mr herschel then showed me some of his new discovered universes with all the good humor with which he would have taken the same trouble for a brother or a sister astronomer there is no possibility of admiring his genius more than his gentleness 1786 december 30ththis morning my dear father carried me to dr herschel that great and very extraordinary man received us almost with open arms he is very fond of my father who is one of the council of the royal society this year as well as himself at this time of day there was nothing to see but his instruments those however are curiosities sufficient i wished very much to have seen his sister but she had been up all night and was then in bed 1787 septemberdr herschel is a delightful man so unassuming with his great knowledge so willing to dispense it to the ignorant and so cheerful and easy in his general manners that were he no genius it would be impossible not to remark him as a pleasing and sensible man 1788 october 3dwe returned to windsor at noon and mrs de luc sent me a most pressing invitation to tea and to hear a little music two young ladies were to perform at her house in a little concert dr herschel was there and accompanied them very sweetly on the violin his newmarried wife was with him and his sister his wife seems goodnatured she was rich too and astronomers are as able as other men to discern that gold can glitter as well as stars dr burney to madame darblay chelsea college september 28 1798 i drove through slough in order to ask at dr herschels door when my visit would be least inconvenient to himthat night or next morning the good soul was at dinner but came to the door himself to press me to alight immediately and partake of his family repast and this he did so heartily that i could not resist i expected not knowing that herschel was married only to have found miss herschel but there was a very old lady the mother i believe of mrs herschel who was at the head of the table herself and a scots lady a miss wilson daughter of dr wilson of glasgow an eminent astronomer miss herschel and a little boy they rejoiced at the accident which had brought me there and hoped i would send my carriage away and take a bed with them they were sorry they had no stables for my horses we soon grew acquaintedi mean the ladies and iand before dinner was over we seemed old friends just met after a long absence mrs herschel is sensible goodhumored unpretending and well bred miss herschel all shyness and virgin modesty the scots lady sensible and harmless and the little boy entertaining promising and comical herschel you know and everybody knows is one of the most pleasing and wellbred natural characters of the present age as well as the greatest astronomer your health was drunk after dinner put that into your pocket and after much social conversation and a few hearty laughs the ladies proposed to take a walk in order i believe to leave herschel and me together we walked and talked round his great telescopes till it grew damp and dusk then retreated into his study to philosophize he made a discovery to me which had i known it sooner would have overset me and prevented my reading any part of my work24 he said that he had almost always had an aversion to poetry which he regarded as the arrangement of fine words without any useful meaning or adherence to truth but that when truth and science were united to these fine words he liked poetry very well 1798 december 10 dr burney to madame darblay herschel has been in town for short spurts and back again two or three times leaving mrs herschel behind in town to transact law business i had him here two whole days the reading of the manuscript of the poetical history of astronomy was continued and herschel was so humble as to confess that i knew more of the history of astronomy than he did and had surprised him with the mass of information i had got together he thanked me for the entertainment and instruction i had given him can anything be grander and all this before he knows a word of what i have said of himselfall his discoveries as you may remember being kept back for the twelfth and last book dr burney to madame darblay slough monday morning july 22 1799 in bed at dr herschels halfpast five where i can neither sleep nor lie idle my dear fannyi believe i told you on friday that i was going to finish the perusal of my astronomical verses to the great astronomer on saturday after tea dr herschel proposed that we two should retire into a quiet room in order to resume the perusal of my work in which no progress has been made since last december the evening was finished very cheerfully and we went to our bowers not much out of humor with each other or the world after dinner we all agreed to go to the terrace at windsormr mrs and miss h with their nice little boy and three young ladies here i met with almost everybody i wished and expected to see previous to the kings arrival but now here comes will and i must get up and make myself up to go down to the perusal of my last book entitled herschel so goodmorrow chelsea tuesday not a moment could i get to write till now i must tell you that herschel proposed to me to go with him to the kings concert at night he having permission to go when he chooses his five nephews griesbachs making a principal part of the band and says he i know you will be welcome an intimacy was gradually established between herschel and dr burney they saw each other often at the meetings of the royal society and herschel frequently stayed at the doctors house on the first evening herschel spent at chelsea when i called for my argand lamp herschel who had not seen one of those lamps was surprised at the great effusion of light and immediately calculated the difference between that and a single candle and found it sixteen to one25 in 1793 we find herschel as a witness for his friend james watt in the celebrated case of watt vs bull which was tried in the court of common pleas and from muirheads life of watt it appears that herschel visited watt at heathfield in 1810 a delightful picture of the old age of herschel is given by the poet campbell26 whose nature was fitted to perceive the beauties of a grand and simple character like herschels brighton september 15 1813 i wish you had been with me the day before yesterday when you would have joined me i am sure deeply in admiring a great simple good old mandr herschel do not think me vain or at least put up with my vanity in saying that i almost flatter myself i have made him my friend i have got an invitation and a pressing one to go to his house and the lady who introduced me to him says he spoke of me as if he would really be happy to see me i spent all sunday with him and his family his son is a prodigy in sciences and fond of poetry but very unassuming now for the old astronomer himself his simplicity his kindness his anecdotes his readiness to explainand make perfectly conspicuous toohis own sublime conceptions of the universe are indescribably charming he is seventysix but fresh and stout and there he sat nearest the door at his friends house alternately smiling at a joke or contentedly sitting without share or notice in the conversation any train of conversation he follows implicitly anything you ask he labors with a sort of boyish earnestness to explain i was anxious to get from him as many particulars as i could about his interview with buonaparte27 the latter it was reported had astonished him by his astronomical knowledge no he said the first consul did surprise me by his quickness and versatility on all subjects but in science he seemed to know little more than any welleducated gentleman and of astronomy much less for instance than our own king his general air he said was something like affecting to know more than he did know he was high and tried to be great with herschel i suppose without success and i remarked said the astronomer his hypocrisy in concluding the conversation on astronomy by observing how all these glorious views gave proofs of an almighty wisdom i asked him if he thought the system of laplace to be quite certain with regard to the total security of the planetary system from the effects of gravitation losing its present balance he said no he thought by no means that the universe was secured from the chance of sudden losses of parts he was convinced that there had existed a planet between mars and jupiter in our own system of which the little asteroids or planetkins lately discovered are indubitably fragments and remember said he that though they have discovered only four of those parts there will be thousandsperhaps thirty thousand moreyet discovered this planet he believed to have been lost by explosion with great kindness and patience he referred me in the course of my attempts to talk with him to a theorem in newtons principles of natural philosophy in which the time that the light takes to travel from the sun is proved with a simplicity which requires but a few steps in reasoning in talking of some inconceivably distant bodies he introduced the mention of this plain theorem to remind me that the progress of light could be measured in the one case as well as the other then speaking of himself he said with a modesty of manner which quite overcame me when taken together with the greatness of the assertion i have looked further into space than ever human being did before me i have observed stars of which the light it can be proved must take two millions of years to reach this earth i really and unfeignedly felt at this moment as if i had been conversing with a supernatural intelligence nay more said he if those distant bodies had ceased to exist two millions of years ago we should still see them as the light would travel after the body was gone these were herschels words and if you had heard him speak them you would not think he was apt to tell more than the truth after leaving herschel i felt elevated and overcome and have in writing to you made only this memorandum of some of the most interesting moments of my life campbells conscientious biographer appears to have felt that the value of this charming account of his interview with herschel was in its report of astronomical facts and opinions and he adds a footnote to explain that herschels opinion never amounted to more than hypothesis having some degree of probability sir john herschel remembers his father saying if that hypothesis were true and if the planet destroyed were as large as the earth there must have been at least thirtythousand such fragments but always as an hypothesishe was never heard to declare any degree of conviction that it was so for us the value of this sympathetic account of a day in herschels life is in its conception of the simplicity the modesty the boyish earnestness the elevation of thought and speech of the old philosopher and in the impression made on the feelings not the mind of the poet then thirtyfive years old in a letter to alison campbell reverts with great pleasure to the day spent with herschel sydenham december 12 1813 my dearest alison i spent three weeks with my family at brighton in charming weather and was much pleased with as well as benefited by the place there i met a man with whom you will stare at the idea of my being congenial or having the vanity to think myself sothe great herschel he is a simple great being i once in my life looked at newtons principia and attended an astronomical class at glasgow wonderful it seemed to myself that the great man condescended to understand my questions to become apparently earnest in communicating to me as much information as my limited capacity and preparation for such knowledge would admit he invited me to see him at his own abode and so kindly that i could not believe that it was mere good breeding but a sincere wish to see me again i had a full day with him he described to me his whole interview with buonaparte said it was not true as reported that buonaparte understood astronomical subjects deeply but affected more than he knew in speaking of his great and chief telescope he said with an air not of the least pride but with a greatness and simplicity of expression that struck me with wonder i have looked further into space than ever human being did before me i have observed stars of which the light takes two millions of years to travel to this globe i mean to pay him a reverential visit at slough as soon as my book is out this winter in 1807 carolina herschel has this entry in her diary october 4my brother came from brighton the same night two parties from the castle came to see the comet and during the whole month my brother had not an evening to himself as he was then in the midst of polishing the fortyfoot mirror rest became absolutely necessary after a day spent in that most laborious work and it has ever been my opinion that on the 14th of october his nerves received a shock of which he never got the better afterwards in the spring of 1808 he was quite seriously ill but in may the observing went on again in 1809 and 1810 his principal investigations were upon physical subjects newtons rings and in 1811 the only long series of observations was upon the comet of that year after 1811 the state of herschels health required that his observations should be much less frequent much of the time after 1811 he was absent and his work at home consisted largely in arranging the results of his previous labors and in computations connected with them all through the years 1814 to 1822 herschels health was very feeble the severe winter of 181314 had told materially upon him in 1814 however he undertook to repolish the fortyfoot mirror but was obliged to give it over he now found it necessary to make frequent little excursions for change of air and scene his faithful sister remained at home bringing order into the masses of manuscript and copying the papers for the royal society she was sick at heart fearing that each time she saw her brother it would be the last in 1818 she says feb 11 i went to my brother and remained with him till the 23d we spent our time though not in idleness in sorrow and sadness he is not only unwell but low in spirits in 1818 december 16 herschel went to london to have his portrait painted by artaud while he was in london his will was made28 in 1819 there is a glimmer of the oldtime light in a note herschel says linathere is a great comet i want you to assist me come to dine and spend the day here if you can come soon after one oclock we shall have time to prepare maps and telescopes i saw its situation last night it has a long tail july 4 1819 this note has been carefully kept by his sister and on it she has written i keep this as a relic every line now traced by the hand of my dear brother becomes a treasure to me so the next three years passed away sir william29 was daily more and more feeble he spent his time in putting his works in order but could devote only a few moments each day to this his sister says aug 11th 12th 13th and 14th 1822 i went as usual to spend some hours of the forenoon with my brother aug 15thi hastened to the spot where i was wont to find him with the newspaper which i was to read to him but instead i found mrs monson miss baldwin and mr bulman from leeds the grandson of my brothers earliest acquaintance in this country i was informed my brother had been obliged to return to his room whither i flew immediately lady h and the housekeeper were with him administering everything which could be thought of for supporting him i found him much irritated at not being able to grant mr bulmans request for some token of remembrance for his father as soon as he saw me i was sent to the library to fetch one of his last papers and a plate of the fortyfoot telescope but for the universe i could not have looked twice at what i had snatched from the shelf and when he faintly asked if the breaking up of the milky way was in it i said yes and he looked content i cannot help remembering this circumstance it was the last time i was sent to the library on such an occasion that the anxious care for his papers and workrooms never ended but with his life was proved by his frequent whispered inquiries if they were locked and the key safe of which i took care to assure him that they were and the key in lady herschels hands after half an hours vain attempt to support himself my brother was obliged to consent to be put to bed leaving no hope ever to see him rise again on the 25th of august 1822 herschel died peacefully at the age of eightyfour years his remains lie in the little church at upton near windsor where a memorial tablet has been erected by his son the epitaph is as follows30 h s e gulielmus herschel eques guelphicus hanovi natus

slough walking with his father he asked him what was the oldest of all things the father replied after the socratic manner and what do you suppose is the oldest of all things the boy was not

222 chapter iv review of the scientific labors of william herschel in this chapter i shall endeavor to give such explanations as will enable the general reader to follow the course of discovery in each branch of astronomy and physics regularly through the period of herschels life and up to the state in which he left it a more detailed and precise account which should appeal directly to the professional astronomer will not be needed since arago has already fulfilled this want in his analyse de la vie et des travaux de sir william herschel published in 1842 the few misconceptions there contained will be easily corrected by those to whom alone they are of consequence the latter class of readers may also consult the abstracts of herschels memoirs which have been given in a subjectindex and a synopsis of the scientific writings of sir william herschel prepared by dr hastings and myself and published by the smithsonian institution an accurate sketch of the state of astronomy in england and on the continent in the years 17801820 need not be given it will be enough if we remember that of the chief observatories of europe public and private no one was actively devoted to such labors as were undertaken by herschel at the very beginning of his career his observations on variable stars indeed were in the same line as those of pigott flaugergues and darquier in france had perhaps preceded him in minute scrutiny of the suns surface etc but even in that department of observation he at once put an immense distance between himself and others by the rapid and extraordinary advances in the size and in the excellence of his telescopes before his time the principal aids to observation were the gregorian and newtonian telescopes of short and the small achromatics of dollond31 we have seen in what goes before how his patient zeal had succeeded in improving upon these there was no delay and no rest steadily the art of making reflectors was urged forward until he had finally in his hands the fortyfoot telescope it must be admitted that this was the limit to which the manufacture of powerful telescopes could be pushed in his generation the optical and mechanical difficulties which prevented a farther advance required time for their solution and indeed some of these difficulties are scarcely solved at this day it may fairly be said that no reflector larger than three feet in aperture has yet realized our expectations the improvement of telescopes and optical apparatus it will be of interest to give in this place some connected account of the large fortyfoot reflector of four feet aperture made by herschel its history extends from 1785 to 1811 its manufacture was considered by his cotemporaries as his greatest triumph as a machine it was extremely ingenious in all its parts as may be seen from the elaborate description and plates of it published in the philosophical transactions for 1795 one of its mirrors certainly had good definition for by means of it the two small satellites of saturn mimas and enceladus were discovered and these discoveries alone would make it famous perhaps more was expected of it by the public in general than it absolutely performed its merits were after a while decried and herschel even felt obliged to state why he did not always employ it in his observations his reasons were perfectly valid and such as any one may understand the time required to get so large a machine into working order was a serious tax it required more assistants than his twentyfoot telescope and he says i have made it a rule never to employ a larger telescope when a smaller will answer the purpose it still remains as a remarkable feat of engineering and an example of great optical and mechanical skill it led the way to the large reflectors of lord rosse some sixty years later and several of the fortyfoot telescopes of the present day even have done less useful work its great feat however was to have added two satellites to the solar system from the published accounts of it the following is taken when i resided at bath i had long been acquainted with the theory of optics and mechanics and wanted only that experience so necessary in the practical part of these sciences this i acquired by degrees at that place where in my leisure hours by way of amusement i made several twofoot fivefoot sevenfoot tenfoot and twentyfoot newtonian telescopes beside others of the gregorian form of eight twelve and eighteen inches and two three five and ten feet focal length in this way i made not less than two hundred sevenfoot one hundred and fifty tenfoot and about eighty twentyfoot mirrors not to mention the gregorian telescopes32 the number of stands i invented for these telescopes it would not be easy to assign in 1781 i began to construct a thirtyfoot arial reflector and having made a stand for it i cast the mirror thirtysix inches in diameter this was cracked in cooling i cast it a second time and the furnace i had built in my house broke soon after the georgian planet was discovered and this interrupted the work for a time in the year 1783 i finished a very good twentyfoot reflector with a large aperture and mounted it upon the plan of my present telescope after two years observation with it the great advantage of such apertures appeared so clearly to me that i recurred to my former intention of increasing them still further and being now sufficiently provided with experience in the work which i wished to undertake the president of the royal society who is always ready to promote useful undertakings had the goodness to lay my design before the king his majesty was graciously pleased to approve of it and with his usual liberality to support it with his royal bounty in consequence of this arrangement i began to construct the fortyfoot telescope about the latter end of 178533 the woodwork of the stand and machines for giving the required motions to the instrument were immediately put in hand in the whole of the apparatus none but common workmen were employed for i made drawings of every part of it by which it was easy to execute the work as i constantly inspected and directed every persons labor though sometimes there were not less than forty different workmen employed at the same time while the stand of the telescope was preparing i also began the construction of the great mirror of which i inspected the casting grinding and polishing and the work was in this manner carried on with no other interruption than that occasioned by the removal of all the apparatus and materials from where i then lived to my present situation at slough here soon after my arrival i began to lay the foundation upon which by degrees the whole structure was raised as it now stands and the speculum being highly polished and put into the tube i had the first view through it on february 19 1787 i do not however date the completing of the instrument till much later for the first speculum by a mismanagement of the person who cast it came out thinner on the centre of the back than was intended and on account of its weakness would not permit a good figure to be given to it a second mirror was cast january 26 1788 but it cracked in cooling february 16 we recast it and it proved to be of a proper degree of strength october 24 it was brought to a pretty good figure and polish and i observed the planet saturn with it but not being satisfied i continued to work upon it till august 27 1789 when it was tried upon the fixed stars and i found it to give a pretty sharp image large stars were a little affected with scattered light owing to many remaining scratches on the mirror august the 28th 1789 having brought the telescope to the parallel of saturn i discovered a sixth satellite of that planet and also saw the spots upon saturn better than i had ever seen them before so that i may date the finishing of the fortyfoot telescope from that time another satellite of saturn was discovered with the fortyfoot on the 17th of september 1789 it was used for various observations so late as 1811 on january 19 of that year herschel observed the nebula of orion with it this was one of his last observations the final disposition of the telescope is told in the following extract from a letter of sir john herschels to mr weld secretary of the royal society collingwood march 13 1847 in reply to your queries respecting the fortyfoot reflecting telescope constructed by my father i have to state that king george iii munificently defrayed the entire cost of that instrument including of course all preparatory cost in the nature of construction of tools and of the apparatus for casting grinding and figuring the reflectors of which two were constructed at a total cost of 4000 the woodwork of the telescope being so far decayed as to be dangerous in the year 1839 i pulled it down and piers were erected on which the tube was placed that being of iron and so well preserved that although not more than onetwentieth of an inch thick when in the horizontal position it sustained within it all my family and continues to sustain inclosed within it to this day not only the heavier of the two reflectors but also all the more important portions of the machinery the mirror and the rest of the polishing apparatus are on the premises the iron grinding tools and polishers are placed underneath the tube let into the ground and level with the surface of the gravelled area in which it stands the closing of the tube was done with appropriate ceremony on newyearsday 1840 when after a procession through it by the family at slough a poem written by sir john was read the machinery put into its present position and the tube sealed the memoir on the fortyfoot telescope shows throughout that herschels prime object was not the making of the telescope itself but that his mind was constantly directed towards the uses to which it was to be puttowards the questions which he wished it to answer again and again in his various papers he returns to the question of the limit of vision as bessel has said the naked eye has its limit of vision in the stars of the sixth magnitude the light of fainter stars than these does not affect the retina enough for them to be seen a very small telescope penetrates to smaller and in general without doubt to more distant stars a more powerful one penetrates deeper into space and as its power is increased so the boundaries of the visible universe are widened and the number of stars increased to millions and millions whoever has followed the history of the series of herschels telescopes will have observed this but herschel was not content with the bare fact but strove ever to know how far a telescope of a certain construction and size could penetrate compared with the naked and unassisted eye these investigations were never for the discovery of new facts concerning the working of his instruments it was for the knowledge of the distribution of the fixed stars in space itself that he strove herschels instruments were designed to aid vision to the last extent they were only secondarily for the taking of measures his efforts were not for a knowledge of the motions but of the constitution and construction of the heavenly bodies besides the stands for his telescopes which were both ingenious and convenient herschel devised many forms of apparatus for facilitating the art of observation his micrometers for measuring position angles his lamp micrometer the method of limiting apertures and the methods he used for viewing the sun may be mentioned among these points in practical astronomy are considered all through the years of observation a reference to his original papers will show how numerous how varied and how valuable these are i cannot forbear quoting here the account of a precaution observed during his examination of the belts on saturn 1794 it is the most striking example of how fully herschel realized that the eye of the observer is a material part of the optical apparatus of astronomy simple as this principle may appear it was an absolute novelty in his day in making these observations he says i took care to bend my head so as to receive the picture of the belt in the same direction as i did formerly this was a precaution that occurred to me as there was a possibility that the vertical diameter of the retina might be more or less sensitive than the horizontal one astronomers will recognize in this the first suggestion of the processes which have led to important results in the hands of dr otto struve and others in the comparison of the measures of double stars by different observers each of whom has a personal habit of observation which if not corrected may affect his results in the way which herschel was striving to avoid researches on the relative brightness of the stars variable stars no research of herschels was more laborious than the elaborate classification of the stars according to their comparative brightness which he executed during the years 1796 to 1799 it was directly in the line of his main workto find out the construction of the heavens his first paper had been upon the variable star mira ceti here was a sun shining by its native brightness which waxed and waned like the moon itself this star is periodic it is for a long period invisible to the unassisted eye then it can just be seen and increases in brightness for a little over a month and attains a maximum brilliancy from this it decreases for nearly three months and after becoming invisible remains so for five or six months its whole period is about 333 days are all other stars constant in brightness the example of mira ceti and of other known variables makes this at least doubtful but the sun itself may vary for all that we know it is a simple star like the rest this question of variability in general is an important one then it can only be tested by making accurate catalogues of the relative brilliance of stars at various times and by comparing these no such general catalogue existed before herschels time and led by the discrepancies in isolated cases which he found between his own estimates and those of his predecessors he made from observation a series of four catalogues in which were set down the order of sequence of the stars of each constellation the method adopted by herschel was perfectly simple in principle though most laborious in practice suppose any number of stars a b c d e etc near enough to each other to be well compared the process consists simply in writing down the names of the stars a b c etc in the order of their relative brightness thus if for a group of eight stars we have found at one epoch a b c d e f g h and if at another time the order was a b c d f e g h symptoms of variability are pointed out repeated observations where the same star is found in different sequences will decide the question thus for the stars visible to the naked eye we know exactly the state of the sky in herschels day now nearly a century ago any material change cannot escape us these catalogues have been singularly overlooked by the observers of our generation who have followed this branch of observation and it was not till 1876 that they received proper attention and a suitable reduction at the hands of mr c s pierce we owe to herschel the first trustworthy account of the stars visible to the naked eye and since the date of his labors about 1800 we have similar views published by argelander 1839 heis 1848 argelander and schnfeld 1857 gould 1860 and 1872 and houzeau 1875 thus his labors have been well followed up in the prosecution of this work herschel found stars whose light was progressively diminishing others which regularly increased one star whose light periodically varies alpha herculis and at least one star 55 herculis which has utterly disappeared on october 10 1781 and april 11 1782 he observed this latter star but in may 1791 it had totally vanished there was no trace remaining the discovery of the variability of alpha herculis was a more important one than would at first sight appear up to that time the only variable stars known were seven in number their periods were four hundred and ninetyfour four hundred and four three hundred and thirtyfour seven six five and three days these periods seemed to fall into two groups one of from three hundred to five hundred days the other comparatively much shorter of three to seven days alpha herculis came to occupy the middle place between these groups its period being about sixty days the cause of these strange and regular variations of brightness was supposed by herschel to be the rotation of the star bodily on an axis by which revolution different parts of its surface of different brilliancy were successively and periodically presented to us this explanation it might have been difficult to receive when the periods of the known variables were so markedly various in length his own discovery came to bridge over the interval and quite confirmed him in his belief he returned to the subject of the revolution of stars about their axes again and again and connected it with the revolution of satellites he found that the satellites of jupiter and one of saturns periodically changed in brightness and by quite simple means showed that their periods of rotation were at least approximately the same as their periods of revolution about their primaries in this case as in every other he considered a discovery in each and every one of its possible bearings there are no instances where he has singularly overlooked the consequences of his observations researches on double stars the double stars were the subject of herschels earliest and of his latest papers in 1782 he published his catalogue of double stars and his last published memoir 1822 was on the same subject the question of determining the parallax of stars first brought herschel to the discovery of double stars if two stars a and b appear very close together and if in reality the star b is very many times more distant from the earth than a although seen along the same line of sight then the revolution of the earth in its orbit will produce changes in the relative situation of a and b and in fact b will describe a small orbit about a due to this revolution this idea had been proposed by galileo and measures on this plan had been made by long with negative results but herschel in reviewing their work declares that the stars chosen by long were not suitable to the purpose it is necessary among other things to the success of this method that it should be certain that the star b is really very much more distant than the star a the only general test of the distance of stars is their brilliancy and herschel decided to use only stars for this research which had two components very greatly different in brightness a must be very bright and presumably near to us and b must be very close to a and very faint and thus presumably very distant it was in the search for such pairs of stars that the catalogue of double stars 1782 was formed herschels first idea of a double star made such pairs as he found to consist of two stars accidentally near to each other a was near to us and appeared projected in a certain place on the celestial sphere b was many times more distant but by chance was seen along the same line and made with a an optical double if the two stars were at the same distance from the earth if they made part of the same physical system if one revolved around the other then this method of gaining a knowledge of their distance failed even in his first memoir on the subject a surmise that this latter state might occur in some cases was expressed by herschel the notes on some of the pairs declare that a motion of one of them was suspected but this motion might be truly orbitalof one star about the other as a centreor it might simply be that one star was moving by its own proper motion and leaving the other behind it was best to wait and see the first catalogue of double stars contained two hundred and three instances of such associations these were observed from time to time and new pairs discovered the paper of michell an inquiry into the probable parallax and magnitude of the fixed stars from the quantity of light which they afford and the particular circumstances of their situation 1767 was read and pondered by 1802 herschel had become certain that there existed in the heavens real pairs of stars both at the same distance from the earth which were physically connected with each other the arguments of michell have been applied by bessel to the case of one of herschels double stars in much the same order in which the argument ran in herschels own mind as follows the star castor alpha geminorum is a double star where a is of the second and b of the fourth magnitude to the naked eye these two appear as one star with a telescope this is seen to be two stars some 5 apart in the whole sky there are not above fifty such stars as the brighter of the two and about four hundred of the brilliancy of b these fifty and four hundred stars are scattered over the vault of heaven almost at random no law has yet been traced by which we can say that here or here there shall be a bright star like a or a fainter one like b in general the distribution appears to be fortuitous how then can we account for one of the four hundred stars like b placed so close to one of the fifty like a the chances are over four hundred thousand to one that the association in position is not accidental this argument becomes overwhelming when the same association is found in many other cases there were two hundred and three doubles in the catalogue of 1782 alone and many thousands are now known by a process like this herschel reached his grand discovery of true binary systems where one sun revolves about another for he saw that if the two stars are near together in space they could not stand still in face of each other but that they must revolve in true orbits here was the discovery which came to take the place of the detection of the parallaxes of the fixed stars he had failed in one research but he was led to grand conclusions was the force that these distant pairs of suns obeyed the force of gravitation this he could not settle but his successors have done so it was not till about 1827 that savary of the paris observatory showed that one of herschels doubles was subjected to the law of gravitation and thus extended the power of this law from our system to the universe at large herschel himself lived to see some of his double stars perform half a revolution of herschels discoveries arago thinks this has le plus davenir it may well be so the laws which govern our solar system have been extended through his researches to regions of unknown distance the binary stars will afford the largest field for research into the laws which govern them and together with the clusters and groups they will give a firm basis by which to study the distribution of stars in general since here we have the great advantage of knowing if not the real distance of the two stars from the earth at least that this distance is alike for both researches on planets and satellites after herschels first publication on the mountains of the moon 1780 our satellite appears to have occupied him but little the observation of volcanoes 1787 and of a lunar eclipse are his only published ones the planets mercury venus mars and jupiter although they were often studied were not the subjects of his more important memoirs the planet saturn on the contrary seems never to have been lost sight of from the time of his first view of it in 1772 the field of discovery always appears to be completely occupied until the advent of a great man who even by his way of putting old and familiar facts shows the paths along which discoveries must come if at all this faculty comes from profound reflection on the nature of the subject itself from a sort of transmuting power which changes the words of the books into the things of reality herschels paper on saturn in 1790 is an admirable example of this herschels observations on saturn began in 1772 from 1790 to 1808 he published six memoirs on the figure the ring and the satellites of this planet the spheroidal shape of the ball was first discovered by him and we owe much of our certain knowledge of the constitution of the rings to his work the sixth and seventh satellites mimas and enceladus were discovered by him in 1789 the periods of rotation of the ball and of the ring were also fixed in his conclusions as to the real figure of the rings there is a degree of scientific caution which is truly remarkable and which today seems almost excessive in his paper of 1792 herschel shows that the most distant satellite of saturnjapetusturns once on its axis in each revolution about its primary just as our moon does he says of this i cannot help reflecting with some pleasure on the discovery of an analogy which shows that a certain uniform plan is carried on among the secondary planets of our solar system and we may conjecture that probably most of the satellites are governed by the same law especially if it be founded on such a construction of their figure as makes them more ponderous towards their primary planets i believe the last suggestion to have been the first statement of the possible arrangement of matter in satellites which was afterwards so forcibly maintained by hansen in his theory of the moon hansens researches show the consequences of such an arrangement although they do not prove its existence it should be recorded that the explanation which is today received of the belts and bands upon jupiter is i believe first found in herschels memoir on venus 1793 his memoir of 1797 on the changeable brightness of the satellites of jupiter has already been referred to the times of the rotation of the satellites on their axes was first determined by herschel from these observations which also contain accounts of the curious and as yet unexplained phenomena attending their appearances on the disc of the planet herschel discovered in january 1787 the two brighter satellites of uranus now called oberon and titania they are among the faintest objects in the solar system a later discussion of all his observations led him to the belief that there were four more and he gives his observations and computations in full he says that of the existence of additional satellites he has no doubt of these four three were exterior to the most distant satellite oberon the other was interior to titania it was not until 1834 that even oberon and titania were again observed by sir john herschel with a telescope of twenty feet similar to that which had discovered them and not until 1847 was the true state of this system known when mr lassell discovered ariel and umbriel two satellites interior to titania neither of which was herschels interior satellite in 1848 and later years mr lassell by the aid of telescopes constructed by himself fully settled the fact that only four satellites of this planet existed in 1874 i examined the observations of herschel on his supposed interior satellite thinking that it might be possible that among the very few glimpses of it which he recorded some might have belonged to ariel and some to umbriel and that by combining rare and almost accidental observations of two satellites which really existed he had come to announce the existence of an interior satellite which had no existence in fact such i believe to be the case in 1801 april 17 herschel describes an interior satellite in the position angle 189 distant 18 from the planet at that instant umbriel one of mr lassells satellites was in the position 191 and distant 21 from uranus in the most favorable position for seeing it the observation of 1794 march 27 may belong to ariel at the best the investigation is of passing interest only and has nothing to do with the question of the discovery of the satellites herschel discovered the two brighter ones and it was only sixty years later that they were properly reobserved by mr lassell who has the great honor of having added as many more and who first settled the vexed question of satellites exterior to oberon and this with a reflecting telescope made by himself which is unequalled by any other of its dimensions researches on the nature of the sun in the introduction to his paper on the nature and construction of the sun and fixed stars 1795 herschel recounts what was known of the nature of the sun at that time newton had shown that it was the centre of the system galileo and his successors had determined its rotation the place of its equator its real diameter magnitude density distance and the force of gravity on its surface he says i should not wonder if considering all this we were induced to think that nothing remained to be added and yet we are still very ignorant in regard to the internal construction of the sun the spots have been supposed to be solid bodies the smoke of volcanoes the scum floating on an ocean of fluid matter clouds opaque masses and to be many other things the sun itself has been called a globe of fire though perhaps metaphorically it is time now to profit by the observations we are in possession of i have availed myself of the labors of preceding astronomers but have been induced thereto by my own actual observation of the solar phenomena herschel then refers to the theories advanced by his friend prof wilson of glasgow in 1774 wilson maintained that the spots were depressions below the suns atmosphere vast hollows as it were at the bases of which the true surface of the sun could be seen the essence of his theory was the existence of two different kinds of matter in the sun one solid and nonluminousthe nucleusthe other gaseous and incandescentthe atmosphere vacant places in the atmosphere however caused would show the black surface of the solid mass below these were the spots no explanation could be given of the facul bright streaks which appear on the suns surface from time to time but his theory accounted for the existence of the black nuclei of the spots and for the existence of the penumbr about these the penumbra of a spot was formed by the thinner parts of the atmosphere about the vacancy which surrounded the nucleus this theory of wilsons was adopted by herschel as a basis for his own and he brought numerous observations to confirm it in the modified shape which he gave to it according to herschel the sun consisted of three essentially different parts first there was a solid nucleus nonluminous cool and even capable of being inhabited second above this was an atmosphere proper and lastly outside of this was a layer in which floated the clouds or bodies which gave to the solar surface its intense brilliancy according to my theory a dark spot in the sun is a place in its atmosphere which happens to be free from luminous decompositions above it the two atmospheric layers which will be of varying thickness about a spot will account for all the shades of darkness seen in the penumbra ascending currents from the solar surface will elevate certain regions and may increase the solar activity near by and will thus give rise to facul which herschel shows to be elevated above the general surface it will not be necessary to give a further account of this theory the data in the possession of the modern theorist is a thousandfold that to be derived from herschels observations and while the subject of the internal construction of the sun is today unsettled we know that many important even fundamental portions of his theory are untenable a remark of his should be recorded however as it has played a great part in such theories that the emission of light must waste the sun is not a difficulty that can be opposed to our hypothesis many of the operations of nature are carried on in her great laboratory which we cannot comprehend perhaps the many telescopic comets may restore to the sun what is lost by the emission of light arguments in favor of the habitability of both sun and moon are contained in this paper but they rest more on a metaphysical than a scientific basis and are today justly forgotten researches on the motion of the sun and of the solar system in space in 1782 herschel writes in regard to some of his discoveries of double stars these may serve another very important end i will just mention it though it is foreign to my present purpose several stars of the first magnitude have been observed or suspected to have a proper motion hence we may surmise that our sun with all its planets and comets may also have a motion towards some particular point of the heavens if this surmise should have any foundation it will show itself in a series of some years in a kind of systematical parallax or change due to the motion of the whole solar system in 1783 he published his paper on the proper motion of the solar system which contained the proofs of his surmises of a year before that certain of the stars had in fact a proper motion had been well established by the astronomers of the eighteenth century after all allowances had been made for the effects of precession and other displacements of a stars position which were produced by motions of the earth it was found that there were still small outstanding differences which must be due to the motion of the star itselfits proper motion the quantity of this motion was not well known for any star when herschels researches began before they were concluded however maskelyne had deduced the proper motions of thirtysix starsthe fundamental stars so calledwhich included in their number sirius procyon arcturus and generally the brightest stars it is priori evident that stars in general must have proper motions when once we admit the universality of gravitation that any fixed star should be entirely at rest would require that the attractions on all sides of it should be exactly balanced any change in the position of this star would break up this balance and thus in general it follows that stars must be in motion since all of them cannot occupy such a critical position as has to be assumed if but one fixed star is in motion this affects all the rest and we cannot doubt but that every star our sun included is in motion by an amount which varies from small to great if the sun alone had a motion and the other stars were at rest the consequence of this would be that all the fixed stars would appear to be retreating en masse from that point in the sky towards which we were moving those nearest us would move more rapidly those more distant less so and in the same way the stars from which the solar system was receding would seem to be approaching each other if the stars instead of being quite at rest as just supposed had motions proper to themselves then we should have a double complexity they would still appear to an observer in the solar system to have motions and part of these motions would be truly proper to the stars and part would be due to the advance of the sun itself in space observations can show us only the resultant of these two motions it is for reasoning to separate this resultant into its two components at first the question is to determine whether the results of observation indicate any solar motion at all if there is none the proper motions of stars will be directed along all possible lines if the sun does truly move then there will be a general agreement in the resultant motions of the stars near the ends of the line along which it moves while those at the sides so to speak will show comparatively less systematic effect it is as if one were riding in the rear of a railway train and watching the rails over which it has just passed as we recede from any point the rails at that point seem to come nearer and nearer together if we were passing through a forest we should see the trunks of the trees from which we were going apparently come nearer and nearer together while those on the sides of us would remain at their constant distance and those in front would grow further and further apart these phenomena which occur in a case where we are sensible of our own motion serve to show how we may deduce a motion otherwise unknown from the appearances which are presented by the stars in space in this way acting upon suggestions which had been thrown out previously to his own time by lambert mayer and bradley herschel demonstrated that the sun together with all its system was moving through space in an unknown and majestic orbit of its own the centre round which this motion is directed cannot yet be assigned we can only know the point in the heavens towards which our course is directedthe apex of solar motion by a study of the proper motions assigned by maskelyne to the brighter stars herschel was able to define the position of the solar apex with an astonishing degree of accuracy his calculations have been several times repeated with the advantage of modern analytical methods and of the hundredfold material now at our disposition but nothing essential has been added to his results of 1805 which were based upon such scanty data and his paper of 1782 contains the announcement of the discovery itself his second paper on the direction and velocity of the solar system 1805 is the best example that can possibly be given of his marvellous skill in reaching the heart of a matter and it may be the one in which his philosophical powers appear in their highest exercise for sustained reflection and high philosophic thought it is to be ranked with the researches of newton in the principia researches on the construction of the heavens herschels papers on the construction of the heavens as he named it extended over his whole scientific life by this he specially means the method according to which the stars the clusters the nebul are spread through the regions of space the causes that have led to this distribution and the laws to which it is subjected no single astronomical fact is unimportant in the light which it may throw on the scheme of the whole and each fact is to be considered in this light as an instance his discovery of the variable star alpha herculis which has a period of sixty days was valuable in itself as adding one more to the number of those strange suns whose light is now brighter now fainter in a regular and periodic order but the chief value of the discovery was that now we had an instance of a periodic star which went through all its phases in sixty days and connected as it were the stars of short periods three to seven days with those of very long ones three hundred to five hundred days which two groups had until then been the only ones known in the same way all his researches on the parallaxes of stars were not alone for the discovery of the distance of any one or two single stars but to gain a unit of celestial measure by means of which the depths of space might be sounded astronomy in herschels day considered the bodies of the solar system as separated from each other by distances and as filling a cubical space the ideas of near and far of up and down were preserved in regard to them by common astronomical terms but the vast number of stars seemed to be thought of as they appear in fact to exist lying on the surface of a hollow sphere the immediate followers of bradley used these fixed stars as points of reference by which the motions within the solar system could be determined or like lacaille and lalande gathered those immense catalogues of their positions which are so indispensable to the science michell and herschel alone in england occupied their thoughts with the nature and construction of the heavensthe one in his study the other through observation34 they were concerned with all three of the dimensions of space in his memoir of 1784 herschel says hitherto the sidereal heavens have not inadequately for the purpose designed been represented by the concave surface of a sphere in the centre of which the eye of an observer might be supposed to be placed it is true the various magnitudes of the fixed stars even then plainly suggested to us and would have better suited the idea of an expanded firmament of three dimensions but the observations upon which i am now going to enter still farther illustrate and enforce the necessity of considering the heavens in this point of view in future therefore we shall look upon those regions into which we may now penetrate by means of such large telescopes as a naturalist regards a rich extent of ground or chain of mountains containing strata variously inclined and directed as well as consisting of very different materials the surface of a globe or map therefore will but ill delineate the interior parts of the heavens herschels method of study was founded on a mode of observation which he called stargauging it consisted in pointing a powerful telescope toward various parts of the heavens and ascertaining by actual count how thick the stars were in each region his twentyfoot reflector was provided with such an eyepiece that in looking into it he saw a portion of the heavens about 15 in diameter a circle of this size on the celestial sphere has about one quarter the apparent surface of the sun or of the full moon on pointing the telescope in any direction a greater or less number of stars were visible these were counted and the direction in which the telescope pointed was noted gauges of this kind were made in all parts of the sky and the results were tabulated in the order of right ascension the following is an extract from the gauges and gives the average number of stars in each field at the points noted in right ascension and north polar distance n p d n p d r a 78 to 80 r a 92 to 94 no of stars no of stars h m h m 11 6 31

the two regions such differences are still more marked if we compare the extreme cases found by herschel as r a 19h 41m n p d 74 33 number of stars per field 588 and r a 16h 10m n p d 113 4 number of stars 11 the number of stars in certain portions is very great for example in the milky way near orion six fields of view promiscuously taken gave 110 60 70 90 70 and 74 stars each or a mean of 79 stars per field the most vacant space in this neighborhood gave 60 stars so that as herschels sweeps were two degrees wide in declination in one hour 15 there would pass through the field of his telescope 40000 or more stars in some of the sweeps this number was as great as 116000 stars in a quarter of an hour when herschel first applied his telescope to the milky way he believed that it completely resolved the whole whitish appearance into small stars this conclusion he subsequently modified he says it is very probable that the great stratum called the milky way is that in which the sun is placed though perhaps not in the very centre of its thickness we gather this from the appearance of the galaxy which seems to encompass the whole heavens as it certainly must do if the sun is within it for suppose a number of stars arranged between two parallel planes indefinitely extended every way but at a given considerable distance from each other and calling this a sidereal stratum an eye placed somewhere within it will see all the stars in the direction of the planes of the stratum projected into a great circle which will appear lucid on account of the accumulation of the stars while the rest of the heavens at the sides will only seem to be scattered over with constellations more or less crowded according to the distance of the planes or number of stars contained in the thickness or sides of the stratum if the eye were placed somewhere without the stratum at no very great distance the appearance of the stars within it would assume the form of one of the smaller circles of the sphere which would be more or less contracted according to the distance of the eye and if this distance were exceedingly increased the whole stratum might at last be drawn together into a lucid spot of any shape according to the length breadth and height of the stratum suppose that a smaller stratum should branch out from the former in a certain direction and that it also is contained between two parallel planes so that the eye is contained within the great stratum somewhere before the separation and not far from the place where the strata are still united then this second stratum will not be projected into a bright circle like the former but it will be seen as a lucid branch proceeding from the first and returning into it again at a distance less than a semicircle if the bounding surfaces are not parallel planes but irregularly curved surfaces analogous appearances must result the milky way as we see it presents the aspect which has been just accounted for in its general appearance of a girdle around the heavens and in its bifurcation at a certain point and herschels explanation of this appearance as just given has never been seriously questioned one doubtful point remains are the stars scattered all through space or are they near its bounding planes or clustered in any way within this space so as to produce the same result to the eye as if uniformly distributed herschel assumed that they were nearly equably arranged all through the space in question he only examined one other arrangement viz that of a ring of stars surrounding the sun and he pronounced against such an arrangement for the reason that there is absolutely nothing in the size or brilliancy of the sun to cause us to suppose it to be the centre of such a gigantic system no reason except its importance to us personally can be alleged for such a supposition every star will have its own appearance of a galaxy or milky way which will vary according to the situation of the star such an explanation will account for the general appearances of the milky way and of the rest of the sky supposing the stars equally or nearly equally distributed in space on this supposition the system must be deeper where the stars appear most numerous herschel endeavored in his early memoirs to explain this inequality of distribution on the fundamental assumption that the stars were nearly equably distributed in space if they were so distributed then the number of stars visible in any gauge would show the thickness of the stellar system in the direction in which the telescope was pointed at each pointing the field of view of the instrument includes all the visible stars situated within a cone having its vortex at the observers eye and its base at the very limits of the system the angle of the cone at the eye being 15 then the cubes of the perpendiculars let fall from the eye on the plane of the bases of the various visual cones are proportional to the solid contents of the cones themselves or as the stars are supposed equally scattered within all the cones the cube roots of the numbers of stars in each of the fields express the relative lengths of the perpendiculars a section of the sidereal system along any great circle can be constructed from the data furnished by the gauges in the following way the solar system is within the mass of stars from this point lines are drawn along the different directions in which the gauging telescope was pointed on these lines are laid off lengths proportional to the cube roots of the number of stars in each gauge the irregular line joining the terminal points will be approximately the bounding curve of the stellar system in the great circle chosen within this line the space is nearly uniformly filled with stars without it is empty space a similar section can be constructed in any other great circle and a combination of all such would give a representation of the shape of our stellar system the more numerous and careful the observations the more elaborate the representation and the 863 gauges of herschel are sufficient to mark out with great precision the main features of the milky way and even to indicate some of its chief irregularities on the fundamental assumption of herschel equable distribution no other conclusion can be drawn from his statistics but the one laid down by him this assumption he subsequently modified in some degree and was led to regard his gauges as indicating not so much the depth of the system in any direction as the clustering power or tendency of the stars in those special regions it is clear that if in any given part of the sky where on the average there are ten stars say to a field we should find a certain small portion having 100 or more to a field then on herschels first hypothesis rigorously interpreted it would be necessary to suppose a spikeshaped protuberance directed from the earth in order to explain the increased number of stars if many such places could be found then the probability is great that this explanation is wrong we should more rationally suppose some real inequality of star distribution here it is in fact in just such details that the method of herschel breaks down and a careful examination of his system leads to the belief that it must be greatly modified to cover all the known facts while it undoubtedly has in the main a strong basis the stars are certainly not uniformly distributed and any general theory of the sidereal system must take into account the varied tendency to aggregation in various parts of the sky in 1817 herschel published an important memoir on the same subject in which his first method was largely modified though not abandoned its fundamental principle was stated by him as follows it is evident that we cannot mean to affirm that the stars of the fifth sixth and seventh magnitudes are really smaller than those of the first second or third and that we must ascribe the cause of the difference in the apparent magnitudes of the stars to a difference in their relative distances from us on account of the great number of stars in each class we must also allow that the stars of each succeeding magnitude beginning with the first are one with another further from us than those of the magnitude immediately preceding the relative magnitudes give only relative distances and can afford no information as to the real distances at which the stars are placed a standard of reference for the arrangement of the stars may be had by comparing their distribution to a certain properly modified equality of scattering the equality which i propose does not require that the stars should be at equal distances from each other nor is it necessary that all those of the same nominal magnitude should be equally distant from us it consisted in allotting a certain equal portion of space to every star so that on the whole each equal portion of space within the stellar system contains an equal number of stars the space about each star can be considered spherical suppose such a sphere to surround our own sun its radius will not differ greatly from the distance of the nearest fixed star and this is taken as the unit of distance suppose a series of larger spheres all drawn around our sun as a centre and having the radii 3 5 7 9 etc the contents of the spheres being as the cubes of their diameters the first sphere will have 3 3 3 27 times the volume of the unit sphere and will therefore be large enough to contain 27 stars the second will have 125 times the volume and will therefore contain 125 stars and so on with the successive spheres for instance the sphere of radius 7 has room for 343 stars but of this space 125 parts belong to the spheres inside of it there is therefore room for 218 stars between the spheres of radii 5 and 7 herschel designates the several distances of these layers of stars as orders the stars between spheres 1 and 3 are of the first order of distance those between 3 and 5 of the second order and so on comparing the room for stars between the several spheres with the number of stars of the several magnitudes which actually exists in the sky he found the result to be as follows order of number of number of distance stars there magnitude stars of that is room for magnitude 1 26 1 17 2 98 2 57 3 218 3 206 4 386 4 454 5 602 5 1161 6 866 6 6103 7 1178 7 6146 8 1538 the result of this comparison is that if the order of magnitudes could indicate the distance of the stars it would denote at first a gradual and afterward a very abrupt condensation of them at and beyond the region of the sixthmagnitude stars if we assume the brightness of any star to be inversely proportional to the square of its distance it leads to a scale of distance different from that adopted by herschel so that a sixthmagnitude star on the common scale would be about of the eighth order of distance according to this schemethat is we must remove a star of the first magnitude to eight times its actual distance to make it shine like a star of the sixth magnitude on the scheme here laid down herschel subsequently assigned the order of distance of various objects mostly starclusters and his estimates of these distances are still quoted they rest on the fundamental hypothesis which has been explained and the error in the assumption of equal intrinsic brilliancy for all stars affects these estimates it is perhaps probable that the hypothesis of equal brilliancy for all stars is still more erroneous than the hypothesis of equal distribution and it may well be that there is a very large range indeed in the actual dimensions and in the intrinsic brilliancy of stars at the same order of distance from us so that the tenthmagnitude stars for example may be scattered throughout the spheres which herschel would assign to the seventh eighth ninth tenth eleventh twelfth and thirteenth magnitudes however this may be the fact remains that it is from herschels groundwork that future investigators must build he found the whole subject in utter confusion by his observations data for the solution of some of the most general questions were accumulated and in his memoirs which struve well calls immortal he brought the scattered facts into order and gave the first bold outlines of a reasonable theory he is the founder of a new branch of astronomy researches for a scale of celestial measures distances of the stars if the stars are supposed all of the same absolute brightness their brightness to the eye will depend only upon their distance from us if we call the brightness of one of the fixed stars at the distance of sirius which may be used as the unity of distance 1 then if it is moved to the distance 2 its apparent brightness will be onefourth if to the distance 3 oneninth if to the distance 4 onesixteenth and so on the apparent brightness diminishing as the square of the distance increases the distance may be taken as an order of magnitude stars at the distances two three four etc herschel called of the second third and fourth magnitudes by a series of experiments the details of which cannot be given here herschel determined the spacepenetrating power of each of his telescopes the twentyfoot would penetrate into space seventyfive times farther than the naked eye the twentyfive foot ninetysix times and the fortyfoot one hundred and ninetytwo times if the seventhmagnitude stars are those just visible to the naked eye and if we still suppose all stars to be of equal intrinsic brightness such seventhmagnitude stars would remain visible in the fortyfoot even if removed to 1344 times the distance of sirius 1344 7 192 if further we suppose that the visibility of a star is strictly proportional to the total intensity of the light from it which strikes the eye then a condensed cluster of 25000 stars of the 1344th magnitude could still be seen in the fortyfoot at a distance where each star would have become 25000 times fainter that is at about 158 times the distance of sirius 158 158 24964 the light from the nearest star requires some three years to reach the earth from a star 1344 times farther it would require about 4000 years and for such a cluster as we have imagined no less than 600000 years are needed that is the light by which we see such a group has not just now left it on the contrary it has been travelling through space for centuries and centuries since it first darted forth it is the ancient history of such groups that we are studying now and it was thus that herschel declared that telescopes penetrated into time as well as into space other more exact researches on the relative light of stars were made by herschel these were only one more attempt to obtain a scale of celestial distances according to which some notion of the limits and of the interior dimensions of the universe could be gained two telescopes exactly equal in every respect were chosen and placed side by side pairs of stars which were exactly equal were selected by means of them by diminishing the aperture of one telescope directed to a bright star and keeping the other telescope unchanged and directed to a fainter star the two stars could be equalized in light and from the relative size of the apertures the relative light of this pair of stars could be accurately computed and so on for other pairs this was the first use of the method of limiting apertures his general results were that the stars of the first magnitude would still remain visible to the naked eye even if they were at a distance from us twelve times their actual distance this method received a still further development at his hands he did not leave it until he had gained all the information it was capable of giving he prepared a set of telescopes collecting 4 9 16 etc 2 2 3 3 4 4 etc times as much light as the naked eye these were to extend the determinations of distance to the telescopic stars for example a certain portion of the heavens which he examined contained no star visible to the naked eye but many telescopic stars we cannot say that no one of these is as bright in itself as some of our firstmagnitude stars the smallest telescope of the set showed a large number of stars these must then be twice as far from us on the average as the stars just visible to the naked eye but firstmagnitude stars like sirius procyon arcturus etc become just visible to the eye if removed to twelve times their present distance hence the stars seen in this first telescope of the set were between twelve and twentyfour times as far from us as arcturus for example at least as herschel says we are certain that if stars of the size and lustre of sirius arcturus etc were removed into the profundity of space i have mentioned they would then appear like the stars which i saw with the next telescope which collected nine times more light than the eye and brought into view objects three times more distant other and new stars appeared which were then 3 12 thirtysix times farther from us than arcturus in the same way the sevenfoot reflector showed stars 204 times the tenfoot 344 times the twentyfoot 900 times farther from us than the average firstmagnitude star as the light from such a star requires three years to reach us the light from the faintest stars seen by the twentyfoot would require 2700 years 3 900 but herschel was now 1817 convinced that the twentyfoot telescope could not penetrate to the boundaries of the milky way the faintest stars of the galaxy must then be farther from us even than nine hundred times the distance of arcturus and their light must be at least 3000 years old when it reaches us there is no escaping a certain part of the consequences established by herschel it is indeed true that unless a particular star is of the same intrinsic brightness as our largest stars this reasoning does not apply to it in just so far as the average star is less bright than the average brightness of our largest stars will the numbers which herschel obtained be diminished but for every star of which his hypothesis is true we may assert that his conclusions are true and no one can deny with any show of reason that on the whole his suppositions must be valid on the whole the stars which we call faint are farther from us than the brighter ones and on the whole the brilliancy of our brightest and nearest stars is not very far from the brilliancy of the average star in space we cannot yet define the word very by a numerical ratio the method struck out by herschel was correct it is for his successors to look for the special cases and limitations to answer the question at a certain distance from us what are the variations which actually take place in the brilliancy and the sizes of stars the answer to this question is to be found in the study of the clusters of regular forms where we know the stars to be all at the same distance from us researches on light and heat etc frequently in the course of his astronomical work herschel found himself confronted by questions of physics which could not be immediately answered in the state of the science at that time in his efforts to find a method for determining the dimensions of the stellar universe he was finally led as has been shown to regard the brightness of a star as in general the best attainable measure of its distance from us his work however was done with telescopes of various dimensions and powers and it was therefore necessary to find some law for comparing the different results among themselves as well as with those given by observations with an unassisted eye this necessity prompted an investigation published in 1800 in which after drawing the distinction between absolute and intrinsic brightness herschel gave an expression for the spacepenetrating power of a telescope the reasoning at the base of this conception was as follows the ratio of the light entering the eye when directed toward a star to the whole light given out by the star would be as the area of the pupil of the eye to the area of the whole sphere having the star as a centre and our distance from the star as a radius if the eye is assisted by a telescope the ratio is quite different in that case the ratio of the light which enters the eye to the whole light would be as the area of the mirror or objectglass to the area of the whole sphere having the star as a centre and its distance as a radius thus the light received by the eye in the two cases would be as the area of the pupil is to the area of the objectglass for instance if the pupil has a diameter of twofifths of an inch and the mirror a diameter of four inches then a hundred times as much light would enter the eye when assisted by the telescope as when unarmed since the area of the pupil is onehundredth the area of the objective if a particular star is just visible to the naked eye it will be quite bright if viewed with this special telescope which makes it one hundred times more brilliant in appearance if we could move the star bodily away from us to a distance ten times its present distance we could thus reduce its brightness as seen with the telescope to what it was at first as seen with the eye alone i e to bare visibility moving the star to ten times its present distance would increase the surface of the sphere which it illuminates a hundredfold we cannot move any special star but we can examine stars of all brightnesses and thus presumably of all distances herschels argument was then as follows since with such a telescope one can see a star ten times as far off as is possible to the naked eye this telescope has the power of penetrating into space ten times farther than the eye alone but this number ten also expresses the ratio of the diameter of the objective to that of the pupil of the eye consequently the general law is that the spacepenetrating power of a telescope is found by dividing the diameter of the mirror in inches by twofifths the diameter of the pupil of the eye twofifths of an inch herschel determined by many measures this simple ratio would only hold good however provided no more light were lost by the repeated reflections and refractions in the telescope than in the eye that light must be so lost was evident but no data existed for determining the loss herschel was thus led to a long series of photometric experiments on the reflecting powers of the metals used in his mirrors and on the amount of light transmitted by lenses applying the corrections thus deduced experimentally he found that the spacepenetrating power of his twentyfoot telescope with which he made his stargauges was sixtyone times that of the unassisted eye while the spacepenetrating power of his great fortyfoot telescope was one hundred and ninetytwo times that of the eye in support of his important conclusions herschel had an almost unlimited amount of experimental data in the records of his observations of which he made effective use by far the most important of herschels work in the domain of pure physics was published in the same year 1800 and related to radiant heat the investigation of the spacepenetrating powers of telescopes was undertaken for the sole purpose of aiding him in measuring the dimensions of the stellar universe and there was no temptation for him to pursue it beyond the limits of its immediate usefulness but here though the first hint leading to remarkable discoveries was a direct consequence of his astronomical work the novelty and interest of the phenomena observed induced him to follow the investigation very far beyond the mere solution of the practical question in which it originated having tried many varieties of shadeglasses between the eyepiece of his telescope and the eye in order to reduce the inordinate degree of heat and light transmitted by the instrument when directed towards the sun he observed that certain combinations of colored glasses permitted very little light to pass but transmitted so much heat that they could not be used while on the other hand different combinations and differently colored glasses would stop nearly all the heat but allow an inconveniently great amount of light to pass at the same time he noticed in the various experiments that the images of the sun were of different colors this suggested the question as to whether there was not a different heating power proper to each color of the spectrum on comparing the readings of sensitive thermometers exposed in different portions of an intense solar spectrum he found that beginning with the violet end he came to the maximum of light long before that of heat which lay at the other extremity that is near the red by several experiments it appeared that the maximum of illumination i e the yellow had little more than half the heat of the full red rays and from other experiments he concluded that even the full red fell short of the maximum of heat which perhaps lay even a little beyond the limits of the visible spectrum in this case he says radiant heat will at least partly if not chiefly consist if i may be permitted the expression of invisible light that is to say of rays coming from the sun that have such a momentum35 as to be unfit for vision and admitting as is highly probable that the organs of sight are only adapted to receive impressions from particles of a certain momentum it explains why the maximum of illumination should be in the middle of the refrangible rays as those which have greater or less momenta are likely to become equally unfit for the impression of sight in his second paper on this subject published in the same year herschel describes the experiments which led to the conclusion given above this paper contains a remarkably interesting passage which admirably illustrates herschels philosophic method to conclude if we call light those rays which illuminate objects and radiant heat those which heat bodies it may be inquired whether light be essentially different from radiant heat in answer to which i would suggest that we are not allowed by the rules of philosophizing to admit two different causes to explain certain effects if they may be accounted for by one if this be a true account of the solar heat for the support of which i appeal to my experiments it remains only for us to admit that such of the rays of the sun as have the refrangibility of those which are contained in the prismatic spectrum by the construction of the organs of sight are admitted under the appearance of light and colors and that the rest being stopped in the coats and humors of the eye act on them as they are known to do on all the other parts of our body by occasioning a sensation of heat we now know that the reasoning and conclusion here given are entirely correct but they have for their basis only a philosophical conception and not a series of experiments designed especially to test their correctness such an experimental test of this important question was the motive for a third and last paper in this department of physics this paper was published in volume ninety of the philosophical transactions and gave the results of two hundred and nineteen quantitative experiments here we are at a loss to know which to admire mostthe marvellous skill evinced in acquiring such accurate data with such inadequate means and in varying and testing such a number of questions as were suggested in the course of the investigationor the intellectual power shown in marshalling and reducing to a system such intricate and apparently selfcontradictory phenomena it is true that this discussion led him to a different conclusion from that announced in the previous paper and consequently to a false conclusion but almost the only escape from his course of reasoning lay in a principle which belongs to a later period of intellectual development than that of herschels own time herschel made a careful determination of the quantitative distribution of light and of heat in the prismatic spectrum and discovered the surprising fact that not only where the light was at a maximum the heat was very inconsiderable but that where there was a maximum exhibition of heat there was not a trace of light this consideration he writes must alter the form of our proposed inquiry for the question being thus at least partly decided since it is ascertained that we have rays of heat which give no light it can only become a subject of inquiry whether some of these heatmaking rays may not have a power of rendering objects visible superadded to their now already established power of heating bodies this being the case it is evident that the onus probandi ought to lie with those who are willing to establish such an hypothesis for it does not appear that nature is in the habit of using one and the same mechanism with any two of our senses witness the vibration of air that makes sound the effluvia that occasion smells the particles that produce taste the resistance or repulsive powers that affect the touchall these are evidently suited to their respective organs of sense it is difficult to see how the fallacy of this argument could have been detected by any one not familiar with the fundamental physiological law that the nature of a sensation is in no wise determined by the character of the agent producing it but only by the character of the nerves acted upon but as already intimated this law belongs to a later epoch than the one we are considering herschel thus finally concluded that light and radiant heat were of essentially different natures and upon this supposition he explained all of the phenomena which his numerous experiments had shown him so complete and satisfactory did this work appear to the scientific world that for a long time the question was looked upon as closed and not until thirtyfive years later was there any dissent then the italian physicist melloni with instrumental means a thousand times more delicate than that of herschel and with a far larger store of cognate phenomena collected during the generation which had elapsed to serve as a guide discovered the true law this as we have seen was at first adopted by herschel on philosophical grounds and then rejected since he did not at that time possess the key which alone could have enabled him to properly interpret his experiments it is well to summarize the capital discoveries in this field made by herschel more particularly because his claims as a discoverer seem to have been strangely overlooked by historians of the development of physical science he before any other investigator showed that radiant heat is refracted according to the laws governing the refraction of light by transparent media that a portion of the radiation from the sun is incapable of exciting the sensation of vision and that this portion is the less refrangible that the different colors of the spectrum possess very unequal heating powers which are not proportional to their luminosity that substances differ very greatly in their power of transmitting radiant heat and that this power does not depend solely upon their color and that the property of diffusing heat is possessed to a varying degree by different bodies independently of their color nor should we neglect to emphasize in this connection the importance of his measurements of the intensity of the heat and light in the different portions of the solar spectrum it is the more necessary to state herschels claims clearly as his work has been neglected by those who should first have done him justice in his history of physics poggendorff has no reference to herschel in the collected works of verdet long bibliographical notes are appended to each chapter with the intention of exhibiting the progress and order of discovery but all of herschels work is overlooked or indexed under the name of his son one little reference in the text alone shows that his very name was not unknown even in the great work of helmholtz on physiological optics herschels labors are not taken account of it is easy to account for this seemingly strange neglect herschel is known to this generation only as an astronomer a study of his memoirs will show that his physical work alone should give him a very high rank indeed and i trust that the brief summaries which alone can be given here will have made this plain we may conclude from the time expended the elaborate nature of the experiments involved and the character of the papers devoted to their consideration that the portion of herschels researches in physics which interested him to the greatest degree was the investigation of the optical phenomena known as newtons rings in 1792 he obtained the two objectglasses of huyghens which were in the possession of the royal society for the purpose of repeating newtons experiments and in 1810 he read the last of his three papers on the subject sir isaac newton had given some of his most vigorous efforts to the study of the phenomena of interference of light which are exemplified in the colors of thin and of thick plates the colors of thin plates are most conveniently studied in the regular form which they present when produced by a thin plate of air limited on one side by a plane polished surface and on the other by a spherical surface of long radius such as the exterior surface of a convex lens for example the colors are then arranged in concentric circles and though others had so produced them before newton these rings have ever since the publication of his remarkable work been known by his name to explain the phenomena newton was obliged to supplement his theory of the corpuscular nature of light by supposing that the inconceivably minute particles constituting light are not always equally susceptible of reflection but that they have periodically recurring fits of easy reflection and of easy transmission this conception though by no means unphilosophical seemed to herschel too artificial and improbable for ready acceptance and his effort was to supply a more probable explanation the developments of optical science have justified herschel in his objections but we cannot accord to him must any considerable part in making clear the true nature of the phenomenon indeed it must be recognized that his position was distinctly less advanced than that of newton that great philosopher announced the true law governing the relation between the color and the thickness of the film herschel did not recognize such a relation newton showed exactly how the phenomenon depended upon the obliquity at which it was viewed herschel found no place in his theory for this evident variation in the series of experiments described in the first paper on this subject herschel mistook the locus of a certain set of rings which he was observing this mistake though so slight as hardly to be detected without the guidance of the definite knowledge acquired in later times not only vitiated the conclusion from the experiments but gave an erroneous direction to the whole investigation to him these experiments proved that newtons conception of a periodic phenomenon was untenable thus cut loose from all hypothesis his fertility in ideas and ingenuity in experimentation are as striking as ever he tried the effect of having a polished metal as one of the surfaces limiting the thin plate of air observing the socalled blue bow of newton at the limit of total reflection in a prism he was led to the discovery of its complement the red bow by refraction here he thought he had found the solution of his problem and attributed the rings to the reflection of the light which passed through in the red bow though mistaken he had presented to the world of science two experiments which have since played very prominent parts in the undulatory theory of light namely the rings formed upon polished metal and the bands produced by a thin plate near the critical angle as in his later researches upon the nature of radiant heat he was wrong in his conclusions and perhaps with less excuse his experiments were skilfully devised and most ingenious his philosophizing was distinctly faulty we can see not only that he was wrong but exactly where he began to go wrong yet these papers are full of interest to the physicist and by no means deserve the neglect into which they have fallen researches on the dimensions of the stars herschel examined a number of bright stars using extremely high magnifying powers in order to determine whether the stars have sensible dimensions in a good telescope stars present round and pretty uniformly illuminated disks if these disks really represent the angular diameter of the stars they should admit of magnifying like other objects but instead of this herschel found that they appeared smaller as the telescopic power was increased he accordingly called the disk of light seen in the telescope a spurious disk this singular phenomenon gave its discoverer a ready criterion for determining whether a small bright body has an appreciable size or only impresses the sense of sight by virtue of its intrinsic brightness if the first were the case the apparent size would increase with increased magnifying power while if the angular dimensions were inappreciable the apparent size would on the contrary diminish with additional magnifying an occasion for using this criterion came in the first years of this century with the discovery of three small planets having orbits lying between those of mars and jupiter herschel gave the name asteroids to these bodies as the appropriateness of this term had been violently assailed the discovery of juno in 1804 the third one of the group led to a careful experimental study of the defining power of the telescope used and of the laws governing the phenomena of spurious disks with a telescope of about nine inches in aperture herschel found that if juno subtended an angle greater than a quarter of a second of arc a certain indication of the fact would have shown itself in the course of the experiments this conclusion was a justification of the name asteroid since the appearance of the new planet was strictly stellar on other grounds a better name might have been selected in the paper giving the results of the experiments the phenomena of the spurious disks are very completely described but they did not attract the attention which they deserved and they only became an object of especial interest to students of physics when they were again studied by the famous german optician fraunhofer a generation later incidentally the experiments are of interest as yielding us a measure of the excellence of herschels telescopes and a measure which is quite independent of the keenness of his vision from them we may be sure that the efficiency of the nineinch mirror used was not sensibly less than that of the highest theoretically attainable excellence in this connection too we may refer to the philosophical transactions for 1790 pp 468 and 475 where herschel gives observations of both enceladus and mimas seen in contact with the ball of saturn i have never seen so good definition telescopic and atmospheric as he must have had on these occasions researches on the spectra of the fixed stars the spectroscope was applied by secchi to the study of the spectra of the fixed stars visible to the naked eye in the years 1863 to 1866 he examined the nature of the spectrum of each of the larger stars and found that these stars could be arranged in three general classes or types his results have been verified and extended by other astronomers and his classification has been generally accepted according to secchi the lucid stars may be separated into three groups distinguished by marked differences in their spectra secchis type i contains stars whose spectra are like those of sirius procyon and alpha lyr his type ii stars like arcturus and aldebaran his type iii stars like alpha orionis herschel also made some trials in this direction in the philosophical transactions for 1814 p 264 he says by some experiments on the light of a few of the stars of the first magnitude made in 1798 by a prism applied to the eyeglasses of my reflectors adjustable to any angle and to any direction i had the following analyses the light of sirius consists of red orange yellow green blue purple and violet alpha orionis contains the same colors but the red is more intense and the orange and yellow are less copious in proportion than they are in sirius procyon contains all the colors but proportionately more blue and purple than sirius arcturus contains more red and orange and less yellow in proportion than sirius aldebaran contains much orange and very little yellow alpha lyr contains much yellow green blue and purple here the essential peculiarities of the spectrum of each of the stars investigated by herschel is pointed out and if we were to use his observations alone to classify these stars into types we should put sirius and procyon into one type of stars which have all the colors in their spectra arcturus and aldebaran would represent another group of stars with a deficiency of yellow and an excess of orange and red in the spectrum and alpha orionis would stand as a type of those stars with an excess of red and a deficiency of orange alpha lyr would represent a subgroup of the first class herschels immediate object was not classification and his observations are only recorded in a passing way but the fact remains that he clearly distinguished the essential differences of the spectra of these stars and that he made these observations in support of his statement that the fixed stars like the planets also shine with differently colored light that of arcturus and aldebaran for instance is as different from the light of sirius and capella as that of mars and saturn is from the light of venus and jupiter of course no special discovery can be claimed for him on these few instances we can see however a good example of the manner in which he examined a subject from every side and used the most remote evidence exactly in its proper place and time researches on the variable emission of light and heat from the sun it is certainly a remarkable fact that herschel was the first observer to recognize the real importance of the aperture or diameter of a telescope before his time it was generally assumed that this element only conditioned the amount of light transmitted to the eye or in other words merely determined the brightness of the image hence the conclusion that if an object is sufficiently bright the telescope may be made as small as desired without loss of power thus in observing the sun astronomers before herschel had been accustomed to reduce the aperture of their telescopes in order to moderate the heat and light transmitted scheiner it is true nearly two centuries before the time we are considering had invented a method for observing the sun without danger still employing the full aperture this was by projecting the image of the sun on a white screen beyond the eyepiece the telescope being slightly lengthened for special purposes this ingenious method has even been found useful in modern times though for sharpness of definition it bears much the same relation to the more usual manner of observing that a photographic picture does to direct vision although herschel saw the advantages of using the whole aperture of a telescope in such observations the practical difficulties in the way were very great we have noted his attempts to find screens which would effectively cut off a large portion of the heat and light without impairing vision and have considered somewhat in detail the remarkable discoveries in radiant heat to which these attempts led him his efforts were not unsuccessful a green glass smoked and a glass cell containing a solution of black writing ink in waterwere found to work admirably thus provided with more powerful instrumental means than had ever been applied to the purpose herschel turned his attention to the sun in a very short time he exhausted nearly all there was to be discovered so that since the publication of his last paper on this subject in 1801 until the present time there has been but a single telescopic phenomenon connected with the physical appearance of the sun which was unknown to herschel that phenomenon is the frequent occurrence of a darker central shade or kernel in large spots discovered by dawes about 1858 herschel though observing a hundred and ninety years after the earliest discovery of sun spots seems to have been the first to suspect their periodic character to establish this as a fact and to measure the period was left for our own times and for the indefatigable observer schwabe the probable importance of such a period in its relation to terrestrial meteorology was not only clearly pointed out by herschel but he even attempted to demonstrate from such data as were obtainable the character of this influence perhaps no one thing which this great philosopher has done better exhibits the catholic character of his mind than this research when the possible connection of solar and terrestrial phenomena occurred to him as a question to be tested there were no available meteorological records and he could find but four or five short series of observations widely separated in time to an ordinary thinker the task would have seemed hopeless until more data had been collected but herschels fertile mind though it could not recall lost opportunities for solar observations did find a substitute for meteorological records in the statistics of the prices of grain during the various epochs it is clear that the price of wheat must have depended upon the supply and the supply in turn largely upon the character of the season the method as ingenious as it is failed in herschels hands on account of the paucity of solar statistics but it has since proved of value and has taken its place as a recognized method of research researches on nebul and clusters when herschel first began to observe the nebul in 1774 there were very few of these objects known the nebul of orion and andromeda had been known in europe only a little over a hundred years in 1784 messier published a list of sixtyeight such objects which he had found in his searches for comets and twentyeight nebul had been found by lacaille in his observations at the cape of good hope in the mere discovery of these objects herschel quickly surpassed all others in 1786 he published a catalogue of one thousand new nebul in 1789 a catalogue of a second thousand and in 1802 one of five hundred in all he discovered and described two thousand five hundred and eight new nebul and clusters this branch of astronomy may almost be said to be proper to the herschels father and son sir john herschel reobserved all his fathers nebul in the northern hemisphere and added many new ones and in his astronomical expedition to the cape of good hope he recorded almost an equal number in the southern sky of the six thousand two hundred nebul now known the herschels discovered at least eighttenths the mere discovery of twentyfive hundred nebul would have been a brilliant addition to our knowledge of celestial statistics herschel did more than merely point out the existence and position of these new bodies each observation was accompanied by a careful and minute description of the object viewed and with sketches and diagrams which gave the position of the small stars in it and near it36 as the nebul and clusters were discovered they were placed in classes each class covering those nebul which resembled each other in their general features even at the telescope herschels object was not discovery merely but to know the inner constitution of the heavens his classes were arranged with this end and they are today adopted they were class i bright nebul 288 in all ii faint nebul 909 in all iii very faint nebul 984 in all iv planetary nebul stars with burs with milky chevelure with short rays remarkable shapes etc 79 in all v very large nebul 52 in all vi very compressed and rich clusters of stars 42 in all vii pretty much compressed clusters 67 in all viii coarsely scattered clusters of stars 88 in all the lists of these classes were the storehouses of rich material from which herschel drew the examples by which his later opinions on the physical conditions of nebulous matter were enforced as the nebul were discovered and classified they were placed upon a starmap in their proper positions 1786 and as the discoveries went on the real laws of the distribution of the nebul and of the clusters over the surface of the sky showed themselves more and more plainly it was by this means that herschel was led to the announcement of the law that the spaces richest in nebul are distant from the milky way etc by no other means could he have detected this and i believe this to have been the first example of the use of the graphical method now become common in treating large masses of statistics it is still in his capacity of an observeran acute and wise onethat herschel is considered but this was the least of his gifts this vast mass of material was not left in this state it served him for a steppingstone to larger views of the nature and extent of the nebulous matter itself his views on the nature of nebul underwent successive changes at first he supposed all nebul to be but aggregations of stars the logic was simple to the naked eye there are many groups of stars which appear nebulous praesepe is perhaps the best example the slightest telescopic power applied to such groups alters the nebulous appearance and shows that it comes from the combined and confused light of discrete stars other groups which remain nebulous in a sevenfoot telescope become stellar in a tenfoot the nebulosity of the tenfoot can be resolved into stars by the twentyfoot and so on the nebul which remained still unresolved it was reasonable to conclude would yield to higher power and generally a nebula was but a group of stars removed to a great distance an increase of telescopic power was alone necessary to demonstrate this37 nebul can be selected so that an insensible gradation shall take place from a coarse cluster like the pleiades down to a milky nebulosity like that in orion every intermediate step being represented this tends to confirm the hypothesis that all are composed of stars more or less remote so at first herschel believed that his twentyfoot telescope was of power sufficient to fathom the milky way that is to see through it and beyond it and to reduce all its nebulosities to true groups of stars in 1791 he published a memoir on nebulous stars in which his views were completely changed he had found a nebulous star the sixtyninth of his class iv to which his reasons would not apply in the centre of it was a bright star around the star was a halo gradually diminishing in brightness from the star outward and perfectly circular it was clear the two parts star and nebula were connected and thus at the same distance from us there were two possible solutions only either the whole mass was first composed of stars in which case the nucleus would be enormously larger than the other stars of its stellar magnitude elsewhere in the sky or the stars which made up the halo indefinitely small or second the central nucleus was indeed a star but a star surrounded with a shining fluid of a nature totally unknown to us the long strata of nebul which he had before described under the name of telescopic milky ways might well be accounted for by masses of this fluid lying beyond the regions of the seventhmagnitude stars this fluid might exist independently of stars if it is selfluminous it seems more fit to produce a star by its condensation than to depend upon the star for its own existence such were a few of the theorems to which his discovery of this nebula led him the hypothesis of an elastic shining fluid existing in space sometimes in connection with stars sometimes distinct from them was adopted and never abandoned how well the spectroscope has confirmed this idea it is not necessary to say we know the shining fluid does exist and in late years we have seen the reverse of the process imagined by herschel a star has actually under our eyes become a planetary nebula and the cycle of which he gave the first terms is complete in five separate memoirs 1802 1811 1814 1817 and 1818 herschel elaborated his views of the sidereal system the whole extent of his views must be gained from the extended memoirs themselves here only the merest outline can be given in 1802 there is a marshaling of the various objects beyond our solar system the stars themselves may be insulated or may belong to binary or multiple systems to clusters and groups or to grand groups like the milky way nebul may have any of the forms which have been described and in 1811 he gives examples of immense spaces in the sky covered with diffused and very faint nebulosity its abundance exceeds all imagination38 these masses of nebular matter are the seats of attracting forces and these forces must produce condensation when a nebula has more than one preponderating seat of attracting matter it may in time be divided and the double nebul have had such an origin when nebul appear to us as round masses they are in reality globular in form and this form is at once the effect and the proof of a gravitating cause the central brightness of nebul points out the seat of the attraction and the completeness of the approximation to a spherical form points out the length of time that the gravitating forces have been at work those nebul and clusters which are most perfect in the globular form have been longest exposed to central forces the planetary nebul are the oldest in our system they must have a rotatory motion on their axes by progressive condensation planetary nebul may be successively converted into bright stellar nebul or into nebulous stars and these again by the effects of the same cause into insulated or double stars this chain of theorems laid down in the memoir of 1811 is enforced in 1814 with examples which show how the nebulous appearance may grow into the sidereal herschel selects from the hundreds of instances in his notebooks nebul in every stage of progress and traces the effect of condensation and of clustering power through all its course even to the final breaking up of the milky way itself the memoirs of 1817 and 1818 add little to the general view of the physical constitution of the heavens they are attempts to gain a scale of celestial measures by which we may judge of the distances of the stars and clusters in which these changes are going on there is little to change in herschels statement of the general construction of the heavens it is the groundwork upon which we have still to build every astronomical discovery and every physical fact well observed is material for the elaboration of its details or for the correction of some of its minor points as a scientific conception it is perhaps the grandest that has ever entered into the human mind as a study of the height to which the efforts of one man may go it is almost without a parallel the philosopher who will add to it today will have his facts and his methods ready to his hands herschel presents the almost unique example of an eager observer marshaling the multitude of single instances which he himself has laboriously gathered into a compact and philosophic whole in spite of minor errors and defects his ideas of the nature of the sidereal universe have prevailed and are today the unacknowledged basis of our every thought upon it some of its most secret processes have been worked out by him and the paths which he pointed out are those along which our advances must be made in concluding this condensed account of herschels scientific labors it behoves us to remember that there was nothing due to accident in his long life he was born with the faculties which fitted him for the gigantic labors which he undertook and he had the firm basis of energy and principle which kept him steadily to his work as a practical astronomer he remains without an equal in profound philosophy he has few superiors by a kindly chance he can be claimed as the citizen of no one country in very truth his is one of the few names which belong to the whole world footnotes 31 james short frs 17101768 and john dollond frs 17061761 were the most celebrated makers of telescopes of their day the sixfoot newtonian reflectors of short aperture 94 inches and the fortysixinch achromatics of dollond aperture 36 inches were highly esteemed the royal observatory of greenwich possessed in 1765 one of each class in a comparative trial of shorts telescope at greenwich and one of herschels first telescopes the latter was adjudged greatly superior 32 at least one of these telescopes had the principal mirror made of glass instead of metalphilosophical transactions 1803 33 the following extract from fouriers loge of herschel is of interest in this connection the sum first appropriated by the king was 2000 this was afterwards raised to 4000 and a sum of 200 yearly was given for maintenance lhistoire doit conserver jamais la rponse de ce prince un tranger clbre lalande qui le remerciait des sommes considrables accordes pour les progrs de lastronomie je fais les dpenses de la guerre dit le roi parcequelles sont ncessaires quant celles des sciences il mest agrable des les ordonner leur objet ne cote point des larmes et honore lhumanit lalandes own account is a little different he says the king exclaimed ne vautil pas mieux employer son argent cela qu faire tuer des hommes 34 the memoirs on the parallaxes of stars written by various astronomers from 1750 to 1800 were mainly directed to the improvement of the methods or to the discovery of the parallax of some particular star for example lacailles observations of sirius at the cape of good hope had resulted in a parallax of 9 for that stara quantity over forty times too large 35 herschel accepted as did all his cotemporaries the newtonian or corpuscular theory of light 36 thus the position of small stars critically situated in the centre or on the edges of the nebul was always noted many of the descriptions are given in the published papers but the publication of the diagrams would be an immense help to this branch of astronomy darrest in his reduction of herschels nebula observations 1856 writes gewiss wre es vom hchsten interesse fr die entwickelung welche hoffentlich auch dieser zweig der beobachtenden astronomie zuknftig erhalten wird wenn die herschelschen beobachtungen in der ausfhrlichkeit in welcher sie verschiedenen andeutungen zufolge handschriftlich vorhanden sind verffentlicht wrden es schliesst sich dieser wunsch in betreff der nebelflecken lebhaft an den an welcher schon vor einem jahrzehnt nach verffentlichung der 400 noch unedirten stargauges von gewichtigerer seite her geussert wurde in this all must agree who have a knowledge of the direction in which we must look for advances in the difficult and important questions of the distance the motions and the changes of the nebul almost the only aid to be looked for from the older observations must come from such diagrams and we may safely say that the publication of this priceless material just as it stands would carry our exact data back from 1833 to 1786 or no less than fortyseven years 37 long after herschel had abandoned this idea it continued current among astronomers the successes of lord rosses telescope perpetuated to the middle of the nineteenth century an erroneous view which herschel had given up in 1791 38 these have never been reobserved they should be sought for with a powerful refractor taking special precautions against the illumination of the field of view from neighboring bright stars herschels reflectors were specially open to illusions produced in this way his observations probably will remain untested until some
