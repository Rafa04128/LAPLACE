lacemaking ancient and modern methods the art of making lace in one form or another has existed from the earliest ages there are scriptural references to various weblike fabrics which were of rude construction no doubt but whose general characteristics were identical with those productions of modern skill which have for centuries been known as lace homer and other ancient writers constantly mention networks of fancifully embroidered materials gold threadwork was known to the romans and as egyptian robes of state are depicted upon the tombs of the earlier dynasties as being fashioned from a looped network or crochet it is probable that the israelites learned the art from the egyptians museums contain specimens of lace dating back to periods that to us of the present day seem mere dreams of reigns and eras and history includes a scattered literature of lace which proves that the art must have been practised almost from the beginning up to the sixteenth century however open work embroidery was the favorite decoration and from it the tangible origin of lace seems derived during the renaissance period the first book of embroidery patterns and lacework appeared the earliest volume bearing a date was printed at cologne in 1527 and it was during the reign of richard iii of england that the word lace was first used in the descriptions of the royal wardrobe at first the best known laces were those of venice milan and genoa the italians claim the invention of point or needlemade lace but the venetian point is now a product of the past and england and france supply most of the fine laces of the present time lacemakers in the various european countries are trained to the work from childhood but it is said that the makers of honiton lace the fabric of which queen victorias wedding gown was made are rapidly decreasing in numbers so that there are few persons now living who understand the construction of this exquisite pillow lace the costly point and honiton and the dainty mechlin and valenciennes of bygone days can only be produced by trained laceworkers whose skilful fingers weave bobbins of cobweblike thread to and fro over the pillow necessary to antique methods and for this reason fine lacemaking is practically beyond the skill of the amateur besides some of the threads in the very filmy laces are so fine that they cannot be successfully manipulated except in a moist atmosphere such as that of great britain and even there some of the more exquisite specimens must perforce be made in underground rooms since it is only there that the proper degree of moisture can be obtained in dry climates these gossamerlike threads would roughen and break at almost the slightest touch referring to the known origin of some of the earlier laces a writer upon the subject says they say it was a woman barbara uttmann who invented pillow lace in the 16th century women have ever been patrons of lacemaking victoria has kept the honiton laces in fashion and it was the duchess of argyle who introduced lacemaking in scotland the countess of erne and lady denny and lady bingham began it in ireland and lady de vere gave her own brussels point for patterns when the first irish point was made at curragh it was elizabeth of denmark who introduced lacemaking in that country and the archduchess sophia who started lace schools in bohemia now at least i can have laces said anne of austria when louis xiii her husband died and her court was famous for its cleanliness and its spanish point colbert had three women as coadjutors when he started lacemaking in france it was because josephine loved point dalenon that napoleon revived it eugenie spent 5000 for a single dress flounce and had 1000000 in fine laces victorias favorite honiton is not considered a particularly beautiful lace although its weaving is so tedious and difficult real honiton laces so says an authority are made up of bits and bits fashioned by many different women in their own little cottageshere a leaf there a flower slowly woven through the long weary days only to be united afterward in the precious web by other workers who never saw its beginning there is a pretty lesson in the thought that to the perfection of each of these little pieces the beauty of the whole is duethat the rose or leaf some humble peasant woman wrought carefully helps to make the fabric worthy the adorning of a queen or the decoration of an altar even as the sweetness and patient perfection in any life makes all living more worthy and noble a single flower upon which taste and fancy were lavished and which sustained and deft labor brought to perfection represents the lives of many diligent women workers it has become so much the fashion to worship all things ancient that most lovers of fine lace would prefer to have it a century old and yet there never was a time when laces were more beautiful more artistic and more unique in design than just at the present day for modern laces preserve the best features of the laces that have gone before them and have added so many new inspirations that except for the sentiment the romance or the history connecting this scrap with a title that with a famous beauty and another with some cathedrals sacred treasure the palm would certainly be given to the gauzelike production of the poor flax thread spinner of the present day not all people know the difference between point lace which is made with the needle and pillow lace which is made with the bobbinsbut much of the beautiful point lace of the present day is made with the needle and its beauty stands a favorable comparison with the more costly pillow lace strictly modern lacemaking is a result of american ingenuity and it has so simple a basis and is so easy to learn that any woman of average skill may with little difficulty produce by its different processes laces that are really magnificent and quite as substantial and useful as they are exquisitely beautiful in america modern lacemaking has been developed to a high degree of perfection by its pioneer mrs grace b mccormick in whose designing rooms at no 923 broadway new york may be seen specimens of modern laces of every variety from dainty needlepoint to a very elaborate kind known as the royal battenburg this english name for an american production was selected in honor of the battenburg nuptials which occurred about the time a patent for making the lace was applied for at washington only a few years have elapsed since this plucky little woman made a single piece of lace edging from common braid as an experiment and sold it for a trifling sum love for the work and perseverance have enabled her to overcome obstacles that would have discouraged a woman of ordinary energy and she has gradually improved upon her earlier methods until modern lace occupies a front rank among the numerous dainty forms of needlework of the day one of the finest specimens lately placed on exhibition is a tablecloth intended for use at elaborate dinners it is made of the finest table linen and royal battenburg lace the cloth is of course very large and the lace in the form of wide insertion is let in above the border and is also arranged to divide the center into three squares an outside border of edging to match completes this exquisite production which has been two years in course of construction and is valued at four hundred and seventyfive dollars the same style of lace may be made by any one who studies the art and in any width or form and it may be produced in many textures although really intended for heavy effects the making of such lace possesses a great charm for womankind in general and will undoubtedly retain favor as long as needlecraft remains a pastime and employment with the gentler sex materials the requirements of modern lacemaking are few the products are classed as honiton point duchesse princesse royal battenburg or old english point etc etc but all are made with various braids arranged in different patterns and connected by numerous kinds of stitches many different stitches often appearing in one variety of lace the materials required are neither numerous nor expensive the following is a complete list tracing cloth leather or toile cire lace braids of various kinds linen thread two or three sizes of needles a good thimble and a pair of fine sharp scissors for each kind of lace there is a special sort of braid in various patterns and the selection of the thread depends entirely upon the variety and quality of lace to be made this selection should be left to the decision of the teacher or the skilled maker of laces as she knows from experience the proper combinations of materials thus in making honiton and point lace thread in twelve different degrees of fineness is used and as the braids also vary in size the thread must always be adapted to the braid for battenburg lace the thread is in eight sizes the finest being used only for whipping curves or drawing edges into the outlines required the ideal honiton is a new lace made with fancy honiton braid and washsilk floss in dainty colors and is exquisite for doilies mats table scarfs and centerpieces designs sold by lacemakers are usually drawn upon tracing cloth as this is flexible and much more agreeable to work upon than any other material the tracing cloth when the braid is arranged is basted to a foundation of leather or toile cire or smooth wrappingpaper may be basted under the design and will furnish all the support that is necessary while being lighter than the toile cire it must be remembered that the work is really wrong side out while in progress so that it will not show its true beauty until finished and removed from the foundation or pattern according to the braid and thread selected these laces may be made of fairylike fineness or of massive elegancegeneral results being dainty enough for the gown of a bride or sumptuous enough for the adornment of an altar lacemaking establishments will furnish designs of any width or shape desired and will also originate designs for special articles for which there are only occasional calls regular edging designs are ordinarily made in four widthsfrom quite narrow to very wide and not infrequently a handkerchief design is enlarged sufficiently to form a square for a table or a fancy stand in filling in the spaces of any design or pattern the worker may choose the stitches that please her best if she does not like those accompanying the design that she has selected or that has been sent her stitches used in modern lacemaking as in all fancy work which has a set of foundation stitches peculiar to it that may be varied according to the proficiency and ingenuity of the maker so has modern lace a series of primary stitches from which may be evolved many others a large number of illustrations of stitches some of which are primary or foundation stitches while others are combinations are here presented with full instructions for making and the entire series given will make perfectly plain to the student the ease with which she may combine or invent stitches when those of the design she is to work are not to her liking the first stitch given is the main foundation stitch plain point stitches nos 1 and 2point de bruxelles or brussels pointamong the stitches most used in lacemaking is point de bruxelles or brussels point it is simply a buttonhole stitch worked loosely and it must be done with regularity as the beauty of the work depends almost wholly upon the evenness of the stitches brussels point is occasionally used as an edge but is more frequently seen in rows worked back and forth to fill in spaces or as a ground work the illustrations clearly represent the method of making this stitch illustration no 1point de bruxelles brussels point illustration no 2point de bruxelles worked in rows no 3point de venise or venice pointthis stitch is

for groundwork where brussels net is not imitated and is very effective wherever it is used it is begun in the corner or crosswise of the space to be filled a loose point de bruxelles stitch is first taken and fastened to the braid then passed twice through the braid as shown in the illustration and worked in rows backward and forward as follows 1 point de bruxelles stitch then before proceeding to the next stitch pass the needle under the knot over the thread and again under it as shown in the illustration this stitch is very quickly worked illustration no 12 point de fillet net groundwork

stitchthis stitch is used to fill in narrow spaces where great lightness of effect is desired and is usually seen along the sides of insertions and the tops of edgings plain point dalenon is worked over and under in bars in a sort of herringbone pattern and a twisted stitch is made as seen in the engraving by twisting the thread three times around each bar and knotting it at the angles as pictured the effect is similar to one of the drawnwork hemstitches illustration no 19point dalenon with twisted thread no 20point dangleterrethis lace is worked as follows cover the space to be filled in with lines of thread about an eighth of an inch apart then form crosslines intersecting those already made and passing alternately under and over them work a rosette on every spot where two lines cross by working over and under the two lines about 16 times round then twist the thread twice round the groundwork thread and begin to form another rosette at the crossing threads illustration no

written explanation of the methods employed in making them illustration no 21point de fillet and point de reprise no 22point de tullethis stitch is used as a groundwork for very fine work and is worked in rows backward and forward in the same stitch as open point d espagne when this is completed the work is gone over a second time by inserting the needle under one twisted bar bringing it out and inserting it at and bringing it out again at the dot this produces a close double twist which is very effective illustration no 22point de tulle no 23 fan lace stitchcommence at the right side and work as follows first rowmake 1 buttonhole stitch and miss the space of 8 which will leave a long loop second rowmake 8 buttonhole stitches in each loop third rowmake 7 stitches into the spaces

single threads crossing them to form the large squares work a buttonhole stitch at each crossing to make it firm now begin at the top at the right side and fill the first square with brussels net stitches finishing at the lower left corner fill every alternate square in the same way as seen in the picture now cross the open squares diagonally with two threads twisting each thread around the adjoining one as represented carry one thread across all the squares from corner to corner first then twist back fastening at the corner started from cross these threads in the same way from the opposite direction when twisting the thread back from the last set of crossings make a rosette at each center crossing as follows keep the space open with a pin and trace round it with a darning movement five or six times commence at the single thread and work a close buttonhole stitch over the tracing entirely around and then twist along the single thread to the center of the next square this is a very effective design for spaces illustration no 24rose point lace stitch wheels and rosettes wheels and rosettes are used to fill up spaces or in combination to form lace no 25rosette in raised point dangleterrethis rosette is worked in a manner similar to the english wheel the difference being that after each stitch is passed round and under the bars the thread is passed loosely around in the reverse direction as shown in the illustration before proceeding to make the next stitch illustration no 25rosette in raised point dangleterre no 26mechlin lace wheelsthis is one of the prettiest stitches in point lace but also one of the most difficult to work correctly it is made thus work a number of diagonal bars in buttonhole stitch on a single thread in one direction then begin at the opposite side in the same way and work 5 or 6 stitches past the spot where the two lines cross pass the thread round the cross twice under and over the thread to form a circle work in buttonhole stitch half of onequarter make a dot by putting a fine pin in the loop instead of drawing the thread tight and work 3 buttonhole stitches in the loop held open by the pin then take the pin out and continue as before beginners will do well to omit the dot leaving the loop only on the wheel mechlin wheels are also worked in rows upon horizontal and parallel lines of thread illustration no 26mechlin lace wheels no 27english wheelthis is worked in the same manner as sorrento wheels but instead of winding the thread over and under the bars the needle is inserted under each bar and brought out again between the thread and the last stitch this produces a kind of buttonhole stitch and gives the square firm appearance possessed by this wheel illustration no 27english wheel nos 28 and 30sorrento wheelthis is worked by fastening the thread in the pattern to be filled up as indicated by the letters fasten it first to the place a then at place b carrying it back to the middle of the first formed bar by winding it round fasten again at c carrying it back again to the center by winding it around the bar and so on to all the letters then work over and under the bars thus formed

stitches used to connect the various parts of point lace and the beauty of the work depends greatly upon the class of bar selected and its suitability to the lace stitches used nos 31 and 32raleigh barsthese bars are much used in making battenburg lace and are very effective they are worked over a foundation or network of coarse thread and are twisted in places so that they will more easily fall into the desired form by following the numbering from 1 to 21 in no 31 a square place may be easily filled and portions of this arrangement applied to form groundwork of any shape desired upon this

worker illustration no 48third method of making picots or dots in making modern lace the various kinds require appropriate braids there are three classes of these braidsthose for battenburg lace those for plain honiton and point and those for the newest kind of lace which is called the ideal honiton each class of braids contains many designs and widths and a large number of them together with various cords buttons and rings also used are illustrated on following pages fancy braids cords rings and buttons braids the braids cords rings and buttons illustrated upon the following two pages are all used in modern lacemaking they are all made of pure linen thread and according to the fancy the lace including them may be heavy or light royal battenburg lace as originated was heavyin some cases massive but at present many lighter varieties are made as will be surmised upon an inspection of the braids for its manufacture which are represented on the pages mentioned as shown by no 1 these braids are about a third narrower than their actual width and the picot edges numbered 16 and 17 are plain tatting made for the purpose as the picot edges woven for lighter laces are not heavy enough for battenburg lace the numbers opposite the specimens are simply for convenience in ordering if the order is sent the lady mentioned in another part of the book as the pioneer of lacemaking in america but in ordering from other lacemakers or manufacturers of braids these numbers will be of little use as every lacemaker or manufacturer has his or her own individual identifications for materials almost any of the braids or those very similar may be found at large fancy stores but in buying them at such stores be careful to get linen braids as cotton braids do not make pretty lace neither do they wear or launder well in ordering these braids from other lacemakers or from fancy stores it will be necessary to forward the illustration of the kind wanted as the braids cannot be described with sufficient accuracy to obtain the desired varieties some are sold by the yard some by the dozen yards and others by the piece according to the position to be occupied in the work the point honiton and princess braids are represented full size and are much daintier in texture than the battenburg braids of this class of braids see no 2 are made the plain honiton and point laces and the braids for these two laces combined produce the princess lacea creation whose beauty fully entitles it to its royal name the braids seen at no 3 page 21 are those which are used in making the new ideal honiton lace represented in another portion of the book as illustrated these braids are threequarters of their proper widths the top braid no 38 being just one inch wide in the fabric itself the ideal honiton is one of the prettiest laces made and is very appropriate for tidies doilies squares and scarfs it is daintily secured to the finest of lawn in charming designs and then the lawn is cut

the ordinary battenburg is worked with quite thick braid the cord in any size desired is used to follow one edge of the design as will be seen from illustrations upon other following pages rings and

necessity most of the designs and specimens given on this and the following pages are smaller than the articles they represent but they afford a correct idea of the method of making and the beauty of modern lace and also its adaptability to dainty accessories of the toilet and the household as before mentioned any design desired can be obtained from any lacemaking establishment in any size width or shape according to the requirements of the article or lace to be made and individual taste ingenious students will no doubt be able to adapt for themselves the designs offered but it is not advisable for those who have no talent in the matter of drawing or designing to undertake an elaborate adaptation though they may easily accomplish a simple one besides a professional designer will furnish the design for a moderate sum perfectly outlined upon tracing cloth with ink and with the proper fillingin stitches perfectly delineated and if the student wishes it will select the thread and braid appropriate for the design or the student may select the braid she fancies and the designer will then select the thread suitable for the braid no 1 design for a lace handkerchief this design is suitable for point lace braid but is of course very much reduced in size in order to show the effect and arrangement of a design ready for working as sent out from the lacemakers by a reference to the various stitches illustrated on preceding pages the stitches shown in one corner of the design may be readily identified the following engraving shows how braid is applied to a design before the stitches are begun illustration no 1design for a lace handkerchief no 2 method of placing braid upon designs this illustration shows the method of arranging braid upon designs for modern lace and how after the braid is basted along the pattern the tracing cloth is basted to toile cire or to smooth light brown wrapping paper to provide sufficient firmness for working the following instructions apply particularly to engraving no 2 but their principle should be observed and applied to any design decided upon as good results in lacemaking largely depend upon the arrangement of the braid run on a straight line of braid for the lower edge with fine stitches working as shown from left to right take another piece of braid or the other end of the same piece and begin to lay the braid by running stitches in its center keeping it as smooth and even as possible the outer edge presents no difficulty but the inner edge will not lie evenly without being drawn in by a needle and thread as follows fasten whipping thread securely and insert the needle in and out of the edge of the braid as if for fine gathering this thread when drawn up will keep the braid in its place two or three fasteningoff stitches should be worked when each circle half circle or rounded curve of a pattern is finished as the drawing or gathering thread remains in the work and forms an important though unseen part of its structure before cutting off the braid run a few stitches across it to prevent it from widening joins should be avoided but when a join is indispensable stitch the braid together open and turn back the ends and stitch each portion down separately when passing the thread from one part to another run it along the center of the braid allowing the stitches to show as little as possible in commencing make a few stitches leaving the end of the thread on the wrong side and cutting it off afterwards in fastening off make a tight buttonhole stitch run in three stitches bring the needle out at the back and cut off illustration no 2method of placing braid upon designs no 3 royal battenburg lace bureauscarf the engraving on the opposite page represents the article above mentioned and shows the effectiveness of this magnificent and durable lace in actual size the scarf is about a yard and onehalf long and onehalf yard wide and is made of a heavy battenburg braid having a fancy edge see nos 5 or 7 on page 20 and cord rings and buttons the main part of the design is outlined with the braid cord is used as a veining for the leaves and the rings and buttons are introduced here and there over the surface as seen in the picture raleigh bars with picots connect the border and center designs while the palms along the border as well as other small spaces are filled in with point turque and point de grecque stitches sorrento bars are also used in some of the long leaflike spaces while in a few of the circular spaces point dangleterre rosettes are introduced these rosettes are also frequently called spiders and are made according to the space large or small and according to the requirements of the braid selected heavy or light for convenience in giving the name of this lace the full title is rarely usedbattenburg lace being considered sufficient to identify the fabric from the other and lighter laces battenburg lace is made both heavy and light according to personal taste or the object for which the lace is intended but it was originally designed for heavy work only illustration no 3royal battenburg lace bureauscarf no 4 point lace doily for a toilet cushion this dainty doily may be made of the point lace braids illustrated at nos 30 and 31 together with the picot edging no 36 seen on page 20 in filling in the spaces thread suitable for the braid is used and the stitches are point de valenciennes point despagne sorrento bars point de bruxelles open rings and spiders as all of these stitches with many others are illustrated in that section of this book devoted to stitches it will be unnecessary to repeat the details for making as they are fully given in the department mentioned it will also be understood that most of the articles illustrated are not of full size but in some instances are nearly so the doily just described is illustrated about threequarters of its actual size but by using a fine braid a doily of fairylike texture and just the size of the engraving may be produced any one accustomed to drawing may enlarge this or any of the designs given but only clever fingers should try this experiment illustration no 4point lace doily for a toilet cushion no 5 battenburg edging with cord this is a very elegant looking lace though simply made after the regular battenburg method a plain braid no 10 page 20 is chosen to form the outlines and after the stitches are filled in cord of a suitable size is carried around the petals and foliage of the design and rows of it are also used to indicate the vine though the latter may be outlined with the tape and then with the cord the petals of the blossoms are filled in in point de bruxelles and point de venise stitches while point despagne and point brabanon are used for the foliage and vine point grecque and dalenon bars are also used at the very heart of the blossom and raleigh network bars connect the design to the edge and are dotted here and there with spiders illustration no 5battenburg lace with cord no 6 battenburg insertion with cord this insertion matches the edging or lace above described and is therefore made in exactly the same way except that the design is double both the edging and insertion may be made of any width desired and the design will be found very pretty for fancyedge or plain braids without the cord buttons or rings may be used in place of the spiders seen in the engravings if preferred illustration no 6battenburg insertion with cord no 7 design for a honiton lace cap the design illustrated is of necessity much smaller than the cap it is intended for but the clever student may easily enlarge it to or design one for herself of the size required lacemakers will duplicate designs in any size desired for a moderate sum thus saving the amateur much work and at the same time putting her to little expense the design here illustrated might also be used for handkerchief corners scarfends etc etc and any of the stitches illustrated on preceding pages may be selected for fillingin purposes illustration no 7design for a honiton lace cap no 8 design for a corner in battenburg point or honiton lace according to the article to be decorated this design will be found appropriate for either of the braids used for the laces above mentioned for table scarfs tidies heavy borders etc etc the battenburg braids should be selected but for handkerchiefs or doilies the point or honiton braids are the proper ones to choose for this design raleigh bars brussels point and any other stitches preferred may be used in filling in the spaces when a design is procured from a lacemaker a portion of it is always marked with the stitches to be used but this is not an arbitrary matter since the one who is to make the lace may desire to and may insert other stitches in preference to those indicated illustration no 8design for a corner in battenburg point or honiton lace no 9 doily in ideal honiton lacework and linen lawn one of the prettiest and the very newest of the modern laces is here illustrated it is made of two of the many varieties of honiton braids washsilk floss and linen lawn the braid is basted smoothly upon a square of lawn in the design illustrated though individual taste will no doubt suggest many other equally pretty designs after which the inner edges of the braid are permanently secured by a short and long stitch this is merely a short and long buttonhole stitch reversed so that the cross loops are on the edge of the braid while the stitches them selves extend beyond the braid into the lawn as seen in the engraving two short stitches alternate with single long ones throughout this part of the work the outer edges are then fastened to the square by tiny buttonhole scollops then the lawn is cut from under the squares formed by the braid and the openings are buttonholed through the lawn and braid so that the edges of the lawn will not fray when this is done the spaces are filled in with fancy stitches and when they are completed the lawn is cut away from the edgescollops with a pair of fine sharp scissors in the doily illustrated spiders and point de venise stitches are used for filling in the spaces the floss used may be white or tinted the latter washing as well as the white but as a rule white or yellow flosses are selected in preference to other colors ideal honiton scarfs tidies doilies pillow shams tray cloths etc etc may be purchased with the braid already basted on in a pretty design and with the necessary threads or floss or they may be designed at home and by either method will result in a beautiful variety of modern lace illustration no 9doily of ideal honiton lace and linen lawn no 10 design for a corner in battenburg lace although this design is intended for battenburg lace and may be made up of any of the braids used for that kind of lace it will also be found suitable for the finer point or honiton braids for handkerchiefs doilies mats etc etc as illustrated it would be suitable for a handkerchief enlarged and followed in battenburg braid it would make a very handsome border for a tablescarf curtains or draperies or a substantial decoration for a gown of wash fabric or other goods raleigh bars spiders and point de bruxelles stitches are used for filling in and a dainty picot edge is sewed to the outer line of the braid plain or fancy braid may be used for this design if fancy loopedge braid is selected the picot edge will not be needed the loops taking its place illustration no 10design for a corner in battenburg lace no 11 battenburg edging the edging here illustrated is represented about onethird less than its actual width but the design is so distinctly brought out that its beauty in any width may be readily conceived it is formed of fancy battenburg braid but may be made from a plain variety if preferred the design is known as the fern leaf and is easy to follow sorrento bars are used to connect the work and spiders are made here and there to add variety to the work point de bruxelles stitches are used to fill in the spaces at the sides of the leaves and with the fancy braid produce a very dainty delicate effect illustration no 11battenburg edging no 12 battenburg insertion this insertion is made to match the edging seen above it but is much wider than the edging though formed of the same braid either design could be varied so as to result in an edging and insertion of equal width or the edging could be arranged for an insertion and the insertion illustrated changed into an edging illustration no 12battenburg insertion no 13 fingerbowl doily of princess lace and linen lawn princess lace also known as duchesse lace as elsewhere mentioned results from combining honiton and point lace braids in one design and a charming specimen of this lovely lace is here illustrated the doily is pictured only a trifle smaller than its actual size and even in its full size is a very dainty affair after the braids are basted along the design they are then connected by twisted bars that are an adaptation from the point dalenon bars with the twisted stitch and the spaces are filled in in small dangleterre rosettes or spiders as few bars as possible are employed for the spiders in order to produce a very delicate effect the lawn center is added last illustration no 13fingerbowl doily of princess lace and linen lawn no 14 design for insertion or a centerpiece in battenburg lace as suggested by the title the design here presented may be used for insertion or for a center to a table cloth or scarf or a handsome spread as represented it is intended for a centerpiece and the lace from which the engraving was made is about halfayard long and onefourth of a yard wide the groundwork is formed of raleigh bars made with picots and the loops of braid are filled in with twisted point dalenon bars this centerpiece is very pretty made of ribbon with silk thread for the bars and in this event it may be made of any color desired and added to a spread or scarf of surah silk or fine cloth for which a border to match may be made illustration no 14design for insertion or a centerpiece in battenburg lace no 15 queen anne traycloth of battenburg lace and linen this pretty cloth is intended for a queen anne tray and its lace edges curve upward and just over the rim of the tray when it is laid upon it the center is of fine tablelinen while the edge is formed of battenburg braid buttons and fancy stitches as will be seen the corner spaces are filled in with point dangleterre rosettes or spiders the large border spaces and corresponding corner ones are filled in with picot bars while the very fine work seen in the triangles and square spaces are point de venise stitches and halfspiders are made in the other triangles the narrow straight inner border is composed of bars and tiny buttons arranged as represented the cloth is hemstitched before the braid is laid on and the corners are cut out from underneath after the work is otherwise completed illustration no 15queen anne traycloth of battenburg lace and linen no 16 design for a butterfly in point lace full size butterflies for the corners of handkerchiefs scarfends and the points of caps or coiffures are favorite designs in point and honiton laces the one illustrated is very dainty and exceedingly simple to execute the upper portion of each wing has a point de reprise groundwork but the solid sections are tiny spiders instead of point de reprise triangles the outer tips of the wings are filled in with raleigh bars while similar bars point de bruxelles stitches and a point dangleterre rosette complete the lower wings any of the fine point or honiton braids may be chosen for the outlining of the butterfly and a fine overandover stitch or fine cord may be used to mark the lines extending from the head illustration no 16design for a butterfly in point lace full size no 17 design for a doily or handkerchief of point or honiton lace this design as illustrated is of course too small for either a doily or handkerchief but an expert lacemaker can enlarge it to any size desired and the clever amateur will find no difficulty in doing the same thing as the outlines are not at all intricate and may be easily followed in sending for the braid for this or similar designs it is advisable to permit the lacemaker addressed to select them and of course the thread since her long experience enables her at once to correctly judge what materials are appropriate for the articles you wish to make especially if she knows the size the article is desired to be the stitches as here indicated are point dangleterre rosettes and point de fillet with small spiders on the latter a dainty picotbraid edges the design illustration no

battenburg braid and plain raleigh bars the design is not especially definite in its outlines and may be imitated with any variations which may seem pleasing to the copyist the picots are made after the method directed at the illustration of point de venise bars in the department devoted to stitches cardinals point of genuine make is of italian origin and in the earlier eras was largely used for the decoration of church vestments and draperies illustration no 18cardinals point lace nos 19 and 20 battenburg edging and insertion with cord these two engravings show a very pretty design for battenburg lace made with a cord finish the application of the cord has been fully described elsewhere where a different design of the same kind of work is given in the present instance the spaces are filled in with twisted bars spiders and rosettes in point dangleterre the specimens from which the engravings were made are a trifle wider than seen in the pictures but the width is a matter of individual taste and also a result of the braid selected a professional lacemaker will enlarge or adapt the design to accord with personal requirements illustration no 19battenburg edging with cord illustration no 20battenburg insertion with cord no 21 tapeguipure design found in an old church the design here illustrated was found in the old church of santa margherita in italy it was drawn on parchment and was undoubtedly intended as a design for altar lace it was mentioned in a book of accounts for the year 1592 found in the archives of the church designated and is therefore of antique origin but it may be easily adapted to modern methods of lacemaking and could be appropriately filled in with either italian or genoa lace stitches or with a combination of both and twisted bars done with fancy battenburg braid it would be quite similar in effect to the cardinals point illustrated on another page illustration no 21tapeguipure design found in an old church no 22 battenburg church lace the engraving opposite illustrates a magnificent specimen of modern church lace made of battenburg braid with a limited introduction of honiton braid the specimen itself is considerably wider than represented but as the width is a matter of individual taste the engraving will serve as a design for a narrow church lace sorrento bars are used to connect the braids and to form foundations for the spiders or rosettes here and there inserted and the lace is delicately bordered with a dainty picotbraid the fancy stitches in the main portions of the cross are point de valenciennes while those in the minor sections are point de bruxelles point de fillet is used for the central portion of the large tshaped symbol while the stitch forming the other symbol is one never used except for church lace and consists of two or three sets of fine stitches so interlaced as to seem to form one solid stitch in making church lace any insignia desired can be introduced by a professional designeran accomplishment that is usually beyond the inventive powers of the novice in lacemaking illustration no 22battenburg church lace no 23 english needlepoint this is a very handsome design combining the

no 26 design for table scarf in battenburg lace the scarfend from which this design was copied is about ten inches deep and it is about fourteen or fifteen inches wide it will be seen from these dimensions that it is impossible to produce a fullsize design of it on these pages but one of any size desired may be obtained at any lacemakers or a clever student of lacemaking may enlarge the design to suit her own requirements according to the size of the scarfend wide or narrow braid must be selected with thread to correspond the stitches used in filling in are point de fillet point de

the same time but rosettes or spiders may be worked in place of the rings if preferred the corner spaces are filled in in point brabanon and for those at each side point de bruxelles is used the doily

fabrics or those of cotton fabrics which will not need renovating illustration no 29modern russian lace no 30 russian lace this engraving represents a specimen of genuine russian lace made of fine braid and wrought with bars similar to raleigh bars except that they have no picots the russians have always been noted for their exquisite needlework but as a nation they have never had any established lace manufactory the workers of the small amount of lace produced are scattered about at their own houses and many of them are poor ladies of gentle birth most of the laces however are made by the peasantry who bring them to st petersburg where sale for them is found illustration no 30russian lace no 31 bowknot design for modern lace this fashionable design may be developed in various widths and braids as an insertion or as an appliqu on lawn the groundwork may be formed of raleigh bars or of twisted bars made like the network for raleigh bars the loops of the bows may be

lace handkerchief illustration no 32princess lace doily design no 33 altar lace battenburg this very elegant specimen of altar lace is in reality about nine or ten inches deep but for want of space the engraving represents it as only about half as wide the design however is perfect in detail and the illustration fully displays its effectiveness and discloses the variety of connecting and fillingin stitches used a delicate battenburg braid is chosen for the foundation and in addition to regular lace stitches those from drawn work are here and there interspersed the cross is filled in in point de venise or side stitch as it is sometimes called and the same stitch is seen in the central design at each side of the cross drawnwork effects are seen also in these central figures and along the borders sorrento bars are here made and knotted at the center like drawn strands or are connected by rosettes or spiders made in drawnwork style at the center of the cross is a large drawnwork wheel while small maltese crosses and halfcrosses are made elsewhere in the work by the drawnwork method sorrento bars taking the place of the usual strands the central section of the border at the right of the cross is done in point de bruxelles which is afterward buttonholed as in barwork and a buttonhole picot edge follows the lower outlines of the pattern raleigh bars with picots form

open spiders and the latter are distributed elsewhere as will be seen by inspecting the engraving point de grecque is also introduced into some of the spaces and raleigh bars are used for the groundwork any of the stitches previously described may be used in making such a collar if those mentioned are not admired and the addition of buttons or rings will improve the work greatly

these illustrated in the department devoted to stitches the various kinds here used may be easily identified they consist of point de venise point de bruxelles sorrento and dalenon bars and spiders a

arrange her braid for any purpose she desires fine raleigh bars form the connecting work and a buttonhole picotfinish is made along the edge of the braid which forms the border in making an edging a definite outline could be kept for the lower edge and above this an irregular or indefinite outline arranged illustration no 50roman lace coral pattern no 51 tidy of battenburg lace the tidy here illustrated is made entirely of battenburg lace and is a beautiful specimen of this kind of work the border design is the same as the one previously described for a pillowsham except that but one row of the blossoms and foliage is used the center is composed of rows of braid crossed to form squares or open spaces that are filled in with rosettes in point dangleterre this center is attached to the braid at the inner edge of the border by a series of bars arranged in dalenon style and then wrought with the thread after the method used in danvers bars this tidy enlarged forms an elegant design for a pillowsham when laid over a tinted silk spread or pillow a sham of this design shows its full beauty when the braid is basted on in the outlines desired the remainder of the work will be a pleasing pastime as none of it is so fine as to require very close attention illustration no 51tidy of battenburg lace no 52 modern lace a handsome specimen of lace is here illustrated it will be observed that the braid from which it is made is woven like fine binding braid and in this respect differs from any of the lacebraids herein illustrated it will also be seen that no two figures of the design are alike and that various stitches are used in completing them many being combinations of or adaptations from the stitches illustrated at the beginning of this pamphlet the engraving is sufficiently plain to enable the worker to decide which stitches are used alone or in combination and to guide her correctly in their application the picotedge is done in point de venise stitch illustration no 52modern lace no 53 modernpoint lace edging this is an easy design to follow and is simply made heavy sorrento bars with picot loops form the groundwork while the fillingin stitches are of the same class done in fine thread in regular squares and also a combination of point de fillet and point de grecque a dainty picotfinish is added at the lower edge this edging is pretty for bordering draperies or decorating dresses and may be made as fine or as coarse as desired illustration no 53modernpoint lace edging no 54 square in modernpoint lace in this design will be observed a favorite combinationthe rose and the butterfly close inspection will also disclose that the fillingin stitches are of a diverse character and that to this diversification much of the beauty of the work is due as most of the stitches are easily recognized and as the copyist can easily adapt methods for the combinations seen it will not be necessary to definitely describe them the square may be used for a scarfend in connection with the edging no 53 seen on page 91 if the braid selected is sufficiently fine when coarser braid is chosen the square will be pretty for doilies tidies or the center of a table spread the design may be daintily made up of ribbon with silk for the stitches in this event it may be set into a scarf or drapery of china or surah silk with charming results illustration no 54square in modernpoint lace no 55 louis xiv curtainlace this is a very popular decoration for curtains and vestibule doors and is made of heavy cru or white net and braid the design selected is generally a border with a corner piece and sometimes a center piece the specimen here given is simply a square of the net decorated as illustrated to convey an idea of this at present fashionable curtain lace the design is first traced on tracing cloth that is then underlaid with brown paper to hold it stiffly in place the net is then laid over this and smoothly basted down so that the tracing shows through plainly then cru or white battenburg braid is used to follow the design and is shaped into the leaves and flowers seen rings being used for the centers of the blossoms and cru or white cord for the stems the net is cut from under the rings at the centers of the large roses and each opening is filled in with point de fillet and english wheels the effect is very rich and the work is not difficult to do when a curtain is thus embroidered or decorated with braid it is bordered the same as the square illustrated or upon that principle with rows and points of battenburg braid ribbon is often used in this way for tidies bureau scarfs and various other little household decorations and in this event the flower and foliage tints may be carried out in the design illustration no 55louis xiv curtainlace darnednet scarfs kerchiefs tidies edgings insertions etc etc with designs for the same and other articles bobbin net or bobbinet or net as it is now commonly called was first made by machinery in 1809 and was so called because the threads from which it was made were wound upon bobbins and twisted into meshes instead of being looped in knitting style as they were previous to the invention of the machine the latter was invented by john heathcoat the son of an english farmer but to france must be given the credit of introducing the darned work by which some of its costliest net laces were first made from these laces originated the industry of darning net by machinery and by hand and in all grades from fine silkblonde and brussels net to the coarsest wash net such as is used for curtains and draperies in the earlier days the pattern was stamped on the net by means of wooden blocks and the net was then placed in a frame and the darner with her left hand under the lace followed the design with her needle and cotton linen or silk floss held over the work in the right hand this method may be employed at the present time or the design may be drawn on thick paper and the net basted over it or if the net is coarse the design may be followed by counting the meshes and inserting the needle and floss accordingly or the design may be transferred to the net itself by black or colored pencils or stamping the darner must decide for herself which method for holding the work she will use some of the most expert darners simply hold the net loosely in their hands and copy the design by eye alone washsilk floss india floss which is of linen but looks like silk and ordinary darning flosses are all used for this work darned net is liked for many purposes as will be observed by the variety of designs and illustrations given on these pages no 1 scarfend of darned net this illustration pictures a very pretty scarfend but presents it only half of its actual width the scarf is about a yard in length and is darned with linen floss and edged with the finest featheredge braid the center portions of the flowers and foliage are cut out after the solid darning is made and the spaces are then filled in with a fancy mesh done with fine cotton in point de bruxelles stitch illustration no 1scarfend of darned net half size no 2 narrow cuff of

97 and as represented the corner is only onehalf its actual size the kerchief itself is about twentytwo inches square and is very dainty in effect the stars which fill in the central portion are very simple to make and the eyelets in each are punched with a bodkin and then worked once around in point de bruxelles or buttonhole stitch the kerchief is made of fine brussels net and the darning is done with india floss illustration no 3corner of kerchief of darned net half size no 4 tidy of darned net this engraving represents a charming little tidy made of coarse washnet darned with washsilk floss in oriental colorings the tidy has an inch wide hem and is about eleven inches wide and twelve long the hem is fastened down by three rows of darning stitches the outer row being deep garnet the middle row bright oldrose and the inner row deep orange one small fan is made of the orange and paleblue another of the oldrose with sulphuryellow and the third peacockblue and crimson one large fan is made of palepink and silvergray darned together and woodbrown another is made of the garnet and the sulphuryellow while the third is made of orange and paleblue the scrolls meeting at the center are made one of woodbrown one of sulphuryellow and one of garnet and the rest of the design is made in different shades of dull green laid over white this tidy is very effective it may be darned in one color on white black or cru net if preferred and with linen floss illustration no 4tidy of darned net no 5 tieend of darned net a tieend in its actual width is here illustrated the tie is about threequarters of a yard long and is darned in allover style in the design seen in the engraving with linen floss a line of fine featheredge braid finishes the tie in a dainty manner this design may be used for any other article preferred and its details will also suggest other designs of a similar character which may be invented by the worker this scarf as well as the others just described may be made up in black if preferred and in this event it will be easier for the darner to follow the meshes if she bastes her net over a white background the design may or not be traced on this background illustration no 5tieend of darned net full width no 6 darnednet edging with overwrought stitch this handsome edging is darned upon a wide strip of net with coarse and fine embroidery cotton and after the pattern is completed the lower edge of the net is cut away the coarse cotton is used to outline the design and fill in some of the central portions while the fine is darned in between the outer and center portions and is used for the overwrought portions these portions are run back and forth loosely to form a raised foundation for the buds and rosecenters before the overwrought work is done the edging is given fullsize and no difficulty will be experienced in following the design or making the lace and the design may be adapted to any article of wear that can be made of darned net a scarf or kerchief dotted with rosebuds made like those of this design would be a very dainty article of personal adornment and the buds might be made of palepink or yellow floss with a charming effect the floral idea might be further carried out by using shaded green floss for the foliage illustration no 6darnednet edging with overwrought stitch full size nos 7 and 8 darnednet edgings it will not be necessary to give special instructions for either of the edgings here illustrated as both are given full size and the designs are perfectly distinct no 7 is finished with a buttonholed scallop from

purchased three and onehalf yards wide if desired illustration no 7darnednet edging illustration no 8darnednet edging no 9 pillowsham of darned net this engraving represents one of the many uses to which darned net is put moderately coarse net was selected and the darning was done with linen floss in the various patterns seen and which are repeated in a larger form on the following pages the sham was hemmed after the darning was finished and a frill of darnednet edging was then added tinted silk or sateen should be laid under such a sham in order to bring out the beauty of the work the ambitious darner may make a bedspread to correspond with her shams if she has the time to devote to the task and the patience to complete it and in making such a set she need not confine herself to the designs here given but may select any others she admires or may originate a design herself individual ideas as to decoration so widely differ that clever workers are sure to evolve designs of various characters and a generally uniform beauty blossoms leaves carvings oriental figures brocades etc etc all afford dainty ideas for designs for darned net illustration no 9pillowsham of darned

of the draperyscarf from which this engraving was made is about fourteen inches square and the sides are turned under for about a quarter of an inch or a little more and darned down closely to represent a selvedge the design is oriental in outline and is easy to follow as represented the scarf is made of white net and darned with white linen floss but the oriental effect may be carried out more perfectly if the darning is done with colored flosses with an intermingling of silver or gilt thread white black cru or colored net may be used two ends are made and then gathered to a smaller square of net this small square is then drawn together through the center under a bow of wide satin ribbon and the scarf is then fastened to the article of furniture it is to decorate to its ends may

is very easy to follow and is illustrated full size it might be used to border the lower edge of a wide flounce for a petticoat or with equal propriety applied to a tidy or a window drapery providing the worker regulates the size of the design appropriately for the work in hand for window draperies it would need to be much broader and larger in other ways than as represented illustration no

pretty indeed and the design may be put to any of the many uses for which darned net is suitable it is pretty for yokes pillowshams counterpanes infants dresses and carriagerobes parasolcovers sofapillow covers and in fact for any article that may be made of lace the points of the flounce are darned back and forth in selvedge effect but they may be worked in buttonhole stitch if preferred a

elaborating an adults attire illustration no 20design in darned net no 21 design for a yoke or section of a garment in darned net the yoke sleeves collar cuffs and flounce of a childs dress were beautifully darned in the design illustrated by this engraving and the effect was far more charming than can be conveyed by a picture the little gown was airy enough for a sprite and its greatest cost was in the outlay of the time devoted to its construction and even this could not be counted a real outlay as only odd moments of leisure were employed in making the pretty garment white net white floss and white india lawn were the composing materials illustration no 21design for a yoke or section of a garment in darned net nos 22 and 23 designs for darned net both of these designs are very pretty for diverse purposes and also very easy to follow either may be used as a heading an insertion or a border separately or in conjunction with other designs many of the suggestions given concerning other designs upon previous pages will apply to these two designs which fact leaves little to suggest for them individually each darner will think out for herself many uses to which to put designs many combinations in which they will prove effective and many colorings suggested by the tints which govern her room or her wardrobe all of which would be an impossible task for any one person
