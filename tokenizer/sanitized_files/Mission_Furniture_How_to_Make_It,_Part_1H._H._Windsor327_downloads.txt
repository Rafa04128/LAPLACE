suitable for dining room use illustration details of chair construction a mission chair suitable for the dining room can be made from any one of the furniture woods to match the other articles of furniture the materials can be secured from the planing mill dressed and sandpapered ready to cut the tenons and mortises the material list can be made up from the dimensions given in the detail drawing the front legs or posts as well as the back ones are made from 134in square stock the back ones having a slope of 2 in from the seat to the top all the slats are made from 78in material and of such widths as are shown in the detail the three upright slats in the back are 34in material the detail drawing shows the side and back the front being the same as the back from the seat down all joints are mortised in the posts as shown the joints however can be made with dowels if desired if making dowel joints they must be clamped very tight when glued and put together the seat can be made from one piece of 78in material fitted with notches around the posts this is then upholstered with leather without using springs leather must be selected as to color to suit the kind of wood used in making the chair the seat can also be made with an open center for a cane bottom by making a square of four pieces of 78in material about 4 in wide these pieces are fitted neatly to the proper size and dowelled firmly together after the cane is put in the opening the cane is covered over and upholstered with leather in the same manner as with a solid bottom how to make a lamp stand and shade a library light stand of pleasing design and easy construction is made as follows square up a piece of white oak so that it shall have a width and thickness of 134 in with a length of 13 in square up two pieces of the same kind of material to the same width and thickness but with a length of 12 in each square up two pieces to a width and length of 3 in each with a thickness of 118 in if a planing mill is near time and patience will be saved by ordering one piece 134 in square and 40 in long two pieces 118 in thick and 3 in square all planed and sandpapered on all surfaces the long piece can then be cut at home to the lengths specified above the 13in piece is for the upright and should have a 12in hole bored the full length through the center if the bit is not long enough to reach entirely through bore from each end then use a redhot iron to finish this hole is for the electric wire or gas pipe if gas is used the two pieces for the base are alike except the groove of one is cut from the top and of the other from the under side as shown shape the under sides first this can best be done by placing the two pieces in a vise under sides together and boring two holes with a 1in bit the center of each hole will be 212 in from either end and in the crack between the pieces the pieces can then be taken out lines gauged on each side of each and the wood between the holes removed with turning saw and scraper steel illustration the completed lamp the width of the grooves must be determined by laying one piece upon the other a trysquare should be used to square the lines across the pieces however gauge for depth gauging both pieces from their top surfaces chisel out the grooves and round off the corners as shown in the sketch using a 34in radius these parts may be put together and fastened to the upright by means of two long screws from the under side placed to either side of the 12in hole this hole must be continued through the pieces forming the base the braces are easiest made by taking the two pieces which were planed to 118 in thick and 3 in square and drawing a diagonal on each find the middle of this diagonal by drawing the central portion of the other diagonal at this point place the spur of the bit and bore a 1in hole in each block saw the two blocks apart sawing along a diagonal of each plane the surfaces on the saw cut smooth and sandpaper the curve made by the bit fasten the braces in place by means of roundhead blued screws to make a shade such as is shown in the illustration is rather difficult the shade is made of wood glued up and has art glass fitted in rabbets cut on the inner edges such shades can be purchased ready to attach the sketch shows one method of attaching four small pieces of strap iron are bent to the shape shown and fastened to the four sides of the upright electric globestwo three or four may be attached as shown illustration construction of shade the kind of wood finish for the stand will depend upon the finish on the wooden shade if shade is purchased brown flemish is obtained by first staining the wood with flemish water stain diluted by the addition of two parts water to one part stain when this is dry sandpaper the whiskers which were raised by the water and fill with a medium dark filler directions will be found on the filler cans when filler has hardened apply two coats of wax illustration details of construction of library lamp stand the metal shade as shown in the sketch is a layout for a copper or brass shade of a size suitable for this particular lamp such shades are frequently made from one piece of sheet metal and designs are pierced in them as suggested in the layout this piercing is done by driving the point of a nail through the metal from the under side before the parts are soldered or riveted together if the parts are to be riveted enough additional metal must be left on the last panel to allow for a lap no lap is needed when joints are soldered a better way and one which will permit the use of heavier metal is to cut each side of the shade separately and fasten them together by riveting a piece of metal over each joint the shape of this piece can be made so as to accentuate the rivet heads and thus give a pleasing effect for artglass the metal panels are cut out the glass is inserted from the under side and held in place by small clips soldered to the frame of the shade pleasing effects are obtained by using one kind of metal as brass and reinforcing and riveting with another metal such as copper illustration details of homemade porch seat how to make a porch chair the illustration shows a very comfortable and attractive porch chair that can be made with few tools and easily procured material most any kind of wood will answer says the american carpenter and builder but if open grained wood such as oak or chestnut is used the parts should be filled with a paste filler if the natural color of the wood is not desired the wood may first be stained the filler being colored somewhat darker than the stain procure enough lumber to make all the pieces shown in the detail drawing and finish to the dimensions shown being careful to make the corresponding pieces exactly alike in order to preserve the perfect symmetry which is necessary in work of this kind in boring the holes care must be taken to keep both edges of the holes sharp and clean the holes should each be bored until the spur shows the bit should then be withdrawn and the rest of the boring be done from the other side the semicircular notches are made by placing the two pieces edge to edge in the vise and placing the spur of the bit in the crack the 1in bit is used as it will be difficult to finish the boring of these blocks from the second side the parts remaining may be cut out with the knife after the pieces have been separated five 12in dowel rods are needed it is possible to get these in one long piece if you happen to live near a mill and then all you will have to do is to saw off the desired lengths however if they cannot be got easily you can make your own two rods each 1814 in long two rods each 2014 in and one rod 2214 in give the exact lengths it is well to cut each piece a little longer than required so that the ends which are imperfectly formed may be cut off these rods should fit tight and may be fastened in addition with a small screw or nail from the under or back side illustration porch chair finished the hand rests should be nailed to the arms with small nails or brads before the arms are bolted the illustration of the assembled chair shows the relative position the bolts should be 14 in and of the following lengths 4 bolts 214 in long 2 bolts 2 in long 2 bolts 3 in long washers should be placed between adjacent pieces of wood fastened together with bolts and also at both ends of the bolts this will require 26 washers in all while the size of the chair may be varied it will be necessary to keep the proportions if the parts are to fold properly how to make a tabouret secure from the planing mill the following pieces and have them planed and sandpapered on two surfaces for the top one piece 78 in thick and 17 in square for the legs four pieces 78 in thick 434 in wide and 1812 in long for the lower stretchers two pieces 78 in thick 234 in wide and 1534 in long for the top stretchers two pieces 78 in thick 214 in wide and 1314 in long no stock need be ordered for the keys as they can be made out of the waste pieces remaining after the legs are shaped begin work on the four legs first while both sides of each leg slope it will be necessary to plane a joint edge on each leg from which to lay out the mortises grooves and to test the ends it will be necessary to have a bevel square to use in marking off the slopes and for testing them to get the setting for the bevel square make a full sized lay out or drawing of the necessary lines in their proper relation to one another and adjust the bevel to those lines from the joint edge lay out the mortises grooves and the slopes of sides and ends of the legs cut the mortises and grooves first then shape up the sides saw the sides accurately and quite close to the lines finishing with the steel cabinet scraper illustration details of tabouret next make the bottom stretchers in laying out the cross lap joint the working faces are both to be up when the joint is completed therefore lay off one groove on the face of one piece and on the side opposite the face on the other in gauging for depth however be careful to keep the gauge block against the working face of each piece in laying out the mortises for the keys the opening on the top surface is to be made 18 in longer than on the under surface the slope of the key will therefore be 18 in of slope to each 78 in of length the drawing shows the mortise as 78 in from the shoulders of the tenon this distance is the same as the thickness of the leg and to insure the keys pulling the shoulder up against the leg firmly should any of the legs happen to be a little less than 78 in it is well to make the mortise slightly nearer the shoulder than 78 in it is a good plan to lay out the mortise in the tenon at the same time the shoulders of the tenons are laid out otherwise the joint edge being cut off in making the tenon there is no convenient way to locate this mortise accurately lay off the top stretchers according to the dimensions shown in the drawing observe the same precautions about the cross lap joint as were given for the lower stretchers except that the joint edges are to be placed up in this latter case make sure the grooves are laid out in the middle before cutting as a test place the pieces side by side examine the markings then turn one of them end for end and again examine the grooves into which the legs pass are 18 in deep and must be very carefully cut their purpose is to give rigidity to the tabouret frame bore two holes in each stretcher for the screws that are to fasten the top in place make the keys scrape all the parts and sandpaper those that were not so treated at the mill use glue to fasten the tops of the legs to the top stretchers and assemble these parts the top is octagonal or eightsided to make it square up a piece to 1612 by 1612 in measure the diagonal take onehalf of it and measure from each corner of the board each way along the edges to locate the places at which to cut off the corners connect these points saw and plane the remaining four sides there is to be a 58in bevel on the under side of the top scrape and sandpaper these edges and secure the top to the stretchers with screws illustration tabouret as completed much time can be saved and a better result obtained if the wood finishing is done before the parts are put together especially is this true if stain and filler are used a very pretty finish and one easily put on even after the parts are put together is obtained as follows take a barrel and stuff up the cracks or paste paper over them so as to make it as near airtight as possible in some outoftheway place put a dish with about 2 oz of strong ammonia set the tabouret over this dish and quickly invert the barrel over the tabouret allow the fumes to act on the wood for at least 15 hours remove the barrel and allow the fumes to escape polish with several coats of wax such as is used upon floors directions for waxing will be found on the cans that contain the wax this produces the rich nutbrown finish so popular in arts and crafts furniture and is known as fumed oak how to make a morris chair the stock necessary to make a morris chair of craftsman design as shown in the engraving can be purchased millplaned and sandpapered on four sides as given in the following list 4 posts 134 by 3 by 26 in 2 front and back rails 78 by 512 by 24 in 2 side rails 78 by 512 by 28 in 2 arm pieces 78 by 512 by 37 in 7 slats 38 by 2 by 24 in 2 cleats 1 by 1 by 2212 in 2 back stiles 1 by 212 by 2412 in 2 back rails 1 by 2 by 17 in 3 back slats 38 by 112 by 19 in 1 back support 34 by 34 by 24 in 2 support rests 1 by 112 by 812 in 2 dowels 12 in diameter 6 in long first make and put together the sides of the chair while the glue is setting on these parts make and assemble the back the front and back rails may next be made and placed and the cleats and bottom slats fastened with the adjustment of the back the chair is ready for the finish the posts are to be tenoned on the upper ends these tenons are to project 316 in above the arm and should be slightly beveled the lower ends of the posts likewise all other projecting ends should be beveled to avoid their splintering all sharp corners as on the arms should be sandpapered just enough to take their sharpness off so as not to injure the hand that the chair may be properly inclined the rear posts are cut 1 in shorter than the forward ones to get the correct slant on the bottoms of these posts lay a straightedge so that its edge touches the bottom of the front post at its front surface but keep it 1 in above the bottom of the rear post mark with pencil along the straightedge across both posts illustration complete morris chair without cushion illustration details of a morris chair at the rear ends of the arms are the notched pieces that allow the back to be adjusted to different angles these pieces may be fastened in place either by means of roundhead screws from above or flatheads from underneath the arms the notches are to be cut 34 in deep if more than three adjustments are wanted the arms must be made correspondingly longer the dimensions for the tenons on all the larger pieces will be found on the drawing for the back the tenons of the cross pieces the rails should be 38 by 114in for the slats the easiest way is to not tenon them but to let in the whole end making the mortises in the rails 38 by 112 in this will necessitate cutting the sides of the mortises very accurately but this extra care will be more than compensated by not having to bother with the cutting of tenons on each end of the three back slats to finish the chair put on a coat of water stain first removing all surplus glue and thoroughly scraping and sandpapering all the parts that were not so treated at the mill the color of the stain will depend upon the finish desired whether golden mission etc water stains cause the grain of the wood to roughen so it will be necessary to resandpaper the surfaces after the stain has dried using fine paper next apply a coat of filler colored to match the stain directions for its application will be found upon the cans in which the filler comes after the filler has hardened put on a very thin coat of shellac what step is taken next will depend upon what kind of a surface is desired several coats of polishing wax may be put on this is easily donedirections will be found on the cansand makes the most satisfactory finish for mission and craftsman furniture it is the easiest to apply several coats of shellac or of varnish might be put on instead of wax each coat of the shellac should be rubbed when thoroughly dried with curled hair or fine steel wool or fine oiled sandpaper rub the first coats of varnish with haircloth or curled hair and the last coats with pulverized pumice stone and crude oil or raw linseed oil cushions for the chair can be made at home they may be made of art leather such as spanish roan skin and the top and bottom parts fastened together by lacing leather thongs through holes previously punched along the edges of the parts a very pretty effect is obtained by using thongs of a different but harmonious color the manner of lacing may be any one of the various laces such as are used in lacing belts or as shoestrings these cushions may be filled with hair or cotton felt denim or burlap may also be used as a covering and are much less expensive than the leather lace one side and the two ends then place filling and finish lacing art leather cushions retail at from 16 to 20 a pair and the denim and burlap at 6 to 9 the bottom cushion should be made the full size of the chair the front and back rails extend a little above the slats and thus hold it in place the back cushion will settle down a little and therefore may be made nearly the full length from the slats to the top of the back homemade mission book rack illustration light but strong when making the book rack as shown in the accompanying photograph use quartersawed oak if possible as this wood is the most suitable for finishing in the different mission stains this piece of furniture is very attractive and simple to construct the upper shelf can be used for vases or a plant of some kind while the lower shelves afford ample room for books and magazines the slats and legs are fastened to the shelves with 2in roundheaded brass screws these can be purchased from any hardware store one screw is used at each joint of a slat and shelf which calls for 32 screws in all holes should be bored into the slats and legs in which to insert the screws this will keep the wood from splitting the dimensions are given in the diagram sketch although these may be changed to suit the requirement of the builder if no glue is used on the joints when setting up the rack can easily be taken apart and put in a small bundle for moving illustration details of stand how to make a mission library table the mission library table the drawings for which are here given has been found well proportioned and of pleasing appearance it can be made of any of the several furniture woods in common use such as selected quartersawed white oak which will be found exceptionally pleasing in the effect produced illustration this picture is from a photograph of the mission table described in this article if a planing mill is at hand the stock can be ordered in such a way as to avoid the hard work of planing and sandpapering of course if millplaned stock cannot be had the following dimensions must be enlarged slightly to allow for squaring up the rough illustration showing dimensions of table for the top order 1 piece 118 in thick 34 in wide and 46 in long have it s4s surface on four sides and squared to length also specify that it be sandpapered on the top surface the edges and ends for the shelf order 1 piece 78 in thick 22 in wide and 42 in long with the four sides surfaced squared and sandpapered the same as for the top for the side rails order 2 pieces 78 in thick 6 in wide and 37 in long s4s and sanded on one side for the end rails 2 pieces 78 in thick 6 in wide and 25 in long other specifications as for the side rails for the stretchers into which the shelf tenons enter 2 pieces 118 in thick 334 in wide and 25 in long surfaced and sanded on four sides for the slats 10 pieces 58 in thick 112 in wide and 17 in long surfaced and sanded on four sides for the keys 4 pieces 34 in thick 114 in wide and 278 in long s4s this width is a little wide it will allow the key to be shaped as desired the drawings obviate any necessity for going into detail in the description fig 1 gives an assembly drawing showing the relation of the parts fig 2 gives the detail of an end the tenons for the side rails are laid off and the mortises placed in the post as are those on the end care must be taken however not to cut any mortises on the post below as was done in cutting the stretcher mortises on the ends of the table a good plan is to set the posts upright in the positions they are to occupy relative to one another and mark with pencil the approximate positions of the mortises the legs can then be laid flat and the mortises accurately marked out with a fair degree of assurance that they will not be cut where they are not wanted and that the legs shall pair properly when effort is made to assemble the parts of the table illustration details of table construction the table ends should be glued up first and the glue allowed to harden after which the tenons of the shelf may be inserted and the side rails placed there is a reason for the shape size and location of each tenon or mortise for illustration the shape of the tenon on the top rails permits the surface of the rail to extend almost flush with the surface of the post at the same time permitting the mortise in the post to be kept away from that surface again the shape of the ends of the slats is such that though they may vary slightly in length the fitting of the joints will not be affected care must be taken in cutting the mortises to keep their sides clean and sharp and to size in making the mortises for the keyed tenons the length of mortise must be slightly in excess of the width of the tenonabout 18 in of play to each side of each tenon with a shelf of the width specified for this table if such allowance is not made so that the tenons may move sideways the shrinkage would split the shelf in cutting across the ends of the shelf between the tenons leave a hole in the waste so that the turning saw or compass saw can be inserted saw within onesixteenth of the line after which this margin may be removed with chisel and mallet in fig 3 is shown two views of the keyed tenon and the key the mortise for the key is to be placed in the middle of the tenon it will be noted that this mortise is laid out 1116 in from the shoulder of the tenon while the stretcher is 118 in thick this is to insure the keys pulling the shelf tightly against the side of the stretcher keys may be made in a variety of shapes the one shown is simple and structurally good whatever shape is used the important thing to keep in mind is that the size of the key and the slant of its forward surface where it passes through the tenon must be kept the same as the mortise made for it in the tenon the top is to be fastened to the rails by means either of wooden buttons fig 4 or small angle irons there are a bewildering number of mission finishes upon the market a very satisfactory one is obtained by applying a coat of brown flemish water stain diluted by the addition of water in the proportion of two parts water to 1 part stain when this has dried sand with no 00 paper being careful not to cut through next apply a coat of dark brown filler the directions for doing this will be found upon the can in which the filler is bought one coat usually suffices however if an especially smooth surface is desired a second coat may be applied in a similar manner after the filler has hardened a very thin coat of shellac is to be put on when this has dried it should be sanded lightly and then one or two coats of wax should be properly applied and polished directions for waxing are upon the cans in which the wax is bought a beautiful dull gloss so much sought by finishers of modern furniture will be the result of carefully following these directions homemade mission candlestick there are many kinds of mission candlesticks but few of them carry out the mission design throughout herewith is illustrated a candlestick which may be made from the various woods that will have the style and lines of mission craft work the base is made from 1in material 412 in square two holes are bored and countersunk for screws to hold the post and handle the post is 214 in high bored in one end to fit the size of a candle the post is covered with a 38in thick cap 2 in square this also is bored to fit the candle the handle is 38 in thick and 3 in long with a 38in square mortise and is notched to fit the base the wood may be selected to match any other piece of furniture and finished in any of the mission stains illustration illustration details of candlestick another style of mission chair the material necessary to make a mission chair as shown in the accompanying illustration may be secured from a planing mill with all four surfaces squared and sandpapered the mill can do this work quickly and the expense will be nothing compared with the time it takes to do the work by hand the following is the stock list 4 legs 212 by 212 by 3212 in 2 bottom end rails 78 by 534 by 2312 in 2 bottom side rails 78 by 534 by 2812 in 2 top end rails 78 by 412 by 2312 in 1 top back rail 78 by 412 by 2812 in 2 cleats 78 by 212 by 2612 in 7 slats 12 by 2 by 24 in this design was purposely made simple if it is considered too severe and the worker has had some experience in woodwork it can easily be modified by adding vertical slats in back and sides these should be made of 12in stock and their ends should be let into the rails by means of mortises either plain red oak or quartersawed white oak will do begin by squaring up one end of each leg marking and cutting them to length and planing up the second ends so that they shall be square both the top and bottom of each leg should be beveled or rounded off about 14 in so that they may not splinter or cause injury to the hand when all of the legs have been made of the same length set them on end in the positions they are to have relative to one another and mark with pencil the approximate locations of the mortises next place them on the bench side by side even the ends and square sharp lines across to indicate the ends of the mortises the drawing shows the dimensions to use a sharp pencil should be used for this marking and the lines should be carried entirely across the two faces of each piece illustration mission chair complete set the gauge for the side of the mortise nearest the face edge with this setting mark all the mortises then set for the second side of the mortise and complete the gauging there are two ways of cutting small mortises in common use one is by using a chisel of a width just equal to that of the mortise the other is by using a smaller chisel after the mortise has first been bored with the brace and bit in the first method the cutting is begun at the middle of the mortise where a vshaped opening is made the full depth of the mortise that is to be continuing from the middle vertical cuts are taken first toward one end and then toward the other the chips are pried out as the cutting proceeds in making the last cut this prying must be omitted otherwise the edge of the mortise would be ruined it will be necessary to stand so as to look along the opening in order to get the sides plumb this method of cutting when once the knack has been attained will be found much easier quicker and more accurate for small openings such as these than the usual method the second method which is the usual one needs no description illustration details of mission chair construction the rails should next have the tenons cut on their ends it may not be out of place to remind the amateur that the lengths of the various like pieces can best be laid off by placing them on the bench measuring off the proper distances on one of them and then with trysquare marking across the edges of all of them at once this not only saves time in that but one set of measurements need be made but it insures all the pieces being similarly laid off in measuring off for the shoulders of the tenons begin at the middle of the length of the rail and measure half of the distance each way by doing so if there are any slight differences in the lengths of the pieces this difference will be divided between the two tenons and no harm will be done in gauging the tenons take the precaution to mark a working face and joint edge even if all the surfaces were finishplaned at the mill it is very important that all tenon gauging be done from these faces the same is true of the legs or posts and the slats if there are to be any to avoid confusion it is well to number each tenon by means of the chisel with a roman numeral and its corresponding mortise with the same this will prevent the fitting of one tenon into more than one mortise put the parts together with warm glue if it can be had otherwise use the prepared cold glue in cold weather the wood ought to be warmed before the glue is applied put the ends of the chair together first when the glue has set on these put the other rails in place when clamping up the second set of rails make sure the frame of the chair is square the best way to test for squareness is to measure the diagonals with a stick spring the frame until they measure alike using a brace to hold the frame in position until the glue can harden before staining scrape off any surplus glue for stain will not adhere to glue and a white spot will be the result of failing to remove it fasten cleats to the front and back rails with screws to these cleats fasten the slats as shown in the drawing a cushion of spanish leather such as is shown in the photograph can be bought at the furniture store or the upholsterers it can be made by the amateur quite easily however the two parts are fastened together with leather thongs and the filling is of hair or elastic felt a cushion for the back might well be provided to finish the wood to match a brown leather proceed as follows with a cloth or brush stain the wood with brown flemish water stain diluted by the addition of four parts of water when this has dried sandpaper smooth using no 00 paper held on the tips of the fingers apply a dark brown filler when this has flatted ie when the gloss has disappeared which will be in the course of ten or fifteen minutes wipe off clean with excelsior and then with waste or a cloth allow this to dry over night then apply two or three coats of wax polish each coat with a flannel cloth by briskly rubbing it a settle can be made after this design by using longer front and back rails rails 42 in between shoulders will make a good length for a settle how to make and finish a magazine stand for the magazine stand shown herewith there will be needed the following pieces 1 top 78 in by 1512 in by 1612 in 1 shelf 78 in by 1112 in by 1212 in 1 shelf 78 in by 1212 in by 1434 in 1 shelf 78 in by 1312 in by 1612 in 2 sides 78 in by 1412 in by 3312 in 1 brace 78 in by 314 in

makes the best appearance of all the woods that are comparatively easy to obtain plain sawed red or white oak will look well but are more liable to warp than the quartersawed this is quite an element in pieces as wide as these begin work on the sides first plane a joint edge on each and from this work the two ends the ends will be square to the joint edge but beveled to the working face a bevel square will be needed for testing these beveled ends to set the bevel make a drawing full size or nearly so of the front view and place the bevel on the drawing adjusting its sides to the angle wanted work from a center line in laying off the drawing having planed the ends lay off the sides this is done by measuring from the joint edge along the bottom 14 in from the joint edge along the top 112 in and from this 11 in connect the points by means of a pencil and straightedge illustration completed stand before cutting off the joint edges of the pieces measure off and square lines across to indicate the locations of the shelves put both pieces together and mark across both joint edges at once to insure getting both laid off alike the design at the bottom can be varied to suit the fancy of the worker for such a design as is shown draw on paper full size half of it fold on the center line and with scissors cut both sides of the outline by cutting along the line just drawn trace around this pattern on the wood and saw out with compass or turning saw the shelves may now be made the bevel of the ends of the shelves will be the same as for the ends of the side pieces the lengths may be obtained by measuring the drawing remember that length is always measured along the grain and that the end grain of the shelves must extend from side to side in this stand the widths may be obtained by measuring the width of the sides at the points marked out on them for the location of the shelf ends it is best not to have the shelves the full width of the sides since the edges of the shelves are to be faced with leather make each shelf 12 in less than the width of the side at the place that the shelf is to be fastened the top will be squared up in the usual manner 15 in wide by 16 in long these parts may now be put together they may be fastened in any one of a variety of ways roundhead blued screws may be placed at regular intervals through the sides finishing nails may be used and the heads set and covered with putty stained to match the wood finish nails may be placed at regular intervals and fancy headed nails used to cover the heads illustration details of the magazine stand the braces should be formed and fitted but not fastened until the finish has been applied thoroughly scrape and sandpaper all parts not already so treated probably no other finish appeals to so many people as golden oak there is no fixed standard of color for golden oak different manufacturers have set standards in their part of the country but the prevailing idea of golden oak is usually that of a rich reddish brown proceed as follows egg shell gloss 1one coat of golden oak water stain diluted with water if a light golden is desired 2allow time to dry then sandpaper lightly with fine sandpaper this is to smooth the grain and to bring up the high lights by removing the stain from the wood use no 00 sandpaper and hold it on the finger tips 3apply a second coat of the stain diluted about onehalf with water this will throw the grain into still higher relief and thus produce a still greater contrast apply this coat of stain very sparingly using a rag should this stain raise the grain again rub lightly with fine worn sandpaper just enough to smooth 4when this has dried put on a light coat of thin shellac shellac precedes filling that it may prevent the high lightsthe solid parts of the woodfrom being discolored by the stain in the filler and thus causing a muddy effect the shellac being thin does not interfere with the fillers entering the pores of the open grain 5sand lightly with fine sandpaper 6fill with paste filler colored to match the stain 7cover this with a coat of orange shellac this coat of shellac might be omitted but another coat of varnish must be added 8sandpaper lightly 9apply two or three coats of varnish 10rub the first coats with hair cloth or curled hair and then with pulverized pumice stone crude oil or linseed oil affix the braces just after filling using brads and puttying the holes with putty colored to match the filler the shelves may be faced with thin leather harmonizing with the oak ornamental headed tacks being used to fasten it in place homemade lawn swing illustration the completed swing the coming of spring and summer calls forth various kinds of porch and lawn furniture a porch or lawn swing to accommodate two or more persons is a thing desired by most people the lawn swing as shown in the picture is portable and does not need stakes to hold it to the ground while this swing is substantial and rigid it can be moved from place to place on the lawn or the chains can be fastened with heavy hooks to the ceiling of a porch instead of using the stand either ropes or chains may be used to hang the swing and should be of such length that the seat will be about 20 in from the ground or floor the drawing giving the dimensions for constructing the seat shows how the parts are put together the front and back apron pieces are mortised to receive a 1in square tenon cut on the crosspieces that support the slats each end of the apron pieces extends 4 in and a hole is bored at a into which the hanging ropes or chains are fastened if ropes are used bore the holes to fit the rope and when the end of each rope is put through a hole it is tied in a knot to keep from slipping out chains can be fastened with eye bolts small carriage or stove bolts are used to hold the slats on the framework and cross pieces the arm rests are fastened with wood screws illustration details of seat the drawing for the stand gives all the dimensions for its construction split the upright pieces or legs with a saw cut to the length as shown a bolt should be put through each piece edgewise at the end of the saw cut to keep the wood from splitting any farther when the ends are spread to receive the bolts through the cross pieces at the top the upper ends of the ropes or chains are fastened close to and under the bolt holding the inside forks of the uprights this bolt can be long enough to fasten a clevis that will hang underneath for this purpose the whole swing can be painted with a forest green color which is very suitable for summer outdoor furniture illustration showing construction of stand how to make a portable table illustration table for outdoor use a table for outdoor use that can be taken apart

billiard table and davenport a small size billiard table which can be converted quickly into a davenport is made as follows secure clear selected plain sawed white oak in sizes as indicated by the drawing have these planed at the mill to the widths and thicknesses specified the lower part should be made first cut the four posts to length chamfering the ends somewhat so that they will not splinter when in use lay out and cut the mortises which are to receive the rails the lower rails are to be 118 in thick and the mortises are to be laid out in the legs so as to bring their outer surfaces almost flush with those of the posts the upper rails are 214 in wide the slats are 34 in thick tenons should be thoroughly pinned to the sides of the mortises as shown in the illustration the braces are 134 in thick and are fastened to place with roundhead screws and glue the seat may be made by putting in a solid bottom that shall rest upon cleats fastened to the inner surfaces of the rails the top of this bottom should rest about 34 in below the top edge of the rails a well filled leather cushion completes this part a more satisfactory result is obtained by putting in springs and upholstering the seat upon this the leather cushion can be placed illustration by swinging the top back the table is transformed into the elegant davenport seen on the opposite page illustration the billiard table as converted into a luxurious davenporta child can make the change in a moment the top or table is built upon and about a heavy frame of well seasoned 134in by 534in white pine the parts to this frame are thoroughly mortised and tenoned together middle stretchers lengthwise and crosswise give added strength and rigidity upon this frame the slate bed is leveled by planing the frame wherever necessary slats are fastened to the bed by screws the heads of which are countersunk so that they may be covered over even with plaster of paris illustration details showing dimensions

have all these pieces mill planed on the four sides straight and square also have them sandpapered on the four sides of each plain sawed white or red oak finishes nicely and is easily obtained the sizes are specified exact as to thickness and width but the lengths are longer than is needed this is to allow for cutting and fitting begin by squaring one end of each post measure the length 28 in and placing all of them side by side square a line across the four saw then plane these ends square the top and bottom side rails are treated in a similar manner their length being 1918 in each these pieces extend right through the posts projecting 58 in beyond the surface the mortises in the posts must be cut smoothly and of exact size wood pins fasten these rails and posts together the other rails have tenons 12 by 3 in shouldered on the two edges and one side the mortise in the post is placed central on the ends of the chair the shouldered side is turned in see photograph while on the front and back they are turned out miter the ends of these tenons these tenons are to be glued and clampedthe ends of the chair being put together first when this is dry the sides are clamped the stretcher should have its ends shouldered on the two edges so as to make a 212in tenon allow the tenons to extend 118 in beyond the cross rail and cut mortises in these tenons for the keys all projecting tenons as well as the tops and bottoms of the posts should be chamfered about 18 in for the seat screw cleats to the insides of the rails and place a platform of thin boards so that its top surface is 12 in below the top of the rails a cushion can be made as shown in the photograph by lacing with leather thongs two pieces of spanish leather cut to proper length and width when nearly laced fill with any of the common upholsterers fillings illustration details of parts of chair for a brown stain dissolve by boiling in 4 oz of water extract of logwood the size of a walnut apply hot and repeat until the desired color is obtained stains can be bought ready prepared however and are quite satisfactory finish by applying several coats of wax how to make a settee this handsome piece of mission furniture is designed to be made up in three different pieces as desired the only changes necessary being in the length of the one front and the two back rails the settee can be made into a threecushion length by adding the length of another cushion to the dimensions of the one front and two back rails a companion piece chair can be made by using suitable length rails to admit only one cushion the following stock list of materials ordered millplaned and sandpapered will be sufficient to make up the settee as illustrated oak is the most suitable wood which can be finished in either mission or a dark golden oak 3 rails 1 by 4 by 5214 in 4 end rails 1 by 4 by 2414 in 4 posts 214 in square by 3412 in 13 slats 12 by 5 by 2114 in 2 cleats 1 in square by 51 in all the rails are mortised into the posts for a depth of 58 in also the slats are mortised 58 in into the rails the material list gives the exact dimensions for the rails and slats as they will not need to be squared for entering the mortises provided you are careful to get all lengths cut to dimensions when cutting the mortises take care to get them square and clean the posts have 12 in extra added for squaring up and cutting the corners sloping on the top ends the joints are all put together with glue nails can be driven into the posts intersecting the tenons of the rails on the inside as they will not show and will help to make the settee more solid illustration a complete twocushion settee illustration details of a mission settee the cushions can be made with or without springs as desired if made without springs 15 slats must be provided in the material list 12 in thick 2 in wide and 24 in long to be placed on the cleats fastened to the inside of each bottom rail the two cleats are fastened one on each inside of the front and back rails with screws the location as to height of these cleats will depend upon the kind of cushions used the parts necessary to make the cushions with springs are as follows 4 pieces 1 by 212 by 26 in 8 pieces 1 by 212 by 24 in 4 pieces 1 by 212 by 22 in 32 8in springs 2 pieces leather about 29 by 31 in illustration details of the cushion an open box is made from two 26in and two 22in pieces and across the bottom are mortised and set in four 24in pieces to form slats on which to set the springs the tops of the springs are tied or anchored with stout cords running in both directions and fastened to the inside of the pieces forming the open box these should be tied in such manner as to hold each spring so it cannot slip over and come in contact with another spring roan or pebbled leather are very popular for cushions for this style of furniture the leather is drawn over the springs and tacked to the outside of the open box frame when complete the cushions are set in loose on the cleats which should in this case be placed about 1 in from the top of the rails how to make a pyrographers table illustration convenient pyrographers table any pyrographer will appreciate the construction of the table and cabinet as illustrated anyone doing burnt wood work will know the annoyance of building up a steady support for the arm to the level of the article on which the work is to be done the size of this table may be made to suit the surroundings and the space of the builder figure 1 shows the table with a slot cut in the side support in which to place the thumb screw of the bracket as shown on top of the table it will be noticed fig 2 that while both drawer and cabinet are available for storing the apparatus they are not in the way of the operator while sitting at his work the drawer overhangs the knees and the cabinet is far enough back not to interfere with sitting up close to the work the bracket shelf slides in the slot at the side of the table and is fastened to any height by the thumb screw there is also a smaller slide bracket on the shelf to clamp irregular objects to the side of the table the thumb screws hinges and drawer pulls can be purchased from any hardware store when the table is not in use for pyrography it can be used for a writing table or a round top provided and attached on which to play games when used for this purpose the bracket as well as the pyrographic outfit is stowed away in the cabinet as shown in fig 3 illustration storage for apparatus mission stains what is mission oak stain there are many on the market with hardly two alike in tone the true mission oak stain may be said to show a dull gray the flakes showing a reddish tint while the grain of the wood will be almost a dead black to produce such a stain take 1 lb of drop black in oil and 12 oz of rose pink in oil adding a gill of best japan drier thinning with three halfpints of turpentine this will make about 1 qt of stain use these proportions for a larger quantity of stain strain it through cheese cloth japan colors will give a quicker drying stain than that made with oil colors and in this case omit the japan and add a little varnish to bind it one of the most popular of all the fancy oaks has been that known as flemish and this in spite of its very somber color says wood craft there are several ways of producing flemish finish you can fill the wood with a paste filler strained with raw umber and when dry apply a stain of transparent flat raw umber and for the darker shades of finish use drop black with the umber varnish and rub down according to a foreign technical journal french workmen mahoganize various kinds of woods by the following method the surface of the wood to be stained is made perfectly smooth then it is given a coating of dilute nitric acid which is rubbed well into the wood fiber then it is stained with a mixture made by dissolving 112 oz of dragons blood in a pint of alcohol this solution being filtered and then there is added to it onethird of its weight of sodium carbonate apply this mixture with a brush and repeat the coats at intervals until the surface has the appearance of polished mahogany in case the luster should fail it may be restored by rubbing with a little raw linseed oil the description of the process is meager and hence he who would try it will have to experiment a little a good cheap mission effect for oak is to mix together equal parts of boiled linseed oil and good asphaltum varnish and apply this to the wood with a brush in a minute or so you may rub off surplus with a rag and when dry give a coat of varnish a gallon of this stain will cover about 600 sq ft filling oak a very good hardwood filler for oak either for a natural or golden effect may be made from two parts of turpentine and one part of raw linseed oil with a small amount of good japan to dry in the usual time to this liquid add bolted gilders whiting to form a suitable paste it may be made thin enough for use if to be used at once or into a stiff paste for future use when it can be thinned down for use says woodworkers review after applying a coat of filler let stand until it turns gray which requires about 20 minutes depending upon the amount of japan in the filler when it should be rubbed off with cotton waste or whatever you use for the purpose a filler must be rubbed well into the wood the surplus only being removed the application of a coat of burnt umber stain to the wood before filling is in order which will darken the wood to the proper depth if you rub off the surplus showing the grain and giving a golden oak effect the filling should stand at least a day and night before applying shellac and varnish wax finishing in waxfinishing hardwoods use a paste filler and shellac varnish to get a good surface of course the wax may also be rubbed into the unfilled wood but that gives you quite a different effect from the regular wax polish says a correspondent of wood craft with soft woods you first apply a stain then apply a liquid filler or shellac according to the quality of work to be done the former for the cheaper job the usual proportion of wax and turpentine is two parts of the former to one part of the latter melting the wax first then adding the spirits of turpentine for reviving or polishing furniture you can add three or four times as much turpentine as wax all these proportions to be by weight to produce the desired eggshell gloss rub vigorously with a brush of stiff bristles or woolen rag the fuming of oak darkened oak always has a better appearance when fumed with ammonia this process is rather a difficult one as it requires an airtight case but the description herewith given may be entered into with as large a case as the builder cares to construct oak articles can be treated in a case made from a tin biscuit box or any other metal receptacle of good proportions provided it is airtight the oak to be fumed is arranged in the box so the fumes will entirely surround the piece the article may be propped up with small sticks or suspended by a string the chief point is to see that no part of the wood is covered up and that all surfaces are exposed to the fumes a saucer of ammonia is placed in the bottom of the box the lid or cover closed and all joints sealed up by pasting heavy brown paper over them any leakage will be detected if the nose is placed near the tin and farther application of the paper will stop the holes a hole may be cut in the cover and a piece of glass fitted in taking care to have all the edges closed the process may be watched through the glass and the article removed when the oak is fumed to the desired shade wood stained in this manner should not be french polished or varnished but waxed the process of waxing is simple cut some beeswax into fine shreds and place them in a small pot or jar pour in a little turpentine and set aside for half a day giving it an occasional stir the wax must be thoroughly dissolved and then more turpentine added until the preparation has the consistency of a thick cream this can be applied to the wood with a rag and afterward brushed up with a stiff brush how to make black wax when putting a wax finish on oak or any opengrained wood the wax will often show white streaks in the pores of the wood these streaks cannot be removed by rubbing or brushing prepared black wax can be purchased but if you do not have any on hand ordinary floor wax can be colored black melt the floor wax in a can placed in a bucket of hot water when the wax has become liquid mix thoroughly into it a little drop black or lampblack allow the wax to cool and harden this wax will not streak but will give a smooth glossy finish the 40 styles of chairs there are 40 distinct styles of chairs embracing the period from 3000 bc to 1900 adnearly 7000 years of all the millions of chairs made during the centuries each one can be classified under one or more of the 40 general styles shown in the chart this chart was compiled by the editor of decorative furniture the colonial does not appear on the chart because it classifies under the jacobean and other styles a condensed key to the chart follows egyptian3000 bc to 500 bc seems to have been derived largely from the early asian it influenced assyrian and greek decorations and was used as a motif in some french empire decoration not used in its entirety except for lodge rooms etc grecian700 bc to 200 bc influenced by egyptian and assyrian styles it had a progressive growth through the doric ionic and corinthian periods it influenced the roman style and the pompeian and all the renaissance styles and all styles following the renaissance and is still the most important factor in decorations today roman750 bc to 450 ad rome took her art entirely from greece and the roman is purely a greek development the roman style revived in the renaissance and in this way is still a prominent factor in modern decoration pompeian100 bc to 79 ad sometimes called the grecianroman style which well describes its components the style we know as greek was the greek as used in public structures the pompeian is our best idea of greek domestic decoration pompeii was long buried but when rediscovered it promptly influenced all european styles including louis xvi and the various georgian styles byzantine300 ad to 1450 ad the eastern roman style originating in the removal of the capital of the roman empire to constantinople then called byzantium it is a combination of persian and roman it influenced the various moorish sacracenic and other mohammedan styles gothic1100 to 1550 it had nothing to do with the goths but was a local european outgrowth of the romanesque it spread all over europe and reached its climax of development about 1550 it was on the gothic construction that the northern european and english renaissance styles were grafted to form such styles as the elizabethan etc illustration moorish700 to 1600 the various mohammedan styles can all be traced to the ancient persian through the byzantine the moorish or moresque was the form taken by the mohammedans in spain indian2000 bc to 1906 ad the east indian style is almost composite as expected of one with a growth of nearly 4000 years it has been influenced repeatedly by outside forces and various religious invasions and has in turn influenced other far eastern styles chinese3500 bc to 1906 ad another of the ancient styles it had a continuous growth up to 230 bc since when it has not changed much it has influenced western styles as in the chippendale queen anne etc japanese1200 bc to 1906 ad a style probably springing originally from china but now absolutely distinct it has influenced recent art in europe and america especially the new art styles italian gothic1100 to 1500 the italian gothic differs from the european and english gothic in clinging more closely to the romanesquebyzantine originals tudor1485 to 1558 the earliest entry of the renaissance into england an application of renaissance to the gothic foundations its growth was into the elizabethan italian renaissance fifteenth century1400 to 1500 the birth century of the renaissance a seeking for revival of the old roman and greek decorative and constructive forms italian renaissance sixteenth century1500 to 1600 a period of greater elaboration of detail and more freedom from actual greek and roman models italian renaissance seventeenth century1600 to 1700 the period of great elaboration and beginning of reckless ornamentation spanish renaissance1500 to 1700 a variation of the renaissance spirit caused by the combination of three distinct stylesthe renaissance as known in italy the gothic and the moorish in furniture the spanish renaissance is almost identical with the flemish which it influenced dutch renaissance1500 to 1700 a style influenced alternately by the french and the spanish this style and the flemish had a strong influence on the english william and mary and queen anne styles and especially on the jacobean german renaissance1550 to 1700 a style introduced by germans who had gone to italy to study it was a heavy treatment of the renaissance spirit and merged into the german baroque about 1700 francis i1515 to 1549 the introductory period when the italian renaissance found foothold in france it is almost purely italian and was the forerunner of the henri ii henri ii1549 to 1610 in this the french renaissance became differentiated from the italian assuming traits that were specifically french and that were emphasized in the next period louis xiii1616 to 1643 a typically french style in which but few traces of its derivation from the italian remained it was followed by the louis xiv elizabethan1558 to 1603 a compound style containing traces of the gothic much of the tudor some dutch flemish and a little italian especially noted for its fine wood carving jacobean1603 to 1689 the english period immediately following the elizabethan and in most respects quite similar the dutch influence was however more prominent the cromwellian which is included in this period was identical with it william and mary1689 to 1702 more dutch influences all furniture lighter and better suited to domestic purposes illustration queen anne1702 to 1714 increasing dutch influences jacobean influence finally discarded chinese influence largely present louis xiv1643 to 1715 the greatest french style an entirely french creation marked by elegance and dignity toward the end of the period it softened into the early rococo georgian1714 to 1820 a direct outgrowth of the queen anne tempered by the prevailing french styles it includes chippendale hepplewhite and sheraton but these three great cabinetmakers were sufficiently distinct from the average georgian to be worthy separate classification chippendale1754 to 1800 the greatest english cabinet style based on the queen anne but drawing largely from the rococo chinese and gothic he produced three distinct types viz french chippendale chinese chippendale and gothic chippendale the last is a negligible quantity louis xv1715 to 1774 the rococo period the result of the efforts of french designers to enliven the louis xiv and to evolve a new style out of one that had reached its logical climax hepplewhite1775 to 1800 succeeded chippendale as the popular english cabinetmaker by many he is considered his superior his work is notable for a charming delicacy of line and design louis xvi1774 to 1793 the french style based on a revival of greek forms and influenced by the discovery of the ruins of pompeii sheraton1775 to 1800 a fellow cabinetmaker working at same time as hepplewhite one of the colonial styles georgian r j adam1762 to 1800 fathers of an english classic revival much like the french louis xvi and empire styles in many respects empire1804 to 1814 the style created during the empire of napoleon i derived from classic roman suggestions with some greek and egyptian influences new arts1900 to date these are various worthy attempts by the designers of various nations to create a new style some of the results are good and they are apt to be like the little girl who had a little curl that hung in the middle of her forehead in that when they are good

basket and number each tenon and mortise mark all the mortises on the posts being sure to keep the distances between the top and lower rail the same on each post cut each mortise to fit the correspondingly numbered tenon next mark the mortises for the slats in the rails allowing the whole slat to go in 14 in the handles are next in order the pieces going into the rail should be fastened with a round 12in tenon cut on one end and glued in place the crosspiece should be mortised all the way through these pieces and held in place by a brad from the under side now put the whole basket together without gluing in order that errors if any may be detected if everything fits perfectly the basket is ready to be glued for best results hot glue should be used first glue up two opposite sides with the slats in place clamps must be used when these have set for at least 24 hours the other rails and slats may be glued in place and clamped it is a good idea to pin the tenons in place with two 1in brads driven from the inside the handles are then glued in place using hand screws to hold them until the glue sets the bottom should rest on thin cleats without being nailed to them so that it may be removed when the basket is to be emptied of small papers etc before applying the stain see that all glue spots are removed and all surfaces sanded to perfect smoothness if a fumed finish is not desired any good stain may be used after which a thin coat of shellac and two coats of wax should be applied allow plenty of time for drying between the coats a cellarette pedestal
