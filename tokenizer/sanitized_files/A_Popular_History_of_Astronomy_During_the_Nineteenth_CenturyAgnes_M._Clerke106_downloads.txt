and finished its record a new era has dawned not by chronological prescription alone but to the vital sense of humanity novel thoughts are rife fresh impulses stir the nations the soughing of the wind of progress strikes every ear the old order changeth more and more swiftly as mental activity becomes intensified already many of the scientific doctrines implicitly accepted fifteen years ago begin to wear a superannuated aspect daltons atoms are in process of disintegration kirchhoffs theorem visibly needs to be modified clerk maxwells medium no longer figures as an indispensable factotum absolute zero is known to be situated on an asymptote to the curve of cold ideas in short have all at once become plastic and none more completely so than those relating to astronomy the physics of the heavenly bodies indeed finds its best opportunities in unlookedfor disclosures for it deals with transcendental conditions and what is strange to terrestrial experience may serve admirably to expound what is normal in the skies in celestial science especially facts that appear subversive are often the most illuminative and the prospect of its advance widens and brightens with each divagation enforced or permitted from the strait paths of rigid theory this readiness for innovation has undoubtedly its dangers and drawbacks to the historian above all it presents frequent occasions of embarrassment the writing of history is a strongly selective operation the outcome being valuable just in so far as the choice what to reject and what to include has been judicious and the task is no light one of discriminating between barren speculations and ideas pregnant with coming truth to the possession of such prescience of the future as would be needed to do this effectually i can lay no claim but diligence and sobriety of thought are ordinarily within reach and these i shall have exercised to good purpose if i have succeeded in rendering the fourth edition of a popular history of astronomy during the nineteenth century not wholly unworthy of a place in the scientific literature of the twentieth century my thanks are due to sir david gill for the use of his photograph of the great comet of 1901 which i have added to my list of illustrations and to the council of the royal astronomical society for the loan of glass positives needed for the reproduction of those included in the third edition london july 1902 preface to the first edition the progress of astronomy during the last hundred years has been rapid and extraordinary in its distinctive features moreover the nature of that progress has been such as to lend itself with facility to untechnical treatment to this circumstance the present volume owes its origin it embodies an attempt to enable the ordinary reader to follow with intelligent interest the course of modern astronomical inquiries and to realize so far as it can at present be realized the full effect of the comprehensive change in the whole aspect purposes and methods of celestial science introduced by the momentous discovery of spectrum analysis since professor grants invaluable work on the history of physical astronomy was published a third of a century has elapsed during the interval a socalled new astronomy has grown up by the side of the old one effect of its advent has been to render the science of the heavenly bodies more popular both in its needs and in its nature than formerly more popular in its needs since its progress now primarily depends upon the interest in and consequent efforts towards its advancement of the general public more popular in its nature because the kind of knowledge it now chiefly tends to accumulate is more easily intelligibleless remote from ordinary experiencethan that evolved by the aid of the calculus from materials collected by the use of the transitinstrument and chronograph it has thus become practicable to describe in simple language the most essential parts of recent astronomical discoveries and being practicable it could not be otherwise than desirable to do so the service to astronomy itself would be not inconsiderable of enlisting wider sympathies on its behalf while to help one single mind towards a fuller understanding of the manifold works which have in all ages irresistibly spoken to man of the glory of god might well be an object of no ignoble ambition the present volume does not profess to be a complete or exhaustive history of astronomy during the period covered by it its design is to present a view of the progress of celestial science on its most characteristic side since the time of herschel abstruse mathematical theories unless in some of their more striking results are excluded from consideration these during the eighteenth century constituted the sum and substance of astronomy and their fundamental importance can never be diminished and should never be ignored but as the outcome of the enormous development given to the powers of the telescope in recent times together with the swift advance of physical science and the inclusion by means of the spectroscope of the heavenly bodies within the domain of its inquiries much knowledge has been acquired regarding the nature and condition of those bodies forming it might be said a science apart and disembarrassed from immediate dependence upon intricate and except to the initiated unintelligible formul this kind of knowledge forms the main subject of the book now offered to the public there are many reasons for preferring a history to a formal treatise on astronomy in a treatise what we know is set forth a history tells us in addition how we came to know it it thus places facts before us in the natural order of their ascertainment and narrates instead of enumerating the story to be told leaves the marvels of imagination far behind and requires no embellishment from literary art or highflown phrases its best ornament is unvarnished truthfulness and this at least may confidently be claimed to be bestowed upon it in the ensuing pages in them unity of treatment is sought to be combined with a due regard to chronological sequence by grouping in separate chapters the various events relating to the several departments of descriptive astronomy the whole is divided into two parts the line between which is roughly drawn at the middle of the present century herschels inquiries into the construction of the heavens strike the keynote of the first part the discoveries of sunspot and magnetic periodicity and of spectrum analysis determine the character of the second where the nature of the subject required it however this arrangement has been disregarded clearness and consistency should obviously take precedence of method thus in treating of the telescopic scrutiny of the various planets the whole of the related facts have been collected into an uninterrupted narrative a division elsewhere natural and helpful would here have been purely artificial and therefore confusing the interests of students have been consulted by a full and authentic system of references to the sources of information relied upon materials have been derived as a rule with very few exceptions from the original authorities the system adopted has been to take as little as possible at secondhand much pains have been taken to trace the origin of ideas often obscurely enunciated long before they came to resound through the scientific world and to give to each individual discoverer strictly and impartially his due prominence has also been assigned to the biographical element as underlying and determining the whole course of human endeavour the advance of knowledge may be called a vital process the lives of men are absorbed into and assimilated by it inquiries into the kind and mode of the surrender in each separate case must always possess a strong interest whether for study or for example the acknowledgments of the writer are due to professor

sagittarius 424 history of astronomy during the nineteenth century introduction we can distinguish three kinds of astronomy each with a different origin and history but all mutually dependent and composing in their fundamental unity one science first in order of time came the art of observing the returns and measuring the places of the heavenly bodies this was the sole astronomy of the chinese and chaldeans but to it the vigorous greek mind added a highly complex geometrical plan of their movements for which copernicus substituted a more harmonious system without as yet any idea of a compelling cause the planets revolved in circles because it was their nature to do so just as laudanum sets to sleep because it possesses a virtus dormitiva this first and oldest branch is known as observational or practical astronomy its business is to note facts as accurately as possible and it is essentially unconcerned with schemes for connecting those facts in a manner satisfactory to the reason the second kind of astronomy was founded by newton its nature is best indicated by the term gravitational but it is also called theoretical astronomy1 it is based on the idea of cause and the whole of its elaborate structure is reared according to the dictates of a single law simple in itself but the tangled web of whose consequences can be unravelled only by the subtle agency of an elaborate calculus the third and last division of celestial science may properly be termed physical and descriptive astronomy it seeks to know what the heavenly bodies are in themselves leaving the how and the wherefore of their movements to be otherwise answered now such inquiries became possible only through the invention of the telescope so that galileo was in point of fact their originator but herschel first gave them a prominence which the whole progress of science during the nineteenth century served to confirm and render more exclusive inquisitions begun with the telescope have been extended and made effective in unhopedfor directions by the aid of the spectroscope and photographic camera and a large part of our attention in the present volume will be occupied with the brilliant results thus achieved the unexpected development of this new physicalcelestial science is the leading fact in recent astronomical history it was out of the regular course of events in the degree in which it has actually occurred it could certainly not have been foreseen it was a seizing of the prize by a competitor who had hardly been thought qualified to enter the lists orthodox astronomers of the old school looked with a certain contempt upon observers who spent their nights in scrutinising the faces of the moon and planets rather than in timing their transits or devoted daylight energies not to reductions and computations but to counting and measuring spots on the sun they were regarded as irregular practitioners to be tolerated perhaps but certainly not encouraged the advance of astronomy in the eighteenth century ran in general an even and logical course the age succeeding newtons had for its special task to demonstrate the universal validity and trace the complex results of the law of gravitation the accomplishment of that task occupied just one hundred years it was virtually brought to a close when laplace explained to the french academy november 19 1787 the cause of the moons accelerated motion as a mere machine the solar system so far as it was then known was found to be complete and intelligible in all its parts and in the mcanique cleste its mechanical perfections were displayed under a form of majestic unity which fitly commemorated the successive triumphs of analytical genius over problems amongst the most arduous ever dealt with by the mind of man theory however demands a practical test all its data are derived from observation and their insecurity becomes less tolerable as it advances nearer to perfection observation on the other hand is the pitiless critic of theory it detects weak points and provokes reforms which may be the beginnings of discovery thus theory and observation mutually act and react each alternately taking the lead in the endless race of improvement now while in france lagrange and laplace were bringing the gravitational theory of the solar system to completion work of a very different kind yet not less indispensable to the future welfare of astronomy was being done in england the royal observatory at greenwich is one of the few useful institutions which date their origin from the reign of charles ii the leading position which it still occupies in the science of celestial observation was for near a century and a half after its foundation an exclusive one delambre remarked that had all other materials of the kind been destroyed the greenwich records alone would suffice for the restoration of astronomy the establishment was indeed absolutely without a rival2 systematic observations of sun moon stars and planets were during the whole of the eighteenth century made only at greenwich here materials were accumulated for the secure correction of theory and here refinements were introduced by which the exquisite accuracy of modern practice in astronomy was eventually attained the chief promoter of these improvements was james bradley few men have possessed in an equal degree with him the power of seeing accurately and reasoning on what they see he let nothing pass the slightest inconsistency between what appeared and what was to be expected roused his keenest attention and he never relaxed his mental grip of a subject until it had yielded to his persistent inquisition it was to these qualities that he owed his discoveries of the aberration of light and the nutation of the earths axis the first was announced in 1729 what is meant by it is that owing to the circumstance of light not being instantaneously transmitted the heavenly bodies appear shifted from their true places by an amount depending upon the ratio which the velocity of light bears to the speed of the earth in its orbit because light travels with enormous rapidity the shifting is very slight and each star returns to its original position at the end of a year bradleys second great discovery was finally ascertained in 1748 nutation is a real nodding of the terrestrial axis produced by the dragging of the moon at the terrestrial equatorial protuberance from it results an apparent displacement of the stars each of them describing a little ellipse about its true or mean position in a period of nearly nineteen years now an acquaintance with the fact and the laws of each of these minute irregularities is vital to the progress of observational astronomy for without it the places of the heavenly bodies could never be accurately known or compared so that bradley by their detection at once raised the science to a higher grade of precision nor was this the whole of his work appointed astronomerroyal in 1742 he executed during the years 175062 a series of observations which formed the real beginning of exact astronomy part of their superiority must indeed be attributed to the cooperation of john bird who provided bradley in 1750 with a measuring instrument of till then unequalled excellence for not only was the art of observing in the eighteenth century a peculiarly english art but the means of observing were furnished almost exclusively by british artists john dollond the son of a spitalfields weaver invented the achromatic lens in 1758 removing thereby the chief obstacle to the development of the powers of refracting telescopes james short of edinburgh was without a rival in the construction of reflectors the sectors quadrants and circles of graham bird ramsden and cary were inimitable by continental workmanship thus practical and theoretical astronomy advanced on parallel lines in england and france respectively the improvement of their several toolsthe telescope and the quadrant on the one side and the calculus on the otherkeeping pace the whole future of the science seemed to be theirs the cessation of interest through a too speedy attainment of the perfection towards which each spurred the other appeared to be the only danger it held in store for them when all at once a rival stood by their sidenot indeed menacing their progress but threatening to absorb their popularity the rise of herschel was the one conspicuous anomaly in the astronomical history of the eighteenth century it proved decisive of the course of events in the nineteenth it was unexplained by anything that had gone before yet all that came after hinged upon it it gave a new direction to effort it lent a fresh impulse to thought it opened a channel for the widespread public interest which was gathering towards astronomical subjects to flow in much of this interest was due to the occurrence of events calculated to arrest the attention and excite the wonder of the uninitiated the predicted return of halleys comet in 1759 verified after an unprecedented fashion the computations of astronomers it deprived such bodies for ever of their portentous character it ranked them as denizens of the solar system again the transits of venus in 1761 and 1769 were the first occurrences of the kind since the awakening of science to their consequence imposing preparations journeys to remote and hardly accessible regions official expeditions international communications all for the purpose of observing them to the best advantage brought their high significance vividly to the public consciousness a result aided by the facile pen of lalande in rendering intelligible the means by which these elaborate arrangements were to issue in an accurate knowledge of the suns distance lastly herschels discovery of uranus march 13 1781 had the surprising effect of utter novelty since the human race had become acquainted with the company of the planets no addition had been made to their number the event thus broke with immemorial traditions and seemed to show astronomy as still young and full of unlookedfor possibilities further popularity accrued to the science from the sequel of a career so strikingly opened herschels huge telescopes his detection by their means of two saturnian and as many uranian moons his piercing scrutiny of the sun picturesque theory of its constitution and sagacious indication of the route pursued by it through space his discovery of stellar revolving systems his bold soundings of the universe his grandiose ideas and the elevated yet simple language in which they were conveyedformed a combination powerfully effective to those least susceptible of new impressions nor was the evoked enthusiasm limited to the british isles in germany schrter followedlongo intervalloin herschels track von zach set on foot from gotha that general communication of ideas which gives life to a forward movement bode wrote much and well for unlearned readers lalande by his popular lectures and treatises helped to form an audience which laplace himself did not disdain to address in the exposition du systme du monde this great accession of public interest gave the impulse to the extraordinarily rapid progress of astronomy in the nineteenth century official patronage combined with individual zeal sufficed for the elder branches of the science a few wellendowed institutions could accumulate the materials needed by a few isolated thinkers for the construction of theories of wonderful beauty and elaboration yet precluded by their abstract nature from winning general applause but the new physical astronomy depends for its prosperity upon the favour of the multitude whom its striking results are well fitted to attract it is in a special manner the science of amateurs it welcomes the most unpretending cooperation there is no one with a true eye and a faithful hand but can do good work in watching the heavens and not unfrequently prizes of discovery which the most perfect appliances failed to grasp have fallen to the share of ignorant or illprovided assiduity observers accordingly have multiplied observatories have been founded in all parts of the world associations have been constituted for mutual help and counsel a formal astronomical congress met in 1789 at gothathen under duke ernest ii and von zach the focus of german astronomyand instituted a combined search for the planet suspected to revolve undiscovered between the orbits of mars and jupiter the astronomical society of london was established in 1820 and the similar german institution in 1863 both have been highly influential in promoting the interests local and general of the science they are devoted to forward while functions corresponding to theirs have been discharged elsewhere by older or less specially constituted bodies and new ones of a more popular character are springing up on all sides modern facilities of communication have helped to impress more deeply upon modern astronomy its associative character the electric telegraph gives a certain ubiquity which is invaluable to an observer of the skies with the help of a wire a battery and a code of signals he sees whatever is visible from any portion of our globe depending however upon other eyes than his own and so entering as a unit into a widespread organisation of intelligence the press again has been a potent agent of cooperation it has mainly contributed to unite astronomers all over the world into a body animated by the single aim of collecting particulars in their special branch for what bacon termed a history of nature eventually to be interpreted according to the sagacious insight of some one among them gifted above his fellows the first really effective astronomical periodical was the monatliche correspondenz started by von zach in the year 1800 it was followed in 1822 by the astronomische nachrichten later by the memoirs and monthly notices of the astronomical society and by the host of varied publications which now in every civilised country communicate the discoveries made in astronomy to divers classes of readers and so incalculably quicken the current of its onward flow public favour brings in its train material resources it is represented by individual enterprise and finds expression in an ample liberality the first regular observatory in the southern hemisphere was founded at paramatta by sir thomas makdougall brisbane in 1821 the royal observatory at the cape of good hope was completed in 1829 similar establishments were set to work by the east india company at madras bombay and st helena during the first third of the nineteenth century the organisation of astronomy in the united states of america was due to a strong wave of popular enthusiasm in 1825 john quincy adams vainly urged upon congress the foundation of a national observatory but in 1843 the lectures on celestial phenomena of ormsby macknight mitchel stirred an impressionable audience to the pitch of providing him with the means of erecting at cincinnati the first astronomical establishment worthy the name in that great country on the 1st of january 1882 no less than one hundred and fortyfour were active within its boundaries the apparition of the great comet of 1843 gave an additional fillip to the movement to the excitement caused by it the harvard college observatorycalled the american pulkowadirectly owed its origin and the example was not ineffective elsewhere the united states naval observatory was built in 1844 lieutenant maury being its first director corporations universities municipalities vied with each other in the creation of such institutions private subscriptions poured in emissaries were sent to europe to purchase instruments and to procure instruction in their use in a few years the young republic was in point of astronomical efficiency at least on a level with countries where the science had been fostered since the dawn of civilisation a vast widening of the scope of astronomy has accompanied and in part occasioned the great extension of its area of cultivation which our age has witnessed in the last century its purview was a comparatively narrow one problems lying beyond the range of the solar system were almost unheeded because they seemed inscrutable herschel first showed the sidereal universe as accessible to investigation and thereby offered to science new worldsmajestic manifold infinitely infinite to our apprehension in number variety and extentfor future conquest their gradual appropriation has absorbed and will long continue to absorb the powers which it has served to develop but this is not the only direction in which astronomy has enlarged or rather has levelled its boundaries the unification of the physical sciences is perhaps the greatest intellectual feat of recent times the process has included astronomy so that like bacon she may now be said to have taken all knowledge of that kind for her province in return she proffers potent aid for its increase every comet that approaches the sun is the scene of experiments in the electrical illumination of rarefied matter performed on a huge scale for our benefit the sun stars and nebul form so many celestial laboratories where the nature and mutual relations of the chemical elements may be tried by more stringent tests than sublunary conditions afford the laws of terrestrial magnetism can be completely investigated only with the aid of a concurrent study of the face of the sun the solar spectrum will perhaps one day by its recurrent modifications tell us something of impending droughts famines and cyclones astronomy generalises the results of the other sciences she exhibits the laws of nature working over a wider area and under more varied conditions than ordinary experience presents ordinary experience on the other hand has become indispensable to her progress she takes in at one view the indefinitely great and the indefinitely little the mutual revolutions of the stellar multitude during tracts of time which seem to lengthen out to eternity as the mind attempts to traverse them she does not admit to be beyond her ken nor is she indifferent to the constitution of the minutest atom of matter that thrills the ether into light how she entered upon this vastly expanded inheritance and how so far she has dealt with it is attempted to be set forth in the ensuing chapters footnotes footnote 1 the denomination physical astronomy first used by kepler and long appropriated to this branch of the science has of late been otherwise applied footnote 2 histoire de lastronomie au xviiie sicle p 267 part i progress of astronomy during the first half of the nineteenth century chapter i foundation of sidereal astronomy until nearly a hundred years ago the stars were regarded by practical astronomers mainly as a number of convenient fixed points by which the motions of the various members of the solar system could be determined and compared their recognised function in fact was that of milestones on the great celestial highway traversed by the planets as well as on the byways of space occasionally pursued by comets not that curiosity as to their nature and even conjecture as to their origin were at any period absent both were from time to time powerfully stimulated by the appearance of startling novelties in a region described by philosophers as incorruptible or exempt from change the catalogue of hipparchus probably and certainly that of tycho brahe some seventeen centuries later owed each its origin to the temporary blaze of a new star the general aspect of the skies was thus however imperfectly recorded from age to age and with improved appliances the enumeration was rendered more and more accurate and complete but the secrets of the stellar sphere remained inviolate in a qualified though very real sense sir william herschel may be called the founder of sidereal astronomy before his time some curious facts had been noted and some ingenious speculations hazarded regarding the condition of the stars but not even the rudiments of systematic knowledge had been acquired the facts ascertained can be summed up in a very few sentences giordano bruno was the first to set the suns of space in motion but in imagination only his daring surmise was however confirmed in 1718 when halley announced3 that sirius aldebaran betelgeux and arcturus had unmistakably shifted their quarters in the sky since ptolemy assigned their places in his catalogue a similar conclusion was reached by j cassini in 1738 from a comparison of his own observations with those made at cayenne by richer in 1672 and tobias mayer drew up in 1756 a list showing the direction and amount of about fiftyseven proper motions4 founded on starplaces determined by olaus rmer fifty years previously thus the stars were no longer regarded as fixed but the question remained whether the movements perceived were real or only apparent and this it was not yet found possible to answer already in the previous century the ingenious robert hooke had suggested an alteration of the very system of the sun5 to account for certain suspected changes in stellar positions bradley in 1748 and lambert in 1761 pointed out that such apparent displacements by that time well ascertained were in all probability a combined effect of motions both of sun and stars and mayer actually attempted the analysis but without result on the 13th of august 1596 david fabricius an unprofessional astronomer in east friesland saw in the neck of the whale a star of the third magnitude which by october had disappeared it was nevertheless visible in 1603 when bayer marked it in his catalogue with the greek letter omicron and was watched in 163839 through its phases of brightening and apparent extinction by a dutch professor named holwarda6 from hevelius this firstknown periodical star received the name of mira or the wonderful and boulliaud in 1667 fixed the length of its cycle of change at 334 days it was not a solitary instance a star in the swan was perceived by janson in 1600 to show fluctuations of light and montanari found in 1669 that algol in perseus shared the same peculiarity to a marked degree altogether the class embraced in 1782 halfadozen members when it is added that a few starcouples had been noted in singularly but it was supposed accidentally close juxtaposition and that the failure of repeated attempts to measure stellar parallaxes pointed to distances at least 400000 times that of the earth from the sun7 the picture of sidereal science when the last quarter of the eighteenth century began is practically complete it included three items of information that the stars have motions real or apparent that they are immeasurably remote and that a few shine with a periodically variable light nor were these scantily collected facts ordered into any promise of further development they lay at once isolated and confused before the inquirer they needed to be both multiplied and marshalled and it seemed as if centuries of patient toil must elapse before any reliable conclusions could be derived from them the sidereal world was thus the recognised domain of farreaching speculations which remained wholly uncramped by systematic research until herschel entered upon his career as an observer of the heavens the greatest of modern astronomers was born at hanover november 15 1738 he was the fourth child of isaac herschel a hautboyplayer in the band of the hanoverian guard and was early trained to follow his fathers profession on the termination however of the disastrous campaign of 1757 his parents removed him from the regiment there is reason to believe in a somewhat unceremonious manner technically indeed he incurred the penalties of desertion remittedaccording to the duke of sussexs statement to sir george airyby a formal pardon handed to him personally by george iii on his presentation in 17828 at the age of nineteen then his military service having lasted four years he came to england to seek his fortune of the life of struggle and privation which ensued little is known beyond the circumstances that in 1760 he was engaged in training the regimental band of the durham militia and that in 1765 he was appointed organist at halifax in the following year he removed to bath as oboist in linleys orchestra and in october 1767 was promoted to the post of organist in the octagon chapel the tide of prosperity now began to flow for him the most brilliant and modish society in england was at that time to be met at bath and the young hanoverian quickly found himself a favourite and the fashion in it engagements multiplied upon him he became director of the public concerts he conducted oratorios engaged singers organised rehearsals composed anthems chants choral services besides undertaking private tuitions at times amounting to thirtyfive or even thirtyeight lessons a week he in fact personified the musical activity of a place then eminently and energetically musical but these multifarious avocations did not take up the whole of his thoughts his education notwithstanding the poverty of his family had not been neglected and he had always greedily assimilated every kind of knowledge that came in his way now that he was a busy and a prosperous man it might have been expected that he would run on in the deep professional groove laid down for him on the contrary his passion for learning seemed to increase with the diminution of the time available for its gratification he studied italian greek mathematics maclaurins fluxions served to unbend his mind smiths harmonics and optics and fergusons astronomy were the nightly companions of his pillow what he read stimulated without satisfying his intellect he desired not only to know but to discover in 1772 he hired a small telescope and through it caught a preliminary glimpse of the rich and varied fields in which for so many years he was to expatiate henceforward the purpose of his life was fixed it was to obtain a knowledge of the construction of the heavens9 and this sublime ambition he cherished to the end a more powerful instrument was the first desideratum and here his mechanical genius came to his aid having purchased the apparatus of a quaker optician he set about the manufacture of specula with a zeal which seemed to anticipate the wonders they were to disclose to him it was not until fifteen years later that his grinding and polishing machines were invented so the work had at that time to be entirely done by hand during this tedious and laborious process which could not be interrupted without injury and lasted on one occasion sixteen hours his strength was supported by morsels of food put into his mouth by his sister10 and his mind amused by her reading aloud to him the arabian nights don quixote or other light works at length after repeated failures he found himself provided with a reflecting telescopea 512foot gregorianof his own construction a copy of his first observation with it on the great nebula in orionan object of continual amazement and assiduous inquiry to himis preserved by the royal society it bears the date march 4 177411 in the following year he executed his first review of the heavens memorable chiefly as an evidence of the grand and novel conceptions which already inspired him and of the enthusiasm with which he delivered himself up to their guidance overwhelmed with professional engagements he still contrived to snatch some moments for the stars and between the acts at the theatre was often seen running from the harpsichord to his telescope no doubt with that uncommon precipitancy which accompanied all his actions12 he now rapidly increased the power and perfection of his telescopes mirrors of seven ten even twenty feet focal length were successively completed and unprecedented magnifying powers employed his energy was unceasing his perseverance indomitable in the course of twentyone years no less than 430 parabolic specula left his hands he had entered upon his fortysecond year when he sent his first paper to the philosophical transactions yet during the ensuing thirtynine years his contributionsmany of them elaborate treatisesnumbered sixtynine forming a series of extraordinary importance to the history of astronomy as a mere explorer of the heavens his labours were prodigious he discovered 2500 nebul 806 double stars passed the whole firmament in review four several times counted the stars in 3400 gaugefields and executed a photometric classification of the principal stars founded on an elaborate and the first systematically conducted investigation of their relative brightness he was as careful and patient as he was rapid spared no time and omitted no precaution to secure accuracy in his observations yet in one night he would examine singly and attentively up to 400 separate objects the discovery of uranus was a mere incident of the scheme he had marked out for himselfa fruit gathered as it were by the way it formed nevertheless the turningpoint in his career from a stargazing musician he was at once transformed into an eminent astronomer he was relieved from the drudgery of a toilsome profession and installed as royal astronomer with a modest salary of 200 a year funds were provided for the construction of the fortyfoot reflector from the great spacepenetrating power of which he expected unheardof revelations in fine his future work was not only rendered possible but it was stamped as authoritative13 on whitsunday 1782 william and caroline herschel played and sang in public for the last time in st margarets chapel bath in august of the same year the household was moved to datchet near windsor and on april 3 1786 to slough here happiness and honours crowded on the fortunate discoverer in 1788 he married mary only child of james baldwin a merchant of the city of london and widow of mr john pitta lady whose domestic virtues were enhanced by the possession of a large jointure the fruit of their union was one son of whose workthe worthy sequel of his fatherswe shall have to speak further on herschel was created a knight of the hanoverian guelphic order in 1816 and in 1821 he became the first president of the royal astronomical society his son being its first foreign secretary but his health had now for some years been failing and on august 25 1822 he died at slough in the eightyfourth year of his age and was buried in upton churchyard his epitaph claims for him the lofty praise of having burst the barriers of heaven let us see in what sense this is true the first to form any definite idea as to the constitution of the stellar system was thomas wright the son of a carpenter living at byers green near durham with him originated what has been called the grindstone theory of the universe which regarded the milky way as the projection on the sphere of a stratum or disc of stars our sun occupying a position near the centre similar in magnitude and distribution to the lucid orbs of the constellations14 he was followed by kant15 who transcended the views of his predecessor by assigning to nebul the position they long continued to occupy rather on imaginative than scientific grounds of island universes external to and coequal with the galaxy johann heinrich lambert16 a tailors apprentice from mhlhausen followed but independently the conceptions of this remarkable man were grandiose his intuitions bold his views on some points a singular anticipation of subsequent discoveries the sidereal world presented itself to him as a hierarchy of systems starting from the planetary scheme rising to throngs of suns within the circuit of the milky waythe ecliptic of the stars as he phrased itexpanding to include groups of many milky ways these again combining to form the unit of a higher order of assemblage and so onwards and upwards until the mind reels and sinks before the immensity of the contemplated creations thus everything revolvesthe earth round the sun the sun round the centre of his system this system round a centre common to it with other systems this group this assemblage of systems round a centre which is common to it with other groups of the same kind and where shall we have done17 the stupendous problem thus speculatively attempted herschel undertook to grapple with experimentally the upshot of this memorable inquiry was the inclusion for the first time within the sphere of human knowledge of a connected body of facts and inferences from facts regarding the sidereal universe in other words the foundation of what may properly be called a science of the stars tobias mayer had illustrated the perspective effects which must ensue in the stellar sphere from a translation of the solar system by comparing them to the separating in front and closing up behind of trees in a forest to the eye of an advancing spectator18 but the appearances which he thus correctly described he was unable to detect by a more searching analysis of a smaller collection of proper motions herschel succeeded in rendering apparent the very consequences foreseen by mayer he showed for example that arcturus and vega did in fact appear to recede from and sirius and aldebaran to approach each other by very minute amounts and with a striking effort of divinatory genius placed the apex or point of direction of the suns motion close to the star lambda in the constellation hercules19 within a few degrees of the spot indicated by later and indefinitely more refined methods of research he resumed the subject in 180520 but though employing a more rigorous method was scarcely so happy in his result in 180621 he made a preliminary attempt to ascertain the speed of the suns journey fixing it by doubtless much too low an estimate at about three miles a second yet the validity of his general conclusion as to the line of solar travel though long doubted has been triumphantly confirmed the question as to the secular parallax of the fixed stars was in effect answered with their annual parallax however the case was very different the search for it had already led bradley to the important discoveries of the aberration of light and the nutation of the earths axis it was now about to lead herschel to a discovery of a different but even more elevated character yet in neither case was the object primarily sought attained from the very first promulgation of the copernician theory the seeming immobility of the stars had been urged as an argument against its truth for if the earth really travelled in a vast orbit round the sun objects in surrounding space should appear to change their positions unless their distances were on a scale which to the narrow ideas of the universe then prevailing seemed altogether extravagant22 the existence of such apparent or parallactic displacements was accordingly regarded as the touchstone of the new views and their detection became an object of earnest desire to those interested in maintaining them copernicus himself made the attempt but with his triquetrum a jointed wooden rule with the divisions marked in ink constructed by himself23 he was hardly able to measure angles of ten minutes far less fractions of a second galileo a more impassioned defender of the system strained his ears as it were from arcetri in his blind and sorrowful old age for news of a discovery which two more centuries had still to wait for hooke believed he had found a parallax for the bright star in the head of the dragon but was deceived bradley convinced himself that such effects were too minute for his instruments to measure herschel made a fresh attempt by a practically untried method it is a matter of daily experience that two objects situated at different distances seem to a beholder in motion to move relatively to each other this principle galileo in the third of his dialogues on the systems of the world24 proposed to employ for the determination of stellar parallax for two stars lying apparently close together but in reality separated by a great gulf of space must shift their mutual positions when observed from opposite points of the earths orbit or rather the remoter forms a virtually fixed point to which the movements of the other can be conveniently referred by this means complications were abolished more numerous and perplexing than galileo himself was aware of and the problem was reduced to one of simple micrometrical measurement the doublestar method was also suggested by james gregory in 1675 and again by wallis in 169325 huygens first and afterwards dr long of cambridge about 1750 made futile experiments with it and it eventually led in the hands of bessel to the successful determination of the parallax of 61 cygni its advantages were not lost upon herschel his attempt to assign definite distances to the nearest stars was no isolated effort but part of the settled plan upon which his observations were conducted he proposed to sound the heavens and the first requisite was a knowledge of the length of his soundingline thus it came about that his special attention was early directed to double stars i resolved he writes26 to examine every star in the heavens with the utmost attention and a very high power that i might collect such materials for this research as would enable me to fix my observations upon those that would best answer my end the subject has already proved so extensive and still promises so rich a harvest to those who are inclined to be diligent in the pursuit that i cannot help inviting every lover of astronomy to join with me in observations that must inevitably lead to new discoveries the first result of these inquiries was a classed catalogue of 269 double stars presented to the royal society in 1782 followed after three years by an additional list of 434 in both these collections the distances separating the individuals of each pair were carefully measured and with a few exceptions the angles made with the hourcircle by the lines joining their centres technically called angles of position were determined with the aid of a revolvingwire micrometer specially devised for the purpose moreover an important novelty was introduced by the observation of the various colours visible in the starcouples the singular and vivid contrasts of which were now for the first time described double stars were at that time supposed to be a purely optical phenomenon their components it was thought while in reality indefinitely remote from each other were brought into fortuitous contiguity by the chance of lying nearly in the same line of sight from the earth yet bradley had noticed a change of 30 between 1718 and 1759 in the positionangle of the two stars forming castor and was thus within a hairs breadth of the discovery of their physical connection27 while the rev john michell arguing by the doctrine of probabilities wrote as follows in 1767it is highly probable in particular and next to a certainty in general that such double stars as appear to consist of two or more stars placed very near together do really consist of stars placed near together and under the influence of some general law28 and in 178429 it is not improbable that a few years may inform us that some of the great number of double triple stars etc which have been observed by mr herschel are systems of bodies revolving about each other this remarkable speculative anticipation had a practical counterpart in germany father christian mayer a jesuit astronomer at mannheim set himself in january 1776 to collect examples of stellar pairs and shortly after published the supposed discovery of satellites to many of the principal stars30 but his observations were neither exact nor prolonged enough to lead to useful results in such an inquiry his disclosures were derided his planetstars treated as results of hallucination on na point cru des choses aussi extraordinaires wrote lalande31 within one year of a bettergrounded announcement to the same effect herschel at first shared the general opinion as to the merely optical connection of double stars of this the purpose for which he made his collection is in itself sufficient evidence since what may be called the differential method of parallaxes depends as we have seen for its efficacy upon disparity of distance it was much too soon he declared in 178232 to form any theories of small stars revolving round large ones while in the year following33 he remarked that the identical proper motions of the two stars forming to the naked eye the single bright orb of castor could only be explained as both equally due to the systematic parallax caused by the suns movement in space plainly showing that the notion of a physical tie compelling the two bodies to travel together had not as yet entered into his speculations but he was eminently open to conviction and had moreover by observations unparalleled in amount as well as in kind prepared ample materials for convincing himself and others in 1802 he was able to announce the fact of his discovery and in the two ensuing years to lay in detail before the royal society proofs gathered from the labours of a quarter of a century of orbital revolution in the case of as many as fifty double stars henceforth he declared to be held as real binary combinations intimately held together by the bond of mutual attraction34 the fortunate preservation in dr maskelynes notebook of a remark made by bradley about 1759 to the effect that the line joining the components of castor was an exact prolongation of that joining castor with pollux added eighteen years to the time during which the pair were under scrutiny and confirmed the evidence of change afforded by more recent observations approximate periods were fixed for many of the revolving sunsfor castor 342 years for gamma leonis 1200 delta serpentis 375 eta bootis 1681 years eta lyr was noted as a doubledoublestar a change of relative situation having been detected in each of the two pairs composing the group and the occultation was described of one star by another in the course of their mutual revolutions as exemplified in 1795 by the rapidly circulating system of zeta herculis thus by the sagacity and perseverance of a single observer a firm basis was at last provided upon which to raise the edifice of sidereal science the analogy long presumed to exist between the mighty star of our system and the bright points of light spangling the firmament was shown to be no fiction of the imagination but a physical reality the fundamental quality of attractive power was proved to be common to matter so far as the telescope was capable of exploring and law subordination and regularity to give testimony of supreme and intelligent design no less in those limitless regions of space than in our narrow terrestrial home the discovery was emphatically in aragos phrase one with a future since it introduced the element of precise knowledge where more or less probable conjecture had previously held almost undivided sway and precise knowledge tends to propagate itself and advance from point to point we have now to speak of herschels pioneering work in the skies to explore with line and plummet the shining zone of the milky way to delineate its form measure its dimensions and search out the intricacies of its construction was the primary task of his life which he never lost sight of and to which all his other investigations were subordinate he was absolutely alone in this bold endeavour unaided he had to devise methods accumulate materials and sift out results yet it may safely be asserted that all the knowledge we possess on this sublime subject was prepared and the greater part of it anticipated by him the ingenious method of stargauging and its issue in the delineation of the sidereal system as an irregular stratum of evenlyscattered suns is the bestknown part of his work but it was in truth only a first rude approximation the principle of which maintained its credit in the literature of astronomy a full halfcentury after its abandonment by its author this principle was the general equality of star distribution if equal portions of space really held equal numbers of stars it is obvious that the number of stars visible in any particular direction would be strictly proportional to the range of the system in that direction apparent accumulation being produced by real extent the process of gauging the heavens accordingly consisted in counting the stars in successive telescopic fields and calculating thence the depths of space necessary to contain them the result of 3400 such operations was the plan of the galaxy familiar to every reader of an astronomical textbook widelyvarying evidence was as might have been expected derived from an examination of different portions of the sky some fields of view were almost blank while others in or near the milky way blazed with the radiance of many hundred stars compressed into an area about onefourth that of the fullmoon in the most crowded parts 116000 were stated to have been passed in review within a quarter of an hour here the length of his soundingline was estimated by herschel at about 497 times the distance of siriusin other words the bounding orb or farthest sun of the system in that direction so far as could be seen with the 20foot reflector was thus inconceivably remote but since the distance of sirius no less than of every other fixed star was as yet an unknown quantity the dimensions inferred for the galaxy were of course purely relative a knowledge of its form and structure might admitting the truth of the fundamental hypothesis be obtained but its real or absolute size remained altogether undetermined even as early as 1785 however herschel perceived traces of a tendency which completely invalidated the supposition of any approach to an average uniformity of distribution this was the action of what he called a clustering power in the milky way many gathering clusters35 were already discernible to him even while he endeavoured to obtain a true mean result on the assumption that each star in space was separated from its neighbours as widely as the sun from sirius it appears he wrote in 1789 that the heavens consist of regions where suns are gathered into separate systems and in certain assemblages he was able to trace a course or tide of stars setting towards a centre denoting not doubtfully the presence of attractive forces36 thirteen years later he described our sun and his constellated companions as surrounded by a magnificent collection of innumerable stars called the milky way which must occasion a very powerful balance of opposite attractions to hold the intermediate stars at rest for though our sun and all the stars we see may truly be said to be in the plane of the milky way yet i am now convinced by a long inspection and continued examination of it that the milky way itself consists of stars very differently scattered from those which are immediately about us this immense aggregation he added is by no means uniform its component stars show evident signs of clustering together into many separate allotments37 the following sentences written in 1811 contain a definite retractation of the view frequently attributed to him i must freely confess he says that by continuing my sweeps of the heavens my opinion of the arrangement of the stars and their magnitudes and of some other particulars has undergone a gradual change and indeed when the novelty of the subject is considered we cannot be surprised that many things formerly taken for granted should on examination prove to be different from what they were generally but incautiously supposed to be for instance an equal scattering of the stars may be admitted in certain calculations but when we examine the milky way or the closely compressed clusters of stars of which my catalogues have recorded so many instances this supposed equality of scattering must be given up38 another assumption the fallacy of which he had not the means of detecting since become available was retained by him to the end of his life it was that the brightness of a star afforded an approximate measure of its distance upon this principle he founded in 1817 his method of limiting apertures39 by which two stars brought into view in two precisely similar telescopes were equalised by covering a certain portion of the objectglass collecting the more brilliant rays the distances of the orbs compared were then taken to be in the ratio of the reduced to the original apertures of the instruments with which they were examined if indeed the absolute lustre of each were the same the result might be accepted with confidence but since we have no warrant for assuming a standard star to facilitate our computations but much reason to suppose an indefinite range not only of size but of intrinsic brilliancy in the suns of our firmament conclusions drawn from such a comparison are entirely worthless in another branch of sidereal science besides that of stellar aggregation herschel may justly be styled a pioneer he was the first to bestow serious study on the enigmatical objects known as nebul the history of the acquaintance of our race with them is comparatively short the only one recognised before the invention of the telescope was that in the girdle of andromeda certainly familiar in the middle of the tenth century to the persian astronomer abdurrahman alsfi and marked with dots on spanish and dutch constellationcharts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries40 yet so little was it noticed that it might practically be saidas far as europe is concernedto have been discovered in 1612 by simon marius mayer of genzenhausen who aptly described its appearance as that of a candle shining through horn the first mention of the great orion nebula is by a swiss jesuit named cysatus who succeeded father scheiner in the chair of mathematics at ingolstadt he used it apparently without any suspicion of its novelty as a term of comparison for the comet of december 161841 a novelty nevertheless to astronomers it still remained in 1656 when huygens discerned as it were an hiatus in the sky affording a glimpse of a more luminous region beyond42 halley in 1716 knew of six nebul which he believed to be composed of a lucid medium diffused through the ether of space43 he appears however to have been unacquainted with some previously noticed by hevelius lacaille brought back with him from the cape a list of fortytwothe firstfruits of observation in southern skiesarranged in three numerically equal classes44 and messier nicknamed by louis xv the ferret of comets finding such objects a source of extreme perplexity in the pursuit of his chosen game attempted to eliminate by methodising them and drew up a catalogue comprising in 1781 103 entries45 these preliminary attempts shrank into insignificance when herschel began to sweep the heavens with his giant telescopes in 1786 he presented to the royal society a descriptive catalogue of 1000 nebul and clusters followed three years later by a second of as many more to which he added in 1802 a further gleaning of 500 on the subject of their nature his views underwent a remarkable change finding that his potent instruments resolved into stars many nebulous patches in which no signs of such a structure had previously been discernible he naturally concluded that resolvability was merely a question of distance and telescopic power he was as he said himself led on by almost imperceptible degrees from evident clusters such as the pleiades to spots without a trace of stellar formation the gradations being so well connected as to leave no doubt that all these phenomena were equally stellar the singular variety of their appearance was thus described by him i have seen he says double and treble nebul variously arranged large ones with small seeming attendants narrow but much extended lucid nebul or bright dashes some of the shape of a fan resembling an electric brush issuing from a lucid point others of the cometic shape with a seeming nucleus in the centre or like cloudy stars surrounded with a nebulous atmosphere a different sort again contain a nebulosity of the milky kind like that wonderful inexplicable phenomenon about theta orionis while others shine with a fainter mottled kind of light which denotes their being resolvable into stars46 these curious objects he considered to be no less than whole sidereal systems47 some of which might well outvie our milky way in grandeur he admitted however a wide diversity in condition as well as compass the system to which our sun belongs he described as a very extensive branching congeries of many millions of stars which probably owes its origin to many remarkably large as well as pretty closely scattered small stars that may have drawn together the rest48 but the continued action of this same clustering power would he supposed eventually lead to the breakingup of the original majestic galaxy into two or three hundred separate groups already visibly gathering such minor nebul due to the decay of other branching nebul similar to our own he recognised by the score lying as it were stratified in certain quarters of the sky one of these nebulous beds he informs us is so rich that in passing through a section of it in the time of only thirtysix minutes i detected no less than thirtyone nebul all distinctly visible upon a fine blue sky the stratum of coma berenices he judged to be the nearest to our system of such layers nor did the marked aggregation of nebul towards both poles of the circle of the milky way escape his notice by a continuation of the same process of reasoning he was enabled as he thought to trace the lifehistory of nebul from a primitive loose and extended formation through clusters of gradually increasing compression down to the kind named by him planetary because of the defined and uniform discs which they present these he regarded as very aged and drawing on towards a period of change or dissolution49 this method of viewing the heavens he concluded seems to throw them into a new kind of light they now are seen to resemble a luxuriant garden which contains the greatest variety of productions in different flourishing beds and one advantage we may at least reap from it is that we can as it were extend the range of our experience to an immense duration for to continue the simile which i have borrowed from the vegetable kingdom is it not almost the same thing whether we live successively to witness the germination blooming foliage fecundity fading withering and corruption of a plant or whether a vast number of specimens selected from every stage through which the plant passes in the course of its existence be brought at once to our view50 but already this supposed continuity was broken after mature deliberation on the phenomena presented by nebulous stars herschel was induced in 1791 to modify essentially his original opinion when i pursued these researches he says i was in the situation of a natural philosopher who follows the various species of animals and insects from the height of their perfection down to the lowest ebb of life when arriving at the vegetable kingdom he can scarcely point out to us the precise boundary where the animal ceases and the plant begins and may even go so far as to suspect them not to be essentially different but recollecting himself he compares for instance one of the human species to a tree and all doubt upon the subject vanishes before him in the same manner we pass through gentle steps from a coarse cluster of stars such as the pleiades till we find ourselves brought to an object such as the nebula in orion where we are still inclined to remain in the once adopted idea of stars exceedingly remote and inconceivably crowded as being the occasion of that remarkable appearance it seems therefore to require a more dissimilar object to set us right again a glance like that of the naturalist who casts his eye from the perfect animal to the perfect vegetable is wanting to remove the veil from the mind of the astronomer the object i have mentioned above is the phenomenon that was wanting for this purpose view for instance the 19th cluster of my 6th class and afterwards cast your eye on this cloudy star and the result will be no less decisive than that of the naturalist we have alluded to our judgment i may venture to say will be that the nebulosity about the star is not of a starry nature51 the conviction thus arrived at of the existence in space of a widely diffused shining fluid a conviction long afterwards fully justified by the spectroscope led him into a field of endless speculation what was its nature should it be compared to the coruscation of the electric fluid in the aurora borealis or to the more magnificent cone of the zodiacal light above all what was its function in the cosmos and on this point he already gave a hint of the direction in which his mind was moving by the remark that this selfluminous matter seemed more fit to produce a star by its condensation than to depend on the star for its existence52 this was not a novel idea tycho brahe had tried to explain the blaze of the star of 1572 as due to a sudden concentration of nebulous material in the milky way even pointing out the space left dark and void by the withdrawal of the luminous stuff and kepler theorising on a similar stellar apparition in 1604 followed nearly in the same track but under herschels treatment the nebular origin of stars first acquired the consistency of a formal theory he meditated upon it long and earnestly and in two elaborate treatises published respectively in 1811 and 1814 he at length set forth the arguments in its favour these rested entirely upon the principle of continuity between the successive classes of his assortment of developing objects there was as he said perhaps not so much difference as would be in an annual description of the human figure were it given from the birth of a child till he comes to be a man in his prime53 from diffused nebulosity barely visible in the most powerful lightgathering instruments but which he estimated to cover nearly 152 square degrees of the heavens54 to planetary nebul supposed to be already centrally solid instances were alleged of every stage and phase of condensation the validity of his reasoning however was evidently impaired by his confessed inability to distinguish between the dim rays of remote clusters and the milky light of true gaseous nebul it may be said that such speculations are futile in themselves and necessarily barren of results but they gratify an inherent tendency of the human mind and if pursued in a becoming spirit should be neither reproved nor disdained herschels theory still holds the field the testimony of recent discoveries with regard to it having proved strongly confirmatory of its principle although not of its details strangely enough it seems to have been propounded in complete independence of laplaces nebular hypothesis as to the origin of the solar system indeed it dated as we have seen in its first inception from 1791 while the french geometricians view was not advanced until 1796 we may now briefly sum up the chief results of herschels long years of watching the heavens the apparent motions of the stars had been disentangled one portion being clearly shown to be due to a translation towards a point in the constellation hercules of the sun and his attendant planets while a large balance of displacement was left to be accounted for by real movements various in extent and direction of the stars themselves by the action of a central force similar to if not identical with gravity suns of every degree of size and splendour and sometimes brilliantly contrasted in colour were seen to be held together in systems consisting of two three four even six members whose revolutions exhibited a wide range of variety both in period and in orbital form a new department of physical astronomy was thus created55 and rigid calculation for the first time made possible within the astral region the vast problem of the arrangement and relations of the millions of stars forming the milky way was shown to be capable of experimental treatment and of at least partial solution notwithstanding the variety and complexity seen to prevail to an extent previously undreamt of in the arrangement of that majestic system the existence of a luminous fluid diffused through enormous tracts of space and intimately associated with stellar bodies was virtually demonstrated and its place and use in creation attempted to be divined by a bold but plausible conjecture change on a stupendous scale was inferred or observed to be everywhere in progress periodical stars shone out and again decayed progressive ebbings or flowings of light were indicated as probable in many stars under no formal suspicion of variability forces were everywhere perceived to be at work by which the very structure of the heavens themselves must be slowly but fundamentally modified in all directions groups were seen to be formed or forming tides and streams of suns to be setting towards powerful centres of attraction new systems to be in process of formation while effete ones hastened to decay or regeneration when the course appointed for them by infinite wisdom was run and thus to quote the words of the observer who had looked farther into space than ever human being did before him56 the state into which the incessant action of the clustering power has brought the milky way at present is a kind of chronometer that may be used to measure the time of its past and future existence and although we do not know the rate of going of this mysterious chronometer it is nevertheless certain that since the breakingup of the parts of the milky way affords a proof that it cannot last for ever it equally bears witness that its past duration cannot be admitted to be infinite57 footnotes footnote 3 phil trans vol xxx p 737 footnote 4 out of eighty stars compared fiftyseven were

chapter ii progress of sidereal astronomy we have now to consider labours of a totally different character from those of sir william herschel exploration and discovery do not constitute the whole business of astronomy the less adventurous though not less arduous task of gaining a more and more complete mastery over the problems immemorially presented to her may on the contrary be said to form her primary duty a knowledge of the movements of the heavenly bodies has from the earliest times been demanded by the urgent needs of mankind and science finds its advantage as in many cases it has taken its origin in condescension to practical claims indeed to bring such knowledge as near as possible to absolute precision has been defined by no mean authority58 as the true end of astronomy several causes concurred about the beginning of the last century to give a fresh and powerful impulse to investigations having this end in view the rapid progress of theory almost compelled a corresponding advance in observation instrumental improvements rendered such an advance possible herschels discoveries quickened public interest in celestial inquiries royal imperial and grandducal patronage widened the scope of individual effort the heart of the new movement was in germany hitherto the observatory of flamsteed and bradley had been the acknowledged centre of practical astronomy greenwich observations were the standard of reference all over europe and the art of observing prospered in direct proportion to the fidelity with which greenwich methods were imitated dr maskelyne who held the post of astronomer royal during fortysix years from 1765 to 1811 was no unworthy successor to the eminent men who had gone before him his foundation of the nautical almanac in 1767 alone constitutes a valid title to fame he introduced at the observatory the important innovation of the systematic publication of results and the careful and prolonged series of observations executed by him formed the basis of the improved theories and corrected tables of the celestial movements which were rapidly being brought to completion abroad his catalogue of thirtysix fundamental stars was besides excellent in its way and most serviceable yet he was devoid of bradleys instinct for divining the needs of the future he was fitted rather to continue a tradition than to found a school the old ways were dear to him and indefatigable as he was a definite purpose was wanting to compel him by its exigencies along the path of progress thus for almost fifty years after bradleys death the acquisition of a small achromatic59 was the only notable change made in the instrumental equipment of the observatory the transit the zenith sector and the mural quadrant with which bradley had done his incomparable work retained their places long after they had become deteriorated by time and obsolete by the progress of invention and it was not until the very close of his career that maskelyne compelled by ponds detection of serious errors ordered a troughtons circle which he did not live to employ meanwhile the heavy national disasters with which germany was overwhelmed in the early part of the nineteenth century seemed to stimulate rather than impede the intellectual revival already for some years in progress there astronomy was amongst the first of the sciences to feel the new impulse by the efforts of bode olbers schrter and von zach just and elevated ideas on the subject were propagated intelligence was diffused and a firm ground prepared for common action in mutual sympathy and disinterested zeal they received powerful aid through the foundation in 1804 by a young artillery officer named von reichenbach of an optical and mechanical institute at munich here the work of english instrumental artists was for the first time rivalled and that of english opticianswhen fraunhofer entered the new establishmentfar surpassed the development given to the refracting telescope by this extraordinary man was indispensable to the progress of that fundamental part of astronomy which consists in the exact determination of the places of the heavenly bodies reflectors are brilliant engines of discovery but they lend themselves with difficulty to the prosaic work of measuring right ascensions and polar distances a signal improvement in the art of making and working flintglass thus most opportunely coincided with the rise of a german school of scientific mechanicians to furnish the instrumental means needed for the reform which was at hand of the leader of that reform it is now time to speak friedrich wilhelm bessel was born at minden in westphalia july 22 1784 a certain taste for figures coupled with a still stronger distaste for the latin accidence directed his inclination and his fathers choice towards a mercantile career in his fifteenth year accordingly he entered the house of kuhlenkamp and sons in bremen as an apprenticed clerk he was now thrown completely upon his own resources from his father a struggling government official heavily weighted with a large family he was well aware that he had nothing to expect his dormant faculties were roused by the necessity for selfdependence and he set himself to push manfully forward along the path that lay before him the post of supercargo on one of the trading expeditions sent out from the hanseatic towns to china and the east indies was the aim of his boyish ambition for the attainment of which he sought to qualify himself by the industrious acquisition of suitable and useful knowledge he learned english in two or three months picked up spanish with the casual aid of a gunsmiths apprentice studied the geography of the distant lands which he hoped to visit collected information as to their climates inhabitants products and the courses of trade he desired to add some acquaintance with the art then much neglected of taking observations at sea and thus led on from navigation to astronomy and from astronomy to mathematics he groped his way into a new world it was characteristic of him that the practical problems of science should have attracted him before his mind was as yet sufficiently matured to feel the charm of its abstract beauties his first attempt at observation was made with a sextant rudely constructed under his own directions and a common clock its object was the determination of the longitude of bremen and its success he tells us himself60 filled him with a rapture of delight which by confirming his tastes decided his destiny he now eagerly studied bodes jahrbuch and von zachs monatliche correspondenz overcoming each difficulty as it arose with the aid of lalandes trait dastronomie and supplying with amazing rapidity his early deficiency in mathematical training in two years he was able to attack a problem which would have tasked the patience if not the skill of the most experienced astronomer amongst the earl of egremonts papers von zach had discovered harriots observations on halleys comet at its appearance in 1607 and published them as a supplement to bodes annual with an elaborate care inspired by his youthful ardour though hardly merited by their loose nature bessel deduced from them an orbit for that celebrated body and presented the work to olbers whose reputation in cometary researches gave a special fitness to the proffered homage the benevolent physicianastronomer of bremen welcomed with surprised delight such a performance emanating from such a source fifteen years previously the french academy had crowned a similar work now its equal was produced by a youth of twenty busily engaged in commercial pursuits selftaught and obliged to snatch from sleep the hours devoted to study the paper was immediately sent to von zach for publication with a note from olbers explaining the circumstances of its author and the name of bessel became the common property of learned europe he had however as yet no intention of adopting astronomy as his profession for two years he continued to work in the countinghouse by day and to pore over the mcanique cleste and the differential calculus by night but the post of assistant in schrters observatory at lilienthal having become vacant by the removal of harding to gttingen in 1805 olbers procured for him the offer of it it was not without a struggle that he resolved to exchange the desk for the telescope his reputation with his employers was of the highest he had thoroughly mastered the details of the business which his keen practical intelligence followed with lively interest his years of apprenticeship were on the point of expiring and an immediate and not unwelcome prospect of comparative affluence lay before him the love of science however prevailed he chose poverty and the stars and went to lilienthal with a salary of a hundred thalers yearly looking back over his lifes work olbers long afterwards declared that the greatest service which he had rendered to astronomy was that of having discerned directed and promoted the genius of bessel61 for four years he continued in schrters employment at the end of that time the prussian government chose him to superintend the erection of a new observatory at knigsberg which after many vexatious delays caused by the prostrate condition of the country was finished towards the end of 1813 knigsberg was the first really efficient german observatory it became moreover a centre of improvement not for germany alone but for the whole astronomical world during twoandthirty years it was the scene of bessels labours and bessels labours had for their aim the reconstruction on an amended and uniform plan of the entire science of observation a knowledge of the places of the stars is the foundation of astronomy62 their configuration lends to the skies their distinctive features and marks out the shifting tracks of more mobile objects with relatively fixed and generally unvarying points of light a more detailed and accurate acquaintance with the stellar multitude regarded from a purely uranographical point of view has accordingly formed at all times a primary object of celestial science and was during the last century cultivated with a zeal and success by which all previous efforts were dwarfed into insignificance in lalandes histoire cleste published in 1801 the places of no less than 47390 stars were given but in the rough as it were and consequently needing laborious processes of calculation to render them available for exact purposes piazzi set an example of improved methods of observation resulting in the publication in 1803 and 1814 of two catalogues of about 7600 starsthe second being a revision and enlargement of the firstwhich for their time were models of what such works should be63 stephen groombridge at blackheath was similarly and most beneficially active but something more was needed than the diligence of individual observers a systematic reform was called for and it was this which bessel undertook and carried through direct observation furnishes only what has been called the raw material of the positions of the heavenly bodies64 a number of highly complex corrections have to be applied before their mean can be disengaged from their apparent places on the sphere of these the most considerable and familiar is atmospheric refraction by which objects seem to stand higher in the sky than they in reality do the effect being evanescent at the zenith and attaining by gradations varying with conditions of pressure and temperature a maximum at the horizon moreover the points to which measurements are referred are themselves in motion either continually in one direction or periodically to and fro the precession of the equinoxes is slowly progressive or rather retrogressive the nutation of the pole oscillatory in a period of about eighteen years added to which the noninstantaneous transmission of light combined with the movement of the earth in its orbit causes a small annual displacement known as aberration now it is easy to see that any uncertainty in the application of these corrections saps the very foundations of exact astronomy extremely minute quantities it is true are concerned but the life and progress of modern celestial science depends upon the sure recognition of extremely minute quantities in the early years of the nineteenth century however no uniform system of reduction so the complete correction of observational results is termed had been established much was left to the individual caprice of observers who selected for the several elements of reduction such values as seemed best to themselves hence arose much hurtful confusion tending to hinder united action and mar the usefulness of laborious researches for this state of things bessel by the exercise of consummate diligence sagacity and patience provided an entirely satisfactory remedy his first step was an elaborate investigation of the precious series of observations made by bradley at greenwich from 1750 until his death in 1762 the catalogue of 3222 stars which he extracted from them gave the earliest example of the systematic reduction on a uniform plan of such a body of work it is difficult without entering into details out of place in a volume like the present to convey an idea of the arduous nature of this task it involved the formation of a theory of the errors of each of bradleys instruments and a difficult and delicate inquiry into the true value of each correction to be applied before the entries in the greenwich journals could be developed into a finished and authentic catalogue although completed in 1813 it was not until five years later that the results appeared with the proud but not inappropriate title of fundamenta astronomi the eminent value of the work consisted in this that by providing a mass of entirely reliable information as to the state of the heavens at the epoch 1755 it threw back the beginning of exact astronomy almost half a century by comparison with piazzis catalogues the amount of precession was more accurately determined the proper motions of a considerable number of stars became known with certainty and definite predictionthe certificate of initiation into the secrets of natureat last became possible as regards the places of the stars bessels final improvements in the methods of reduction were published in 1830 in his tabul regiomontan they not only constituted an advance in accuracy but afforded a vast increase of facility in application and were at once and everywhere adopted thus astronomy became a truly universal science uncertainties and disparities were banished and observations made at all times and places rendered mutually comparable65 more however yet remained to be done in order to verify with greater strictness the results drawn from the bradley and piazzi catalogues a third term of comparison was wanted and this bessel undertook to supply by a course of 75011 observations executed during the years 182133 with the utmost nicety of care the number of accurately known stars was brought up to above 50000 and an ample store of trustworthy facts laid up for the use of future astronomers in this department argelander whom he attracted from finance to astronomy and trained in his own methods was his assistant and successor the great bonn durchmusterung66 in which 324198 stars visible in the northern hemisphere are enumerated and the corresponding atlas published in 185763 constituting a picture of our sidereal surroundings of heretofore unapproached completeness may be justly said to owe their origin to bessels initiative and to form a sequel to what he commenced but his activity was not solely occupied with the promotion of a comprehensive reform in astronomy it embraced special problems as well the longbaffled search for a parallax of the fixed stars was resumed with fresh zeal as each mechanical or optical improvement held out fresh hopes of a successful issue illusory results abounded piazza in 1805 perceived as he supposed considerable annual displacements in vega aldebaran sirius and procyon the truth being that his instruments were worn out with constant use and could no longer be depended upon67 his countryman calandrelli was similarly deluded the celebrated controversy between the astronomer royal and dr brinkley director of the dublin college observatory turned on the same subject brinkley who was in possession of a firstrate meridiancircle believed himself to have discovered relatively large parallaxes for four of the brightest stars pond relying on the testimony of the greenwich instruments asserted their nullity the dispute protracted for fourteen years from 1810 until 1824 was brought to no definite conclusion but the strong presumption on the negative side was abundantly justified in the event there was good reason for incredulity in the matter of parallaxes announcements of their detection had become so frequent as to be discredited before they were disproved and struve who investigated the subject at dorpat in 181821 had clearly shown that the quantities concerned were too small to come within the reliable measuring powers of any instrument then in use already however the means were being prepared of giving to those powers a large increase on the 21st july 1801 two old houses in an alley of munich tumbled down burying in their ruins the occupants of whom one alone was extricated alive though seriously injured this was an orphan lad of fourteen named joseph fraunhofer the elector maximilian joseph was witness of the scene became interested in the survivor and consoled his misfortune with a present of eighteen ducats seldom was money better bestowed part of it went to buy books and a glasspolishing machine with the help of which young fraunhofer studied mathematics and optics and secretly exercised himself in the shaping and finishing of lenses the remainder purchased his release from the tyranny of one weichselberger a lookingglass maker by trade to whom he had been bound apprentice on the death of his parents a period of struggle and privation followed during which however he rapidly extended his acquirements and was thus eminently fitted for the task awaiting him when in 1806 he entered the optical department of the establishment founded two years previously by von reichenbach and utzschneider he now zealously devoted himself to the improvement of the achromatic telescope and after a prolonged study of the theory of lenses and many toilsome experiments in the manufacture of flintglass he succeeded in perfecting december 12 1817 an objectglass of exquisite quality and finish 912 inches in diameter and of 14 feet focal length this as it was then considered gigantic lens was secured by struve for the russian government and the great dorpat refractorthe first of the large achromatics which have played such an important part in modern astronomywas late in 1824 set up in the place which it still occupies by ingenious improvements in mounting and fitting it was adapted to the finest micrometrical work and thus offered unprecedented facilities both for the examination of double stars in which struve chiefly employed it and for such subtle measurements as might serve to reveal or disprove the existence of a sensible stellar parallax fraunhofer moreover constructed for the observatory at knigsberg the first really available heliometer the principle of this instrument termed with more propriety a divided objectglass micrometer is the separation by a strictly measurable amount of two distinct images of the same object if a double star for instance be under examination the two halflenses into which the objectglass is divided are shifted until the upper star say in one image is brought into coincidence with the lower star in the other when their distance apart becomes known by the amount of motion employed68 this virtually new engine of research was delivered and mounted in 1829 three years after the termination of the life of its deviser the dorpat lens had brought to fraunhofer a title of nobility and the sole management of the munich optical institute completely separated since 1814 from the mechanical department what he had achieved however was but a small part of what he meant to achieve he saw before him the possibility of nearly quadrupling the lightgathering capacity of the great achromatic acquired by struve he meditated improvements in reflectors as important as those he had already effected in refractors and was besides eagerly occupied with investigations into the nature of light the momentous character of which we shall byandby have an opportunity of estimating but his health was impaired it is said from the weakening effects of his early accident combined with excessive and unwholesome toil and still hoping for its restoration from a projected journey to italy he died of consumption june 7 1826 aged thirtynine years his tomb in munich bears the concise eulogy approximavit sidera bessel had no sooner made himself acquainted with the exquisite defining powers of the knigsberg heliometer than he resolved to employ them in an attack upon the now secular problem of stardistances but it was not until 1837 that he found leisure to pursue the inquiry in choosing his teststar he adopted a new principle it had hitherto been assumed that our nearest neighbours in space must be found among the brightest ornaments of our skies the knowledge of stellar proper motions afforded by the critical comparison of recent with earlier starplaces suggested a different criterion of distance it is impossible to escape from the conclusion that the apparently swiftestmoving stars are on the whole also the nearest to us however numerous the individual exceptions to the rule now as early as 179269 piazzi had noted as an indication of relative vicinity to the earth the unusually large proper motion 52 annually of a double star of the fifth magnitude in the constellation of the swan still more emphatically in 181270 bessel drew the attention of astronomers to the fact and 61 cygni became known as the flying star the seeming rate of its flight indeed is of so leisurely a kind that in a thousand years it will have shifted its place by less than 312 lunar diameters and that a quarter of a million would be required to carry it round the entire circuit of the visible heavens nevertheless it has few rivals in rapidity of movement the apparent displacement of the vast majority of stars being by comparison almost insensible this interesting though inconspicuous object then was chosen by bessel to be put to the question with his heliometer while struve made a similar and somewhat earlier trial with the bright gem of the lyre whose arabic title of the falling eagle survives as a timeworn remnant in vega both astronomers agreed to use the differential method for which their instruments and the vicinity to their selected stars of minute physically detached companions offered special facilities in the last month of 1838 bessel made known the result of one years observations showing for 61 cygni a parallax of about a third of a second 0313671 he then had his heliometer taken down and repaired after which he resumed the inquiry and finally terminated a series of 402 measures in march 184072 the resulting parallax of 03483 corresponding to a distance about 600000 times that of the earth from the sun seemed to be ascertained beyond the possibility of cavil and is memorable as the first published instance of the fathomline so industriously thrown into celestial space having really and indubitably touched bottom it was confirmed in 184243 with curious exactness by c a f peters at pulkowa but later researches showed that it required increase to nearly half a second73 struves measurements inspired less confidence they extended over three years 183538 but were comparatively few and were frequently interrupted the parallax accordingly of about a quarter of a second 02613 which he derived from them for alpha lyr and announced in 184074 has proved considerably too large75 meanwhile a result of the same kind but of a more striking character than either bessels or struves had been obtained one might almost say casually by a different method and in a distant region thomas henderson originally an attorneys clerk in his native town of dundee had become known for his astronomical attainments and was appointed in 1831 to direct the recently completed observatory at the cape of good hope he began observing in april 1832 and the serious shortcomings of his instrument notwithstanding executed during the thirteen months of his tenure of office a surprising amount of firstrate work with a view to correcting the declination of the lustrous double star alpha centauri which ranks after sirius and canopus as the third brightest orb in the heavens he effected a number of successive determinations of its position and on being informed of its very considerable proper motion 36 annually he resolved to examine the observations already made for possible traces of parallactic displacement this was done on his return to scotland where he filled the office of astronomer royal from 1834 until his premature death in 1844 the result justified his expectations from the declination measurements made at the cape and duly reduced a parallax of about one second of arc clearly emerged diminished by gills and elkins observations 18821883 to o75 but by perhaps an excess of caution was withheld from publication until fuller certainty was afforded by the concurrent testimony of lieutenant meadowss determinations of the same stars right ascension76 when at last january 9 1839 henderson communicated his discovery to the astronomical society he could no longer claim the priority which was his due bessel had anticipated him with the parallax of 61 cygni by just two months thus from three different quarters three successful and almost simultaneous assaults were delivered upon a longbeleaguered citadel of celestial secrets the same work has since been steadily pursued with the general result of showing that as regards their overwhelming majority the stars are far too remote to show even the slightest trace of optical shifting from the revolution of the earth in its orbit in nearly a hundred cases however small parallaxes have been determined some certainly that is within moderate limits of error others more or less precariously the list is an instructive one in its omissions no less than in its contents it includes stars of many degrees of brightness from sirius down to a nameless telescopic star in the great bear77 yet the vicinity to the earth of this minute object is so much greater than that of the brilliant vega that the latter transported to its place would increase in lustre thirtyeight times moreover many of the brightest stars are found to have no sensible parallax while the majority of those ascertained to be nearest to the earth are of fifth sixth even ninth magnitudes the obvious conclusions follow that the range of variety in the sidereal system is enormously greater than had been supposed and that estimates of distance based upon apparent magnitude must be wholly futile thus the splendid canopus betelgeux and rigel can be inferred from their indefinite remoteness to exceed our sun thousands of times in size and lustre while many inconspicuous objects which prove to be in our relative vicinity must be notably his inferiors the limits of real stellar magnitude are then set very widely apart at the same time the socalled optical and geometrical methods of relatively estimating stardistances are both seen to have a foundation of fact although so disguised by complicated relations as to be of very doubtful individual application on the whole the chances are in favour of the superior vicinity of a bright star over a faint one and on the whole the stars in swiftest apparent motion are amongst those whose actual remoteness is least indeed there is no escape from either conclusion unless on the supposition of special arrangements in themselves highly improbable and we may confidently say nonexistent the distances even of the few stars found to have measurable parallaxes are on a scale entirely beyond the powers of the human mind to conceive in the attempt both to realize them distinctly and to express them conveniently a new unit of length itself of bewildering magnitude has originated this is what we may call the lightjourney of one year the subtle vibrations of the ether propagated on all sides from the surface of luminous bodies travel at the rate of 186300 miles a second or in round numbers six billions of miles a year four and a third such measures are needed to span the abyss that separates us from the nearest fixed star in other words light takes four years and four months to reach the earth from alpha centauri yet alpha centauri lies some ten billions of miles nearer to us so far as is yet known than any other member of the sidereal system the determination of parallax leads in the case of stars revolving in known orbits to the determination of mass for the distance from the earth of the two bodies forming a binary system being ascertained the seconds of arc apparently separating them from each other can be translated into millions of miles and we only need to add a knowledge of their period to enable us by an easy sum in proportion to find their combined mass in terms of that of the sun thus sinceaccording to dr dobercks elementsthe components of alpha centauri revolve round their common centre of gravity at a mean distance nearly 25 times the radius of the earths orbit in a period of 88 years the attractive force of the two together must be just twice the solar we may gather some idea of their relations by placing in imagination a second luminary like our sun in circulation between the orbits of neptune and uranus but systems of still more majestic proportions are reduced by extreme remoteness to apparent insignificance a double star of the fourth magnitude in cassiopeia eta to which a small parallax is ascribed on the authority of o struve appears to be above eight times as massive as the central orb of our world while a much less conspicuous pair85 pegasiexerts if the available data can be depended upon no less than thirteen times the solar gravitating power further the actual rate of proper motions so far as regards that part of them which is projected upon the sphere can be ascertained for stars at known distance the annual journey for instance of 61 cygni across the line of sight amounts to 1000 and that of alpha centauri to 446 millions of miles a small star numbered 1830 in groombridges circumpolar catalogue devours the way at the rate of at least 150 miles a seconda speed in newcombs opinion beyond the gravitating power of the entire sidereal system to control and mu cassiopei possesses above twothirds of that surprising velocity while for both objects radial movements of just sixty miles a second were disclosed by professor campbells spectroscopic measurements herschels conclusion as to the advance of the sun among the stars was not admitted as valid by the most eminent of his successors bessel maintained that there was absolutely no preponderating evidence in favour of its supposed direction towards a point in the constellation hercules78 biot burckhardt even herschels own son shared his incredulity but the appearance of argelanders prizeessay in 183779 changed the aspect of the question herschels first memorable solution in 1783 was based upon the motions of thirteen stars imperfectly known his second in 1805 upon those of no more than six argelander now obtained an entirely concordant result from the large number of 390 determined with the scrupulous accuracy characteristic of bessels work and his own the reality of the fact thus persistently disclosed could no longer be doubted it was confirmed five years later by the younger struve and still more strikingly in 184780 by galloways investigations founded exclusively on the apparent displacements of southern stars in 1859 and 1863 sir george airy and mr dunkin 1821189881 employing all the resources of modern science and commanding the wealth of material furnished by 1167 proper motions carefully determined by mr main reached conclusions closely similar to that indicated nearly eighty years previously by the first great sidereal astronomer which mr plummers reinvestigation of the subject in 188382 served but slightly to modify yet astronomers were not satisfied dr auwers of berlin completed in 1866 a splendid piece of work for which he received in 1888 the gold medal of the royal astronomical society it consisted in reducing afresh with the aid of the most refined modern data bradleys original stars and comparing their places thus obtained for the year 1755 with those assigned to them from observations made at greenwich after the lapse of ninety years in the interval as was to be anticipated most of them were found to have travelled over some small span of the heavens and there resulted a stock of nearly three thousand highly authentic proper motions these ample materials were turned to account by m ludwig struve83 for a discussion of the suns motion of which the upshot was to shift its point of aim to the bordering region of the constellations hercules and lyra and the more easterly position of the solar apex was fully confirmed by the experiments with variously assorted lists of stars of lewis boss of albany84 and oscar stumpe of bonn85 fresh precautions of refinement were introduced into the treatment of the subject by ristenpart of karlsruhe86 by kapteyn of groningen87 by newcomb88 and porter89 in america who ably availed themselves of the copious materials accumulated before the close of the century their results although not more closely accordant than those of their predecessors combined to show that the journey of our system is directed towards a point within a circle about ten degrees in radius having the brilliant vega for its centre to determine its rate was a still more arduous problem it involved the assumption very much at discretion of an average parallax for the stars investigated and otto struves estimate of 154 million miles as the span yearly traversed was hence wholly unreliable fortunately however as will be seen further on a method of determining the suns velocity independently of any knowledge of stardistances has now become available as might have been expected speculation has not been idle regarding the purpose and goal of the strange voyage of discovery through space upon which our system is embarked but altogether fruitlessly the variety of the conjectures hazarded in the matter is in itself a measure of their futility long ago before the construction of the heavens had as yet been made the subject of methodical inquiry kant was disposed to regard sirius as the central sun of the milky way while lambert surmised that the vast orion nebula might serve as the regulating power of a subordinate group including our sun herschel threw out the hint that the great cluster in hercules might prove to be the supreme seat of attractive force90 argelander placed his central body in the constellation perseus91 fomalhaut the brilliant of the southern fish was set in the post of honour by boguslawski of breslau mdler who succeeded struve at dorpat in 1839 concluded from a more formal inquiry that the ruling power in the sidereal system resided not in any single prepondering mass but in the centre of gravity of the selfcontrolled revolving multitude92 in the former case as we know from the example of the planetary scheme the stellar motions would be most rapid near the centre in the latter they would become accelerated with remoteness from it93 mdler showed that no part of the heavens could be indicated as a region of exceptionally swift movements such as would result from the presence of a gigantic though possibly obscure ruling body but that a community of extremely sluggish movements undoubtedly existed in and near the group of the pleiades where accordingly he placed the centre of gravity of the milky way94 the bright star alcyone thus became the central sun but in a purely passive sense its headship being determined by its situation at the point of neutralisation of opposing tendencies and of consequent rest by an avowedly conjectural method the solar period of revolution round this point was fixed at 18200000 years the scheme of sidereal government framed by the dorpat astronomer was it may be observed of the most approved constitutional type deprivation rather than increase of influence accompanying the office of chief dignitary but while we are still ignorant and shall perhaps ever remain so of the fundamental plan upon which the galaxy is organised recent investigations tend more and more to exhibit it not as monarchical so to speak but as federative the community of proper motions detected by mdler in the vicinity of the pleiades may accordingly possess a significance altogether different from what he imagined bessels socalled foundation of an astronomy of the invisible now claims attention95 his prediction regarding the planet neptune does not belong to the present division of our subject a strictly analogous discovery in the sidereal system was however also very clearly foreshadowed by him his earliest suspicions of nonuniformity in the proper motion of sirius dated from 1834 they extended to procyon in 1840 and after a series of refined measurements with the new repsold circle he announced in 1844 his conclusion that these irregularities were due to the presence of obscure bodies round which the two bright dogstars revolved as they pursued their way across the sphere96 he even assigned to each an approximate period of half a century i adhere to the conviction he wrote later to humboldt that procyon and sirius form real binary systems consisting of a visible and an invisible star there is no reason to suppose luminosity an essential quality of cosmical bodies the visibility of countless stars is no argument against the invisibility of countless others97 an inference so contradictory to received ideas obtained little credit until peters found in 185198 that the apparent anomalies in the movements of sirius could be completely explained by an orbital revolution in a period of fifty years bessels prevision was destined to be still more triumphantly vindicated on the 31st of january 1862 while in the act of trying a new 18inch refractor mr alvan g clark one of the celebrated firm of american opticians actually discovered the hypothetical sirian companion in the precise position required by theory it has now been watched through nearly an entire revolution period 494 years and proves to be very slightly luminous in proportion to its mass its attractive power in fact is nearly half that of its primary while it emits only 110000th of its light sirius itself on the other hand possesses a far higher radiative intensity than our sun it gravitatesadmitting sir david gills parallax of 038 to be exactlike two suns but shines like twenty possibly it is much distended by heat and undoubtedly its atmosphere intercepts a very much smaller proportion of its light than in stars of the solar class as regards procyon visual verification was awaited until november 13 1896 when professor schaeberle with the great lick refractor detected the longsought object in the guise of a thirteenthmagnitude star dr sees calculations99 showed it to possess onefifth the mass of its primary or rather more than half that of our sun100 yet it gives barely 120000th of the suns light so that it is still nearer to total obscurity than the dusky satellite of sirius the period of forty years assigned to the system by auwers in 1862101 appears to be singularly exact but bessel was not destined to witness the recognition of the invisible as a legitimate and profitable field for astronomical research he died march 17 1846 just six months before the discovery of neptune of an obscure disease eventually found to be occasioned by an extensive fungusgrowth in the stomach the place which he left vacant was not one easy to fill his lifes work might be truly described as epochmaking rarely indeed shall we find one who reconciled with the same success the claims of theoretical and practical astronomy or surveyed the science which he had made his own with a glance equally comprehensive practical and profound the career of friedrich georg wilhelm struve illustrates the maxim that science differentiates as it develops he was while much besides a specialist in double stars his earliest recorded use of the telescope was to verify herschels conclusion as to the revolving movement of castor and he never varied from the predilection which this first observation at once indicated and determined he was born at altona of a respectable yeoman family april 15 1793 and in 1811 took a degree in philology at the new russian university of dorpat he then turned to science was appointed in 1813 to a professorship of astronomy and mathematics and began regular work in the dorpat observatory just erected by parrot for alexander i it was not however until 1819 that the acquisition of a 5foot refractor by troughton enabled him to take the positionangles of double stars with regularity and tolerable precision the resulting catalogue of 795 stellar systems gave the signal for a general resumption of the herschelian labours in this branch his success so far and the extraordinary facilities for observation afforded by the fraunhofer achromatic encouraged him to undertake february 11 1825 a review of the entire heavens down to 15 south of the celestial equator which occupied more than two years and yielded from an examination of above 120000 stars a harvest of about 2200 previously unnoticed composite objects the ensuing ten years were devoted to delicate and patient measurements the results of which were embodied in mensur micrometric published at st petersburg in 1837 this monumental work gives the places angles of position distances colours and relative brightness of 3112 double and multiple stars all determined with the utmost skill and care the record is one which gains in value with the process of time and will for ages serve as a standard of reference by which to detect change or confirm discovery it appears from struves researches that about one in forty of all stars down to the ninth magnitude is composite but that the proportion is doubled in the brighter orders102 this he attributed to the difficulty of detecting the faint companions of very remote orbs it was also noticed both by him and bessel that double stars are in general remarkable for large proper motions struves catalogue included no star of which the components were more than 32 apart because beyond that distance the chances of merely optical juxtaposition become considerable but the immense preponderance of extremely close over as it were loosely yoked bodies is such as to demonstrate their physical connection even if no other proof were forthcoming many stars previously believed to be single divided under the scrutiny of the dorpat refractor while in some cases one member of a supposed binary system revealed itself as double thus placing the surprised observer in the unexpected presence of a triple group of suns five instances were noted of two pairs lying so close together as to induce a conviction of their mutual dependence103 besides which 124 examples occurred of triple quadruple and multiple combinations the reality of which was open to no reasonable doubt104 it was first pointed out by bessel that the fact of stars exhibiting a common proper motion might serve as an unfailing test of their real association into systems this was accordingly one of the chief criteria employed by struve to distinguish true binaries from merely optical couples on this ground alone 61 cygni was admitted to be a genuine double star and it was shown that although its components appeared to follow almost strictly rectilinear paths yet the probability of their forming a connected pair is actually greater than that of the sun rising tomorrow morning105 moreover this tie of an identical movement was discovered to unite bodies106 far beyond the range of distance ordinarily separating the members of binary systems and to prevail so extensively as to lead to the conclusion that single do not outnumber conjoined stars more than twice or thrice107 in 1835 struve was summoned by the emperor nicholas to superintend the erection of a new observatory at pulkowa near st petersburg destined for the special cultivation of sidereal astronomy boundless resources were placed at his disposal and the institution created by him was acknowledged to surpass all others of its kind in splendour efficiency and completeness its chief instrumental glory was a refractor of fifteen inches aperture by merz and mahler fraunhofers successors which left the famous dorpat telescope far behind and remained long without a rival on the completion of this model establishment august 19 1839 struve was installed as its director and continued to fulfil the important duties of the post with his accustomed vigour until 1858 when illness compelled his virtual resignation in favour of his son otto struve born at dorpat in 1819 he died november 23 1864 an inquiry into the laws of stellar distribution undertaken during the early years of his residence at pulkowa led struve to confirm in the main the inferences arrived at by herschel as to the construction of the heavens according to his view the appearance known as the milky way is produced by a collection of irregularly condensed starclusters within which the sun is somewhat eccentrically placed the nebulous ring which thus integrates the light of countless worlds was supposed by him to be made up of stars scattered over a bent or broken plane or to lie in two planes slightly inclined to each other our system occupying a position near their intersection108 he further attempted to show that the limits of this vast assemblage must remain for ever shrouded from human discernment owing to the gradual extinction of light in its passage through space109 and sought to confer upon this celebrated hypothesis a definiteness and certainty far beyond the aspirations of its earlier advocates chseaux and olbers but arbitrary assumptions vitiated his reasonings on this as well as on some other points110 in his special line as a celestial explorer of the most comprehensive type sir william herschel had but one legitimate successor and that successor was his son john frederick william herschel was born at slough march 17 1792 graduated with the highest honours from st johns college cambridge in 1813 and entered upon legal studies with a view to being called to the bar but his share in an early compact with peacock and babbage to do their best to leave the world wiser than they found it was not thus to be fulfilled the acquaintance of dr wollaston decided his scientific vocation already in 1816 we find him reviewing some of his fathers double stars and he completed in 1820 the 18inch speculum which was to be the chief instrument of his investigations soon afterwards he undertook in conjunction with mr later sir james south a series of observations issuing in the presentation to the royal society of a paper111 containing micrometrical measurements of 380 binary stars by which the elder herschels inferences of orbital motion were in many cases strikingly confirmed a star in the northern crown for instance eta coron had completed more than one entire circuit since its first discovery another tau ophiuchi had closed up into apparent singleness while the motion of a third xi urs majoris in an obviously eccentric orbit was so rapid as to admit of being traced and measured from month to month it was from the first confidently believed that the force retaining double stars in curvilinear paths was identical with that governing the planetary revolutions but that identity was not ascertained until savary of paris showed in 1827112 that the movements of the abovenamed binary in the great bear could be represented with all attainable accuracy by an ellipse calculated on orthodox gravitational principles with a period of 5814 years encke followed at berlin with a still more elegant method and sir john herschel pointing out the uselessness of analytical refinements where the data were necessarily so imperfect described in 1832 a graphical process by which the aid of the eye and hand was brought in to guide the judgment in a case where judgment only and not calculation could be of any avail113 improved methods of the same kind were published by dr see in 1893114 and by mr burnham in 1894115 and our acquaintance with stellar orbits is steadily gaining precision certainty and extent in 1825 herschel undertook and executed with great assiduity during the ensuing eight years a general survey of the northern heavens directed chiefly towards the verification of his fathers nebular discoveries the outcome was a catalogue of 2306 nebul and clusters of which 525 were observed for the first time besides 3347 double stars discovered almost incidentally116 strongly invited as he tells us himself by the peculiar interest of the subject and the wonderful nature of the objects which presented themselves he resolved to attempt the completion of the survey in the southern hemisphere with this noble object in view he embarked his family and instruments on board the mount stewart elphinstone and after a prosperous voyage landed at cape town on the 16th of january 1834 choosing as the scene of his observations a rural spot under the shelter of table mountain he began regular sweeping on the 5th of march the site of his great reflector is now marked with an obelisk and the name of feldhausen has become memorable in the history of science for the four years work done there may truly be said to open the chapter of our knowledge as regards the southern skies the full results of herschels journey to the cape were not made public until 1847 when a splendid volume117 embodying them was brought out at the expense of the duke of northumberland they form a sequel to his fathers labours such as the investigations of one man have rarely received from those of another what the elder observer did for the northern heavens the younger did for the southern and with generally concordant results reviving the paternal method of stargauging he showed from a count of 2299 fields that the milky way surrounds the solar system as a complete annulus of minute stars not however quite symmetrically since the sun was thought to lie somewhat nearer to those portions visible in the southern hemisphere which display a brighter lustre and a more complicated structure than the northern branches the singular cosmical agglomerations known as the magellanic clouds were now for the first time submitted to a detailed though admittedly incomplete examination the almost inconceivable richness and variety of their contents being such that a lifetime might with great profit be devoted to their study in the greater nubecula within a compass of fortytwo square degrees herschel reckoned 278 distinct nebul and clusters besides fifty or sixty outliers and a large number of stars intermixed with diffused nebulosityin all 919 catalogued objects and for the lesser cloud 244 yet this was only the most conspicuous part of what his twentyfoot revealed such an extraordinary concentration of bodies so various led him to the inevitable conclusion that the nubecul are to be regarded as systems sui generis and which have no analogues in our hemisphere118 he noted also the blankness of surrounding space especially in the case of nubecula minor the access to which on all sides he remarked is through a desert as if the cosmical material in the neighbourhood had been swept up and garnered in these mighty groups119 of southern double stars he discovered and gave careful measurements of 2102 and described 1708 nebul of which at least 300 were new the list was illustrated with a number of drawings some of them extremely beautiful and elaborate sir john herschels views as to the nature of nebul were considerably modified by lord rosses success in resolving with his great reflectors a crowd of these objects into stars his former somewhat hesitating belief in the existence of phosphorescent matter disseminated through extensive regions of space in the manner of a cloud or fog120 was changed into a conviction that no valid distinction could be established between the faintest wisp of cosmical vapour just discernible in a powerful telescope and the most brilliant and obvious cluster he admitted however an immense range of possible variety in the size and mode of aggregation of the stellar constituents of various nebul some might appear nebulous from the closeness of their parts some from their smallness others he suggested might be formed of discrete luminous bodies floating in a nonluminous medium121 while the annular kind probably consisted of hollow shells of stars122 that a physical and not merely an optical connection unites nebul with the embroidery so to speak of small stars with which they are in many instances profusely decorated was evident to him as it must be to all who look as closely and see as clearly as he did his description of no 2093 in his northern catalogue as a network or tracery of nebula following the lines of a similar network of stars123 would alone suffice to dispel the idea of accidental scattering and many other examples of a like import might be quoted the remarkably frequent occurrence of one or more minute stars in the close vicinity of planetary nebul led him to infer their dependent condition and he advised the maintenance of a strict watch for evidences of circulatory movements not only over these supposed stellar satellites but also over the numerous double nebul in which as he pointed out all the varieties of double stars as to distance position and relative brightness have their counterparts he moreover investigated the subject of nebular distribution by the simple and effectual method of graphic delineation or charting and succeeded in showing that while a much greater uniformity of scattering prevails in the southern than in the northern heavens a condensation is nevertheless perceptible about the constellations pisces and cetus roughly corresponding to the nebular region in virgo by its vicinity within 20 or 30 to the opposite pole of the milky way he concluded that the nebulous system is distinct from the sidereal though involving and perhaps to a certain extent intermixed with the latter124 towards the close of his residence at feldhausen herschel was fortunate enough to witness one of those singular changes in the aspect of the firmament which occasionally challenge the attention even of the incurious and excite the deepest wonder of the philosophical observer immersed apparently in the argo nebula is a star denominated eta carin when halley visited st helena in 1677 it seemed of the fourth magnitude but lacaille in the middle of the following century and others after him classed it as of the second in 1827 the traveller burchell being then at st paul near rio janeiro remarked that it had unexpectedly assumed the first ranka circumstance the more surprising to him because he had frequently when in africa during the years 1811 to 1815 noted it as of only fourth magnitude this observation however did not become generally known until later herschel on his arrival at feldhausen registered the star as a bright second and had no suspicion of its unusual character until december 16 1837 when he suddenly perceived its light to be almost tripled it then far outshone rigel in orion and on the 2nd of january following it very nearly matched alpha centauri from that date it declined but a second and even brighter maximum occurred in april 1843 when maclear then director of the cape observatory saw it blaze out with a splendour approaching that of sirius its waxings and wanings were marked by curious trepidations of brightness extremely perplexing to theory in 1863 it had sunk below the fifth magnitude and in 1869 was barely visible to the naked eye yet it was not until eighteen years later that it touched a minimum of 76 magnitude soon afterwards a recovery of brightness set in but was not carried very far and the star now shines steadily as of the seventh magnitude its reddish light contrasting effectively with the silvery rays of the surrounding nebula an attempt to include its fluctuations within a cycle of seventy years125 has signally failed the extent and character of the vicissitudes to which it is subject stamping it rather as a species of connecting link between periodic and temporary stars126 among the numerous topics which engaged herschels attention at the cape was that of relative stellar brightness having contrived an astrometer in which an artificial star formed by the total reflection of moonlight from the base of a prism served as a standard of comparison he was able to estimate the lustre of the natural stars examined by the distances at which the artificial object appeared equal respectively to each he thus constructed a table of 191 of the principal stars127 both in the northern and southern hemispheres setting forth the numerical values of their apparent brightness relatively to that of alpha centauri which he selected as a unit of measurement further the light of the full moon being found by him to exceed that of his standard star 27408 times and dr wollaston having shown that the light of the full moon is to that of the sun as 1801072128 zllner made the ratio 1618000 it became possible to compare stellar with solar radiance hence was derived in the case of the few stars at ascertained distances a knowledge of real lustre alpha centauri for example emits less than twice capella one hundred times as much light as our sun while arcturus at its enormous distance must display the splendour of 1300 such luminaries herschel returned to england in the spring of 1838 bringing with him a wealth of observation and discovery such as had perhaps never before been amassed in so short a time deserved honours awaited him he was created a baronet on the occasion of the queens coronation he had been knighted in 1831 universities and learned societies vied with each other in showering distinctions upon him and the success of an enterprise in which scientific zeal was tinctured with an attractive flavour of adventurous romance was justly regarded as a matter of national pride his career as an observing astronomer was now virtually closed and he devoted his leisure to the collection and arrangement of the abundant trophies of his fathers and his own activity the resulting great catalogue of 5079 nebul including all then certainly known published in the philosophical transactions for 1864 is and will probably long remain the fundamental source of information on the subject129 but he unfortunately did not live to finish the companion work on double stars for which he had accumulated a vast store of materials130 he died at collingwood in kent may 11 1871 in the eightieth year of his age and was buried in westminster abbey close beside the grave of sir isaac newton the consideration of sir john herschels cape observations brings us to the close of the period we are just now engaged in studying they were given to the world as already stated three years before the middle of the century and accurately represent the condition of sidereal science at that date looking back over the fifty years traversed we can see at a glance how great was the stride made in the interval not alone was acquaintance with individual members of the cosmos vastly extended but their mutual relations the laws governing their movements their distances from the earth masses and intrinsic lustre had begun to be successfully investigated begun to be for only regarding a scarcely perceptible minority had even approximate conclusions been arrived at nevertheless the whole progress of the future lay in that beginning it was the thin end of the wedge of exact knowledge the principle of measurement had been substituted for that of probability a basis had been found large and strong enough to enable calculation to ascend from it to the sidereal heavens and refinements had been introduced fruitful in performance but still more in promise thus rather the kind than the amount of information collected was significant for the time to comerather the methods employed than the results actually secured rendered the first half of the nineteenth century of epochal importance in the history of our knowledge of the stars footnotes footnote 58 bessel populre vorlesungen pp 6 408

chapter iii progress of knowledge regarding the sun the discovery of sunspots in 1610 by fabricius and galileo first opened a way for inquiry into the solar constitution but it was long before that way was followed with system or profit the seeming irregularity of the phenomena discouraged continuous attention casual observations were made the basis of arbitrary conjectures and real knowledge received little or no increase in 1620 we find jean tarde canon of sarlat arguing that because the sun is the eye of the world and the eye of the world cannot suffer from ophthalmia therefore the appearances in question must be due not to actual specks or stains on the bright solar disc but to the transits of a number of small planets across it to this new group of heavenly bodies he gave the name of borbonia sidera and they were claimed in 1633 for the house of hapsburg under the title of austriaca sidera by father malapertius a belgian jesuit131 a similar view was temporarily maintained against galileo by the justly celebrated father scheiner of ingolstadt and later by william gascoigne the inventor of the micrometer but most of those who were capable of thinking at all on such subjects and they were but few adhered either to the cloud theory or to the slag theory of sunspots the first was championed by galileo the second by simon marius astronomer and physician to the brother margraves of brandenburg the latter opinion received a further notable development from the fact that in 1618 a year remarkable for the appearance of three bright comets the sun was almost free from spots whence it was inferred that the cindery refuse from the great solar conflagration which usually appeared as dark blotches on its surface was occasionally thrown off in the form of comets leaving the sun like a snuffed taper to blaze with renewed brilliancy132 in the following century derham gathered from observations carried on during the years 170311 that the spots on the sun are caused by the eruption of some new volcano therein which at first pouring out a prodigious quantity of smoke and other opacous matter causeth the spots and as that fuliginous matter decayeth and spendeth itself and the volcano at last becomes more torrid and flaming so the spots decay and grow to umbr and at last to facul133 the view confidently upheld by lalande134 that spots were rocky elevations uncovered by the casual ebbing of a luminous ocean the surrounding penumbr representing shoals or sandbanks had even less to recommend it than derhams volcanic theory both were however significant of a growing tendency to bring solar phenomena within the compass of terrestrial analogies for 164 years then after galileo first levelled his telescope at the setting sun next to nothing was learned as to its nature and the facts immediately ascertained of its rotation on an axis nearly erect to the plane of the ecliptic in a period of between twentyfive and twentysix days and of the virtual limitation of the spots to a socalled royal zone extending some thirty degrees north and south of the solar equator gained little either in precision or development from five generations of astronomers but in november 1769 a spot of extraordinary size engaged the attention of alexander wilson professor of astronomy in the university of glasgow he watched it day by day and to good purpose as the great globe slowly revolved carrying the spot towards its western edge he was struck with the gradual contraction and final disappearance of the penumbra on the side next the centre of the disc and when on the 6th of december the same spot reemerged on the eastern limb he perceived as he had anticipated that the shady zone was now deficient on the opposite side and resumed its original completeness as it returned to a central position in other spots subsequently examined by him similar perspective effects were visible and he proved in 1774135 by strict geometrical reasoning that they could only arise in vast photospheric excavations it was not indeed the first time that such a view had been suggested father scheiners later observations plainly foreshadowed it136 a conjecture to the same effect was emitted by leonard rost of nuremburg early in the eighteenth century137 both by lahire in 1703 and by j cassini in 1719 spots had been seen as notches on the solar limb while in 1770 pastor schlen of essingen from the careful study of phenomena similar to those noted by wilson concluded their depressed nature138 modern observations nevertheless prove those phenomena to be by no means universally present wilsons general theory of the sun was avowedly tentative it took the modest form of an interrogatory is it not reasonable to think he asks that the great and stupendous body of the sun is made up of two kinds of matter very different in their qualities that by far the greater part is solid and dark and that this immense and dark globe is encompassed with a thin covering of that resplendent substance from which the sun would seem to derive the whole of his vivifying heat and energy139 he further suggests that the excavations or spots may be occasioned by the working of some sort of elastic vapour which is generated within the dark globe and that the luminous matter being in some degree fluid and being acted upon by gravity tends to flow down and cover the nucleus from these hints supplemented by his own diligent observations and sagacious reasonings herschel elaborated a scheme of solar constitution which held its ground until the physics of the sun were revolutionised by the spectroscope a cool dark solid globe its surface diversified with mountains and valleys clothed in luxuriant vegetation and richly stored with inhabitants protected by a heavy cloudcanopy from the intolerable glare of the upper luminous region where the dazzling coruscations of a solar aurora some thousands of miles in depth evolved the stores of light and heat which vivify our worldsuch was the central luminary which herschel constructed with his wonted ingenuity and described with his wonted eloquence this way of considering the sun and its atmosphere he says140 removes the great dissimilarity we have hitherto been used to find between its condition and that of the rest of the great bodies of the solar system the sun viewed in this light appears to be nothing else than a very eminent large and lucid planet evidently the first or in strictness of speaking the only primary one of our system all others being truly secondary to it its similarity to the other globes of the solar system with regard to its solidity its atmosphere and its diversified surface the rotation upon its axis and the fall of heavy bodies leads us on to suppose that it is most probably also inhabited like the rest of the planets by beings whose organs are adapted to the peculiar circumstances of that vast globe we smile at conclusions which our present knowledge condemns as extravagant and impossible but such incidental flights of fancy in no way derogate from the high value of herschels contributions to solar science the cloudlike character which he attributed to the radiant shell of the sun first named by schrter the photosphere is borne out by all recent investigations he observed its mottled or corrugated aspect resembling as he described it the roughness on the rind of an orange showed that facul are elevations or heapedup ridges of the disturbed photospheric matter and threw out the idea that spots may ensue from an excess of the ordinary luminous emissions a certain empyreal gas was he supposed very much as wilson had done generated in the body of the sun and rising everywhere by reason of its lightness made for itself when in moderate quantities small openings or pores141 abundantly visible as dark points on the solar disc but should an uncommon quantity be formed it will he maintained burst through the planetary142 regions of clouds and thus will produce great openings then spreading itself above them it will occasion large shallows penumbr and mixing afterwards gradually with other superior gases it will promote the increase and assist in the maintenance of the general luminous phenomena143 this partial anticipation of the modern view that the solar radiations are maintained by some process of circulation within the solar mass was reached by herschel through prolonged study of the phenomena in question the novel and important idea contained in it however it was at that time premature to attempt to develop but though many of the subtler suggestions of herschels genius passed unnoticed by his contemporaries the main result of his solar researches was an unmistakable one it was nothing less than the definitive introduction into astronomy of the paradoxical conception of the central fire and hearth of our system as a cold dark terrestrial mass wrapt in a mantle of innocuous radiancean earth so to speak withina sun without let us pause for a moment to consider the value of this remarkable innovation it certainly was not a step in the direction of truth on the contrary the crude notions of anaxagoras and xeno approached more nearly to what we now know of the sun than the complicated structure devised for the happiness of a nobler race of beings than our own by the benevolence of eighteenthcentury astronomers and yet it undoubtedly constituted a very important advance in science it was the first earnest attempt to bring solar phenomena within the compass of a rational system to put together into a consistent whole the facts ascertained to fabricate in short a solar machine that would in some fashion work it is true that the materials were inadequate and the design faulty the resulting construction has not proved strong enough to stand the wear and tear of time and discovery but has had to be taken to pieces and remodelled on a totally different plan but the work was not therefore done in vain none of bacons aphorisms show a clearer insight into the relations between the human mind and the external world than that which declares truth to emerge sooner from error than from confusion144 a definite theory even if a false one gives holdingground to thought facts acquire a meaning with reference to it it affords a motive for accumulating them and a means of coordinating them it provides a framework for their arrangement and a receptacle for their preservation until they become too strong and numerous to be any longer included within arbitrary limits and shatter the vessel originally framed to contain them such was the purpose subserved by herschels theory of the sun it helped to clarify ideas on the subject the turbid sense of groping and viewless ignorance gave place to the lucidity of a possible scheme the persuasion of knowledge is a keen incentive to its increase few men care to investigate what they are obliged to admit themselves entirely ignorant of but once started on the road of knowledge real or supposed they are eager to pursue it by the promulgation of a confident and consistent view regarding the nature of the sun accordingly research was encouraged because it was rendered hopeful and inquirers were shown a path leading indefinitely onwards where an impassable thicket had before seemed to bar the way we have called the terrestrial theory of the suns nature an innovation and so as far as its general acceptance is concerned it may justly be termed but like all successful innovations it was a long time brewing it is extremely curious to find that herschel had a predecessor in its advocacy who never looked through a telescope nor indeed imagined the possibility of such an instrument who knew nothing of sunspots was still mistaken assertions to the contrary notwithstanding in the bondage of the geocentric system and regarded nature from the lofty standpoint of an idealist philosophy this was the learned and enlightened cardinal cusa a fishermans son from the banks of the moselle whose distinguished career in the church and in literature extended over a considerable part of the fifteenth century 140164 in his singular treatise de doct ignoranti one of the most notable literary monuments of the early renaissance the following passage occursto a spectator on the surface of the sun the splendour which appears to us would be invisible since it contains as it were an earth for its central mass with a circumferential envelope of light and heat and between the two an atmosphere of water and clouds and translucent air the luminary of herschels fancy could scarcely be more clearly portrayed some added words however betray the origin of the cardinals idea the earth also he says would appear as a shining star to any one outside the fiery element it was in fact an extension to the sun of the ancient elemental doctrine but an extension remarkable at that period as premonitory of the tendency so powerfully developed by subsequent discoveries to assimilate the orbs of heaven to the model of our insignificant planet and to extend the brotherhood of our system and our species to the farthest limit of the visible or imaginable universe in later times we find flamsteed communicating to newton march 7 1681 his opinion that the substance of the sun is terrestrial matter his light but the liquid menstruum encompassing him145 bode in 1776 arrived independently at the conclusion that the sun is neither burning nor glowing but in its essence a dark planetary body composed like our earth of land and water varied by mountains and valleys and enveloped in a vaporous atmosphere146 and the learned in general applauded and acquiesced the view however was in 1787 still so far from popular that the holding of it was alleged as a proof of insanity in dr elliot when accused of a murderous assault on miss boydell his friend dr simmons stated on his behalf that he had received from him in the preceding january a letter giving evidence of a deranged mind wherein he asserted that the sun is not a body of fire as hath been hitherto supposed but that its light proceeds from a dense and universal aurora which may afford ample light to the inhabitants of the surface beneath and yet be at such a distance aloft as not to annoy them no objection he saith ariseth to that great luminarys being inhabited vegetation may obtain there as well as with us there may be water and dry land hills and dales rain and fair weather and as the light so the season must be eternal consequently it may easily be conceived to be by far the most blissful habitation of the whole system the recorder nevertheless objected that if an extravagant hypothesis were to be adduced as proof of insanity the same might hold good with regard to some other speculators and desired dr simmons to tell the court what he thought of the theories of burnet and buffon147 eight years later this same extravagant hypothesis backed by the powerful recommendation of sir william herschel obtained admittance to the venerable halls of science there to abide undisturbed for nearly seven decades individual objectors it is true made themselves heard but their arguments had little effect on the general body of opinion ruder blows were required to shatter an hypothesis flattering to human pride of invention in its completeness in the plausible detail of observations by which it seemed to be supported and in its condescension to the natural pleasure in discovering resemblance under all but total dissimilarity sir john herschel included among the results of his multifarious labours at the cape of good hope a careful study of the sunspots conspicuously visible towards the end of the year 1836 and in the early part of 1837 they were remarkable he tells us for their forms and arrangement as well as for their number and size one group measured on the 29th of march in the latter year covering apart from what may be called its outlying dependencies the vast area of five square minutes or 3780 million square miles148 we have at present to consider however not so much these observations in themselves as the chain of theoretical suggestions by which they were connected the distribution of spots it was pointed out on two zones parallel to the equator showed plainly their intimate connection with the solar rotation and indicated as their cause fluid circulations analogous to those producing the terrestrial trade and antitrade winds the spots in this view of the subject he went on to say149 would come to be assimilated to those regions on the earths surface where for the moment hurricanes and tornadoes prevail the upper stratum being temporarily carried downwards displacing by its impetus the two strata of luminous matter beneath the upper of course to a greater extent than the lower and thus wholly or partially denuding the opaque surface of the sun below such processes cannot be unaccompanied by vorticose motions which left to themselves die away by degrees and dissipate with the peculiarity that their lower portions come to rest more speedily than their upper by reason of the greater resistance below as well as the remoteness from the point of action which lies in a higher region so that their centres as seen in our waterspouts which are nothing but small tornadoes appear to retreat upwards now this agrees perfectly with what is observed during the obliteration of the solar spots which appear as if filled in by the collapse of their sides the penumbra closing in upon the spot and disappearing after it but when it comes to be asked whether a cause can be found by which a diversity of solar temperature might be produced corresponding with that which sets the currents of the terrestrial atmosphere in motion we are forced to reply that we know of no such cause for sir john herschels hypothesis of an increased retention of heat at the suns equator due to the slightly spheroidal or bulging form of its outer atmospheric envelope assuredly gives no sufficient account of such circulatory movements as he supposed to exist nevertheless the view that the suns rotation is intimately connected with the formation of spots is so obviously correct that we can only wonder it was not thought of sooner while we are even now unable to explain with any certainty how it is so connected mere scrutiny of the solar surface however is not the only means of solar observation we have a satellite and that satellite from time to time acts most opportunely as a screen cutting off a part or the whole of those dazzling rays in which the masterorb of our system veils himself from overcurious regards the importance of eclipses to the study of the solar surroundings is of comparatively recent recognition nevertheless much of what we know concerning them has been snatched as it were by surprise under favour of the moon in former times the sole astronomical use of such incidents was the correction of the received theories of the solar and lunar movements the precise time of their occurrence was the main fact to be noted and subsidiary phenomena received but casual attention now their significance as a geometrical test of tabular accuracy is altogether overshadowed by the interest attaching to the physical observations for which they afford propitious occasions this change may be said to date in its pronounced form from the great eclipse of 1842 although a necessary consequence of the general direction taken by scientific progress it remains associated in a special manner with the name of francis baily the philosopher of newbury was by profession a london stockbroker and a highly successful one nevertheless his services to science were numerous and invaluable though not of the brilliant kind which attract popular notice born at newbury in berkshire april 28 1774 and placed in the city at the age of fourteen he derived from the acquaintance of dr priestley a love of science which never afterwards left him it was however no passion such as flames up in the brain of the destined discoverer but a regulated inclination kept well within the bounds of an actively pursued commercial career after travelling for a year or two in what were then the wilds of north america he went on the stock exchange in 1799 and earned during twentyfour years of assiduous application to affairs a high reputation for integrity and ability to which corresponded an ample fortune in the meantime the astronomical society largely through his cooperation had been founded he had for three years acted as its secretary and he now felt entitled to devote himself exclusively to a subject which had long occupied his leisure hours he accordingly in 1825 retired from business purchased a house in tavistock place and fitted up there a small observatory he was however by preference a computator rather than an observer what sir john herschel calls the archology of practical astronomy found in him an especially zealous student he reedited the starcatalogues of ptolemy ulugh beigh tycho brahe hevelius halley flamsteed lacaille and mayer calculated the eclipse of thales and the eclipse of agathocles and vindicated the memory of the first astronomer royal but he was no less active in meeting present needs than in revising past performances the subject of the reduction of observations then as we have already explained150 in a state of deplorable confusion attracted his most earnest attention and he was close on the track of bessel when made acquainted with the method of simplification devised at knigsberg anticipated as an inventor he could still be of eminent use as a promoter of these valuable improvements and carrying them out on a large scale in the starcatalogue of the astronomical society published in 1827 he put in the words of herschel the astronomical world in possession of a power which may be said without exaggeration to have changed the face of sidereal astronomy151 his reputation was still further enhanced by his renewal with vastly improved apparatus of the method first used by henry cavendish in 179798 for determining the density of the earth from a series of no less than 2153 delicate and difficult experiments conducted at tavistock place during the years 183842 he concluded our planet to weigh 566 as much as a globe of water of the same bulk and this result slightly corrected is still accepted as a very close approximation of the truth what we have thus glanced at is but a fragment of the truly surprising mass of work accomplished by baily in the course of a variously occupied life a rare combination of qualities fitted him for his task unvarying health undisturbed equanimity methodical habits the power of directed and sustained thought combined to form in him an intellectual toiler of the surest though not perhaps of the highest quality he was in harness almost to the end he was destined scarcely to know the miseries of enforced idleness or of consciously failing powers in 1842 he completed the laborious reduction of lalandes great catalogue undertaken at the request of the british association and was still engaged in seeing it through the press when he was attacked with what proved his last as it was probably his first serious illness he however recovered sufficiently to attend the oxford commemoration of july 2 1844 where an honorary degree of dcl was conferred upon him in company with airy and struve but sank rapidly after the effort and died on the 30th of august following at the age of seventy lamented and esteemed by all who knew him it is now time to consider his share in the promotion of solar research eclipses of the sun both ancient and modern were a speciality with him and he was fortunate in those which came under his observation such phenomena are of three kindspartial annular and total in a partial eclipse the moon instead of passing directly between us and the sun slips by as it were a little on one side thus cutting off from our sight only a portion of his surface an annular eclipse on the other hand takes place when the moon is indeed centrally interposed but falls short of the apparent size required for the entire concealment of the solar disc which consequently remains visible as a bright ring or annulus even when the obscuration is at its height in a total eclipse on the contrary the sun completely disappears behind the dark body of the moon the difference of the two latter varieties is due to the fact that the apparent diameter of the sun and moon are so nearly equal as to gain alternate preponderance one over the other through the slight periodical changes in their respective distances from the earth now on the 15th of may 1836 an annular eclipse was visible in the northern parts of great britain and was observed by baily at inch bonney near jedburgh it was here that he saw the phenomenon which obtained the name of bailys beads from the notoriety conferred upon it by his vivid description when the cusps of the sun he writes were about 40 asunder a row of lucid points like a string of bright beads irregular in size and distance from each other suddenly formed round that part of the circumference of the moon that was about to enter on the suns disc its formation indeed was so rapid that it presented the appearance of having been caused by the ignition of a fine train of gunpowder finally as the moon pursued her course the dark intervening spaces which at their origin had the appearance of lunar mountains in high relief and which still continued attached to the suns border were stretched out into long black thick parallel lines joining the limbs of the sun and moon when all at once they suddenly gave way and left the circumference of the sun and moon in those points as in the rest comparatively smooth and circular and the moon perceptibly advanced on the face of the sun152 these curious appearances were not an absolute novelty weber in 1791 and von zach in 1820 had seen the beads van swinden had described the belts or threads153 these last were moreover as baily clearly perceived completely analogous to the black ligament which formed so troublesome a feature in the transits of venus in 1764 and 1769 and which to the regret and confusion though no longer to the surprise of observers was renewed in that of 1874 the phenomenon is largely an effect of what is called irradiation by which a bright object seems to encroach upon a dark one but under good atmospheric and instrumental conditions it becomes inconspicuous the beads must always appear when the projected lunar edge is serrated with mountains in bailys observation they were exaggerated and distorted by an irradiative clinging together of the limbs of sun and moon the immediate result however was powerfully to stimulate attention to solar eclipses in their physical aspect never before had an occurrence of the kind been expected so eagerly or prepared for so actively as that which was total over central and southern europe on the 8th of july 1842 astronomers hastened from all quarters to the favoured region the astronomer royal airy repaired to turin baily to pavia otto struve threw aside his work amidst the stars at pulkowa and went south as far as lipeszk schumacher travelled from altona to vienna arago from paris to perpignan nor did their trouble go unrewarded the expectations of the most sanguine were outdone by the wonders disclosed baily to whose narrative we again have recourse had set up his dollonds achromatic in an upper room of the university of pavia and was eagerly engaged in noting a partial repetition of the singular appearances seen by him in 1836 when he was astounded by a tremendous burst of applause from the streets below and at the same moment was electrified at the sight of one of the most brilliant and splendid phenomena that can well be imagined for at that instant the dark body of the moon was suddenly surrounded with a corona or kind of bright glory similar in shape and relative magnitude to that which painters draw round the heads of saints and which by the french is designated an aurole pavia contains many thousand inhabitants the major part of whom were at this early hour walking about the streets and squares or looking out of windows in order to witness this longtalkedof phenomenon and when the total obscuration took place which was instantaneous there was a universal shout from every observer which made the welkin ring and for the moment withdrew my attention from the object with which i was immediately occupied i had indeed anticipated the appearance of a luminous circle round the moon during the time of total obscurity but i did not expect from any of the accounts of preceding eclipses that i had read to witness so magnificent an exhibition as that which took place the breadth of the corona measured from the circumference of the moon appeared to me to be nearly equal to half the moons diameter it had the appearance of brilliant rays the light was most dense close to the border of the moon and became gradually and uniformly more attenuate as its distance therefrom increased assuming the form of diverging rays in a rectilinear line which at the extremity were more divided and of an unequal length so that in no part of the corona could i discover the regular and welldefined shape of a ring at its outer margin it appeared to me to have the sun for its centre but i had no means of taking any accurate measures for determining this point its colour was quite white not pearlcolour nor yellow nor red and the rays had a vivid and flickering appearance somewhat like that which a gaslight illumination might be supposed to assume if formed into a similar shape splendid and astonishing however as this remarkable phenomenon really was and although it could not fail to call forth the admiration and applause of every beholder yet i must confess that there was at the same time something in its singular and wonderful appearance that was appalling and i can readily imagine that uncivilised nations may occasionally have become alarmed and terrified at such an object more especially at times when the true cause of the occurrence may have been but faintly understood and the phenomenon itself wholly unexpected but the most remarkable circumstance attending the phenomenon was the appearance of three large protuberances apparently emanating from the circumference of the moon but evidently forming a portion of the corona they had the appearance of mountains of a prodigious elevation their colour was red tinged with lilac or purple perhaps the colour of the peachblossom would more nearly represent it they somewhat resembled the snowy tops of the alpine mountains when coloured by the rising or setting sun they resembled the alpine mountains also in another respect inasmuch as their light was perfectly steady and had none of that flickering or sparkling motion so visible in other parts of the corona all the three projections were of the same roseate cast of colour and very different from the brilliant vivid white light that formed the corona but they differed from each other in magnitude the whole of these three protuberances were visible even to the last moment of total obscuration at least i never lost sight of them when looking in that direction and when the first ray of light was admitted from the sun they vanished with the corona altogether and daylight was instantaneously restored154 notwithstanding unfavourable weather the red flames were perceived with little less clearness and no less amazement from the superga than at pavia and were even discerned by mr airy with the naked eye their form the astronomer royal wrote was nearly that of sawteeth in the position proper for a circular saw turned round in the same direction in which the hands of a watch turn their colour was a full lakered and their brilliancy greater than that of any other part of the ring155 the height of these extraordinary objects was estimated by arago at two minutes of arc representing at the suns distance an actual elevation of 54000 miles when carefully watched the roseflush of their illumination was perceived to fade through violet to white as the light returned the same changes in a reversed order having accompanied their first appearance their forms however during about three minutes of visibility showed no change although of so apparently unstable a character as to suggest to arago mountains on the point of crumbling into ruins through topheaviness156 the corona both as to figure and extent presented very different appearances at different stations this was no doubt due to varieties in atmospheric conditions at the superga for instance all details of structure seem to have been effaced by the murky air only a comparatively feeble ring of light being seen to encircle the moon elsewhere a brilliant radiated formation was conspicuous spreading at four opposite points into four vast luminous expansions compared to featherplumes or aigrettes157 arago at perpignan noticed considerable irregularities in the divergent rays some appeared curved and twisted a few lay across the others in a direction almost tangential to the moons limb the general effect being described as that of a hank of thread in disorder158 at lipeszk where the sun stood much higher above the horizon than in italy or france the corona showed with surprising splendour its apparent extent was judged by struve to be no less than twentyfive minutes more than six times airys estimate while the great plumes spread their radiance to three or four degrees from the dark lunar edge so dazzling was the light that many wellinstructed persons denied the totality of the eclipse nor was the error without precedent although the appearances attending respectively a total and an annular eclipse are in reality wholly dissimilar in the latter case the surviving ring of sunlight becomes so much enlarged by irradiation that the interposed dark lunar body is reduced to comparative insignificance or even invisibility maclaurin tells us159 that during an eclipse of this character which he observed at edinburgh in 1737 gentlemen by no means shortsighted declared themselves unable to discern the moon upon the sun without the aid of a smoked glass and baily who however was shortsighted could distinguish in 1836 with the naked eye no trace of the globe of purple velvet which the telescope revealed as projected upon the face of the sun160 moreover the diminution of light is described by him as little more than might be caused by a temporary cloud passing over the sun the birds continued in full song and one cock in particular was crowing with all his might while the annulus was forming very different were the effects of the eclipse of 1842 as to which some interesting particulars were collected by arago161 beasts of burthen he tells us paused in their labour and could by no amount of punishment be induced to move until the sun reappeared birds and beasts abandoned their food linnets were found dead in their cages even ants suspended their toil diligencehorses on the other hand seemed as insensible to the phenomenon as locomotives the convolvulus and some other plants closed their leaves but those of the mimosa remained open the little light that remained was of a livid hue one observer described the general coloration as resembling the lees of wine but human faces showed pale olive or greenish we may then rest assured that none of the remarkable obscurations recorded in history were due to eclipses of the annular kind the existence of the corona is no modern discovery indeed it is too conspicuous an apparition to escape notice from the least attentive or least practised observer of a total eclipse nevertheless explicit references to it are rare in early times plutarch however speaks of a certain splendour compassing round the hidden edge of the sun as a regular feature of total eclipses162 and the corona is expressly mentioned in a description of an eclipse visible at corfu in 968 ad163 the first to take the phenomenon into scientific consideration was kepler he showed from the orbital positions at the time of the sun and moon that an eclipse observed by clavius at rome in 1567 could not have been annular164 as the dazzling coronal radiance visible during the obscuration had caused it to be believed although he himself never witnessed a total eclipse of the sun he carefully collected and compared the remarks of those more fortunate and concluded that the ring of flamelike splendour seen on such occasions was caused by the reflection of the solar rays from matter condensed in the neighbourhood either of the sun or moon165 to the solar explanation he gave his own decided preference but with one of those curious flashes of halfprophetic insight characteristic of his genius declared that it should be laid by ready for use not brought into immediate requisition166 so literally was his advice acted upon that the theory which we now know to be broadly speaking the correct one only emerged from the repository of anticipated truths after 236 years of almost complete retirement and even then timorously and with hesitation the first eclipse of which the attendant phenomena were observed with tolerable exactness was that which was central in the south of france may 12 1706 cassini then put forward the view that the crown of pale light seen round the lunar disc was caused by the illumination of the zodiacal light167 but it failed to receive the attention which as a step in the right direction it undoubtedly merited nine years later we meet with halleys comments on a similar event the first which had occurred in london since march 20 1140 by nine in the morning of may 3 1715 the obscuration he tells us was about ten digits168 when the face and colour of the sky began to change from perfect serene azure blue to a more dusky livid colour having an eye of purple intermixt a few seconds before the sun was all hid there discovered itself round the moon a luminous ring about a digit or perhaps a tenth part of the moons diameter in breadth it was of a pale whiteness or rather pearl colour seeming to be a little tinged with the colours of the iris and to be concentric with the moon whence i concluded it the moons atmosphere but the great height thereof far exceeding our earths atmosphere and the observation of some who found the breadth of the ring to increase on the west side of the moon as emersion approached together with the contrary sentiments of those whose judgment i shall always revere newton is most probably referred to makes me less confident especially in a matter whereto i confess i gave not all the attention requisite he concludes by declining to decide whether the enlightened atmosphere which the appearance in all respects resembled belonged to sun or moon169 a french academician who happened to be in london at the time was less guarded in expressing an opinion the chevalier de louville declared emphatically for the lunar atmospheric theory of the corona170 and his authority carried great weight it was however much discredited by an observation made by maraldi in 1724 to the effect that the luminous ring instead of travelling with the moon was traversed by it171 this was in reality decisive though as usual belief lagged far behind demonstration in 1715 a novel explanation had been offered by delisle and lahire172 supported by experiments regarded at the time as perfectly satisfactory the aureola round the eclipsed sun they argued is simply a result of the diffraction or apparent bending of the sunbeams that graze the surface of the lunar globean effect of the same kind as the coloured fringes of shadows and this view prevailed amongst men of science until and even after brewster showed with clear and simple decisiveness that such an effect could by no possibility be appreciable at our distance from the moon173 don jos joaquim de ferrer however who observed a total eclipse of the sun at kinderhook in the state of new york on june 16 1806 ignoring this refined optical rationale considered two alternative explanations of the phenomenon as alone possible the bright ring round the moon must be due to the illumination either of a lunar or of a solar atmosphere if the former he calculated that it should have a height fifty times that of the earths gaseous envelope such an atmosphere he rightly concluded cannot belong to the moon but must without any doubt belong to the sun174 but he stood alone in this unhesitating assertion the importance of the problem was first brought fully home to astronomers by the eclipse of 1842 the brilliant and complex appearance which on that occasion challenged the attention of so many observers demanded and received no longer the casual attention hitherto bestowed upon it but the most earnest study of those interested in the progress of science nevertheless it was only by degrees and through a process of exclusions to use a baconian phrase that the corona was put in its right place as a solar appendage as every other available explanation proved inadmissible and dropped out of sight the broad presentation of fact remained which though of sufficiently obvious interpretation was long and persistently misconstrued nor was it until 1869 that absolutely decisive evidence on the subject was forthcoming as we shall see further on sir john herschel writing to his venerable aunt relates that when the brilliant red flames burst into view behind the dark moon on the morning of the 8th of july 1842 the populace of milan with the usual inconsequence of a crowd raised the shout es leben die astronomen175 in reality none were less prepared for their apparition than the class to whom the applause due to the magnificent spectacle was thus adjudged and in some measure through their own fault for many partial hints and some distinct statements from earlier observers had given unheeded notice that some such phenomenon might be expected to attend a solar eclipse what we now call the chromosphere is an envelope of glowing gases by which the sun is completely covered and from which the prominences are emanations eruptive or flamelike now continual indications of the presence of this fireocean had been detected during eclipses in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries captain stannyan describing in a letter to flamsteed an occurrence of the kind witnessed by him at berne on may 1 os 1706 says that the suns getting out of the eclipse was preceded by a bloodred streak of light from its left limb176 a precisely similar appearance was noted by both halley and de louville in 1715 during annular eclipses by lord aberdour in 1737177 and by short in 1748178 the tint of the ruby border being however subdued to brown or dusky red by the surviving sunlight while observations identical in character were made at amsterdam in 1820179 at edinburgh by henderson in 1836 and at new york in 1838180 flames or prominences if more conspicuous are less constant in their presence than the glowing stratum from which they spring the first to describe them was a swedish professor named vassenius who observed a total eclipse at gothenburg may 2 os 1733181 his astonishment equalled his admiration when he perceived just outside the edge of the lunar disc and suspended as it seemed in the coronal atmosphere three or four reddish spots or clouds one of which was so large as to be detected with the naked eye as to their nature he did not even offer a speculation further than by tacitly referring them to the moon the observation was repeated in 1778 by a spanish admiral but with no better success in directing efficacious attention to the phenomenon don antonio ulloa was on board his ship the espagne in passage from the azores to cape st vincent on the 24th of june in that year when a total eclipse of the sun occurred of which he has left a valuable description his notices of the corona are full of interest but what just now concerns us is the appearance of a red luminous point near the edge of the moon which gradually increased in size as the moon moved away from it and was visible during about a minute and a quarter182 he was satisfied that it belonged to the sun because of its fiery colour and growth in magnitude and supposed that it was occasioned by some crevice or inequality in the moons limb through which the solar light penetrated allusions less precise both prior and subsequent which it is now easy to refer to similar objects such as the slender columns of smoke seen by ferrer183 might be detailed but the evidence already adduced suffices to show that the prominences viewed with such amazement in 1842 were no unprecedented or even unusual phenomenon it was more important however to decide what was their nature than whether their appearance might have been anticipated they were generally and not very incorrectly set down as solar clouds arago believed them to shine by reflected light184 but the abb peytal rightly considered them to be selfluminous writing in a montpellier paper of july 16 1842 he declared that we had now become assured of the existence of a third or outer solar envelope composed of a glowing substance of a bright rose tint forming mountains of prodigious elevation analogous in character to the clouds piled above our horizons185 this first distinct recognition of a very important feature of our great luminary was probably founded on an observation made by brard at toulon during the then recent eclipse of a very fine red band irregularly dentelated or as it were crevassed here and there186 encircling a large arc of the moons circumference it can hardly however be said to have attracted general notice until july 28 1851 on that day a total eclipse took place which was observed with considerable success in various parts of sweden and norway by a number of english astronomers mr hind saw on the south limb of the moon a long range of rosecoloured flames187 described by dawes as a low ridge of red prominences resembling in outline the tops of a very irregular range of hills188 airy termed the portion of this rugged lines of projections visible to him the sierra and was struck with its brilliant light and nearly scarlet colour189 its true character of a continuous solar envelope was inferred from these data by grant swan and littrow and was by father secchi after the great eclipse of 1860190 formally accepted as established several prominences of remarkable forms especially one variously compared to a turkish scimitar a sickle and a boomerang were seen in 1851 in connection with them two highly significant circumstances were pointed out first that of the approximate coincidence between their positions and those of sunspots previously observed191 next that the moon passed over them leaving them behind and revealing successive portions as she advanced192 this latter perfectly wellattested fact was justly considered by the astronomer royal and others as affording absolute certainty of the solar dependence of these singular objects nevertheless sceptics were still found m faye of the french academy inclined to a lunar origin for them193 feilitsch of greifswald published in 1852 a treatise for the express purpose of proving all the luminous phenomena attendant on solar eclipsescorona prominences and sierrato be purely optical appearances194 happily however the unanswerable arguments of the photographic camera were soon to be made available against such hardy incredulity thus the virtual discovery of the solar appendages both coronal and chromospheric may be said to have been begun in 1842 and completed in 1851 the current herschelian theory of the solar constitution remained however for the time intact difficulties indeed were thickening around it but their discussion was perhaps felt to be premature and they were permitted to accumulate without debate until fortified by fresh testimony into unexpected and overwhelming

a law of the planetary distances kepler tried the experiment of setting a planet invisible by reason of its smallness to revolve in the vast region of seemingly desert space separating mars from jupiter195 the disproportionate magnitude of the same interval was explained by kant as due to the overweening size of jupiter the zone in which each planet moved was according to the philosopher of knigsberg to be regarded as the empty storehouse from which its materials had been derived a definite relation should thus exist between the planetary masses and the planetary intervals196 lambert on the other hand sportively suggested that the body or bodies for it is noticeable that he speaks of them in the plural which once bridged this portentous gap in the solar system might in some remote age have been swept away by a great comet and forced to attend its wanderings through space197 these speculations were destined before long to assume a more definite form johann daniel titius a professor at wittenberg where he died in 1796 pointed out in 1772 in a note to a translation of bonnets contemplation de la nature198 the existence of a remarkable symmetry in the disposition of the bodies constituting the solar system by a certain series of numbers increasing in regular progression199 he showed that the distances of the six known planets from the sun might be represented with a close approach to accuracy but with one striking interruption the term of the series succeeding that which corresponded to the orbit of mars was without a celestial representative the orderly flow of the sequence was thus singularly broken the space where a planet shouldin fulfilment of the lawhave revolved was it appeared untenanted johann elert bode then just about to begin his long career as leader of astronomical thought and work at berlin marked at once the anomaly and filled the vacant interval with a hypothetical planet the discovery of uranus at a distance falling but slightly short of perfect conformity with the law of titius lent weight to a seemingly hazardous prediction and von zach was actually at the pains in 1785 to calculate what he termed analogical elements200 for this unseen and by any effect or influence unfelt body the search for it through confessedly scarcely less chimerical than that of alchemists for the philosophers stone he kept steadily in view for fifteen years and at length september 21 1800 succeeded in organising in combination with five other german astronomers assembled at lilienthal a force of what he jocularly termed celestial police for the express purpose of tracking and intercepting the fugitive subject of the sun the zodiac was accordingly divided for purposes of scrutiny into twentyfour zones their apportionment to separate observers was in part effected and the association was rapidly getting into working order when news arrived that the missing planet had been found through no systematic plan of search but by the diligent though otherwise directed labours of a distant watcher of the skies giuseppe piazzi was born at ponte in the valtelline july 16 1746 he studied at various places and times under tiraboschi beccaria jacquier and le sueur and having entered the theatine order of monks at the age of eighteen he taught philosophy science and theology in several of the italian cities as well as in malta until 1780 when the chair of mathematics in the university of palermo was offered to and accepted by him prince caramanico then viceroy of sicily had scientific leanings and was easily won over to the project of building an observatory a commodious foundation for which was afforded by one of the towers of the viceregal palace this architecturally incongruous addition to an ancient saracenic edificeonce the abode of kelbite and zirite emirswas completed in february 1791 piazzi meanwhile had devoted nearly three years to the assiduous study of his new profession acquiring a practical knowledge of lalandes methods at the cole militaire and of maskelynes at the royal observatory and returned to palermo in 1789 bringing with him in the great fivefoot circle which he had prevailed upon ramsden to construct the most perfect measuring instrument hitherto employed by an astronomer he had been above nine years at work on his starcatalogue and was still profoundly unconscious that a place amongst the lilienthal band201 of astronomical detectives was being held in reserve for him when on the first evening of the nineteenth century january 1 1801 he noticed the position of an eighthmagnitude star in a part of the constellation taurus to which an error of wollastons had directed his special attention reobserving according to his custom the same set of fifty stars on four consecutive nights it seemed to him on the 2nd that the one in question had slightly shifted its position to the west on the 3rd he assured himself of the fact and believed that he had chanced upon a new kind of comet without tail or coma the wandering body whatever its nature exchanged retrograde for direct motion on january 14202 and was carefully watched by piazzi until february 11 when a dangerous illness interrupted his observations he had however not omitted to give notice of his discovery but so precarious were communications in those unpeaceful times that his letter to oriani of january 23 did not reach milan until april 5 while a missive of one day later addressed to bode came to hand at berlin march 20 the delay just afforded time for the publication by a young philosopher of jena named hegel of a dissertation showing by the clearest light of reason that the number of the planets could not exceed seven and exposing the folly of certain devotees of induction who sought a new celestial body merely to fill a gap in a numerical series203 unabashed by speculative scorn bode had scarcely read piazzis letter when he concluded that it referred to the precise body in question the news spread rapidly and created a profound sensation not unmixed with alarm lest this latest addition to the solar family should have been found only to be again lost for by that time piazzis moving star was too near the sun to be any longer visible and in order to rediscover it after conjunction a tolerably accurate knowledge of its path was indispensable but a planetary orbit had never before been calculated from such scanty data as piazzis observation afforded204 and the attempts made by nearly every astronomer of note in germany to compass the problem were manifestly inadequate failing even to account for the positions in which the body had been actually seen and fortiori serving only to mislead as to the places where from september 1801 it ought once more to have become discernible it was in this extremity that the celebrated mathematician gauss came to the rescue he was then in his twentyfifth year and was earning his bread by tuition at brunswick with many possibilities but no settled career before him the news from palermo may be said to have converted him from an arithmetician into an astronomer he was already in possession of a new and more general method of computing elliptical orbits and the system of least squares which he had devised though not published enabled him to extract the most probable result from a given set of observations armed with these novel powers he set to work and the communication in november of his elements and ephemeris for the lost object revived the drooping hopes of the little band of eager searchers their patience however was to be still further tried clouds mist and sleet seemed to have conspired to cover the retreat of the fugitive but on the last night of the year the sky cleared unexpectedly with the setting in of a hard frost and there in the northwestern part of virgo nearly in the position assigned by gauss to the runaway planet a strange star was discerned by von zach205 at gotha and on a subsequent eveningthe anniversary of the original discoveryby olbers at bremen the name of ceres as the tutelary goddess of sicily was by piazzis request bestowed upon this first known of the numerous and probably all but innumerable family of the minor planets the recognition of the second followed as the immediate consequence of the detection of the first olbers had made himself so familiar with the positions of the small stars along the track of the longmissing body that he was at once struck march 28 1802 with the presence of an intruder near the spot where he had recently identified ceres he at first believed the newcomer to be a variable star usually inconspicuous but just then at its maximum of brightness but within two hours he had convinced himself that it was no fixed star but a rapidly moving object the aid of gauss was again invoked and his prompt calculations showed that this fresh celestial acquaintance named pallas by olbers revolved round the sun at nearly the same mean distance as ceres and was beyond question of a strictly analogous character this result was perplexing in the extreme the symmetry and simplicity of the planetary scheme appeared fatally compromised by the admission of many where room could according to oldfashioned rules only be found for one a daring hypothesis of olberss invention provided an exit from the difficulty he supposed that both ceres and pallas were fragments of a primitive transmartian planet blown to pieces in the remote past either by the action of internal forces or by the impact of a comet and predicted that many more such fragments would be found to circulate in the same region he moreover pointed out that these numerous orbits however much they might differ in other respects must all have a common line of intersection206 and that the bodies moving in them must consequently pass at each revolution through two opposite points of the heavens one situated in the whale the other in the constellation of the virgin where already pallas had been found and ceres recaptured the intimation that fresh discoveries might be expected in those particular regions was singularly justified by the detection of two bodies now known respectively as juno and vesta the first was found near the predicted spot in cetus by harding schrters assistant at lilienthal september 2 1804 the second by olbers himself in virgo after three years of persistent scrutiny march 29 1807 the theory of an exploded planet now seemed to have everything in its favour it required that the mean or average distances of the newlydiscovered bodies should be nearly the same but admitted a wide range of variety in the shapes and positions of their orbits provided always that they preserved common points of intersection these conditions were fulfilled with a striking approach to exactness three of the four asteroids a designation introduced by sir w herschel207 conformed with very approximate precision to bodes law of distances they all traversed in their circuits round the sun nearly the same parts of cetus and virgo while the eccentricities and inclinations of their paths departed widely from the planetary typethat of pallas to take an extreme instance making with the ecliptic an angle of nearly 35 the minuteness of these bodies appeared further to strengthen the imputation of a fragmentary character herschel estimated the diameter of ceres at 162 that of pallas at 147 miles208 but these values are now known to be considerably too small a suspected variability of brightness in some of the asteroids somewhat hazardously explained as due to the irregularities of figure to be expected in cosmical potsherds so to speak was added to the confirmatory evidence209 the strong point of the theory however lay not in what it explained but in what it had predicted it had been twice confirmed by actual exploration of the skies and had produced in the recognition of vesta the first recorded instance of the premeditated discovery of a heavenly body the view not only commended itself to the facile imagination of the unlearned but received the sanction of the highest scientific authority the great lagrange bestowed upon it his analytical imprimatur showing that the explosive forces required to produce the supposed catastrophe came well within the bounds of possibility since a velocity of less than twenty times that of a cannonball leaving the guns mouth would have sufficed according to his calculation to launch the asteroidal fragments on their respective paths indeed he was disposed to regard the hypothesis of disruption as more generally available than its author had designed it to be and proposed to supplement with it as explanatory of the eccentric orbits of comets the nebular theory of laplace thereby obtaining as he said a complete view of the origin of the planetary system more conformable to nature and mechanical laws than any yet proposed210 nevertheless the hypothesis of olbers has not held its ground it seemed as if all the evidence available for its support had been produced at once and spontaneously while the unfavourable items were elicited slowly and as it were by crossexamination a more extended acquaintance with the group of bodies whose peculiarities it was framed to explain has shown them after all as recalcitrant to any such explanation coincidences at the first view significant and striking have been swamped by contrary examples and a hasty general conclusion has by a not uncommon destiny at last perished under the accumulation of particulars moreover as has been remarked by professor newcomb211 mutual perturbations would rapidly efface all traces of a common disruptive origin and the catastrophe to be perceptible in its effects should have been comparatively recent a new generation of astronomers had arisen before any additions were made to the little family of the minor planets piazzi died in 1826 harding in 1834 olbers in 1840 all those who had prepared or participated in the first discoveries passed away without witnessing their resumption in 1830 however a certain hencke expostmaster in the prussian town of driessen set himself to watch for new planets and after fifteen long years his patience was rewarded the asteroid found by him december 8 1845 received the name of astra and his further prosecution of the search resulted july 1 1847 in the discovery of hebe a few weeks later august 13 john russell hind 18231893 after many months exploration from mr bishops observatory in the regents park picked up iris and october 18 flora212 the next on the list was metis found by mr graham april 25 1848 at markree in ireland213 at the close of the period to which our attention is at present limited the number of these small bodies known to astronomy was thirteen and the course of discovery has since proceeded far more rapidly and with less interruption both in itself and in its consequences the recognition of the minor planets was of the highest importance to science the traditional ideas regarding the constitution of the solar system were enlarged by the admission of a new class of bodies strongly contrasted yet strictly coordinate with the oldestablished planetary order the profusion of resource so conspicuous in the living kingdoms of nature was seen to prevail no less in the celestial spaces and some faint preliminary notion was afforded of the indefinite complexity of relations underlying the apparent simplicity of the majestic scheme to which our world belongs both theoretical and practical astronomy derived profit from the admission of these apparently insignificant strangers to the rights of citizenship of the solar system the disturbance of their motions by their giant neighbours afforded a more accurate knowledge of the jovian mass which laplace had taken about 150 too small the anomalous character of their orbits presented geometers with highly stimulating problems in the theory of perturbation while the exigencies of the first discovery had produced the theoria motus and won gauss over to the ranks of calculating astronomy moreover the sure prospect of further detections powerfully incited to the exploration of the skies observers became more numerous and more zealous in view of the prizes held out to them starmaps were diligently constructed and the sidereal multitude strewn along the great zodiacal belt acquired a fresh interest when it was perceived that its least conspicuous member might be a planetary shred or projectile in the dignified disguise of a distant sun hardings celestial atlas designed for the special purpose of facilitating asteroidal research was the first systematic attempt to represent to the eye the telescopic aspect of the heavens it was while engaged on its construction that the lilienthal observer successfully intercepted juno on her passage through the whale in 1804 whereupon promoted to gttingen he there completed in 1822 the arduous task so opportunely entered upon a score of years previously still more important were the great starmaps of the berlin academy undertaken at bessels suggestion with the same object of distinguishing errant from fixed stars and executed under enckes supervision during the years 183059 they have played a noteworthy part in the history of planetary discovery nor of the minor kind alone we have now to recount an event unique in scientific history the discovery of neptune has been characterised as the result of a movement of the age214 and with some justice it had become necessary to the integrity of planetary theory until it was accomplished the phantom of an unexplained anomaly in the orderly movements of the solar system must have continued to haunt astronomical consciousness moreover it was prepared by many suggested as possible by not a few and actually achieved simultaneously independently and completely by two investigators the position of the planet uranus was recorded as that of a fixed star no less than twenty times between 1690 and the epoch of its final detection by herschel but these early observations far from affording the expected facilities for the calculation of its orbit proved a source of grievous perplexity the utmost ingenuity of geometers failed to combine them satisfactorily with the later uranian places and it became evident either that they were widely erroneous or that the revolving body was wandering from its ancient track the simplest course was to reject them altogether and this was done in the new tables published in 1821 by alexis bouvard the indefatigable computating partner of laplace but the trouble was not thus to be got rid of after a few years fresh irregularities began to appear and continued to increase until absolutely intolerable it may be stated as illustrative of the perfection to which astronomy had been brought that divergencies regarded as menacing the very foundation of its theories never entered the range of unaided vision in other words if the theoretical and the real uranus had been placed side by side in the sky they would have seemed to the sharpest eye to form a single body215 the idea that these enigmatical disturbances were due to the attraction of an unknown exterior body was a tolerably obvious one and we accordingly find it suggested in many different quarters bouvard himself was perhaps the first to conceive it he kept the possibility continually in view and bequeathed to his nephews diligence the inquiry into its reality when he felt that his own span was drawing to a close but before any progress had been made with it he had already june 7 1843 ceased to breathe and to calculate the rev t j hussey actually entertained in 1834 the notion but found his powers inadequate to the task of assigning an approximate place to the disturbing body and bessel in 1840 laid his plans for an assault in form upon the uranian difficulty the triumphant exit from which fatal illness frustrated his hopes of effecting or even witnessing the problem was practically untouched when in 1841 an undergraduate of st johns college cambridge formed the resolution of grappling with it the projected task was an arduous one there were no guiding precedents for its conduct analytical obstacles had to be encountered so formidable as to appear invincible even to such a mathematician as airy john couch adams however had no sooner taken his degree which he did as senior wrangler in january 1843 than he set resolutely to work and on october 21 1845 was able to communicate to the astronomer royal numerical estimates of the elements and mass of the unknown planet together with an indication of its actual place in the heavens these results it has been well said216 gave the final and inexorable proof of the validity of newtons law the date october 21 1845 may therefore be regarded as marking a distinct epoch in the history of gravitational astronomy sir george biddell airy had begun in 1835 his long and energetic administration of the royal observatory and was already in possession of data vitally important to the momentous inquiry then on foot at his suggestion and under his superintendence the reduction of all the planetary observations made at greenwich from 1750 onwards had been undertaken in 1833 the results published in 1846 constituted a permanent and universal stock of materials for the correction of planetary theory but in the meantime investigators both native and foreign were freely supplied with the places and errors which clearly exhibiting the discrepancies between observation and calculationbetween what was and what was expectedformed the very groundwork of future improvements mr adams had no reason to complain of official discourtesy his labours received due and indispensable aid but their purpose was regarded as chimerical i have always sir george airy wrote217 considered the correctness of a distant mathematical result to be a subject rather of moral than of mathematical evidence and that actually before him seemed from its very novelty to incur a suspicion of unlikelihood no problem in planetary disturbance had heretofore been attacked so to speak from the rear the inverse method was untried and might well be deemed impracticable for the difficulty of determining the perturbations produced by a given planet is small compared with the difficulty of finding a planet by its resulting perturbations laplace might have quailed before it yet it was now grappled with as a first essay in celestial dynamics moreover adams unaccountably neglected to answer until too late a question regarded by airy in the light of an experimentum crucis as to the soundness of the new theory nor did he himself take any steps to obtain a publicity which he was more anxious to merit than to secure the investigation consequently remained buried in obscurity it is now known that had a search been instituted in the autumn of 1845 for the remote body whose existence had been so marvellously foretold it would have been found within three and a half lunar diameters 1 49 of the spot assigned to it by adams a competitor however equally daring and more fortunateaudax fortun adjutus as gauss said of himwas even then entering the field urbain jean joseph leverrier the son of a small government employ in normandy was born at saintl march 11 1811 he studied with brilliant success at the cole polytechnique accepted the post of astronomical teacher there in 1837 and docile to circumstance immediately concentrated the whole of his vast though as yet undeveloped powers upon the formidable problems of celestial mechanics he lost no time in proving to the mathematical world that the race of giants was not extinct two papers on the stability of the solar system presented to the academy of sciences september 16 and october 14 1839 showed him to be the worthy successor of lagrange and laplace and encouraged hopes destined to be abundantly realised his attention was directed by arago to the uranian difficulty in 1845 when he cheerfully put aside certain intricate cometary researches upon which he happened to be engaged in order to obey with dutiful promptitude the summons of the astronomical chief of france in his first memoir on the subject communicated to the academy november 10 1845 he proved the inadequacy of all known causes of disturbance to account for the vagaries of uranus in a second june 1 1848 he demonstrated that only an exterior body occupying at a certain date a determinate position in the zodiac could produce the observed effects in a third august 31 1846 he assigned the orbit of the disturbing body and announced its visibility as an object with a sensible disc about as bright as a star of the eighth magnitude the question was now visibly approaching an issue on september 10 sir john herschel declared to the british association respecting the hypothetical new planet we see it as columbus saw america from the coast of spain its movements have been felt trembling along the farreaching line of our analysis with a certainty hardly inferior to that of ocular demonstration less than a fortnight later september 23 professor galle of the berlin observatory received a letter from leverrier requesting his aid in the telescopic part of the inquiry already analytically completed he directed his refractor to the heavens that same night and perceived within less than a degree of the spot indicated an object with a measurable disc nearly three seconds in diameter its absence from bremikers recentlycompleted map of that region of the sky showed it to be no star and its movement in the predicted direction confirmed without delay the strong persuasion of its planetary nature218 in this remarkable manner the existence of the remote member of our system known as neptune was ascertained but the discovery which faithfully reflected the duplicate character of the investigation which led to it had been already secured at cambridge before it was announced from berlin sir george airys incredulity vanished in the face of the striking coincidence between the position assigned by leverrier to the unknown planet in june and that laid down by adams in the previous october and on the 9th of july he wrote to professor challis director of the cambridge observatory recommending a search with the great northumberland equatoreal had a good starmap been at hand the process would have been a simple one but of bremikers hora xxi no news had yet reached england and there was no other sufficiently comprehensive to be available for an inquiry which in the absence of such aid promised to be both long and laborious as the event proved it might have been neither after four days of observing challis wrote october 12 1846 to airy the planet was in my grasp if only i had examined or mapped the observations219 had he done so the first honours in the discovery both theoretical and optical would have fallen to the university of cambridge but professor challis had other astronomical avocations to attend to and moreover his faith in the precision of the indications furnished to him was by his own confession a very feeble one for both reasons he postponed to a later stage of the proceedings the discussion and comparison of the data nightly furnished to him by his telescope and thus allowed to lie as it were latent in his observations the momentous result which his diligence had insured but which his delay suffered to be anticipated220 nevertheless it should not be forgotten that the berlin astronomer had two circumstances in his favour apart from which his swift success could hardly have been achieved the first was the possession of a good starmap the second was the clear and confident nature of leverriers instructions look where i tell you he seemed authoritatively to say and you will see an object such as i describe221 and in fact not only galle on the 23rd of september but also challis on the 29th immediately after reading the french geometers lucid and impressive treatise picked out from among the stellar points strewing the zodiac a small planetary disc which eventually proved to be that of the precise body he had been in search of during two months the controversy that ensued had its ignominious side but it was entered into by neither of the parties principally concerned adams bore the disappointment which the dilatory proceedings at greenwich and cambridge had inflicted upon him with quiet heroism his silence on the subject of what another man would have called his wrongs remained unbroken to the end of his life222 and he took every opportunity of testifying his admiration for the genius of leverrier personal questions however vanish in the magnitude of the event they relate to by it the last lingering doubts as to the absolute exactness of the newtonian law were dissipated recondite analytical methods received a confirmation brilliant and intelligible even to the minds of the vulgar and emerged from the patient solitude of the study to enjoy an hour of clamorous triumph for ever invisible to the unaided eye of man a sisterglobe to our earth was shown to circulate in perpetual frozen exile at thirty times its distance from the sun nay the possibility was made apparent that the limits of our system were not even thus reached but that yet profounder abysses of space might shelter obedient though little favoured members of the solar family by future astronomers to be recognised through the sympathetic thrillings of neptune even as neptune himself was recognised through the telltale deviations of uranus it is curious to find that the fruit of adamss and leverriers laborious investigations had been accidentally all but snatched half a century before it was ripe to be gathered on the 8th and again on the 10th of may 1795 lalande noted the position of neptune as that of a fixed star but perceiving that the two observations did not agree he suppressed the first as erroneous and pursued the inquiry no further an immortality which he would have been the last to despise hung in the balance the featherweight of his carelessness however kicked the beam and the discovery was reserved to be more hardly won by later comers bodes law did good service in the quest for a transuranian planet by affording ground for a probable assumption as to its distance a startingpoint for approximation was provided by it but it was soon found to be considerably at fault even uranus is about 36 millions of miles nearer to the sun than the order of progression requires and neptunes vast distance of 2800 million should be increased by no less than 800 million miles and its period of 165 lengthened out to 225 years223 in order to bring it into conformity with the curious and unexplained rule which planetary discoveries have alternately tended to confirm and to invalidate within seventeen days of its identification with the berlin achromatic neptune was found to be attended by a satellite this discovery was the first notable performance of the celebrated twofoot reflector224 erected by mr lassell at his suggestively named residence of starfield near liverpool william lassell was a brewer by profession but by inclination an astronomer born at bolton in lancashire june 18 1799 he closed a life of eminent usefulness to science october 5 1818 thus spanning with his wellspent years fourfifths of the momentous period which we have undertaken to traverse at the age of twentyone being without the means to purchase he undertook to construct telescopes and naturally turned his attention to the reflecting sort as favouring amateur efforts by the comparative simplicity of its structure his native ingenuity was remarkable and was developed by the hourly exigencies of his successive enterprises their uniform success encouraged him to enlarge his aims and in 1844 he visited birr castle for the purpose of inspecting the machine used in polishing the giant speculum of parsonstown in the construction of his new instrument however he eventually discarded the model there obtained and worked on a method of his own assisted by the supreme mechanical skill of james nasmyth the result was a newtonian of exquisite definition with an aperture of two and a focal length of twenty feet provided by a novel artifice with the equatoreal mounting previously regarded as available only for refractors this beautiful instrument afforded to its maker october 10 1846 a cursory view of a neptunian attendant but the planet was then approaching the sun and it was not until the following july that the observation could be verified which it was completely first by lassell himself and somewhat later by otto stuve and bond of cambridge us when it is considered that this remote object shines by reflecting sunlight reduced by distance to 1900th of the intensity with which it illuminates our moon the fact of its visibility even in the most perfect telescopes is a somewhat surprising one it can only indeed be accounted for by attributing to it dimensions very considerable for a body of the secondary order it shares with the moons of uranus the peculiarity of retrograde motion that is to say its revolutions running counter to the grand current of movement in the solar system are performed from east to west in a plane inclined at an angle of 35 to that of the ecliptic their swiftness serves to measure the mass of the globe round which they are performed for while our moon takes twentyseven days and nearly eight hours to complete its circuit of the earth the satellite of neptune at a distance not greatly inferior sweeps round its primary in five days and twentyone hours showing according to a very simple principle of computation that it is urged by a force seventeen times greater than the terrestrial pull upon the lunar orb combining this result with those of professor barnards225 and dr sees226 recent measurements of the small telescopic disc of this farthest known planet it is found that while in mass neptune equals seventeen in bulk it is equivalent to fortynine earths this is as much as to say that it is composed of relatively very light materials or more probably of materials distended by internal heat as yet unwasted by radiation into space to about five times the volume they would occupy in the interior of our globe the fact at any rate is fairly well ascertained that the average density of neptune is about twice that of water we must now turn from this laterecognised member of our system to bestow some brief attention upon the still fruitful field of discovery offered by one of the immemorial five the family of saturn unlike that of its brilliant neighbour has been gradually introduced to the notice of astronomers titan the sixth saturnian moon in order of distance led the way being detected by huygens march 25 1655 cassini made the acquaintance of four more between 1671 and 1684 while mimas and enceladus the two innermost were caught by herschel in 1789 as they threaded their lucid way along the edge of the almost vanished ring in the distances of these seven revolving bodies from their primary an order of progression analogous to that pointed out by titius in the planetary intervals was found to prevail but with one conspicuous interruption similar to that which had first suggested the search for new members of the solar system between titan and japetusthe sixth and seventh reckoning outwardsthere was obviously room for another satellite it was discovered on both sides of the atlantic simultaneously on the 19th of september 1848 mr w c bond employing the splendid 15inch refractor of the harvard observatory noticed september 16 a minute star situated in the plane of saturns rings the same object was discerned by mr lassell on the 18th on the following evening both observers perceived that the problematical speck of light kept up with instead of being left behind by the planet as it moved and hence inferred its true character227 hyperion the seventh by distance and eighth by recognition of saturns attendant train is of so insignificant a size when compared with some of its fellowmoons titan is but little inferior to the planet mars as to have suggested to sir john herschel228 the idea that it might be only one of several bodies revolving very close togetherin fact an asteroidal satellite but the conjecture has so far not been verified the coincidence of its duplicate discovery was singularly paralleled two years later galileos amazement when his optic glass revealed to him the triple form of saturnplaneta tergeminushas proved to be like the laughter of the gods inextinguishable it must revive in every one who contemplates anew the unique arrangements of that world apart known to us as the saturnian system the resolution of the socalled ans or handles into one encircling ring by huygens in 1655 the discovery by cassini in 1675 of the division of that ring into two concentric ones together with laplaces investigation of the conditions of stability of such a formation constituted with some minor observations the sum of the knowledge obtained up to the middle of the last century on the subject of this remarkable formation the first place in the discovery now about to be related belongs to an american astronomer william cranch bond born in 1789 at portland in the state of maine was a watchmaker whom the solar eclipse of 1806 attracted to study the wonders of the heavens when in 1815 the erection of an observatory in connection with harvard college cambridge was first contemplated he undertook a mission to england for the purpose of studying the working of similar institutions there and on his return erected a private observatory at dorchester where he worked diligently for many years then at last in 1843 the longpostponed design of the harvard authorities was resumed and on the completion of the new establishment bond who had been from 1838 officially connected with the college and had carried on his scientific labours within its precincts was offered and accepted the post of its director placed in 1847 in possession of one of the finest instruments in the worlda masterpiece of merz and mahlerhe headed the now long list of distinguished transatlantic observers like the elder struve he left an heir to his office and to his eminence but george bond unfortunately died in 1865 at the early age of thirtynine having survived his father but six years on the night of november 15 1850the air remarkably enough being so hazy that only the brightest stars could be perceived with the naked eyewilliam bond discerned a dusky ring extending about halfway between the inner brighter one and the globe of saturn a fortnight later but before the observation had been announced in england the same appearance was seen by the rev w r dawes with the comparatively small refractor of his observatory at wateringbury and on december 3 was described by mr lassell then on a visit to him as something like a crape veil covering a part of the sky within the inner ring229 next morning the times containing the report of bonds discovery reached wateringbury the most surprising circumstance in the matter was that the novel appendage had remained so long unrecognised as the rings opened out to their full extent it became obvious with very moderate optical assistance yet some of the most acute observers who have ever lived using instruments of vast power had heretofore failed to detect its presence it soon appeared however that galle of berlin230 had noticed june 10 1838 a veillike extension of the lucid ring across half the dark space separating it from the planet but the observation although communicated at the time to the berlin academy of sciences had remained barren traces of the dark ring moreover were found in drawings executed by campani in 1664231 and by hooke in 1666232 while picard june 15 1673233 hadley spring of 1720234 and herschel235 had all undoubtedly seen it under the aspect of a dark bar or belt crossing the saturnian globe it was then of no recent origin but there seemed reason to think that it had lately gained considerably in brightness the full meaning of this suspected change it was reserved for later investigations to develop what we may in a certain sense call the closing result of the race for discovery in which several observers seemed at that time to be engaged was the establishment on a satisfactory footing of our acquaintance with the dependent system of uranus sir william herschel whose researches formed in so many distinct lines of astronomical inquiry the startingpoints of future knowledge detected january 11 1787236 two uranian moons since called oberon and titania and ascertained the curious circumstance of their motion in a plane almost at right angles to the ecliptic in a direction contrary to that of all previously known denizens other than cometary of the solar kingdom he believed that he caught occasional glimpses of four more but never succeeded in assuring himself of their substantial existence even the two first remained unseen save by himself until 1828 when his son reobserved them with a 20foot reflector similar to that with which they had been originally discovered thenceforward they were kept fairly within view but their four questionable companions in spite of some false alarms of detection remained in the dubious condition in which herschel had left them at last on october 24 1851237 after some years of fruitless watching lassell espied ariel and umbriel two uranian attendants interior to oberon and titania and of about half their brightness so that their disclosure is still reckoned amongst the very highest proofs of instrumental power and perfection in all probability they were then for the first time seen for although professor holden238 made out a plausible case in favour of the fitful visibility to herschel of each of them in turn lassells argument239 that the glare of the planet in herschels great specula must have rendered almost impossible the perception of objects so minute and so close to its disc appears tolerably decisive to the contrary uranus is thus attended by four moons and so far as present knowledge extends by no more among the most important of the negative results240 secured by lassells observations at malta during the years 185253 and 186165 were the convincing evidence afforded by them that without great increase of optical power no further neptunian or uranian satellites can be perceived and

bodies known as comets or hirsute stars obey the law of gravitation but it was by no means certain that the individual of the species observed by him in 1680 formed a permanent member of the solar system the velocity in fact of its rush round the sun was quite possibly sufficient to carry it off for ever into the depths of space there to wander a celestial casual from star to star with another comet however which appeared two years later the case was different edmund halley who afterwards succeeded flamsteed as astronomer royal calculated the elements of its orbit on newtons principles and found them to resemble so closely those similarly arrived at for comets observed by peter apian in 1531 and by kepler in 1607 as almost to compel the inference that all three were apparitions of a single body this implied its revolution in a period of about seventysix years and halley accordingly fixed its return for 17589 so fully alive was he to the importance of the announcement that he appealed to a candid posterity in the event of its verification to acknowledge that the discovery was due to an englishman the prediction was one of the testquestions put by science to nature on the replies to which largely depend both the development of knowledge and the conviction of its reality in the present instance the answer afforded may be said to have laid the foundation of this branch of astronomy halleys comet punctually reappeared on christmas day 1758 and effected its perihelion passage on the 12th of march following thus proving beyond dispute that some at least of these erratic bodies are domesticated within our system and strictly conform if not to its unwritten customs so to speak at any rate to its fundamental laws their movements in short were demonstrated by the most unanswerable of all argumentsthat of verified calculationto be calculable and their investigation was erected into a legitimate department of astronomical science this notable advance was the chief result obtained in the field of inquiry just now under consideration during the eighteenth century but before it closed its cultivation had received a powerful stimulus through the invention of an improved method the name of olbers has already been brought prominently before our readers in connection with asteroidal discoveries these however were but chance excursions from the path of cometary research which he steadily pursued through life an early predilection for the heavens was fixed in this particular direction by one of the happy inspirations of genius as he was watching one night in the year 1779 by the sickbed of a fellowstudent in medicine at gttingen an important simplification in the mode of computing the paths of comets occurred to him although not made public until 1797 olberss method was then universally adopted and is still regarded as the most expeditious and convenient in cases where absolute rigour is not required by its introduction not only many a toilsome and thankless hour was spared but workers were multiplied and encouraged in the prosecution of labours more useful than attractive the career of heinrich olbers is a brilliant example of what may be done by an amateur in astronomy he at no time did regular work in an observatory he was never the possessor of a transit or any other fixed instrument moreover all the best years of his life were absorbed in the assiduous exercise of a toilsome profession born in 1758 at the village of arbergen where his father was pastor he settled in 1781 as a physician in the neighbouring town of bremen and continued in active practice there for over forty years it was thus only the hours which his robust constitution enabled him to spare from sleep that were available for his intellectual pleasures yet his recreation was as von zach remarked241 no less prolific of useful results than the severest work of other men the upper part of his house in the sandgasse was fitted up with such instruments and appliances as restrictions of space permitted and there night after night during half a century and upwards he discovered calculated or observed the cometary visitants of northern skies almost as effective in promoting the interests of science as the valuable work actually done by him was the influence of his genial personality he engaged confidence by his ready and discerning sympathy he inspired affection by his benevolent disinterestedness he quickened thought and awakened zeal by the suggestions of a lively and inventive spirit animated with the warmest enthusiasm for the advancement of knowledge nearly every astronomer in germany enjoyed the benefits of a frequently active correspondence with him and his communications to the scientific periodicals of the time were numerous and striking the motive power of his mind was thus widely felt and continually in action nor did it wholly cease to be exerted even when the advance of age and the progress of infirmity rendered him incapable of active occupation he was in fact alive even to the last day of his long life of eightyone years and his death which occurred march 2 1840 left vacant a position which a rare combination of moral and intellectual qualities had conspired to render unique amongst the many younger men who were attracted and stimulated by intercourse with him was johann franz encke but while olbers became a mathematician because he was an astronomer encke became an astronomer because he was a mathematician a born geometer he was naturally sent to gttingen and placed under the tuition of gauss but geometers are men and the contagion of patriotic fervour which swept over germany after the battle of leipsic did not spare gausss promising pupil he took up arms in the hanseatic legion and marched and fought until the oppressor of his country was safely ensconced behind the oceanwalls of st helena in the course of his campaigning he met lindenau the militant director of the seeberg observatory and by his influence was appointed his assistant and eventually in 1822 became his successor thence he was promoted in 1825 to berlin where he superintended the building of the new observatory so actively promoted by humboldt and remained at its head until within some eighteen months of his death in august 1865 on the 26th of november 1818 pons of marseilles discovered a comet whose inconspicuous appearance gave little promise of its becoming one of the most interesting objects in our system encke at once took the calculation of its elements in hand and brought out the unexpected result that it revolved round the sun in a period of about 313 years242 he moreover detected its identity with comets seen by mchain in 1786 by caroline herschel in 1795 by pons huth and bouvard in 1805 and after six laborious weeks of research into the disturbances experienced by it from the planets during the entire interval since its first ascertained appearance he fixed may 24 1822 as the date of its next return to perihelion although on that occasion owing to the position of the earth invisible in the northern hemisphere sir thomas brisbanes observatory at paramatta was fortunately ready equipped for its recapture which rmker effected quite close to the spot indicated by enckes ephemeris the importance of this event can be better understood when it is remembered that it was only the second instance of the recognised return of a comet that of halleys sixtythree years previously having as already stated been the first and that it moreover established the existence of a new class of celestial objects somewhat loosely distinguished as comets of short period these bodies of which about thirty have been found to circulate within the orbit of saturn are remarkable as showing certain planetary affinities in the manners of their motions not at all perceptible in the wider travelling members of their order they revolve without exception in the same direction as the planetsfrom west to east they exhibit a marked tendency to conform to the zodiacal track which limits planetary excursions north and south and their paths round the sun although much more eccentric than the approximately circular planetary orbits are far less so than the extravagantly long ellipses in which comets comparatively untrained as it were in the habits of the solar system ordinarily perform their revolutions no great comet is of the planetary kind these are indeed only by exception visible to the naked eye they possess extremely feeble tailproducing powers and give small signs of central condensation thin wisps of cosmical cloud they flit across the telescopic field of view without sensibly obscuring the smallest star their appearance in short suggestswhat some notable facts in their history will presently be shown to confirmthat they are bodies already effete and verging towards dissolution if it be asked what possible connection can be shown to exist between the shortness of period by which they are essentially characterised and what we may call their superannuated condition we are not altogether at a loss for an answer keplers remark243 that comets are consumed by their own emissions has undoubtedly a measure of truth in it the substance ejected into the tail must in overwhelmingly large proportion be for ever lost to the central mass from which it issues true it is of a nature inconceivably tenuous but unrepaired waste however small in amount cannot be persisted in with impunity the incitement to such selfspoliation proceeds from the sun it accordingly progresses more rapidly the more numerous are the returns to the solar vicinity comets of short period may thus reasonably be expected to wear out quickly they are moreover subject to many adventures and vicissitudes their apheliaor the farthest points of their orbits from the sunare usually if not invariably situated so near to the path either of jupiter or of saturn as to permit these giant planets to act as secondary rulers of their destinies by their influence they were in all likelihood originally fixed in their present tracks and by their influence exerted in an opposite sense they may in some cases be eventually ejected from them careers so varied as can easily be imagined are apt to prove instructive and astronomers have not been backward in extracting from them the lessons they are fitted to convey enckes comet above all has served as an index to much curious information and it may be hoped that its function in that respect is by no means at an end the great extent of the solar system traversed by its eccentric path makes it peculiarly useful for the determination of the planetary masses at perihelion it penetrates within the orbit of mercury it considerably transcends at aphelion the farthest excursion of pallas its vicinity to the former planet in august 1835 offered the first convenient opportunity of placing that body in the astronomical balance its weight or mass had previously been assumed not ascertained and the comparatively slight deviation from its regular course impressed upon the comet by its attractive power showed that it had been assumed nearly twice too great244 that fundamental datum of planetary astronomythe mass of jupiterwas corrected by similar means and it was reassuring to find the correction in satisfactory accord with that already introduced from observations of the asteroidal movements the fact that comets contract in approaching the sun had been noticed by hevelius pingr admitted it with hesitating perplexity245 the example of enckes comet rendered it conspicuous and undeniable on the 28th of october 1828 the diameter of the nebulous matter composing this body was estimated at 312000 miles it was then about one and a half times further from the sun than the earth is at the time of the equinox on the 24th of december following its distance being reduced by nearly twothirds it was found to be only 14000 miles across246 that is to say it had shrunk during those two months of approach to 111000th part of its original volume yet it had still seventeen days journey to make before reaching perihelion the same curious circumstance was even more markedly apparent at its return in 1838 its bulk or the actual space occupied by it appeared to be reduced as it drew near the hearth of our system in the enormous proportion of 800000 to 1 a corresponding expansion accompanied on each occasion its retirement from the sphere of observation similar changes of volume though rarely to the same astounding extent have been perceived in other comets they still remain unexplained but it can scarcely be doubted that they are due to the action of the same energetic internal forces which reveal themselves in so many splendid and surprising cometary phenomena another question of singular interest was raised by enckes acute inquiries into the movements and disturbances of the first known comet of short period he found from the first that its revolutions were subject to some influence besides that of gravity after every possible allowance had been made for the pulls now backward now forward exerted upon it by the several planets there was still a surplus of acceleration left unaccounted for each return to perihelion took place about two and a half hours sooner than received theories warranted here then was a residual phenomenon of the utmost promise for the disclosure of novel truths encke in accordance with the opinion of olbers explained it as due to the presence in space of some such subtle matter as was long ago invoked by euler247 to be the agent of eventual destruction for the fair scheme of planetary creation the apparent anomaly of accounting for an accelerative effect by a retarding cause disappears when it is considered that any check to the motion of bodies revolving round a centre of attraction causes them to draw closer to it thus shortening their periods and quickening their circulation if space were filled with a resisting medium capable of impeding even in the most infinitesimal degree the swift course of the planets their orbits should necessarily be not ellipses but very close elliptical spirals along which they would slowly but inevitably descend into the burning lap of the sun the circumstance that no such tendency can be traced in their revolutions by no means sets the question at rest for it might well be that an effect totally imperceptible until after the lapse of countless ages as regards the solid orbs of our system might be obvious in the movements of bodies like comets of small mass and great bulk just as a feather or a gauze veil at once yields its motion to the resistance of the air while a cannonball cuts its way through with comparatively slight loss of velocity it will thus be seen that issues of the most momentous character hang on the timekeeping of comets for plainly all must in some degree suffer the same kind of hindrance as enckes if the cause of that hindrance be the one suggested none of its congeners however show any trace of similar symptoms true the late professor oppolzer announced248 in 1880 that a comet first seen by pons in 1819 and rediscovered by winnecke in 1858 having a period of 2052 days 56 years was accelerated at each revolution precisely in the manner required by enckes theory but m von haerdtls subsequent investigation the materials for which included numerous observations of the body in question at its return to the sun in 1886 decisively negatived the presence of any such effect249 moreover the researches of von asten and backlund250 into the movements of enckes comet revealed a perplexing circumstance they confirmed enckes results for the period covered by them but exhibited the acceleration as having suddenly diminished by nearly onehalf in 1868 the reality and permanence of this change were fully established by observations of the ensuing return in march 1885 some physical alteration of the retarded body seems indicated but visual evidence countenances no such assumption in aspect the comet is no less thin and diffuse than in 1795 or in 1848 the character of the supposed resistance in interplanetary space has it may be remarked been often misapprehended what encke stipulated for was not a medium equally diffused throughout the visible universe such as the ethereal vehicle of the vibrations of light but a rare fluid rapidly increasing in density towards the sun251 this cannot be a solar atmosphere since it is mathematically certain as laplace has shown252 that no envelope partaking of the suns axial rotation can extend farther from his surface than ninetenths of the mean distance of mercury while physical evidence assures us that the actual depth of the solar atmosphere bears a very minute proportion to the possible depth theoretically assigned to it that matter however not atmospheric in its naturethat is neither forming one body with the sun nor altogether ariformexists in its neighbourhood can admit of no reasonable doubt the great lensshaped mass of the zodiacal light stretching out at times far beyond the earths orbit may indeed be regarded as an extension of the corona the streamers of which themselves mark the wide diffusion all round the solar globe of granular or gaseous materials yet comets have been known to penetrate the sphere occupied by them without perceptible loss of velocity the hypothesis then of a resisting medium receives at present no countenance from the movements of comets whether of short or of long periods although enckes comet has made thirtyfive complete rounds of its orbit since its first detection in 1786 it shows no certain signs of decay variations in its brightness are it is true conspicuous but they do not proceed continuously253 the history of the next known planetlike comet has proved of even more curious interest than that of the first it was discovered by an austrian officer named wilhelm von biela at josephstadt in bohemia february 27 1826 and ten days later by the french astronomer gambart at marseilles both observers computed its orbit showed its remarkable similarity to that traversed by comets visible in 1772 and 1805 and connected them together as previous appearances of the body just detected by assigning to its revolutions a period of between six and seven years the two brief letters conveying these strikingly similar inferences were printed side by side in the same number of the astronomische nachrichten no 94 but bielas priority in the discovery of the comet was justly recognised by the bestowal upon it of his name the object in question was at no time subsequently to 1805 visible to the naked eye its aspect in sir john herschels great reflector on the 23rd of september 1832 was described by him as that of a conspicuous nebula nearly 3 minutes in diameter no trace of a tail was discernible while he was engaged in watching it a small knot of minute stars was directly traversed by it and when on the cluster he tells us254 it presented the appearance of a nebula resolvable and partly resolved into stars the stars of the cluster being visible through the comet yet the depth of cometary matter through which such faint stellar rays penetrated undimmed was near the central parts of the globe not less than 50000 miles it is curious to find that this seemingly harmless and we may perhaps add effete body gave occasion to the first and not the last cometary scare of an enlightened century its orbit at the descending node may be said to have intersected that of the earth since according as it bulged in or out under the disturbing influence of the planets the passage of the comet was affected inside or outside the terrestrial track now certain calculations published by olbers in 1828255 showed that on october 29 1832 a considerable portion of its nebulous surroundings would actually sweep over the spot which a month later would be occupied by our planet it needed no more to set the popular imagination in a ferment astronomers after all could not by an alarmed public be held to be infallible their computations it was averred which a trifling oversight would suffice to vitiate exhibited clearly enough the danger but afforded no guarantee of safety from a collision with all the terrific consequences frigidly enumerated by laplace nor did the panic subside until arago formally demonstrated that the earth and the comet could by no possibility approach within less than fifty millions of miles256 the return of the same body in 184546 was marked by an extraordinary circumstance when first seen november 28 it wore its usual aspect of a faint round patch of cosmical fog but on december 19 mr hind noticed that it had become distorted somewhat into the form of a pear and ten days later it had divided into two separate objects this singular duplication was first perceived at new haven in america december 29257 by messrs herrick and bradley and by lieutenant maury at washington january 13 1846 the earliest british observer of the phenomenon noticed by wichmann the same evening at knigsberg was professor challis i see two comets he exclaimed putting his eye to the great equatoreal of the cambridge observatory on the night of january 15 then distrustful of what his senses had told him he called in his judgment to correct their improbable report by resolving one of the dubious objects into a hazy star258 on the 23rd however both were again seen by him in unmistakable cometary shape and until far on in march otto struve caught a final glimpse of the pair on the 16th of april259 continued to be watched with equal curiosity and amazement by astronomers in every part of the northern hemisphere what seneca reproved ephorus for supposing to have taken place in 373 bcwhat pingr blamed kepler for conjecturing in 1618had then actually occurred under the attentive eyes of science in the middle of the nineteenth century at a distance from each other of about twothirds the distance of the moon from the earth the twin comets meantime moved on tranquilly so far at least as their course through the heaven was concerned their extreme lightness or the small amount of matter contained in each could not have received a more signal illustration than by the fact that their revolutions round the sun were performed independently that is to say they travelled side by side without experiencing any appreciable mutual disturbance thus plainly showing that at an interval of only 157250 miles their attractive power was virtually inoperative signs of internal agitation however were not wanting each fragment threw out a short tail in a direction perpendicular to the line joining their centres and each developed a bright nucleus although the original comet had exhibited neither of these signs of cometary vitality a singular interchange of brilliancy was besides observed to take place between the coupled objects each of which alternately outshone and was outshone by the other while an arc of light apparently proceeding from the more lustrous at times bridged the intervening space obviously the gravitational tie rendered powerless by exiguity of matter was here replaced by some other form of mutual action the nature of which can as yet be dealt with only by conjecture once more in august 1852 the double comet returned to the neighbourhood of the sun but under circumstances not the most advantageous for observation indeed the companion was not detected until september 16 when father secchi at rome perceived it to have increased its distance from the originating body to a million and a quarter of miles or about eight times the average interval at the former appearance both vanished shortly afterwards and have never since been seen notwithstanding the eager watch kept for objects of such singular interest and the accurate knowledge of their track supplied by santinis investigations a dangerously near approach to jupiter in 1841 is believed to have occasioned their disruption and the disaggregating process thus started was likely to continue we can scarcely doubt that the fate has overtaken them which newton assigned as the end of all cometary existence diffundi tandem et spargi per coelos universos260 bielas is not the only vanished comet brorsens discovered at kiel in 1846 and observed at four subsequent returns failed unaccountably to become visible in 1890261 yet numerous sentinels were on the alert to surprise its approach along a wellascertained track traversed in five and a half years the object presented from the first a somewhat timeworn aspect it was devoid of tail or any other kind of appendage and the rapid loss of the light acquired during perihelion passage was accompanied by inordinate expansion of an already tenuous globular mass another lost or mislaid comet is one found by de vico at rome august 22 1844 it was expected to return early in 1850 but did not and has never since been seen unless its reappearance as e swifts comet of 1894 should be ratified by closer inquiry262 a telescopic comet with a period of 712 years discovered november 22 1843 by m faye of the paris observatory formed the subject of a characteristically patient and profound inquiry on the part of leverrier designed to test its suggested identity with lexells comet of 1770 the result was decisive against the hypothesis of valz the divergences between the orbits of the two bodies being found to increase instead of to diminish as the history of the newcomer was traced backward into the previous century263 fayes comet pursues the most nearly circular path of any similar known object even at its nearest approach to the sun it remains farther off than mars when he is most distant from it and it was proved by the admirable researches of professor axel mller264 director of the swedish observatory of lund to exhibit no trace of the action of a resisting medium periodical comets are evidently bodies which have each lived through a chapter of accidents and a significant hint as to the nature of their adventures can be gathered from the fact that their aphelia are pretty closely grouped about the tracks of the major planets halleys and five other comets are thus related to neptune three connect themselves with uranus two with saturn above a score with jupiter some form of dependence is plainly indicated and the researches of tisserand265 callandreau266 and newton267 of yale college leave scarcely a doubt that the capturetheory represents the essential truth in the matter the original parabolic paths of these comets were then changed into ellipses by the backward pull of a planet whose sphere of attraction they chanced to enter when approaching the sun from outer space moreover since a body thus affected should necessarily return at each revolution to the scene of encounter the same process of retardation may in some cases have been repeated many times until the more restricted cometary orbits were reduced to their present dimensions the prevalence too among periodical comets of direct motion is shown to be inevitable by m callandreaus demonstration that those travelling in a retrograde direction would by planetary action be thrown outside the probable range of terrestrial observation the scarcity of hyperbolic comets can be similarly explained they would be created whenever the attractive influence of the disturbing planet was exerted in a forward or accelerative sense but could come only by a rare exception to our notice the inner planets including the earth have also unquestionably played their parts in modifying cometary orbits and mr plummer suggests with some show of reason that the capture of enckes comet may be a feat due to mercury268 no great comet appeared between the star which presided at the birth of napoleon and the vintage comet of 1811 the latter was first described by flaugergues at viviers march 26 1811 wisniewski at neutscherkask in southern russia caught a final glimpse of it august 17 1812 two disappearances in the solar rays as the earth moved round in its orbit and two reappearances after conjunction were included in this unprecedentedly long period of visibility of 510 days this relative permanence so far as the inhabitants of europe were concerned was due to the high northern latitude attained near perihelion combined with a certain leisureliness of movement along a path everywhere external to that of the earth the magnificent luminous train of this body on october 15 the day of its nearest terrestrial approach covered an arc of the heavens 2312 degrees in length corresponding to a real extension of one hundred millions of miles its form was described by sir william herschel as that of an inverted hollow cone and its colour as yellowish strongly contrasted with the bluishgreen tint of the head round which it was flung like a transparent veil the planetary disc of the head 127000 miles across appeared to be composed of stronglycondensed nebulous matter but somewhat eccentrically situated within it was a starlike nucleus of a reddish tinge which herschel presumed to be solid and ascertained with his usual care to have a diameter of 428 miles from the total absence of phases as well as from the vivacity of its radiance he confidently inferred that its light was not borrowed but inherent269 this remarkable apparition formed the subject of a memoir by olbers270 the striking yet steadily reasoned out suggestions contained in which there was at that time no means of following up with profit only of late has the electrical theory of which zllner271 regarded olbers as the founder assumed a definite and measurable form capable of being tested by the touchstone of fact as knowledge makes its slow inroads on the fundamental mystery of the physical universe the paraboloidal shape of the bright envelope separated by a dark interval from the head of the great comet of 1811 and constituting as it were the root of its tail seemed to the astronomer of bremen to reveal the presence of a double repulsion the expelled vapours accumulating where the two forces solar and cometary balanced each other and being then swept backwards in a huge train he accordingly distinguished three classes of these bodiesfirst comets which develop no matter subject to solar repulsion these have no tails and are probably mere nebulosities without solid nuclei secondly comets which are acted upon by solar repulsion only and consequently throw out no emanations towards the sun of this kind was a bright comet visible in 1807272 thirdly comets like that of 1811 giving evidence of action of both kinds these are distinguished by a dark hoop encompassing the head and dividing it from the luminous envelope as well as by an obscure caudal axis resulting from the hollow conelike structure of the tail again the ingenious view subsequently propounded by m bredikhin as to the connection between the form of these appendages and the kind of matter composing them was very clearly anticipated by olbers the amount of tailcurvature he pointed out depends in each case upon the proportion borne by the velocity of the ascending particles to that of the comet in its orbit the swifter the outrush the straighter the resulting tail but the velocity of the ascending particles varies with the energy of their repulsion by the sun and this again it may be presumed with their quality thus multiple tails are developed when the same comet throws off as it approaches perihelion specifically distinct substances the long straight ray which proceeded from the comet of 1807 for example was doubtless made up of particles subject to a much more vigorous solar repulsion than those formed into the shorter curved emanation issuing from it nearly in the same direction in the comet of 1811 he calculated that the particles expelled from the head travelled to the remote extremity of the tail in eleven minutes indicating by this enormous rapidity of movement comparable to that of the transmission of light the action of a force much more powerful than the opposing one of gravity the not uncommon phenomena of multiple envelopes on the other hand he explained as due to the varying amounts of repulsion exercised by the nucleus itself on the different kinds of matter developed from it the movements and perturbations of the comet of 1811 were no less profoundly studied by argelander than its physical constitution by olbers the orbit which he assigned to it is of such vast dimensions as to require no less that 3065 years for the completion of its circuit and to carry the body describing it at each revolution to fourteen times the distance from the sun of the frigid neptune thus when it last visited our neighbourhood achilles may have gazed on its imposing train as he lay on the sands all night bewailing the loss of patroclus and when it returns it will perhaps be to shine upon the ruins of empires and civilizations still deep buried among the secrets of the coming time273 on the 26th of june 1819 while the head of a comet passed across the face of the sun the earth was in all probability involved in its tail but of this remarkable double event nothing was known until more than a month later when the fact of its past occurrence emerged from the calculations of olbers274 nor had the comet itself been generally visible previous to the first days of july several observers however on the publication of these results brought forward accounts of singular spots perceived by them upon the sun at the time of the transit and an original drawing of one of them by pastorff of buchholtz has been preserved this undoubtedly authentic delineation275 represents a round nebulous object with a bright spot in the centre of decidedly cometary aspect and not in the least like an ordinary solar macula mr hind276 nevertheless showed its position on the sun to be irreconcilable with that which the comet must have occupied and mr ranyards discovery of a similar smaller drawing by the same author dated may 26 1828277 reduces to evanescence the probability of its connection with that body indeed recent experience renders very doubtful the possibility of such an observation the return of halleys comet in 1835 was looked forward to as an opportunity for testing the truth of floating cometary theories and did not altogether disappoint expectation as early as 1817 its movements and disturbances since 1759 were proposed by the turin academy of sciences as the subject of a prize ultimately awarded to baron damoiseau pontcoulant was adjudged a similar distinction by the paris academy in 1829 while rosenbergers calculations were rewarded with the gold medal of the royal astronomical society278 they were verified by the detection at rome august 6 1835 of a nearly circular misty object not far from the predicted place of the comet it was not however until the middle of september that it began to throw out a tail which by the 15th of october had attained a length of about 24 degrees on the 19th at madras it extended to fully 30279 the head showing to the naked eye as a reddish star rather brighter than aldebaran or antares280 some curious phenomena accompanied the process of tailformation an outrush of luminous matter resembling in shape a partially opened fan issued from the nucleus towards the sun and at a certain point like smoke driven before a high wind was vehemently swept backwards in a prolonged train the appearance of the comet at this time was compared by bessel281 who watched it with minute attention to that of a blazing rocket he made the singular observation that this fan of light which seemed the source of supply for the tail oscillated like a pendulum to and fro across a line joining the sun and nucleus in a period of 435 days and he was unable to escape from the conclusion282 that a repulsive force about twice as powerful as the attractive force of gravity was concerned in the production of these remarkable effects nor did he hesitate to recur to the analogy of magnetic polarity or to declare still more emphatically than olbers the emission of the tail to be a purely electrical phenomenon283 the transformations undergone by this body were almost as strange and complete as those which affected the brigands in dantes inferno when first seen it wore the aspect of a nebula later it put on the distinctive garb of a comet it next appeared as a star finally it dilated first in a spherical then in a paraboloidal form until may 5 1836 when it vanished from herschels observation at feldhausen as if by melting into adjacent space from the excessive diffusion of its light a very uncommon circumstance in its development was that it lost all trace of tail previous to its arrival at perihelion on the 16th of november nor did it begin to recover its elongated shape for more than two months afterwards on the 23rd of january boguslawski perceived it as a star of the sixth magnitude without measurable disc284 only two nights later maclear director of the cape observatory found the head to be 131 seconds across285 and so rapidly did the augmentation of size progress that sir john herschel estimated the actual bulk of this singular object to have increased fortyfold in the ensuing week i can hardly doubt he remarks that the comet was fairly evaporated in perihelio by the heat and resolved into transparent vapour and is now in process of rapid condensation and reprecipitation on the nucleus286 a plausible but no longer admissible interpretation of this still unexplained phenomenon the next return of this body which will be considerably accelerated by jupiters influence is expected to take place in 1910287 by means of an instrument devised to test the quality of light arago obtained decisive evidence that some at least of the radiance proceeding from halleys comet was derived by reflection from the sun288 indications of the same kind had been afforded289 by the comet which suddenly appeared above the northwestern horizon of paris july 3 1819 after having enveloped as already stated our terrestrial abode in its filmy appendages but the polariscope had not then reached the perfection subsequently given to it and its testimony was accordingly far less reliable than in 1835 such experiments however are in reality more beautiful and ingenious than instructive since ignited as well as obscure bodies possess the power of throwing back light incident upon them and will consequently transmit to us from the neighbourhood of the sun rays partly direct partly reflected of which a certain proportion will exhibit the peculiarity known as polarisation the most brilliant comets of the century were suddenly rivalled if not surpassed by the extraordinary object which blazed out beside the sun february 28 1843 it was simultaneously perceived in mexico and the united states in southern europe and at sea off the cape of good hope where the passengers on board the owen glendower were amazed by the sight of a short daggerlike object closely following the sun towards the western horizon290 at florence amici found its distance from the suns centre at noon to be only 1 23 and spectators at parma were able when sheltered from the direct glare of midday to trace the tail to a length of four or five degrees the full dimensions of this astonishing appurtenance began to be disclosed a few days later on the 3rd of march it measured 25 and on the 11th at calcutta mr clerihew observed a second streamer nearly twice as long as the first and making an angle with it of 18 to have been emitted in a single day this rapidity of projection sir john herschel remarked conveys an astounding impression of the intensity of the forces at work it is clear he continued that if we have to deal here with matter such as we conceive itviz possessing inertiaat all it must be under the dominion of forces incomparably more energetic than gravitation and quite of a different nature291 on the 17th of march a silvery ray some 40 long and slightly curved at its extremity shone out above the sunset clouds in this country no previous intimation had been received of the possibility of such an apparition and even astronomersno lightning messages across the seas being as yet possiblewere perplexed the nature of the phenomenon indeed soon became evident but the wonder of it did not diminish with the study of its attendant circumstances never before within astronomical memory had our system been traversed by a body pursuing such an adventurous career the closest analogy was offered by the great comet of 1680 newtons which rushed past the sun at a distance of only 144000 miles but even thison the cosmical scalescarcely perceptible interval was reduced nearly onehalf in the case we are now concerned with the centre of the comet of 1843 approached the formidable luminary within 78000 miles leaving it is estimated a clear space of not more than 32000 between the surfaces of the bodies brought into such perilous proximity the escape of the wanderer was however secured by the extraordinary rapidity of its flight it swept past perihelion at a rate366 miles a secondwhich if continued would have carried it right round the sun in two hours and in only eleven minutes more than that short period it actually described half the curvature of its orbitan arc of 180although in travelling over the remaining half many hundreds of sluggish years will doubtless be consumed the behaviour of this comet may be regarded as an experimentum crucis as to the nature of tails for clearly no fixed appendage many millions of miles in length could be whirled like a brandished sabre from one side of the sun to the other in 131 minutes cometary trains are then as olbers rightly conceived them to be emanations not appendagesinconceivably rapid outflows of highly rarefied matter the greater part if not all of which becomes permanently detached from the nucleus that of the comet of 1843 reached about the time that it became visible in this country the extravagant length of 200 millions of miles292 it was narrow and bounded by nearly parallel and nearly rectilinear lines resemblingto borrow a comparison of aristotlesa road through the constellations and after the 3rd of march showed no trace of hollowness the axis being in fact rather brighter than the edges distinctly perceptible in it were those singular auroralike coruscations which gave to the tresses of charles vs comet the appearanceas cardan described itof a torch agitated by the wind and have not unfrequently been observed to characterise other similar objects a consideration first adverted to by olbers proves these to originate in our own atmosphere for owing to the great difference in the distances from the earth of the origin and extremity of such vast effluxes the light proceeding from their various parts is transmitted to our eyes in notably different intervals of time consequently a luminous undulation even though propagated instantaneously from end to end of a comets tail would appear to us to occupy many minutes in its progress but the coruscations in question pass as swiftly as a falling star they are then of terrestrial production periods of the utmost variety were by different computators assigned to the body which arrived at perihelion february 27 1843 at 947 pm professor hubbard of washington found that it required 533 years to complete a revolution mm laugier and mauvais of paris considered the true term to be 35293 clausen looked for its return at the end of between six and seven a recent discussion294 by professor kreutz of all the available data gives a probable period of 512 years for this body and precludes its hypothetical identity with the comet of 1668 known as the spina of cassini it may now be asked what were the conclusions regarding the nature of comets drawn by astronomers from the considerable amount of novel experience accumulated during the first half of this century the first and best assured was that the matter composing them is in a state of extreme tenuity numerous and trustworthy observations showed that the feeblest rays of light might traverse some hundreds of thousands of miles of their substance even where it was apparently most condensed without being perceptibly weakened nay instances were recorded in which stars were said to have gained in brightness from the process295 on the 24th of june 1825 olbers296 saw the comet then visible all but obliterated by the central passage of a star too small to be distinguished with the naked eye its own light remaining wholly unchanged a similar effect was noted december 1 1811 when the great comet of that year approached so close to altair the lucida of the eagle that the star seemed to be transformed into the nucleus of the comet297 even the central blaze of halleys comet in 1835 was powerless to impede the passage of stellar rays struve298 observed at dorpat on september 17 an all but central occultation glaisher299 one so far as he could ascertain absolutely so eight days later at cambridge in neither case was there any appreciable diminution of the stars light again on the 11th of october 1847 mr dawes300 an exceptionally keen observer distinctly saw a star of the tenth magnitude through the exact centre of a comet discovered on the first of that month by maria mitchell of nantucket examples on the other hand are not wanting of the diminution of stellar light under similar circumstances301 and we meet two alleged instances of the vanishing of a star behind a comet wartmann of geneva observed the first november 28 1828302 but his instrument was defective and the eclipsing body enckes comet has shown itself otherwise perfectly translucent the second case of occultation occurred september 13 1890 when an eleventh magnitude star was stated to have completely disappeared during the transit over it of dennings comet303 from the failure to detect any effects of refraction in the light of stars occulted by comets it was inferred though as we know now erroneously that their composition is rather that of dust than that of vapour that they consist not of any continuous substance but of discrete solid particles very finely divided and widely scattered in conformity with this view was the known smallness of their masses laplace had shown that if the amount of matter forming lexells comet had been as much as 15000 of that contained in our globe the effect of its attraction on the occasion of its approach within 1438000 miles of the earth july 1 1770 must have been apparent in the lengthening of the year and that some comets at any rate possess masses immeasurably below this maximum value was clearly proved by the undisturbed parallel march of the two fragments of bielas in 1846 but the discovery in this branch most distinctive of the period under review is that of short period comets of which four304 were known in 1850 these by the character of their movements serve as a link between the planetary and cometary worlds and by the nature of their construction seem to mark a stage in cometary decay for that comets are rather transitory agglomerations than permanent products of cosmical manufacture appeared to be demonstrated by the division and disappearance of one amongst their number as well as by the singular and rapid changes in appearance undergone by many and the seemingly irrevocable diffusion of their substance visible in nearly all they might then be defined according to the ideas respecting them prevalent fifty years ago as bodies unconnected by origin with the solar system but encountered and to some extent appropriated by it in its progress through space owing their visibility in great part if not altogether to light reflected from the sun and their singular and striking forms to the action of repulsive forces emanating from him the penalty of their evanescent splendour being paid in gradual waste and final dissipation and extinction footnotes

curiosity as to the means by which such surpassing results have been secured indeed the bare acquaintance with what has been achieved without any corresponding knowledge of how it has been achieved supplies food for barren wonder rather than for fruitful and profitable thought ideas advance most readily along the solid ground of practical reality and often find true sublimity while laying aside empty marvels progress is the result not so much of sudden flights of genius as of sustained patient often commonplace endeavour and the true lesson of scientific history lies in the close connection which it discloses between the most brilliant developments of knowledge and the faithful accomplishment of his daily task by each individual thinker and worker it would be easy to fill a volume with the detailed account of the long succession of optical and mechanical improvements by means of which the observation of the heavens has been brought to its present degree of perfection but we must here content ourselves with a summary sketch of the chief amongst them the first place in our consideration is naturally claimed by the telescope this marvellous instrument we need hardly remind our readers is of two distinct kindsthat in which light is gathered together into a focus by refraction and that in which the same end is attained by reflection the image formed is in each case viewed through a magnifying lens or combination of lenses called the eyepiece not for above a century after the optic glasses invented or stumbled upon by the spectaclemaker of middelburg 1608 had become diffused over europe did the reflecting telescope come even in england the place of its birth into general use its principle a sufficiently obvious one had indeed been suggested by mersenne as early as 1639305 james gregory in 1663306 described in detail a mode of embodying that principle in a practical shape and newton adopting an original system of construction actually produced in 1668 a tiny speculum one inch across by means of which the apparent distance of objects was reduced thirtynine times nevertheless the exorbitantly long tubeless refractors introduced by huygens maintained their reputation until hadley exhibited to the royal society january 12 1721307 a reflector of six inches aperture and sixtytwo in focal length which rivalled in performance and of course indefinitely surpassed in manageability one of the aerial kind of 123 feet the concavemirror system now gained a decided ascendant and was brought to unexampled perfection by james short of edinburgh during the years 173268 its resources were however first fully developed by william herschel the energy and inventiveness of this extraordinary man marked an epoch wherever they were applied his ardent desire to measure and gauge the stupendous array of worlds which his specula revealed to him made him continually intent upon adding to their spacepenetrating power by increasing their lightgathering surface these as he was the first to explain308 are in a constant proportion one to the other for a telescope with twice the linear aperture of another will collect four times as much light and will consequently disclose an object four times as faint as could be seen with the first or what comes to the same an object equally bright at twice the distance in other words it will possess double the spacepenetrating power of the smaller instrument herschels great mirrorsthe first examples of the giant telescopes of modern timeswere then primarily engines for extending the bounds of the visible universe and from the sublimity of this final cause was derived the vivid enthusiasm which animated his efforts to success it seems probable that the sevenfoot telescope constructed by him in 1775that is within little more than a year after his experiments in shaping and polishing metal had begunalready exceeded in effective power any work by an earlier optician and both his skill and his ambition rapidly developed his efforts culminated after mirrors of ten twenty and thirty feet focal length had successively left his hands in the gigantic fortyfoot completed august 28 1789 it was the first reflector in which only a single mirror was employed in the gregorian form the focussed rays are by a second reflection from a small concave309 mirror thrown straight back through a central aperture in the larger one behind which the eyepiece is fixed the object under examination is thus seen in the natural direction the newtonian on the other hand shows the object in a line of sight at right angles to the true one the light collected by the speculum being diverted to one side of the tube by the interposition of a small plane mirror situated at an angle of 45 to the axis of the instrument upon these two systems herschel worked until 1787 when becoming convinced of the supreme importance of economising light necessarily wasted by the second reflection he laid aside the small mirror of his fortyfoot then in course of construction and turned it into a frontview reflector this was doneaccording to the plan proposed by lemaire in 1732by slightly inclining the speculum so as to enable the image formed by it to be viewed with an eyeglass fixed at the upper margin of the tube the observer thus stood with his back turned to the object he was engaged in scrutinising the advantages of the increased brilliancy afforded by this modification were strikingly illustrated by the discovery august 28 and september 17 1789 of the two saturnian satellites nearest the ring nevertheless the monster telescope of slough cannot be said to have realised the sanguine expectations of its constructor the occasions on which it could be usefully employed were found to be extremely rare it was injuriously affected by every change of temperature the great weight 25 cwt of a speculum four feet in diameter rendered it peculiarly liable to distortion with all imaginable care the delicate lustre of its surface could not be preserved longer than two years310 when the difficult process of repolishing had to be undertaken it was accordingly never used after 1811 when having gone blind from damp it lapsed by degrees into the condition of a museum inmate the exceedingly high magnifying powers employed by herschel constituted a novelty in optical astronomy to which he attached great importance the work of ordinary observation would however be hindered rather than helped by them the attempt to increase in this manner the efficacy of the telescope is speedily checked by atmospheric to say nothing of other difficulties precisely in the same proportion as an object is magnified the disturbances of the medium through which it is seen are magnified also even on the clearest and most tranquil nights the air is never for a moment really still the rays of light traversing it are continually broken by minute fluctuations of refractive power caused by changes of temperature and pressure and the currents which these engender with such luminous quiverings and waverings the astronomer has always more or less to reckon their absence is simply a question of degree if sufficiently magnified they are at all times capable of rendering observation impossible thus such powers as 3000 4000 5000 even 6652311 which herschel now and again applied to his great telescopes must save on the rarest occasions prove an impediment rather than an aid to vision they were however used by him only for special purposes experimentally not systematically and with the clearest discrimination of their advantages and drawbacks it is obvious that perfectly different ends are subserved by increasing the aperture and by increasing the power of a telescope in the one case a larger quantity of light is captured and concentrated in the other the same amount is distributed over a wider area a diminution of brilliancy in the image accordingly attends coeteris paribus upon each augmentation of its apparent size for this reason such faint objects as nebul are most successfully observed with moderate powers applied to instruments of a great capacity for light the details of their structure actually disappearing when highly magnified with stellar groups the reverse is the case stars cannot be magnified simply because they are too remote to have any sensible dimensions but the space between them can it was thus for the purpose of dividing very close double stars that herschel increased to such an unprecedented extent the magnifying capabilities of his instruments and to this improvement incidentally the discovery of uranus march 13 1781312 was due for by the examination with strong lenses of an object which even with a power of 227 presented a suspicious appearance he was able at once to pronounce its disc to be real not merely spurious and so to distinguish it unerringly from the crowd of stars amidst which it was moving while the reflecting telescope was astonishing the world by its rapid development in the hands of herschel its unpretending rival was slowly making its way towards the position which the future had in store for it the great obstacle which long stood in the way of the improvement of refractors was the defect known as chromatic aberration this is due to no other cause than that which produces the rainbow and the spectrumthe separation or dispersion in their passage through a refracting medium of the variously coloured rays composing a beam of white light in an ordinary lens there is no common point of concentration each colour has its own separate focus and the resulting image formed by the superposition of as many images as there are hues in the spectrum is indefinitely terminated with a tinted border eminently baffling to exactness of observation the extravagantly long telescopes of the seventeenth century were designed to avoid this evil as well as another source of indistinct vision in the spherical shape of lenses but no attempt to remedy it was made until an essex gentleman succeeded in 1733 in so combining lenses of flint and crown glass as to produce refraction without colour313 mr chester more hall was however equally indifferent to fame and profit and took no pains to make his invention public the effective discovery of the achromatic telescope was accordingly reserved for john dollond whose method of correcting at the same time chromatic and spherical aberration was laid before the royal society in 1758 modern astronomy may be said to have been thereby rendered possible refractors have always been found better suited than reflectors to the ordinary work of observatories they are so to speak of a more robust as well as of a more plastic nature they suffer less from vicissitudes of temperature and climate they retain their efficiency with fewer precautions and under more trying circumstances above all they cooperate more readily with mechanical appliances and lend themselves with far greater facility to purposes of exact measurement a practical difficulty however impeded the realisation of the brilliant prospects held out by dollonds invention it was found impossible to procure flintglass such as was needed for optical usethat is of perfectly homogeneous qualityexcept in fragments of insignificant size discs of more than two or three inches in diameter were of extreme rarity and the crushing excise duty imposed upon the article by the financial unwisdom of the government both limited its production and by rendering experiments too costly for repetition barred its improvement up to this time great britain had left foreign competitors far behind in the instrumental department of astronomy the quadrants and circles of bird cary and ramsden were unapproached abroad the reflecting telescope came into existence and reached maturity on british soil the refracting telescope was cured of its inherent vices by british ingenuity but with the opening of the nineteenth century the almost unbroken monopoly of skill and contrivance which our countrymen had succeeded in establishing was invaded and british workmen had to be content to exchange a position of supremacy for one of at least partial temporary inferiority somewhat about the time that herschel set about polishing his first speculum pierre louis guinand a swiss artisan living near chauxdefonds in the canton of neuchtel began to grind spectacles for his own use and was thence led on to the rude construction of telescopes by fixing lenses in pasteboard tubes the sight of an england achromatic stirred a higher ambition and he took the first opportunity of procuring some flint glass from england then the only source of supply with the design of imitating an instrument the full capabilities of which he was destined to be the humble means of developing the english glass proving of inferior quality he conceived the possibility unaided and ignorant of the art as he was of himself making better and spent seven years 178490 in fruitless experiments directed to that end failure only stimulated him to enlarge their scale he bought some land near les brenets constructed upon it a furnace capable of melting two quintals of glass and reducing himself and his family to the barest necessaries of life he poured his earnings he at this time made bells for repeaters unstintingly into his crucibles314 his undaunted resolution triumphed in 1799 he carried to paris and there showed to lalande several discs of flawless crystal four to six inches in diameter lalande advised him to keep his secret but in 1805 he was induced to remove to munich where he became the instructor of the immortal fraunhofer his return to les brenets in 1814 was signalised by the discovery of an ingenious mode of removing striated portions of glass by breaking and resoldering the product of each melting and he eventually attained to the manufacture of perfect discs up to 18 inches in diameter an objectglass for which he had furnished the material to cauchoix procured him in 1823 a royal invitation to settle in paris but he was no longer equal to the change and died at the scene of his labours february 13 following this same lens 12 inches across was afterwards purchased by sir james south and the first observation made with it february 13 1830 disclosed to sir john herschel the sixth minute star in the central group of the orion nebula known as the trapezium315 bequeathed by south to trinity college dublin it was employed at the dunsink observatory by brnnow and ball in their investigations of stellar parallax a still larger objective of nearly 14 inches made of guinands glass was secured in paris about the same time by mr edward cooper of markree castle ireland the peculiarity of the method discovered at les brenets resided in the manipulation not in the quality of the ingredients the secret that is to say was not chemical but mechanical316 it was communicated by henry guinand a son of the inventor to bontemps one of the directors of the glassworks at choisyleroi and by him transmitted to messrs chance of birmingham with whom he entered into partnership when the revolutionary troubles of 1848 obliged him to quit his native country the celebrated american opticians alvan clark sons derived from the birmingham firm the materials for some of their early telescopes notably the 19inch chicago and 26inch washington equatoreals but the discs for the great lick refractor and others shaped by them in recent years have been supplied by feil of paris two distinguished amateurs meanwhile were preparing to reassert on behalf of reflecting instruments their claim to the place of honour in the van of astronomical discovery of mr lassells specula something has already been said317 they were composed of an alloy of copper and tin with a minute proportion of arsenic after the example of newton318 and were remarkable for perfection of figure and brilliancy of surface the capabilities of the newtonian plan were developed still more fullyit might almost be said to the uttermostby the enterprise of an irish nobleman william parsons known as lord oxmantown until 1841 when on his fathers death he succeeded to the title of earl of rosse was born at york june 17 1800 his public duties began before his education was completed he was returned to parliament as member for kings county while still an undergraduate at oxford and continued to represent the same constituency for thirteen years 182134 from 1845 until his death which took place october 31 1867 he sat silent but assiduous in the house of lords as an irish representative peer he held the not unlaborious post of president of the royal society from 1849 to 1854 presided over the meeting of the british association at cork in 1843 and was elected vicechancellor of dublin university in 1862 in addition to these extensive demands upon his time and thoughts were those derived from his position as practically the feudal chief of a large body of tenantry in times of great and anxious responsibility to say nothing of the more genial claims of an unstinted hospitality yet while neglecting no public or private duty this model nobleman found leisure to render to science services so conspicuous as to entitle his name to a lasting place in its annals he early formed the design of reaching the limits of the attainable in enlarging the powers of the telescope and the qualities of his mind conspired with the circumstances of his fortune to render the design a feasible one from refractors it was obvious that no such vast and rapid advance could be expected english glassmanufacture was still in a backward state so late as 1839 simms successor to the distinguished instrumentalist edward troughton reported a specimen of crystal scarcely 712 inches in diameter and perfect only over six to be unique in the history of english glassmaking319 yet at that time the fifteeninch achromatic of pulkowa had already left the workshop of fraunhofers successors at munich it was not indeed until 1845 when the impost which had so long hampered their efforts was removed that the optical artists of these islands were able to compete on equal terms with their rivals on the continent in the case of reflectors however there seemed no insurmountable obstacle to an almost unlimited increase of lightgathering capacity and it was here after some unproductive experiments with fluid lenses that lord oxmantown concentrated his energies he had to rely entirely on his own invention and to earn his own experience james short had solved the problem of giving to metallic surfaces a perfect parabolic figure the only one by which parallel incident rays can be brought to an exact focus but so jealous was he of his secret that he caused all his tools to be burnt before his death320 nor was anything known of the processes by which herschel had achieved his astonishing results moreover lord oxmantown had no skilled workmen to assist him his implements both animate and inanimate had to be formed by himself peasants taken from the plough were educated by him into efficient mechanics and engineers the delicate and complex machinery needed in operations of such hairbreadth nicety as his enterprise involved the steamengine which was to set it in motion at times the very crucibles in which his specula were cast issued from his own workshops in 1827 experiments on the composition of speculummetal were set on foot and the first polishingmachine ever driven by steampower was contrived in 1828 but twelve arduous years of struggle with recurring difficulties passed before success began to dawn a material less tractable than the alloy selected of four chemical equivalents of copper to one of tin321 can scarcely be conceived it is harder than steel yet brittle as glass crumbling into fragments with the slightest inadvertence of handling or treatment322 and the precision of figure requisite to secure good definition is almost beyond the power of language to convey the quantities involved are so small as not alone to elude sight but to confound imagination sir john herschel tells us that the total thickness to be abraded from the edge of a spherical speculum 48 inches in diameter and 40 feet focus to convert it into a paraboloid is only 121333 of an inch323 yet upon this minute difference of form depends the clearness of the image and as a consequence the entire efficiency of the instrument almost infinite indeed in the phrase of the late dr robinson must be the exactitude of the operation adapted to bring about so delicate a result at length in 1839 two specula each three feet in diameter were turned out in such perfection as to prompt a still bolder experiment the various processes needed to insure success were now ascertained and under control all that was necessary was to repeat them on a larger scale a gigantic mirror six feet across and fiftyfour in focal length was accordingly cast on the 13th of april 1842 in two months it was ground down to figure by abrasion with emery and water and daintily polished with rouge and by the month of february 1845 the leviathan of parsonstown was available for the examination of the heavens the suitable mounting of this vast machine was a problem scarcely less difficult than its construction the shape of a speculum needs to be maintained with an elaborate care equal to that used in imparting it in fact one of the most formidable obstacles to increasing the size of such reflecting surfaces consists in their liability to bend under their own weight that of the great rosse speculum was no less than four tons yet although six inches in thickness and composed of a material only a degree inferior in rigidity to wrought iron the strong pressure of a mans hand at its back produced sufficient flexure to distort perceptibly the image of a star reflected in it324 thus the delicacy of its form was perishable equally by the stress of its own gravity and by the slightest irregularity in the means taken to counteract that stress the problem of affording a perfectly equable support in all possible positions was solved by resting the speculum upon twentyseven platforms of cast iron feltcovered and carefully fitted to the shape of the areas they were to carry which platforms were themselves borne by a complex system of triangles and levers ingeniously adapted to distribute the weight with complete uniformity325 a tube which resembled when erect one of the ancient round towers of ireland326 served as the habitation of the great mirror it was constructed of deal staves bound together with iron hoops was fiftyeight feet long including the speculumbox and seven in diameter a reasonably tall man may walk through it as dean peacock once did with umbrella uplifted two piers of solid masonry about fifty feet high seventy long and twentythree apart flanked the huge engine on either side its lower extremity rested on a universal joint of cast iron above it was slung in chains and even in a gale of wind remained perfectly steady the weight of the entire although amounting to fifteen tons was so skilfully counterpoised that the tube could with ease be raised or depressed by two men working a windlass its horizontal range was limited by the lofty walls erected for its support to about ten degrees on each side of the meridian but it moved vertically from near the horizon through the zenith as far as the pole its construction was of the newtonian kind the observer looking into the side of the tube near its upper end which a series of galleries and sliding stages enabled him to reach in any position it has also though rarely been used without a second mirror as a herschelian reflector the splendour of the celestial objects as viewed with this vast lightgrasper surpassed all expectation never in my life exclaimed sir james south did i see such glorious sidereal pictures327 the orb of jupiter produced an effect compared to that of the introduction of a coachlamp into the telescope328 and certain starclusters exhibited an appearance we again quote sir james south such as man before had never seen and which for its magnificence baffles all description but it was in the examination of the nebul that the superiority of the new instrument was most strikingly displayed a large number of these misty objects which the utmost powers of herschels specula had failed to resolve into stars yielded at once to the parsonstown reflector while many others showed under entirely changed forms through the disclosure of previously unseen details of structure one extremely curious result of the increase of light was the abolition of any sharp distinction between the two classes of annular and planetary nebul up to that time only four ringshaped systemstwo in the northern and two in the southern hemispherewere known to astronomers they were now reinforced by five of the planetary kind the discs of which were observed to be centrally perforated while the definite margins visible in weaker instruments were replaced by ragged edges or filamentous fringes still more striking was the discovery of an entirely new and most remarkable species of nebul these were termed spiral from the more or less regular convolutions resembling the whorls of a shell in which the matter composing them appeared to be distributed the first and most conspicuous specimen of this class was met with in april 1845 it is situated in canes venatici close to the tail of the great bear and wore in sir j herschels instruments the aspect of a split ring encompassing a bright nucleus thus presenting as he supposed a complete analogue to the system of the milky way in the rosse mirror it shone out as a vast whirlpool of lighta stupendous witness to the presence of cosmical activities on the grandest scale yet regulated by laws as to the nature of which we are profoundly ignorant professor stephen alexander of new jersey however concluded from an investigation necessarily founded on highly precarious data of the mechanical condition of these extraordinary agglomerations that we see in them the partially scattered fragments of enormous masses once rotating in a state of dynamical equilibrium he further suggested that the separation of these fragments may still be in progress329 and traced back their origin to the disruption through its own continually accelerated rotation of a primitive spheroid of inconceivably vast dimensions such also it was added the curvilinear form of certain outliers of the milky way giving evidence of a spiral structure is probably the history of our own cluster the stars composing which no longer held together in a delicately adjusted system like that of the sun and planets are advancing through a period of seeming confusion towards an appointed goal of higher order and more perfect and harmonious adaptation330 the class of spiral nebul included in 1850 fourteen members besides several in which the characteristic arrangement seemed partial or dubious331 a tendency in the exterior stars of other clusters to gather into curved branches as in our galaxy was likewise noted and the existence of unsuspected analogies was proclaimed by the significant combination in the owl nebula a large planetary in ursa major332 of the twisted forms of a spiral with the perforated effect distinctive of an annular nebula once more by the achievements of the parsonstown reflector the supposition of a shining fluid filling vast regions of space was brought into as it has since proved undeserved discredit although lord rosse himself rejected the inference that because many nebul had been resolved all were resolvable very few imitated his truly scientific caution and the results of bonds investigations333 with the harvard college refractor quickened and strengthened the current of prevalent opinion it is now certain that the evidence furnished on both sides of the atlantic as to the stellar composition of some conspicuous objects of this class notably the orion and dumbbell nebul was delusive but the spectroscope alone was capable of meeting it with a categorical denial meanwhile there seemed good ground for the persuasion which now for the last time gained the upper hand that nebul are without exception true islanduniverses or assemblages of distant suns lord rosses telescope possesses a nominal power of 6000that is it shows the moon as if viewed with the naked eye at a distance of forty miles but this seeming advantage is neutralised by the weakening of the available light through excessive diffusion as well as by the troubles of the surging sea of air through which the observation must necessarily be made professor newcomb in fact doubts whether with any telescope our satellite has ever been seen to such advantage as it would be if brought within 500 miles of the unarmed eye334 the french opticians rule of doubling the number of millimetres contained in the aperture of an instrument to find the highest magnifying power usually applicable to it would give 3600 as the maximum for the leviathan of birr castle but in a climate like that of ireland the occasions must be rare when even that limit can be reached indeed the experience acquired by its use plainly shows that atmospheric rather than mechanical difficulties impede a still further increase of telescopic power its construction may accordingly be said to mark the ne plus ultra of effort in one direction and the beginning of its conversion towards another it became thenceforward more and more obvious that the conditions of observation must be ameliorated before any added efficacy could be given to it the full effect of an uncertain climate in nullifying optical improvements was recognised and the attention of astronomers began to be turned towards the advantages offered by more tranquil and more translucent skies scarcely less important for the practical uses of astronomy than the optical qualities of the telescope is the manner of its mounting the most admirable performance of the optician can render but unsatisfactory service if its mechanical accessories are illarranged or inconvenient thus the astronomer is ultimately dependent upon the mechanician and so excellently have his needs been served that the history of the ingenious contrivances by which discoveries have been prepared would supply a subject here barely glanced at not far inferior in extent and instruction to the history of those discoveries themselves there are two chief modes of using the telescope to which all others may be considered subordinate335 either it may be invariably directed towards the south with no motion save in the plane of the meridian so as to intercept the heavenly bodies at the moment of transit across that plain or it may be arranged so as to follow the daily revolution of the sky thus keeping the object viewed permanently in sight instead of simply noting the instant of its flitting across the telescopic field the first plan is that of the transit instrument the second that of the equatoreal both were by a remarkable coincidence introduced about 1690336 by olaus rmer the brilliant danish astronomer who first measured the velocity of light the uses of each are entirely different with the transit the really fundamental task of astronomythe determination of the movements of the heavenly bodiesis mainly accomplished while the investigation of their nature and peculiarities is best conducted with the equatoreal one is the instrument of mathematical the other of descriptive astronomy one furnishes the materials with which theories are constructed and the tests by which they are corrected the other registers new facts takes note of new appearances sounds the depths and peers into every nook of the heavens the great improvement of giving to a telescope equatoreally mounted an automatic movement by connecting it with clockwork was proposed in 1674 by robert hooke bradley in 1721 actually observed mars with a telescope moved by a machine that made it keep pace with the stars337 and von zach relates338 that he had once followed sirius for twelve hours with a heliostat of ramsdens construction but these eighteenthcentury attempts were of no practical effect movement by clockwork was virtually a complete novelty when it was adopted by fraunhofer in 1824 to the dorpat refractor by simply giving to an axis unvaryingly directed towards the celestial pole an equable rotation with a period of twentyfour hours a telescope attached to it and pointed in any direction will trace out on the sky a parallel of declination thus necessarily accompanying the movement of any star upon which it may be fixed it accordingly forms part of the large sum of fraunhofers merits to have secured this inestimable advantage to observers sir john herschel considered that lassells application of equatoreal mounting to a nineinch newtonian in 1840 made an epoch in the history of that eminently british instrument the reflecting telescope339 nearly a century earlier340 it is true short had fitted one of his gregorians to a complicated system of circles in such a manner that by moving a handle it could be made to follow the revolution of the sky but the arrangement did not obtain nor did it deserve general adoption lassells plan was a totally different one he employed the crossed axes of the true equatoreal and his success removed to a great extent the fatal objection of inconvenience in use until then unanswerably urged against reflectors the very largest of these can now be mounted equatoreally even the rosse within its limited range has been for some years provided with a movement by clockwork along declinationparallels the art of accurately dividing circular arcs into the minute equal parts which serve as the units of astronomical measurement remained during the whole of the eighteenth century almost exclusively in english hands it was brought to a high degree of perfection by graham bird and ramsden all of whom however gave the preference to the oldfashioned mural quadrant and zenithsector over the entire circle which rmer had already found the advantage of employing the fivefoot vertical circle which piazzi with some difficulty induced ramsden to complete for him in 1789 was the first divided instrument constructed in what may be called the modern style it was provided with magnifiers for reading off the divisions one of the neglected improvements of rmer and was set up above a smaller horizontal circle forming an altitude and azimuth combination again rmers invention by which both the elevation of a celestial object above the horizon and its position as referred to the horizon could be measured in the same year borda invented the repeating circle the principle of which had been suggested by tobias mayer in 1756341 a device for exterminating so far as possible errors of graduation by repeating an observation with different parts of the limb this was perhaps the earliest systematic effort to correct the imperfections of instruments by the manner of their use the manufacture of astronomical circles was brought to a very refined state of excellence early in the nineteenth century by reichenbach at munich and after 1818 by repsold at hamburg bessel states342 that the readingoff on an instrument of the kind by the latter artist was accurate to about 180th of a human hair meanwhile the traditional reputation of the english school was fully sustained and sir george airy did not hesitate to express his opinion that the new method of graduating circles published by troughton in 1809343 was the greatest improvement ever made in the art of instrumentmaking344 but a more secure road to improvement than that of mere mechanical exactness was pointed out by bessel his introduction of a regular theory of instrumental errors might almost be said to have created a new art of observation every instrument he declared in memorable words345 must be twice madeonce by the artist and again by the observer knowledge is power defects that are ascertained and can be allowed for are as good as nonexistent thus the truism that the best instrument is worthless in the hands of a careless or clumsy observer became supplemented by the converse maxim that defective appliances may through skilful use be made to yield valuable results the knigsberg observationsof which the first instalment was published in 1815set the example of regular reduction for instrumental errors since then it has become an elementary part of an astronomers duty to study the idiosyncrasy of each one of the mechanical contrivances at his disposal in order that its inevitable but now certified deviations from ideal accuracy may be included amongst the numerous corrections by which the pure essence of even approximate truth is distilled from the rude impressions of sense nor is this enough for the casual circumstances attending each observation have to be taken into account with no less care than the inherent or constitutional peculiarities of the instrument with which it is made there is no once for all in astronomy vigilance can never sleep patience can never tire variable as well as constant sources of error must be anxiously heeded one infinitesimal inaccuracy must be weighed against another all the forces and vicissitudes of naturefrosts dews winds the interchanges of heat the disturbing effects of gravity the shiverings of the air the tremors of the earth the weight and vital warmth of the observers own body nay the rate at which his brain receives and transmits its impressions must all enter into his calculations and be sifted out from his results it was in 1823 that bessel drew attention to discrepancies in the times of transits given by different astronomers346 the quantities involved were far from insignificant he was himself nearly a second in advance of all his contemporaries argelander lagging behind him as much as a second and a quarter each individual in fact was found to have a certain definite rate of perception which under the name of personal equation now forms so important an element in the correction of observations that a special instrument for accurately determining its amount in each case is in actual use at greenwich such are the refinements upon which modern astronomy depends for its progress it is a science of hairbreadths and fractions of a second it exists only by the rigid enforcement of arduous accuracy and unwearying diligence whatever secrets the universe still has in store for man will only be communicated on these terms they are it must be acknowledged difficult to comply with they involve an unceasing struggle

dessau elated with the hope of speedily delivering himself from the hereditary incubus of an apothecarys shop347 obtained from munich a small telescope and began to observe the sun his choice of an object for his researches was instigated by his friend harding of gttingen it was a peculiarly happy one the changes visible in the solar surface were then generally regarded as no less capricious than the changes in the skies of our temperate regions consequently the reckoning and registering of sunspots was a task hardly more inviting to an astronomer than the reckoning and registering of summer clouds cassini keill lemonnier lalande were unanimous in declaring that no trace of regularity could be detected in their appearances or effacements348 delambre pronounced them more curious than really useful349 even herschel profoundly as he studied them and intimately as he was convinced of their importance as symptoms of solar activity saw no reason to suspect that their abundance and scarcity were subject to orderly alternation one man alone in the eighteenth century christian horrebow of copenhagen divined their periodical character and foresaw the time when the effects of the suns vicissitudes upon the globes revolving round him might be investigated with success but this prophetic utterance was of the nature of a soliloquy rather than of a communication and remained hidden away in an unpublished journal until 1859 when it was brought to light in a general ransacking of archives350 indeed schwabe himself was far from anticipating the discovery which fell to his share he compared his fortune to that of saul who seeking his fathers asses found a kingdom351 for the hope which inspired his early resolution lay in quite another direction his patient ambush was laid for a possible intramercurial planet which he thought must sooner or later betray its existence in crossing the face of the sun he took however the most effectual measures to secure whatever new knowledge might be accessible during fortythree years his imperturbable telescope352 never failed weather and health permitting to bring in its daily report as to how many or if any spots were visible on the suns disc the information obtained being day by day recorded on a simple and unvarying system in 1843 he made his first announcement of a probable decennial period353 but it met with no general attention although julius schmidt of bonn afterwards director of the athens observatory and gautier of geneva were impressed with his figures and littrow had himself in 1836354 hinted at the likelihood of some kind of regular recurrence schwabe however worked on gathering each year fresh evidence of a law such as he had indicated and when humboldt published in 1851 in the third volume of his kosmos355 a table of the sunspot statistics collected by him from 1826 downwards the strength of his case was perceived with so to speak a start of surprise the reality and importance of the discovery were simultaneously recognised and the persevering hofrath of dessau found himself famous among astronomers his meritrecognised by the bestowal of the astronomical societys gold medal in 1857consisted in his choice of an original and appropriate line of work and in the admirable tenacity of purpose with which he pursued it his resources and acquirements were those of an ordinary amateur he was distinguished solely by the unfortunately rare power of turning both to the best account he died where he was born and had lived april 11 1875 at the ripe age of eightysix meanwhile an investigation of a totally different character and conducted by totally different means had been prosecuted to a very similar conclusion two years after schwabe began his solitary observations humboldt gave the first impulse at the scientific congress of berlin in 1828 to a great international movement for attacking simultaneously in various parts of the globe the complex problem of terrestrial magnetism through the genius and energy of gauss gttingen became its centre thence new apparatus and a new system for its employment issued there in 1833 the first regular magnetic observatory was founded whilst at gttingen was fixed the universal timestandard for magnetic observations a letter addressed by humboldt in april 1836 to the duke of sussex as president of the royal society enlisted the cooperation of england a network of magnetic stations was spread all over the british dominions from canada to van diemens land measures were concerted with foreign authorities and an expedition was fitted out under the able command of captain afterwards sir james clark ross for the special purpose of bringing intelligence on the subject from the dismal neighbourhood of the south pole in 1841 the elaborate organisation created by the disinterested efforts of scientific agitators was complete gausss magnetometers were vibrating under the view of attentive observers in five continents and simultaneous results began to be recorded ten years later in september 1851 dr john lamont the scotch director of the munich observatory in reviewing the magnetic observations made at gttingen and munich from 1835 to 1850 perceived with some surprise that they gave unmistakable indications of a period which he estimated at 1013 years356 the manner in which this periodicity manifested itself requires a word of explanation the observations in question referred to what is called the declination of the magnetic needlethat is to the position assumed by it with reference to the points of the compass when moving freely in a horizontal plane now this positionas was discovered by graham in 1722is subject to a small daily fluctuation attaining its maximum towards the east about 8 am and its maximum towards the west shortly before 2 pm in other words the direction of the needle approaches in these countries at the present time nearest to the true north some four hours before noon and departs farthest from it between one and two hours after noon it was the range of this daily variation that lamont found to increase and diminish once in every 1013 years in the following winter sir edward sabine ignorant as yet of lamonts conclusion undertook to examine a totally different set of observations the materials in his hands had been collected at the british colonial stations of toronto and hobarton from 1843 to 1848 and had reference not to the regular diurnal swing of the needle but to those curious spasmodic vibrations the inquiry into the laws of which was the primary object of the vast organisation set on foot by humboldt and gauss yet the upshot was practically the same once in about ten years magnetic disturbances termed by humboldt storms were perceived to reach a maximum of violence and frequency sabine was the first to note the coincidence between this unlookedfor result and schwabes sunspot period he showed that so far as observation had yet gone the two cycles of change agreed perfectly both in duration and phase maximum corresponding to maximum minimum to minimum what the nature of the connection could be that bound together by a common law effects so dissimilar as the rents in the luminous garment of the sun and the swayings to and fro of the magnetic needle was and still remains beyond the reach of wellfounded theory but the fact was from the first undeniable the memoir containing this remarkable disclosure was presented to the royal society march 18 and read may 6 1852357 on the 31st of july following rudolf wolf at berne358 and on the 18th of august alfred gautier at sion359 announced separately and independently perfectly similar conclusions this triple event is perhaps the most striking instance of the successful employment of the baconian method of cooperation in discovery by which particulars are amassed by one set of investigatorscorresponding to the depredators and inoculators of solomons housewhile inductions are drawn from them by another and a higher classthe interpreters of nature yet even here the convergence of two distinct lines of research was wholly fortuitous and skilful combination owed the most brilliant part of its success to the unsought bounty of what we call fortune the exactness of the coincidence thus brought to light was fully confirmed by further inquiries a diligent search through the scattered records of sunspot observations from the time of galileo and scheiner onwards put wolf360 in possession of materials by which he was enabled to correct schwabes looselyindicated decennial period to one of slightly over eleven 1111 years and he further showed that this fell in with the ebb and flow of magnetic change even better than lamonts 1013 year cycle the analogy was also pointed out between the lightcurve or zigzagged line representing on paper the varying intensity in the lustre of certain stars and the similar delineation of spotfrequency the ascent from minimum to maximum being in both cases usually steeper than the descent from maximum to minimum while an additional point of resemblance was furnished by the irregularities in height of the various maxima in other words both the number of spots on the sun and the brightness of variable stars increase as a rule more rapidly than they decrease nor does the amount of that increase in either instance show any approach to uniformity the endeavour suggested by the very nature of the phenomenon to connect sunspots with weather was less successful the first attempt of the kind was made by sir william herschel in 1801 and a very notable one it was meteorological statistics save of the scantiest and most casual kind did not then exist but the price of corn from year to year was on record and this with full recognition of its inadequacy he adopted as his criterion nor was he much better off for information respecting the solar condition what little he could obtain however served as he believed to confirm his surmise that a copious emission of light and heat accompanies an abundant formation of openings in the dazzling substance whence our supply of those indispensable commodities is derived361 he gathered in short from his inquiries very much what he had expected to gather namely that the price of wheat was high when the sun showed an unsullied surface and that food and spots became plentiful together362 yet this plausible inference was scarcely borne out by a more exact collocation of facts schwabe failed to detect any reflection of the sunspot period in his meteorological register gautier363 reached a provisional conclusion the reversethough not markedly the reverseof herschels wolf in 1852 derived from an examination of vogels collection of zrich chronicles 10001800 ad evidence showing as he thought that minimum years were usually wet and stormy maximum years dry and genial364 but a subsequent review of the subject in 1859 convinced him that no relation of any kind between the two kinds of effects was traceable365 with the singular affection of our atmosphere known as the aurora borealis more properly aurora polaris the case was different here the zrich chronicles set wolf on the right track in leading him to associate such luminous manifestations with a disturbed condition of the sun since subsequent detailed observation has exhibited the curve of auroral frequency as following with such fidelity the jagged lines figuring to the eye the fluctuations of solar and magnetic activity as to leave no reasonable doubt that all three rise and sink together under the influence of a common cause as long ago as 1716366 halley had conjectured that the northern lights were due to magnetic effluvia but there was no evidence on the subject forthcoming until hiorter observed at upsala in 1741 their agitating influence upon the magnetic needle that the effect was no casual one was made superabundantly clear by aragos researches in 1819 and subsequent years now both were perceived to be swayed by the same obscure power of cosmical disturbance the sun is not the only one of the heavenly bodies by which the magnetism of the earth is affected proofs of a similar kind of lunar action were laid by kreil in 1841 before the bohemian society of sciences and with minor corrections were fully substantiated by sabines more extended researches it was thus ascertained that each lunar day or the interval of twentyfour hours and about fiftyfour minutes between two successive meridian passages of our satellite is marked by a perceptible though very small double oscillation of the needletwo progressive movements from east to west and two returns from west to east367 moreover the lunar like the solar influence as was proved in each case by sabines analysis of the hobarton and toronto observations extends to all three magnetic elements affecting not only the position of the horizontal or declination needle but also the dip and intensity it seems not unreasonable to attribute some portion of the same subtle power to the planets and even to the stars though with effects rendered imperceptible by distance we have now to speak of the discovery and application to the heavenly bodies of a totally new method of investigation spectrum analysis may be shortly described as a mode of distinguishing the various species of matter by the kind of light proceeding from each this definition at once explains how it is that unlike every other system of chemical analysis it has proved available in astronomy light so far as quality is concerned ignores distance no intrinsic change that we yet know of is produced in it by a journey from the farthest bounds of the visible universe so that provided only that in quantity it remain sufficient for the purpose its peculiarities can be equally well studied whether the source of its vibrations be one foot or a hundred billion miles distant now the most obvious distinction between one kind of light and another resides in colour but of this distinction the eye takes cognisance in an sthetic not in a scientific sense it finds gladness in the thousand tints of nature but can neither analyse nor define them here the refracting prismor the combination of prisms known as the spectroscopecomes to its aid teaching it to measure as well as to perceive it furnishes in a word an accurate scale of colour the various rays which entering the eye together in a confused crowd produce a compound impression made up of undistinguishable elements are by the mere passage through a triangular piece of glass separated one from the other and ranged side by side in orderly succession so that it becomes possible to tell at a glance what kinds of light are present and what absent thus if we could only be assured that the various chemical substances when made to glow by heat emit characteristic raysrays that is occupying a place in the spectrum reserved for them and for them onlywe should at once be in possession of a mode of identifying such substances with the utmost readiness and certainty this assurance which forms the solid basis of spectrum analysis was obtained slowly and with difficulty the first to employ the prism in the examination of various flames for it is only in a state of vapour that matter emits distinctive light was a young scotchman named thomas melvill who died in 1753 at the age of twentyseven he studied the spectrum of burning spirits into which were successively introduced sal ammoniac potash alum nitre and seasalt and observed the singular predominance under almost all circumstances of a particular shade of yellow light perfectly definite in its degree of refrangibility368in other words taking up a perfectly definite position in the spectrum his experiments were repeated by morgan369 wollaston andwith far superior precision and diligenceby fraunhofer370 the great munich optician whose work was completely original rediscovered melvills deep yellow ray and measured its place in the colourscale it has since become well known as the sodium line and has played a very important part in the history of spectrum analysis nevertheless its ubiquity and conspicuousness long impeded progress it was elicited by the combustion of a surprising variety of substancessulphur alcohol ivory wood paper its persistent visibility suggesting the accomplishment of some universal process of nature rather than the presence of one individual kind of matter but if spectrum analysis were to exist as a science at all it could only be by attaining certainty as to the unvarying association of one special substance with each special quality of light thus perplexed fox talbot371 hesitated in 1826 to enounce this fundamental principle he was inclined to believe that the presence in the spectrum of any individual ray told unerringly of the volatilisation in the flame under scrutiny of some body as whose badge or distinctive symbol that ray might be regarded but the continual prominence of the yellow beam staggered him it appeared indeed without fail where sodium was but it also appeared where it might be thought only reasonable to conclude that sodium was not nor was it until thirty years later that william swan372 by pointing out the extreme delicacy of the spectral test and the singularly wide dispersion of sodium made it appear probable but even then only probable that the questionable yellow line was really due invariably to that substance common salt chloride of sodium is in fact the most diffusive of solids it floats in the air it flows with water every grain of dust has its attendant particle its absolute exclusion approaches the impossible and withal the light that it gives in burning is so intense and concentrated that if a single grain be divided into 180 million parts and one alone of such inconceivably minute fragments be present in a source of light the spectroscope will show unmistakably its characteristic beam amongst the pioneers of knowledge in this direction were sir john herschel373who however applied himself to the subject in the interests of optics not of chemistryw a miller374 and wheatstone the last especially made a notable advance when in the course of his studies on the prismatic decomposition of the electric light he reached the significant conclusion that the rays visible in its spectrum were different for each kind of metal employed as electrodes375 thus indications of a wider principle were to be found in several quarters but no positive certainty on any single point was obtained until in 1859 gustav kirchhoff professor of physics in the university of heidelberg and his colleague the eminent chemist robert bunsen took the matter in hand by them the general question as to the necessary and invariable connection of certain rays in the spectrum with certain kinds of matter was first resolutely confronted and first definitely answered it was answered affirmativelyelse there could have been no science of spectrum analysisas the result of experiments more numerous more stringent and more precise than had previously been undertaken376 and the assurance of their conclusion was rendered doubly sure by the discovery through the peculiarities of their light alone of two new metals named from the blue and red rays by which they were respectively distinguished csium and rubidium377 both were immediately afterwards actually obtained in small quantities by evaporation of the durckheim mineral waters the link connecting this important result with astronomy may now be indicated in the year 1802 it occurred to william hyde wollaston to substitute for the round hole used by newton and his successors for the admittance of light to be examined with the prism an elongated crevice 120th of an inch in width he thereupon perceived that the spectrum thus formed of light as it were purified by the abolition of overlapping images was traversed by seven dark lines these he took to be natural boundaries of the various colours378 and satisfied with this quasiexplanation allowed the subject to drop it was independently taken up after twelve years by a man of higher genius in the course of experiments on light directed towards the perfecting of his achromatic lenses fraunhofer by means of a slit and a telescope made the surprising discovery that the solar spectrum is crossed not by seven but by thousands of obscure transverse streaks379 of these he counted some 600 and carefully mapped 324 while a few of the most conspicuous he set up if we may be permitted the expression as landmarks measuring their distances apart with a theodolite and affixing to them the letters of the alphabet by which they are still universally known nor did he stop here the same system of examination applied to the rest of the heavenly bodies showed the mild effulgence of the moon and planets to be deficient in precisely the same rays as sunlight while in the stars it disclosed the differences in likeness which are always an earnest of increased knowledge the spectra of sirius and castor instead of being delicately ruled crosswise throughout like that of the sun were seen to be interrupted by three massive bars of darknesstwo in the blue and one in the green380 the light of pollux on the other hand seemed precisely similar to sunlight attenuated by distance or reflection and that of capella betelgeux and procyon to share some of its peculiarities one solar line especiallythat marked in his map with the letter dproved common to all the four lastmentioned stars and it was remarkable that it exactly coincided in position with the conspicuous yellow beam afterwards as we have said identified with the light of glowing sodium which he had already found to accompany most kinds of combustion moreover both the dark solar and the bright terrestrial d lines were displayed by the refined munich appliances as double in this striking correspondence discovered by fraunhofer in 1815 was contained the very essence of solar chemistry but its true significance did not become apparent until long afterwards fraunhofer was by profession not a physicist but a practical optician time pressed he could not and would not deviate from his appointed track all that was possible to him was to indicate the road to discovery and exhort others to follow it381 partially and inconclusively at first this was done the fixed lines as they were called of the solar spectrum took up the position of a standing problem to the solution of which no approach seemed possible conjectures as to their origin were indeed rife an explanation put forward by zantedeschi382 and others and dubiously favoured by sir david brewster and dr j h gladstone383 was that they resulted from interferencethat is a destruction of the motion producing in our eyes the sensation of light by the superposition of two lightwaves in such a manner that the crests of one exactly fill up the hollows of the other this effect was supposed to be brought about by imperfections in the optical apparatus employed a more plausible view was that the atmosphere of the earth was the agent by which sunlight was deprived of its missing beams for a few of them this is actually the case brewster found in 1832 that certain dark lines which were invisible when the sun stood high in the heavens became increasingly conspicuous as he approached the horizon384 these are the wellknown atmospheric lines but the immense majority of their companions in the spectrum remain quite unaffected by the thickness of the stratum of air traversed by the sunlight containing them they are then obviously due to another cause there remained the true interpretationabsorption in the suns atmosphere and this too was extensively canvassed but a remarkable observation made by professor forbes of edinburgh385 on the occasion of the annular eclipse of may 15 1836 appeared to throw discredit upon it if the problematical dark lines were really occasioned by the stoppage of certain rays through the action of a vaporous envelope surrounding the sun they ought it seemed to be strongest in light proceeding from his edges which cutting that envelope obliquely passed through a much greater depth of it but the circle of light left by the interposing moon and of course derived entirely from the rim of the solar disc yielded to forbess examination precisely the same spectrum as light coming from its central parts this circumstance helped to baffle inquirers already sufficiently perplexed it still remains an anomaly of which no satisfactory explanation has been offered convincing evidence as to the true nature of the solar lines was however at length in the autumn of 1859 brought forward at heidelburg kirchhoffs experimentum crucis in the matter was a very simple one he threw bright sunshine across a space occupied by vapour of sodium and perceived with astonishment that the dark fraunhofer line d instead of being effaced by flame giving a luminous ray of the same refrangibility was deepened and thickened by the superposition he tried the same experiment substituting for sunbeams light from a drummond lamp and with similar result a dark furrow corresponding in every respect to the solar dline was instantly seen to interrupt the otherwise unbroken radiance of its spectrum the inference was irresistible that the effect thus produced artificially was brought about naturally in the same way and that sodium formed an ingredient in the glowing atmosphere of the sun386 this first discovery was quickly followed up by the identification of numerous bright rays in the spectra of other metallic bodies with others of the hitherto mysterious fraunhofer lines kirchhoff was thus led to the conclusion that besides sodium iron magnesium calcium and chromium are certainly solar constituents and that copper zinc barium and nickel are also present though in smaller quantities387 as to cobalt he hesitated to pronounce but its existence in the sun has since been established these memorable results were founded upon a general principle first enunciated by kirchhoff in a communication to the berlin academy december 15 1859 and afterwards more fully developed by him388 it may be expressed as follows substances of every kind are opaque to the precise rays which they emit at the same temperature that is to say they stop the kinds of light or heat which they are then actually in a condition to radiate but it does not follow that cool bodies absorb the rays which they would give out if sufficiently heated hydrogen at ordinary temperatures for instance is almost perfectly transparent but if raised to the glowing pointas by the passage of electricityit then becomes capable of arresting and at the same time of displaying in its own spectrum light of four distinct colours this principle is fundamental to solar chemistry it gives the key to the hieroglyphics of the fraunhofer lines the identical characters which are written bright in terrestrial spectra are written dark in the unrolled sheaf of sunrays the meaning remains unchanged it must however be remembered that they are only relatively dark the substances stopping those particular tints in the neighbourhood of the sun are at the same time vividly glowing with the very same remove the dazzling solar background by contrast with which they show as obscure and they will be seen and at critical moments actually have been seen in all their native splendour it is because the atmosphere of the sun is cooler than the globe it envelops that the different kinds of vapour constituting that atmosphere take more than they give absorb more light than they are capable of emitting raise them to the same temperature as the sun itself and their powers of emission and absorption being brought exactly to the same level the thousands of dusky rays in the solar spectrum will be at once obliterated the establishment of the terrestrial science of spectrum analysis was due as we have seen equally to kirchhoff and bunsen but its celestial application to kirchhoff alone he effected this object of the aspirations more or less dim of many other thinkers and workers by the union of two separate though closely related lines of researchthe study of the different kinds of light emitted by various bodies and the study of the different kinds of light absorbed by them the latter branch appears to have been first entered upon by dr thomas young in 1803389 it was pursued by the younger herschel390 by william allen miller brewster and gladstone brewster indeed made in 1833391 a formal attempt to found what might be called an inverse system of analysis with the prism based upon absorption and his efforts were repeated just a quarter of a century later by gladstone392 but no general point of view was attained nor it may be added was it by this path attainable kirchhoffs map of the solar spectrum drawn to scale with exquisite accuracy and printed in three shades of ink to convey the graduated obscurity of the lines was published in the transactions of the berlin academy for 1861 and 1862393 representations of the principal lines belonging to various elementary bodies formed as it were a series of marginal notes accompanying the great solar scroll enabling the veriest tiro in the new science to decipher its meaning at a glance where the dark solar and bright metallic rays agreed in position it might safely be inferred that the metal emitting them was a solar constituent and such coincidences were numerous in the case of iron alone no less than sixty occurred in onehalf of the spectral area rendering the chances394 absolutely overwhelming against mere casual conjunction the preparation of this elaborate picture proved so trying to the eyes that kirchhoff was compelled by failing vision to resign the latter half of the task to his pupil hofmann the complete map measured nearly eight feet in length the conclusions reached by kirchhoff were no sooner announced than they took their place with scarcely a dissenting voice among the established truths of science the broad result that the dark lines in the spectrum of the sun afford an index to its chemical composition no less reliable than any of the tests used in the laboratory was equally captivating to the imagination of the vulgar and authentic in the judgment of the learned and like all genuine advances in the knowledge of nature it stimulated curiosity far more than it gratified it now the history of how discoveries were missed is often quite as instructive as the history of how they were made it may then be worth while to expend a few words on the thoughts and trials by which in the present case the actual event was heralded three times it seemed on the verge of being anticipated the experiment which in kirchhoffs hands proved decisive of passing sunlight through glowing vapours and examining the superposed spectra was performed by professor w a miller of kings college in 1845395 nay more it was performed with express reference to the question then already as has been noted in debate of the possible production of fraunhofers lines by absorption in a solar atmosphere yet it led to nothing again at paris in 1849 with a view to testing the asserted coincidence between the solar dline and the bright yellow beam in the spectrum of the electric arc really due to the unsuspected presence of sodium lon foucault threw a ray of sunshine across the arc and observed its spectrum396 he was surprised to see that the dline was rendered more intensely dark by the combination of lights to assure himself still further he substituted a reflected image of one of the whitehot carbonpoints for the sunbeam with an identical result the same ray was missing it needed but another step to have generalised this result and thus laid hold of a natural truth of the highest importance but that step was not taken foucault keen and brilliant though he was rested satisfied with the information that the voltaic arc had the power of stopping the kind of light emitted by it he asked no further question and was consequently the bearer of no further intelligence on the subject the truth conveyed by this remarkable experiment was however divined by one eminent man professor stokes of cambridge stated to sir william thomson now lord kelvin shortly after it had been made his conviction that an absorbing atmosphere of sodium surrounded the sun and so forcibly was his hearer impressed with the weight of the argument based upon the absolute agreement of the dline in the solar spectrum with the yellow ray of burning sodium then freshly certified by w h miller combined with foucaults reversal of that ray that he regularly inculcated in his public lectures on natural philosophy at glasgow five or six years before kirchhoffs discovery not only the fact of the presence of sodium in the solar neighbourhood but also the principle of the study of solar and stellar chemistry in the spectra of flames397 yet it does not appear to have occurred to either of these two distinguished professorsthemselves among the foremost of their time in the successful search for new truthsto verify practically a sagacious conjecture in which was contained the possibility of a scientific revolution it is just to add that kirchhoff was unacquainted when he undertook his investigation either with the experiment of foucault or the speculation of stokes for c j ngstrm on the other hand perhaps somewhat too much has been claimed in the way of anticipation his optical researches appeared at upsala in 1853 and in their english garb two years later398 they were undoubtedly pregnant with suggestion yet made no epoch in discovery the old perplexities continued to prevail after as before their publication to ngstrm indeed belongs the great merit of having revived eulers principle of the equivalence of emission and absorption but he revived it in its original crude form and without the qualifying proviso which alone gave it value as a clue to new truths according to his statement a body absorbs all the series of vibrations it is under any circumstances capable of emitting as well as those connected with them by simple harmonic relations this is far too wide to render it either true or useful it had to be reduced to the cautious terms employed by kirchhoff radiation strictly and necessarily corresponds with absorption only when the temperature is the same in point of fact ngstrm was still in 1853 divided between adsorption and interference as the mode of origin of the fraunhofer dark rays very important however was his demonstration of the compound nature of the sparkspectrum which he showed to be made up of the spectrum of the metallic electrodes superposed upon that of the gas or gases across which the discharge passed it may here be usefulsince without some clear ideas on the subject no proper understanding of recent astronomical progress is possibleto take a cursory view of the elementary principles of spectrum analysis to many of our readers they are doubtless already familiar but it is better to appear trite to some than obscure even to a few the spectrum then of a body is simply the light proceeding from it spread out by refraction399 into a brilliant variegated band passing from brownishred through crimson orange yellow green and azure into dusky violet the reason of this spreadingout or dispersion is that the various colours have different wavelengths and consequently meet with different degrees of retardation in traversing the denser medium of the prism the shortest and quickest vibrations producing the sensation we call violet are thrown farthest away from their original pathin other words suffer the widest deviation the longest and slowest the red travel much nearer to it thus the sheaf of rays which would otherwise combine into a patch of white light are separated through the divergence of their tracks after refraction by a prism so as to form a tinted riband this visible spectrum is prolonged invisibly at both ends by a long range of vibrations either too rapid or too sluggish to affect the eye as light but recognisable through their chemical and heating effects now all incandescent solid or liquid substances and even gases ignited under great pressure give what is called a continuous spectrum that is to say the light derived from them is of every conceivable hue sorted out with the prism its tints merge imperceptibly one into the other uninterrupted by any dark spaces no colours in short are missing but gases and vapours rendered luminous by heat emit rays of only a few tints which accordingly form an interrupted spectrum usually designated as one of lines or bands and since these rays are perfectly definite and characteristicnot being the same for any two substancesit is easy to tell what kind of matter is concerned in producing them we may suppose that the inconceivably minute particles which by their rapid thrilling agitate the ethereal medium so as to produce light are free to give out their peculiar tone of vibration only when floating apart from each other in gaseous form but when crowded together into a condensed mass the clear ring of the distinctive note is drowned so to speak in a universal molecular clang thus prismatic analysis has no power to identify individual kinds of matter except when they present themselves as glowing vapours a spectrum is said to be reversed when lines previously seen bright on a dark background appear dark on a bright background in this form it is equally characteristic of chemical composition with the direct spectrum being due to absorption as the latter is to emission and absorption and emission are by kirchhoffs law strictly correlative this is easily understood by the analogy of sound for just as a tuningfork responds to soundwaves of its own pitch but remains indifferent to those of any other so those particles of matter whose nature it is when set swinging by heat to vibrate a certain number of times in a second thus giving rise to light of a particular shade of colour appropriate those same vibrations and those only when transmitted past themor phrasing it otherwise are opaque to them and transparent to all others it should further be explained that the shape of the bright or dark spaces in the spectrum has nothing whatever to do with the nature of the phenomena the lines and bands so frequently spoken of are seen as such for no other reason than because the light forming them is admitted through a narrow straight opening change that opening into a fine crescent or a sinuous curve and the lines will at once appear as crescents or curves resuming in a sentence what has been already explained we find that the prismatic analysis of the heavenly bodies was founded upon three classes of facts first the unmistakable character of the light given by each different kind of glowing vapour secondly the identity of the light absorbed with the light emitted by each thirdly the coincidence observed between rays missing from the solar spectrum and rays absorbed by various terrestrial substances thus a realm of knowledge pronounced by morinus400 in the seventeenth century and no less dogmatically by auguste comte401 in the nineteenth hopelessly out of reach of the human intellect was thrown freely open and the chemistry of the sun and stars took at once a leading place among the experimental sciences the immediate increase of knowledge was not the chief result of kirchhoffs labours still more important was the change in the scope and methods of astronomy which set on foot in 1852 by the detection of a common period affecting at once the spots on the sun and the magnetism of the earth was extended and accelerated by the discovery of spectrum analysis the nature of that change is concisely indicated by the heading of the present chapter we would now ask our readers to endeavour to realise somewhat distinctly what is implied by the foundation of astronomical physics just three centuries ago kepler drew a forecast of what he called a physical astronomya science treating of the efficient causes of planetary motion and holding the key to the inner astronomy402 what kepler dreamed of and groped after newton realized he showed the beautiful and symmetrical revolutions of the solar system to be governed by a uniformly acting cause and that cause no other than the familiar force of gravity which gives stability to all our terrestrial surroundings the world under our feet was thus for the first time brought into physical connection with the worlds peopling space and a very tangible relationship was demonstrated as existing between what used to be called the corruptible matter of the earth and the incorruptible matter of the heavens this process of unification of the cosmosthis levelling of the celestial with the sublunarywas carried no farther until the fact unexpectedly emerged from a vast and complicated mass of observations that the magnetism of the earth is subject to subtle influences emanating certainly from some and presumably from all of the heavenly bodies the inference being thus rendered at least plausible that a force not less universal than gravity itself but with whose modes of action we are as yet unacquainted pervades the universe and forms it might be said an intangible bond of sympathy between its parts now for the investigation of this influence two roads are open it may be pursued by observation either of the bodies from which it proceeds or of the effects which it producesthat is to say either by the astronomer or by the physicist or better still by both concurrently their acquisitions are mutually profitable nor can either be considered as independent of the other any important accession to knowledge respecting the sun for example may be expected to cast a reflected light on the still obscure subject of terrestrial magnetism while discoveries in magnetism or its alter ego electricity must profoundly affect solar inquiries the establishment of the new method of spectrum analysis drew far closer this alliance between celestial and terrestrial science indeed they have come to merge so intimately one into the other that it is no easier to trace their respective boundaries than it is to draw a clear dividingline between the animal and vegetable kingdoms yet up to the middle of the last century astronomy while maintaining her strict union with mathematics looked with indifference on the rest of the sciences it was enough that she possessed the telescope and the calculus now the materials for her inductions are supplied by the chemist the electrician the inquirer into the most recondite mysteries of light and the molecular constitution of matter she is concerned with what the geologist the meteorologist even the biologist has to say she can afford to close her ears to no new truth of the physical order her position of lofty isolation has been exchanged for one of community and mutual aid the astronomer has become in the highest sense of the term a physicist while the physicist is bound to be something of an astronomer this then is what is designed to be conveyed by the foundation of astronomical or cosmical physics it means the establishment of a science of nature whose conclusions are not only presumed by analogy but are ascertained by observation to be valid wherever light can travel and gravity is obeyeda science by which the nature of the stars can be studied upon the earth and the nature of the earth can be made better known by study of the starsa science in a word which is or aims at being one and universal even as naturethe visible reflection of the invisible highest unityis one and universal it is not too much to say that a new birth of knowledge has ensued the astronomy so signally promoted by bessel403the astronomy placed by comte404 at the head of the hierarchy of the physical scienceswas the science of the movements of the heavenly bodies and there were those who began to regard it as a science which from its very perfection had ceased

pos phil p 115 chapter ii solar observations and theories the zeal with which solar studies have been pursued during the last half century has already gone far to redeem the neglect of the two preceding ones since schwabes discovery was published in 1851 observers have multiplied new facts have been rapidly accumulated and the previous comparative quiescence of thought on the great subject of the constitution of the sun has been replaced by a bewildering variety of speculations conjectures and more or less justifiable inferences it is satisfactory to find this novel impulse not only shared but to a large extent guided by our countrymen william rutter dawes one of many clergymen eminent in astronomy observed in 1852 with the help of a solar eyepiece of his own devising some curious details of spotstructure405 the umbraheretofore taken for the darkest part of the spotwas seen to be suffused with a mottled nebulous illumination in marked contrast with the striated appearance of the penumbra while through this cloudy stratum a black opening permitted the eye to divine farther unfathomable depths beyond the hole thus disclosedevidently the true nucleuswas found to be present in all considerable as well as in many small macul again the whirling motions of some of these objects were noticed by him the remarkable form of one sketched at wateringbury in kent january 17 1852 gave him the means of detecting and measuring a rotatory movement of the whole spot round the black nucleus at the rate of 100 degrees in six days it appeared he said as if some prodigious ascending force of a whirlwind character in bursting through the cloudy stratum and the two higher and luminous strata had given to the whole a movement resembling its own406 an interpretation founded as is easily seen on the herschelian theory then still in full credit an instance of the same kind was observed by mr w r birt in 1860407 and cyclonic movements are now a recognised feature of sunspots they are however as father secchi408 concluded from his long experience but temporary and casual scarcely three per cent of all spots visible exhibit the spiral structure which should invariably result if a conflict of opposing or the friction of unequal currents were essential and not merely incidental to their origin a whirlpool phase not unfrequently accompanies their formation and may be renewed at periods of recrudescence or dissolution but it is both partial and inconstant sometimes affecting only one side of a spot sometimes slackening gradually its movement in one direction to resume it after a brief pause in the opposite persistent and uniform notions such as the analogy of terrestrial storms would absolutely require are not to be found so that the cyclonic theory of sunspots suggested by herschel in 1847409 and urged from a different point of view by faye in 1872 may be said to have completely broken down the drift of spots over the suns surface was first systematically investigated by carrington a selfconstituted astronomer gifted with the courage and the instinct of thoughtful labour born at chelsea in may 1826 richard christopher carrington entered trinity college cambridge in 1844 he was intended for the church but professor challiss lectures diverted him to astronomy and he resolved as soon as he had taken his degree to prepare with all possible diligence to follow his new vocation his father who was a brewer on a large scale at brentford offered no opposition ample means were at his disposal nevertheless he chose to serve an apprenticeship of three years as observer in the university of durham as though his sole object had been to earn a livelihood he quitted the post only when he found that its restricted opportunities offered no farther prospect of selfimprovement he now built an observatory of his own at redhill in surrey with the design of completing bessels and argelanders survey of the northern heavens by adding to it the circumpolar stars omitted from their view this project successfully carried out between 1854 and 1857 had another and still larger one superposed upon it before it had even begun to be executed in 1852 while the redhill observatory was in course of erection the discovery of the coincidence between the sunspot and magnetic periods was announced carrington was profoundly interested and devoted his enforced leisure to the examination of records both written and depicted of past solar observations struck with their fragmentary and inconsistent character he resolved to appropriate as he said by close and methodical research the elevenyear period next ensuing410 he calculated rightly that he should have the field pretty nearly to himself for many reasons conspire to make public observatories slow in taking up new subjects and amateurs with freedom to choose and means to treat them effectually were scarcer then than they are now the execution of this laborious task was commenced november 9 1853 it was intended to be merely a parergona second subject upon which daylight energies might be spent while the hours of night were reserved for cataloguing those stars that are bereft of the baths of ocean its results however proved of the highest interest although the vicissitudes of life barred the completion in its full integrity of the original design by the death in 1858 of the elder carrington the charge of the brewery devolved upon his son and eventually absorbed so much of his care that it was found advisable to bring the solar observations to a premature close on march 24 1861 his scientific life may be said to have closed with them attacked four years later with severe and in its results permanent illness he disposed of the brentford business and withdrew to churt near farnham in surrey there in a lonely spot on the top of a detached conical hill known as the devils jump he built a second observatory and erected an instrument which he was no longer able to use with pristine effectiveness and there november 27 1875 he died of the rupture of a blood vessel on the brain before he had completed his fiftieth year411 his observations of sunspots were of a geometrical character they concerned positions and movements leaving out of sight physical peculiarities indeed the prudence with which he limited his task to what came strictly within the range of his powers to accomplish was one of carringtons most valuable qualities the method of his observations moreover was chosen with the same practical sagacity as their objects as early as 1847 sir john herschel had recommended the daily selfregistration of sunspots412 and he enforced the suggestion with more immediate prospect of success in 1854413 the art of celestial photography however was even then in a purely tentative stage and carrington wisely resolved to waste no time on dubious experiments but employ the means of registration and measurement actually at his command these were very simple yet very effective to the helioscope employed by father scheiner414 two centuries and a quarter earlier a species of micrometer was added the image of the sun was projected upon a screen by means of a firmlyclamped telescope in the focus of which were placed two crosswires forming angles of 45 with the meridian the six instants were then carefully noted at which these were met by the edges of the disc as it traversed the screen and by the nucleus of the spot to be measured415 a short process of calculation then gave the exact position of the spot as referred to the suns centre from a series of 5290 observations made in this way together with a great number of accurate drawings carrington derived conclusions of great importance on each of the three points which he had proposed to himself to investigate these were the law of the suns rotation the existence and direction of systematic currents and the distribution of spots on the solar surface grave discrepancies were early perceived to exist between determinations of the suns rotation by different observers galileo with comfortable generality estimated the period at about a lunar month416 scheiner at twentyseven days417 cassini in 1678 made it 2558 delambre in 1775 no more than twentyfive days later inquiries brought these divergences within no more tolerable limits laugiers result of 2534 daysobtained in 1841enjoyed the highest credit yet it differed widely in one direction from that of bhm 1852 giving 2552 days and in the other from that of kysus 1846 giving 2509 days now the cause of these variations was really obvious from the first although for a long time strangely overlooked scheiner pointed out in 1630 that different spots gave different periods adding the significant remark that one at a distance from the solar equator revolved more slowly than those nearer to it418 but the hint was wasted for upwards of two centuries ideas on the subject were either retrograde or stationary what were called the proper motions of spots were however recognised by schrter419 and utterly baffled laugier420 who despaired of obtaining any concordant result as to the suns rotation except by taking the mean of a number of discordant ones at last in 1855 a valuable course of observations made at capo di monte naples in 18456 enabled c h f peters421 to set in the clearest light the insecurity of determinations based on the assumption of fixity in objects plainly affected by movements uncertain both in amount and direction such was the state of affairs when carrington entered upon his task everything was in confusion the most that could be said was that the confusion had come to be distinctly admitted and referred to its true source what he discovered was this that the sun or at least the outer shell of the sun visible to us has no single period of rotation but drifts round carrying the spots with it at a rate continually accelerated from the poles to the equator in other words the time of axial revolution is shortest at the equator and lengthens with increase of latitude carrington devised a mathematical formula by which the rate or law of this lengthening was conveniently expressed but it was a purely empirical one it was a concise statement but implied no physical interpretation it summarised but did not explain the facts an assumed mean period for the solar rotation of 2538 days twentyfive days nine hours very nearly was thus found to be actually conformed to only in two parallels of solar latitude 14 north and south while the equatorial period was slightly less than twentyfive and that of latitude 50 rose to twentyseven days and a half422 these curious results gave quite a new direction to ideas on solar physics the other two elements of the suns rotation were also ascertained by carrington with hitherto unattained precision he fixed the inclination of its axis to the ecliptic at 82 45 the longitude of the ascending node at 73 40 for the epoch 1850 ad these datawhich have scarcely yet been improved uponsuffice to determine the position in space of the suns equator its north pole is directed towards a star in the coils of the dragon midway between vega and the polestar its plane intersects that of the earths orbit in such a way that our planet finds itself in the same level on or about the 3rd of june and the 5th of december when any spots visible on the disc cross it in apparently straight lines at other times the paths pursued by them seem curveddownward to an observer in the northern hemisphere between june and december upward between december and june a singular peculiarity in the distribution of sunspots emerged from carringtons studies at the time of the minimum of 1856 two broad belts of the solar surface as we have seen are frequented by them of which the limits may be put at 6 and 35 of north and south latitude individual equatorial spots are not uncommon but nearer to the poles than 35 they are a rare exception carrington observedas an extreme instancein july 1858 one in south latitude 44 and peters in june 1846 watched during several days a spot in 50 24 north latitude but beyond this no true macula has ever been seen for lahires reported observation of one in latitude 70 is now believed to have had its place on the solar globe erroneously assigned and the veiled spots described by trouvelot in 1875423 as occurring within 10 of the pole can only be regarded as at the most the same kind of disturbance in an undeveloped form but the novelty of carringtons observations consisted in the detection of certain changes in distribution concurrent with the progress of the elevenyear period as the minimum approached the spotzones contracted towards the equator and there finally vanished then as if by a fresh impulse spots suddenly reappeared in high latitude and spread downwards with the development of the new phase of activity scarcely had this remark been made public424 when wolf425 found a confirmation of its general truth in bhms observations during the years 183336 and a perfectly similar behaviour was noted both by sprer and secchi at the minimum epoch of 1867 the ensuing period gave corresponding indications and it may now be looked upon as established that the spotzones close in towards the equator with the advance of each cycle their activity culminating as a rule in a mean latitude of about 16 and expiring when it is reduced to 6 before this happens however a completely new disturbance will have manifested itself some 35 north and south of the equator and will have begun to travel over the same course as its predecessor each series of sunspots is thus to some extent overlapped by the succeeding one so that while the average interval from one maximum to the next is eleven years the period of each distinct wave of agitation is twelve or fourteen426 curious evidence of the retarded character of the maximum of 18834 was to be found in the unusually low latitude of the spotzones when it occurred their movement downward having gone on regularly while the crisis was postponed its final symptoms were hence displaced locally as well as in time the law of zones was duly obeyed at the minima of 1890427 and 1901 and sprer found evidence of conformity to it so far back as 1619428 his researches however also showed that it was in abeyance during some seventy years previously to 1716 during which period sunspots remained persistently scarce and auroral displays were feeble and infrequent even in high northern latitudes an unaccountable suspension of solar activity is in fact indicated429 gustav sprer born at berlin in 1822 began to observe sunspots with the view of assigning the law of solar rotation in december 1860 his assiduity and success with limited means attracted attention and a government endowment was procured for his little solar observatory at anclam in pomerania the crown prince afterwards emperor frederick adding a fiveinch refractor to its modest equipment unaware of carringtons discovery not made known until january 1859 he arrived at and published in june 1861430 a similar conclusion as to the equatorial quickening of the suns movement on its axis appointed observer in the new astrophysical establishment at potsdam in 1874 he continued his sunspot determinations there for twenty years and died july 7 1895 the time had now evidently come for a fundamental revision of current notions respecting the nature of the sun herschels theory of a cool dark habitable globe surrounded by and protected against the radiations of a luminous and heatgiving envelope was shattered by the first dicta of spectrum analysis traces of it may be found for a few years subsequent to 1859431 but they are obviously survivals from an earlier order of ideas doomed to speedy extinction it needs only a moments consideration of the meaning at last found for the fraunhofer lines to see the incompatibility of the new facts with the old conceptions they implied not only the presence near the sun as glowing vapours of bodies highly refractory to heat but that these glowing vapours formed the relatively cool envelope of a still hotter internal mass kirchhoff accordingly included in his great memoir on the solar spectrum read before the berlin academy of sciences july 11 1861 an exposition of the views on the subject to which his memorable investigations had led him they may be briefly summarised as follows since the body of the sun gives a continuous spectrum it must be either solid or liquid432 while the interruptions in its light prove it to be surrounded by a complex atmosphere of metallic vapours somewhat cooler than itself spots are simply clouds due to local depressions of temperature differing in no respect from terrestrial clouds except as regards the kinds of matter composing them these sunclouds take their origin in the zones of encounter between polar and equatorial currents in the solar atmosphere this explanation was liable to all the objections urged against the cumulus theory on the one hand and the tradewind theory on the other setting aside its propounder it was consistently upheld perhaps by no man eminent in science except sprer and his advocacy of it proved ineffective to secure its general adoption m faye of the paris academy of sciences was the first to propose a coherent scheme of the solar constitution covering the whole range of new discovery the fundamental ideas on the subject now in vogue here made their first connected appearance much indeed remained to be modified and corrected but the transition was finally made from the old to the new order of thought the essence of the change may be conveyed in a single sentence the sun was thenceforth regarded not as a mere heated body orstill more remotely from the truthas a cool body unaccountably spun round with a cocoon of fire but as a vast heatradiating machine the terrestrial analogy was abandoned in one more particular besides that of temperature the solar system of circulation instead of being adapted like that of the earth to the distribution of heat received from without was seen to be directed towards the transportation towards the surface of the heat contained within polar and equatorial currents tending to a purely superficial equalisation of temperature were replaced by vertical currents bringing up successive portions of the intensely heated interior mass to contribute their share in turn to the radiation into space which might be called the proper function of a sun fayes views which were communicated to the academy of sciences january 16 1865433 were avowedly based on the anomalous mode of solar rotation discovered by carrington this may be regarded either as an acceleration increasing from the poles to the equator or as a retardation increasing from the equator to the poles according to the rate of revolution we choose to assume for the unseen nucleus faye preferred to consider it a retardation produced by ascending currents continually left behind as the sphere widened in which the matter composing them was forced to travel he further supposed that the depth from which these vertical currents rose and consequently the amount of retardation effected by their ascent to the surface became progressively greater as the poles were approached owing to the considerable flattening of the spheroidal surface from which they started434 but the adoption of this expedient has been shown to involve inadmissible consequences the extreme internal mobility betrayed by carringtons and sprers observations led to the inference that the matter composing the sun was mainly or wholly gaseous this had already been suggested by father secchi435 a year earlier and by sir john herschel in april 1864436 but it first obtained general currency through fayes more elaborate presentation a physical basis was afforded for the view by cagniard de la tours experiments in 1822437 proving that under conditions of great heat and pressure the vaporous state was compatible with a very considerable density the position was strengthened when andrews showed in 1869438 that above a fixed limit of temperature varying for different bodies true liquefaction is impossible even though the pressure be so tremendous as to retain the gas within the same space that enclosed the liquid the opinion that the mass of the sun is gaseous now commands a very general assent although the gaseity admitted is of such a nature as to afford the consistence rather of honey or pitch than of the aeriform fluids with which we are familiar on another important point the course of subsequent thought was powerfully influenced by fayes conclusions in 1865 arago somewhat hastily inferred from experiments with the polariscope the wholly gaseous nature of the visible disc of the sun kirchhoff on the contrary believed erroneously as we now know that the brilliant continuous spectrum derived from it proved it to be a whitehot solid or liquid herschel and secchi439 indicated a cloudlike structure as that which would best harmonise the whole of the evidence at command the novelty introduced by faye consisted in regarding the photosphere no longer as a defined surface in the mathematical sense but as a limit to which in the general fluid mass ascending currents carry the physical or chemical phenomena of incandescence440 uprushing floods of mixed vapours with strong affinitiessay of calcium or sodium and oxygenat last attain a region cool enough to permit their combination a fine dust of solid or liquid compound particles of lime or soda for example there collects into the photospheric clouds and descending by its own weight in torrents of incandescent rain is dissociated by the fierce heat below and replaced by ascending and combining currents of similar constitution this first attempt to assign the part played in cosmical physics by chemical affinities was marked by the importation into the theory of the sun of the now familiar phrase dissociation it is indeed tolerably certain that no such combinations as those contemplated by faye occur at the photospheric level since the temperature there must be enormously higher than would be needed to reduce all metallic earths and oxides but molecular changes of some kind dependent perhaps in part upon electrical conditions in part upon the effects of radiation into space most likely replace them the conjecture was emitted by dr johnstone stoney in 1867441 that the photospheric clouds are composed of carbonparticles precipitated from their mounting vapour just where the temperature is lowered by expansion and radiation to the boilingpoint of that substance but this view though countenanced by ngstrm442 and advocated by hastings of baltimore443 and other authorities444 is open to grave objections445 in fayes theory sunspots were regarded as simply breaks in the photospheric clouds where the rising currents had strength to tear them asunder it followed that they were regions of increased heatregions in fact where the temperature was too high to permit the occurrence of the precipitations to which the photosphere is due their obscurity was attributed as in dr bresters more recent thorie du soleil to deficiency of emissive power yet here the verdict of the spectroscope is adverse and irreversible after every deduction however has been made we still find that several ideas of permanent value were embodied in this comprehensive sketch of the solar constitution the principal of these were first that the sun is a mainly gaseous body secondly that its stores of heat are rendered available at the surface by means of vertical convectioncurrentsby the bodily transport that is to say of intensely hot matter upward and of comparatively cool matter downward thirdly that the photosphere is a surface of condensation forming the limit set by the cold of space to this circulating process and that a similar formation must attend at a certain stage the cooling of every cosmical body to warren de la rue belongs the honour of having obtained the earliest results of substantial value in celestial photography what had been done previously was interesting in the way of promise but much could not be claimed for it as actual performance some pioneering experiments were made by dr j w draper of new york in 1840 resulting in the production of a few moonpictures one inch in diameter446 but slight encouragement was derived from them either to himself or others bond of cambridge us however secured in 1850 with the harvard 15inch refractor that daguerreotype of the moon with which the career of extraterrestrial photography may be said to have formally opened it was shown in london at the great exhibition of 1851 and determined the direction of de la rues efforts yet it did little more than prove the art to be a possible one warren de la rue was born in guernsey in 1815 and died in london april 19 1889 educated at the cole saintebarbe in paris he made a large fortune as a paper manufacturer in england and thus amply and early provided the material supplies for his scientific campaign towards the end of 1853 he took some successful lunar photographs they were remarkable as the first examples of the application to astronomical lightpainting of the collodion process invented by archer in 1851 and also of the use of reflectors de la rues was one of thirteen inches constructed by himself for that kind of work the absence of a driving apparatus was however very sensibly felt the difficulty of moving the instrument by hand so as accurately to follow the moons apparent motion being such as to cause the discontinuance of the experiments until 1857 when the want was supplied de la rues new observatory built in that year at cranford was expressly dedicated to celestial photography and there he applied to the heavenly bodies the stereoscopic method of obtaining relief and turned his attention to the delicate business of photographing the sun a solar daguerreotype was taken at paris april 2 1845447 by foucault and fizeau acting on a suggestion from arago but the attempt though far from being unsuccessful does not at that time seem to have been repeated its great difficulty consisted in the enormous lightpower of the object to be represented rendering an inconceivably short period of exposure indispensable under pain of getting completely burntup plates in 1857 de la rue was commissioned by the royal society to construct an instrument specially adapted to the purpose for the kew observatory the resulting photoheliograph may be described as a small telescope of 312 inches aperture and 50 focus with a plateholder at the eyeend guarded in front by a springslide the rapid movement of which across the field of view secured for the sensitive plate a virtually instantaneous exposure by its means the first solar lightpictures of real value were taken and the autographic record of the solar condition recommended by sir john herschel was commenced and continued at kew during fourteen years185872 the work of photographing the sun is now carried on in every quarter of the globe from mauritius to massachusetts and the days are few indeed on which the selfbetrayal of the camera can be evaded by our chief luminary in the year 1883 the incorporation of indian with greenwich pictures afforded a record of the state of the solar surface on 340 days and 364 were similarly provided for in 1897 and 1899 the conclusions arrived at by photographic means at kew were communicated to the royal society in a series of papers drawn up jointly by de la rue balfour stewart and benjamin loewy in 1865 and subsequent years they influenced materially the progress of thought on the subject they were concerned with by its rotation the sun itself offers opportunities for bringing the stereoscope to bear upon it two pictures taken at an interval of twentysix minutes show just the amount of difference needed to give by their combination the maximum effect of solidity448 de la rue thus obtained in 1861 a stereoscopic view of a sunspot and surrounding facul representing the various parts in their true mutual relations i have ascertained in this way he wrote449 that the facul occupy the highest portions of the suns photosphere the spots appearing like holes in the penumbr which appeared lower than the regions surrounding them in one case parts of the facul were discovered to be sailing over a spot apparently at some considerable height above it thus wilsons inference as to the depressed nature of spots received after the lapse of not far from a century proof of the most simple direct and convincing kind a careful application of wilsons own geometrical test gave results only a trifle less decisive of 694 spots observed 78 per cent showed as they traversed the disc the expected effects of perspective450 and their absence in the remaining 22 per cent might be explained by internal commotions producing irregularities of structure the absolute depth of spotcavitiesat least of their sloping sideswas determined by father secchi through measurement of the parallax of profundity451that is of apparent displacements attendant on the suns rotation due to depression below the suns surface he found that in every case it fell short of 4000 miles and averaged not more than 1321 corresponding on the terrestrial scale to an excavation in the earths crust of 115 miles of late however the reality of even this moderate amount of depression has been denied mr howletts persevering observations extending over a third of a century the results of which were presented to the royal astronomical society in december 1894452 availed to shatter the consensus of opinion which had so long been maintained on the subject of spotstructure453 it has become impossible any longer to hold that it is uniformly cavernous and what seem like actually protruding umbr are occasionally vouched for on unimpeachable authority454 we can only infer that the forms of sunspots are really more various than had been supposed that they are peculiarly subject to disturbance and that the level of the nuclei may rise and fall during the phases of commotion like lavas within volcanic craters the opinion of the kew observers as to the nature of such disturbances was strongly swayed by another curious result of the statistical method of inquiry they found that of 1137 instances of spots accompanied by facul 584 had those facul chiefly or entirely on the left 508 showed a nearly equal distribution while 45 only had faculous appendages mainly on the right side455 now the rotation of the sun as we see it is performed from left to right so that the marked tendency of the facul was a lagging one this was easily accounted for by supposing the matter composing them to have been flung upwards from a considerable depth whence it would reach the surface with the lesser absolute velocity belonging to a smaller circle of revolution and would consequently fall behind the cavities or spots formed by its abstraction an attempt it is true made by m wilsing at potsdam in 1888456 to determine the solar rotation from photographs of facul had an outcome inconsistent with this view of their origin they unexpectedly gave a uniform period no trace of the retardation poleward from the equator shown by the spots could be detected in their movements but the experiment was obviously inconclusive457 and m stratonoffs458 repetition of it with ampler materials gave a full assurance that facul rotate like spots in periods lengthening as latitude augments the ideas of m faye were on two fundamental points contradicated by the kew investigators he held spots to be regions of uprush and of heightened temperature they believed their obscurity to be due to a downrush of comparatively cool vapours now m chacornac observing at villeurbanne march 6 1865 saw floods of photospheric matter visibly precipitating themselves into the abyss opened by a great spot and carrying with them small neighbouring macul459 similar instances were repeatedly noted by father secchi who considered the existence of a kind of suction in spots to be quite beyond question460 the tendency in their vicinity to put it otherwise is centripetal not centrifugal and this alone seems to negative the supposition of a central uprush a fresh witness was by this time at hand the application of the spectroscope to the direct examination of the suns surface dates from march 4 1866 when sir norman lockyer to give him his present title undertook an inquiry into the cause of the darkening in spots461 it was made possible by the simple device of throwing upon the slit of the spectroscope an image of the sun any part of which could be subjected to special scrutiny instead of as had hitherto been done admitting rays from every portion of his surface indiscriminately the answer to the inquiry was prompt and unmistakable and was again in this case adverse to the french theorists view the obscurations in question were found to be produced by no deficiency of emissive power but by an increase of absorptive action the background of variegated light remains unchanged but more of it is stopped by the interposition of a dense mass of relatively cool vapours the spectrum of a sunspot is crossed by the same set of multitudinous dark lines with some minor differences visible in the ordinary solar spectrum we must then conclude that the same vapours speaking generally which are dispersed over the unbroken solar surface are accumulated in the umbral cavity the compression incident to such accumulation being betrayed by the thickening of certain lines of absorption but there is also a general absorption extending almost continuously from one end of the spotspectrum to the other using however a spectroscope of exceptionally high dispersive power professor young of princeton new jersey succeeded in 1883 in resolving the supposed continuous obscurity of spotspectra into a countless multitude of fine dark lines set very close together462 their structure was seen still more perfectly about five years later by m dunr463 director of the upsala observatory who traced besides some shadowy vestiges of the crowded doublets and triplets forming the array from the spots on to the general solar surface they cease to be separable in the blue part of the spectrum and the ultraviolet radiations of spots show nothing distinctive464 as to the movements of the constipated vapours forming spots the spectroscope is also competent to supply information the principle of the method by which it is procured will be explained farther on suffice it here to say that the transport at any considerable velocity to or from the eye of the gaseous material giving bright or dark lines can be measured by the displacement of such lines from their previously known normal positions in this way movements have been detected in or above spots of enormous rapidity ranging up to 320 miles per second but the result so far has been to negative the ascription to them of any systematic direction uprushes and downrushes are doubtless as father cortie remarks465 correlated phenomena in the production of a sunspot but neither seem to predominate as part of its regular internal economy the same kind of spectroscopic evidence tells heavily against a theory of sunspots started by faye in 1872 he had been foremost in pointing out that the observations of carrington and sprer absolutely forbade the supposition that any phenomenon at all resembling our tradewinds exists in the sun they showed indeed that beyond the parallels of 20 there is a general tendency in spots to a slow poleward displacement while within that zone they incline to approach the equator but their proper movements gave no evidence of uniformly flowing currents in latitude the systematic drift of the photosphere is strictly a drift in longitude its direction is everywhere parallel to the equator this fact being once clearly recognised the solar tornado hypothesis at once fell to pieces but m faye466 perceived another source of vorticose motion in the unequal rotating velocities of contiguous portions of the photosphere the pores with which the whole surface of the sun is studded he took to be the smaller eddies resulting from these inequalities the spots to be such eddies developed into whirlpools it only needs to thrust a stick into a stream to produce the kind of effect designated and it happens that the differences of angular movement adverted to attain a maximum just about the latitudes where spots are most frequent and conspicuous there are however grave difficulties in identifying the two kinds of phenomena one already mentioned is the total absence of the regular swirling motionin a direction contrary to that of the hands of a watch north of the solar equator in the opposite sense south of itwhich should impress itself upon every lineament of a sunspot if the cause assigned were a primary producing and not merely as it possibly may be a secondary determining one the other pointed out by young467 is that the cause is inadequate to the effect the difference of movement or relative drift supposed to occasion such prodigious disturbances amounts at the utmost for two portions of the photosphere 123 miles apart to about five yards a minute thus the friction of contiguous sections must be quite insignificant a view better justified by observation was urged by secchi in and after the year 1872 and was presented in an improved form by professor young in his excellent little book on the sun published in 1882468 spots are manifestly associated with violent eruptive action giving rise to the facul and prominences which usually garnish their borders it is accordingly contended that upon the withdrawal of matter from below by the flinging up of a prominence must ensue a sinkingin of the surface into which the partially cooled erupted vapours rush and settle producing just the kind of darkening by increased absorption told of by the spectroscope round the edges of the cavity the rupture of the photospheric shell will form lines of weakness provocative of further eruptions which will in their turn deepen and enlarge the cavity the phenomenon thus tends to perpetuate itself until equilibrium is at last restored by internal processes a sunspot might then be described as an inverted terrestrial volcano in which the outbursts of heated matter take place on the borders instead of at the centre of the crater while the cooled products gather in the centre instead of at the borders but on the earth the solid crust forcibly represses the steam gathering beneath until it has accumulated strength for an explosion while there is no such restraining power that we know of in the sun zllner indeed adapted his theory of the solar constitution to the special purpose of procuring it yet with very partial success since almost every new fact has proved adverse to his assumptions volcanic action is essentially spasmodic it implies habitual constraint varied by temporary outbreaks inconceivable in a gaseous globe such as we believe the sun to be if the volcanic hypothesis represented the truth no spot could possibly appear without a precedent eruption the real order of the phenomenon however is exceedingly difficult to ascertain nor is it perhaps invariable although in most cases the opening shows first that may be simply because it is more easily seen according to father sidgreaves469 the disturbance has then already passed the incipient stage he considers it indeed highly probable that the preparatory sign of a new spot is always a small bright patch of facula this sequence if established would be fatal to lockyers theory of sunspots communicated to the royal society may 6 1886470 and further developed some months later in his work on the chemistry of the sun spots are represented in it as incidental to a vast system of solar atmospheric circulation starting with the polar out and upflows indicated by observations during some total eclipses and eventuating in the plunge downward from great heights upon the photosphere of prodigious masses of condensed materials from these falls result primarily spots secondarily through the answering uprushes in which chemical and mechanical forces cooperate their girdles of flameprominences the evidence is however slight that such a circulatory flow as would be needed to maintain this supposed cycle of occurrences really prevails in the suns atmosphere and a similar objection applies to an anticyclonic theory so to designate it elaborated by egon von oppolzer in 1893471 august schmidts optical rationale of solar phenomena472 was on the other hand a complete novelty both in principle and development attractive to speculators from its recondite nature and farreaching scope it by no means commended itself to practical observers intolerant of finding the all but palpable realities of their daily experience dealt with as illusory products of circular refraction a singular circumstance has now to be recounted on the 1st of september 1859 while carrington was engaged in his daily work of measuring the positions of sunspots he was startled by the sudden appearance of two patches of peculiarly intense light within the area of the largest group visible his first idea was that a ray of unmitigated sunshine had penetrated the screen employed to reduce the brilliancy of the image but having quickly convinced himself to the contrary he ran to summon an additional witness of an unmistakably remarkable occurrence on his return he was disappointed to find the strange luminous outburst already on the wane shortly afterwards the last trace vanished its entire duration was five minutesfrom 1118 to 1123 am greenwich time and during those five minutes it had traversed a space estimated at 35000 miles no perceptible change took place in the details of the group of spots visited by this transitory conflagration which it was accordingly inferred took place at a considerable height above it473 carringtons account was precisely confirmed by an observation made at highgate mr r hodgson described the appearance seen by him as that of a very brilliant star of light much brighter than the suns surface most dazzling to the protected eye illuminating the upper edges of the adjacent spots and streaks not unlike in effect the edging of the clouds at sunset474 this unique phenomenon seemed as if specially designed to accentuate the inference of a sympathetic relation between the earth and the sun from the 28th of august to the 4th of september 1859 a magnetic storm of unparalleled intensity extent and duration was in progress over the entire globe telegraphic communication was everywhere interruptedexcept indeed that it was in some cases found practicable to work the lines without batteries by the agency of the earthcurrents alone475 sparks issued from the wires gorgeous auror draped the skies in solemn crimson over both hemispheres and even within the tropics the magnetic needle lost all trace of continuity in its movements and darted to and fro as if stricken with inexplicable panic the coincidence was drawn even closer at the very instant476 of the solar outburst witnessed by carrington and hodgson the photographic apparatus at kew registered a marked disturbance of all the three magnetic elements while shortly after the ensuing midnight the electric agitation culminated thrilling the earth with subtle vibrations and lighting up the atmosphere from pole to pole with the coruscating splendours which perhaps dimly recall the times when our ancient planet itself shone as a star here then at least the sun wasin professor balfour stewarts phrasetaken in the act477 of stirring up terrestrial commotions nor have instances since been wanting of an indubitable connection between outbreaks of individual spots and magnetic disturbances four such were registered in 1882 and symptoms of the same kind including the beautiful rose aurora marked the progress across the sun of the enormous spotgroup of february 1892the largest ever recorded at greenwich this extraordinary formation which covered about 1300 of the suns disc survived through five complete rotations478 it was remarkable for a persistent drift in latitude its place altering progressively from 17 to 30 south of the solar equator again the central passage of an enormous spot on september 9 1898 synchronised with a sharp magnetic disturbance and brilliant aurora479 and the coincidence was substantially repeated in march 1899480 when it was emphasised by the prevalent cosmic calm the theory of the connection is indeed far from clear lord kelvin in 1892481 pronounced against the possibility of any direct magnetic action by the sun upon the earth on the ground of its involving an extravagant output of energy but the fact is unquestionable thatin professor bigelows wordsabnormal agitations affect the sun and the earth as a whole and at the same time482 the nearer approach to the event of september 1 1859 was photographically observed by professor george e hale at chicago july 15 1892483 an active spot in the southern hemisphere was the scene of this curiously sudden manifestation during an interval of 12m between two successive exposures a bridge of dazzling light was found to have spanned the boundaryline dividing the twinnuclei of the spot and these after another 27m were themselves almost obliterated by an overflow of farspreading brilliancy yet two hours later no trace of the outburst remained the spot and its attendant facul remaining just as they had been previously to its occurrence unlike that seen by carrington it was accompanied by no exceptional magnetic phenomena although a storm set in next day484 possibly a terrestrial analogue to the former might be discovered in the auroral beam which traversed the heavens during a vivid display of polar lights november 17 1882 and shared there is every reason to believe their electrical origin and character485 meantime m rudolf wolf transferred to the direction of the zrich observatory where he died december 6 1893 had relaxed none of his zeal in the investigation of sunspot periodicity a laborious revision of the entire subject with the aid of fresh materials led him in 1859486 to the conclusion that while the mean period differed little from that arrived at in 1852 of 1111 years very considerable fluctuations on either side of that mean were rather the rule than the exception indeed the phrase sunspot period must be understood as fitting very loosely the great fact it is taken to represent so loosely that the interval between two maxima may rise to sixteen and a half or sink below seven and a half years487 in 1861488 wolf showed and the remark was fully confirmed at kew that the shortest periods brought the most acute crises and vice vers as if for each wave of disturbance a strictly equal amount of energy were available which might spend itself lavishly and rapidly or slowly and parsimoniously but could in no case be exceeded the further inclusion of recurring solar commotions within a cycle of fiftyfive and a half years was simultaneously pointed out and hermann fritz showed soon afterwards that the aurora borealis is subject to an identical double periodicity489 the same inquirer has more recently detected both for auror and sunspots a secular period of 222 years490 and the kew observations indicate for the latter oscillations accomplished within twentysix and twentyfour days491 depending most likely upon the rotation of the sun this is certainly reflected in magnetic and perhaps in auroral periodicity the more closely in fact spotfluctuations are looked into the more complex they prove maxima of one order are superposed upon or in part neutralised by maxima of another order492 originating causes are masked by modifying causes the larger waves of the commotion are indented with minor undulations and these again crisped with tiny ripples while the whole rises and falls with the swell of the great secular wave scarcely perceptible in its progress because so vast in scale the idea that solar maculation depends in some way upon the position of the planets occurred to galileo in 1612493 it has been industriously sifted by a whole bevy of modern solar physicists wolf in 1859494 found reason to believe that the elevenyear curve is determined by the action of jupiter modified by that of saturn and diversified by influences proceeding from the earth and venus its tempting approach to agreement with jupiters period of revolution round the sun indeed irresistibly suggested a causal connection yet it does not seem that the most skilful coaxing of figures can bring about a fundamental harmony carrington pointed out in 1863 that while during eight successive periods from 1770 downwards there were approximate coincidences between jupiters aphelion passages and sunspot maxima the relation had been almost exactly reversed in the two periods preceding that date495 and wolf himself finally concluded that the jovian origin must be abandoned496 m duponchels497 prediction nevertheless of an abnormal retardation of the maximum due in 1881 through certain peculiarities in the positions of uranus and neptune about the time it fell due was partially verified by the event since after an abortive phase of agitation in april 1882 the final outburst was postponed to january 1894 the interval was thus 135 instead of 111 years and it is noticeable that the delay affected chiefly the southern hemisphere alternations of activity in the solar hemispheres were indeed a marked feature of the maximum of 1884 which in m fayes view498 derived thence its indecisive character while sharp strong crises arise with the simultaneous advance of agitation north and south of the solar equator the curve of magnetic disturbance followed with its usual strict fidelity the anomalous fluctuations of the sunspot curve the ensuing minimum occurred early in 1889 and was succeeded in 1894 by a maximum slightly less feeble than its predecessor499 it cannot be said that much progress has been made towards the disclosure of the cause or causes of the sunspot cycle no external influence adequate to the effect has at any rate yet been pointed out most thinkers on this difficult subject provide a quasiexplanation of the periodicity in question through certain assumed vicissitudes affecting internal processes500 sir norman lockyer and e von oppolzer reach the same end by establishing selfcompensatory fluctuations in the solar atmospheric circulation dr schuster resorts to changes in the electrical conductivity of space near the sun501 in all these theories however the course of transition is arbitrarily arranged to suit a period which imposes itself as a fact peremptorily claiming admittance while obstinately defying explanation the question so much discussed as to the influence of sunspots on weather does not admit of a satisfactory answer the facts of meteorology are too complex for easy or certain classification effects owning dependence on one cause often wear the livery of another the meaning of observed particulars may be inverted by situation and yet it is only by the collection and collocation of particulars that we can hope to reach any general law there is however a good deal of evidence to support the opinionthe grounds for which were primarily derived from the labours of dr meldrum at mauritiusthat increased rainfall and atmospheric agitation attend spotmaxima while herschels conjecture of a more copious emission of light and heat about the same epochs has recently obtained some countenance from savlieffs measures showing a gain in the strength of the suns radiation pari passu with increase in the number of spots visible on his surface502 the examination of what we may call the texture of the suns surface derived new interest from a remarkable announcement made by mr james nasmyth in 1862503 he had made as he supposed the discovery that the entire luminous stratum of the sun is composed of a multitude of elongated shining objects on a darker background shaped much like willowleaves of vast size crossing each other in all possible directions and possessed of unceasing relative motions a lively controversy ensued in england and abroad the most powerful telescopes were directed to a scrutiny encompassed with varied difficulties mr dawes was especially emphatic in declaring that nasmyths willowleaves were nothing more than the nodules of sir william herschel seen under a misleading aspect of uniformity and there is little doubt that he was right it is nevertheless admitted that something of the kind may be seen in the penumbr and bridges of spots presenting an appearance compared by dawes himself in 1852 to that of a piece of coarse strawthatching left untrimmed at the edges504 the term granulated suggested by dawes in 1864505 best describes the mottled aspect of the solar disc as shown by modern telescopes and cameras the grains or rather the floccules with which it is thickly strewn have been resolved by langley under exceptionally favourable conditions into granules not above 100 miles in diameter and from these relatively minute elements composing jointly about onefifth of the visible photosphere506 he estimates that threequarters of the entire light of the sun are derived507 janssen agrees so far as to say that if the whole surface were as bright as its brightest parts its luminous emission would be ten to twenty times greater than it actually is508 the rapid changes in the forms of these solar cloudsummits are beautifully shown in the marvellous photographs taken by janssen at meudon with exposures reduced at times to 1100000 of a second by their means also the curious phenomenon known as the rseau photosphrique has been made evident509 this consists in the diffusion over the entire disc of fleeting blurred patches separated by a reticulation of sharplyoutlined and regularlyarranged granules the imperfect definition in the smudged areas may be due to agitations in the solar or terrestrial atmosphere unless it beas dr schemer thinks possible510merely a photographic effect m janssen considers that the photospheric cloudlets change their shape and character with the progress of the sunspot period511 but this is as yet uncertain the grains or more brilliant parts of the photosphere are now generally held to represent the upper termination of ascending and condensing currents while the darker interstices herschels pores mark the positions of descending cooler ones in the penumbr of spots the glowing streams rushing up from the tremendous subsolar furnace are bent sideways by the powerful indraught so as to change their vertical for a nearly horizontal motion and are thus taken as it were in flank by the eye instead of being seen endon in mamelonform this gives a plausible explanation of the channelled structure of penumbr which suggested the comparison to a rude thatch accepting this theory as in the main correct we perceive that the very same circulatory process which in its spasms of activity gives rise to spots produces in its regular course the singular marbled appearance for the recording of which we are no longer at the mercy of the fugitive or delusive impressions of the human retina and precisely this circulatory process it is which gives to our great luminary its permance as a sun or warming and illuminating body

also the accompanying photographs chapter iii recent solar eclipses by observations made during a series of five remarkable eclipses comprised within a period of eleven years knowledge of the solar surroundings was advanced nearly to its present stage each of these events brought with it a fresh disclosure of a definite and unmistakable character we will now briefly review this orderly sequence of discovery photography was first systematically applied to solve the problems presented by the eclipsed sun july 18 1860 it is true that a daguerreotype512 taken by berkowski with the knigsberg heliometer during the eclipse of 1851 is still valuable as a record of the corona of that year and some subsequent attempts were made to register partial phases of solar occultation notably by professor bartlett at west point in 1854513 but the ground remained practically unbroken until 1860 in that year the track of totality crossed spain and thither accordingly warren de la rue transported his photoheliograph and father secchi his sixinch cauchoix refractor the question then primarily at issue was that relating to the nature of the red protuberances although as already stated the evidence collected in 1851 gave a reasonable certainty of their connection with the sun objectors were not silenced and when the side of incredulity was supported by so considerable an authority as m faye it was impossible to treat it with contempt two crucial tests were available if it could be shown that the fantastic shapes suspended above the edge of the dark moon were seen under an identical aspect from two distant stations that fact alone would annihilate the theory of optical illusion or mirage while the certainty that they were progressively concealed by the advancing moon on one side and uncovered on the other would effectually detach them from dependence on our satellite and establish them as solar appendages now both these tests were eminently capable of being applied by photography but the difficulty arose that nothing was known as to the chemical power of the rosy prominencelight while everything depended on its right estimation a shot had to be fired as it were in the dark it was a matter of some surprise and of no small congratulation that in both cases the shot took effect de la rue occupied a station at rivabellosa in the upper ebro valley secchi set up his instrument at desierto de las palmas about 250 miles to the southeast overlooking the mediterranean from the totally eclipsed sun with its strange garland of flames each observer derived several perfectly successful impressions which were found on comparison to agree in the most minute details this at once settled the fundamental question as to the substantial reality of these objects while their solar character was demonstrated by the passage of the moon in front of them indisputably attested by pictures taken at successive stages of the eclipse that forms seeming to defy all laws of equilibrium were nevertheless not wholly evanescent appeared from their identity at an interval of seven minutes during which the lunar shadow was in transit from one station to the other and the singular energy of their actinic rays was shown by the record on the sensitive plates of some prominences invisible in the telescope moreover photographic evidence strongly confirmed the inferencepreviously drawn by grant and others and now with fuller assurance by secchithat an uninterrupted stratum of prominencematter encompasses the sun on all sides forming a reservoir from which gigantic jets issue and into which they subside thus firstfruits of accurate knowledge regarding the solar surroundings were gathered while the value of the brief moments of eclipse gained indefinite increase by supplementing transient visual impressions with the faithful and lasting records of the camera in the year 1868 the history of eclipse spectroscopy virtually began as that of eclipse photography in 1860 that is to say the respective methods then first gave definite results on the 18th of august 1868 the indian and malayan peninsulas were traversed by a lunar shadow producing total obscuration during five minutes and thirtyeight seconds two english and two french expeditions were despatched to the distant regions favoured by an event so propitious to the advance of knowledge chiefly to obtain the verdict of the prism as to the composition of prominences nor were they despatched in vain an identical discovery was made by nearly all the observers at jamkandi in the western ghauts where lieutenant now colonel herschel was posted unremitting bad weather threatened to baffle his eager expectations but during the lapse of the critical five and a half minutes the clouds broke and across the driving wrack a long fingerlike projection jutted out over the margin of the dark lunar globe in another moment the spectroscope was pointed towards it three bright linesred orange and blueflashed out and the problem was solved514 the problem was solved in this general sense that the composition out of glowing vapours of the objects infelicitously termed protuberances or prominences was no longer doubtful although further inquiry was needed for the determination of the particular species to which those vapours belonged similar but more complete observations were made with less atmospheric hindrance by tennant and janssen at guntoor by pogson at masulipatam and by rayet at whatonne on the coast of the malay peninsula the last observer counting as many as nine bright lines515 among them it was not difficult to recognise the characteristic light of hydrogen and it was generally though overhastily assumed that the orange ray matched the luminous emissions of sodium but fuller opportunities were at hand the eclipse of 1868 is chiefly memorable for having taught astronomers to do without eclipses so far at least as one particular branch of solar inquiry is concerned inspired by the beauty and brilliancy of the variously tinted prominencelines revealed to him by the spectroscope janssen exclaimed to those about him je verrai ces lignesl en dehors des clipses on the following morning he carried into execution the plan which formed itself in his brain while the phenomenon which suggested it was still before his eyes it rests upon an easily intelligible principle the glare of our own atmosphere alone hides the appendages of the sun from our daily view to a spectator on an airless planet the central globe would appear attended by all its splendid retinue of crimson prominences silvery corona and farspreading zodiacal light projected on the starspangled black background of an absolutely unilluminated sky now the spectroscope offers the means of indefinitely weakening atmospheric glare by diffusing a constant amount of it over an area widened ad libitum but monochromatic or brightline light is by its nature incapable of being so diffused it can of course be deviated by refraction to any extent desired but it always remains equally concentrated in whatever direction it may be thrown hence when it is mixed up with continuous lightas in the case of the solar flames shining through our atmosphereit derives a relative gain in intensity from every addition to the dispersive power of the spectroscope with which the heterogeneous mass of beams is analysed employ prisms enough and eventually the undiminished rays of persistent colour will stand out from the continually fading rainbowtinted band by which they were at first effectually veiled this janssen saw by a flash of intuition while the eclipse was in progress and this he realised at 10 am next morning august 19 1868the date of the beginning of spectroscopic work at the margin of the unobscured sun during the whole of that day and many subsequent ones he enjoyed as he said the advantage of a prolonged eclipse the intense interest with which he surveyed the region suddenly laid bare to his scrutiny was heightened by evidences of rapid and violent change on the 18th of august during the eclipse a vast spiral structure at least 89000 miles high was perceived planted in surprising splendour on the rim of the interposed moon if was formed as general tennant judged from its appearance in his photographs by the encounter of two mounting torrents of flame and was distinguished as the great horn next day it was in ruins hardly a trace remained to show where it had been516 janssens spectroscope furnished him besides with the strongest confirmation of what had already been reported by the telescope and the camera as to the continuous nature of the scarlet sierra lying at the base of the prominences everywhere at the suns edge the same bright lines appeared it was not until the 19th of september that janssen thought fit to send news of his discovery to europe it seemed little likely to be anticipated yet a few minutes before his despatch was handed to the secretary of the paris academy of sciences a communication similar in purport had been received from sir norman lockyer there is no need to discuss the narrow and wearisome question of priority each of the competitors deserves and has obtained full credit for his invention with noteworthy and confident prescience lockyer in 1866 before anything was yet known regarding the constitution of the red flames ordered a strongly dispersive spectroscope for the express purpose of viewing apart from eclipses the brightline spectrum which he expected them to give various delays however supervened and the instrument was not in his hands until october 16 1868 on the 20th he picked up the vivid rays of which the presence and approximately the positions had in the interim become known but there is little doubt that even without that previous knowledge they would have been found and that the eclipse of august 18 only accelerated a discovery already assured sir william huggins meanwhile had been tending towards the same goal during two and a half years in his observatory at tulse hill the principle of the spectroscopic visibility of prominencelines at the edge of an uneclipsed sun was quite explicitly stated by him in february 1868517 and he devised various apparatus for bringing them into actual view but not until he knew where to look did he succeed in seeing them astronomers thus liberated by the acquisition of power to survey them at any time from the necessity of studying prominences during eclipses were able to concentrate the whole of their attention on the corona the first thing to be done was to ascertain the character of its spectrum this was seen in 1868 only as a faintly continuous one for rayet who seems to have perceived its distinctive bright line far above the summits of the flames connected it nevertheless with those objects on the other hand lieutenant campbell ascertained on the same occasion the polarisation of the coronal light in planes passing through the suns centre518 thereby showing that light to be in whole or in part reflected sunshine but if reflected sunshine it was objected the chief at least of the dark fraunhofer lines should be visible in it as they are visible in moonbeams sky illumination and all other sunderived light the objection was well founded but was prematurely urged as we shall see on the 7th of august 1869 a track of total eclipse crossed the continent of north america diagonally entering at behrings straits and issuing on the coast of north carolina it was beset with observers but the most effective work was done in iowa at des moines professor harkness of the naval observatory washington obtained from the corona an absolutely continuous spectrum slightly less bright than that of the full moon but traversed by a single green ray519 the same green ray was seen at burlington and its position measured by professor young of dartmouth college520 it appeared to coincide with that of a dark line of iron in the solar spectrum numbered 1474 on kirchhoffs scale but in 1876 young was able by the use of greatly increased dispersion to resolve the fraunhofer line 1474 into a pair the more refrangible member of which he considered to be the reversal of the green coronal ray521 scarcely called in question for over twenty years the identification nevertheless broke down through the testimony of the eclipsephotographs of 1898 sir norman lockyer derived from them a position for the line in question notably higher up in the spectrum than that previously assigned to it instead of 5317 its true wavelength proved to be 5303 ten millionths of a millimetre522 nor does it make any show by absorption in dispersed sunlight the originating substance designated coronium of which nothing is known to terrestrial chemistry continues luminous523 at least 300000 miles above the suns surface and is hence presumably much lighter even than hydrogen a further trophy was carried off by american skill524 sixteen months after the determination due to it of the distinctive spectrum of the corona the eclipse of december 22 1870 though lasting only two minutes and ten seconds drew observers from the new as well as from the old world to the shores of the mediterranean janssen issued from beleaguered paris in a balloon carrying with him the vital parts of a reflector specially constructed to collect evidence about the corona but he reached oran only to find himself shut behind a cloudcurtain more impervious than the prussian lines everywhere the sky was more or less overcast lockyers journey from england to sicily and shipwreck in the psyche were recompensed with a glimpse of the solar aureola during one second and a half three parties stationed at various heights on mount etna saw absolutely nothing nevertheless important information was snatched in despite of the elements the prominent event was youngs discovery of the reversing layer as the surviving solar crescent narrowed before the encroaching moon the dark lines of the spectrum he tells us and the spectrum itself gradually faded away until all at once as suddenly as a bursting rocket shoots out its stars the whole field of view was filled with bright lines more numerous than one could count the phenomenon was so sudden so unexpected and so wonderfully beautiful as to force an involuntary exclamation525 its duration was about two seconds and the impression produced was that of a complete reversal of the fraunhofer spectrumthat is the substitution of a bright for every dark line now something of the kind was theoretically necessary to account for the dusky rays in sunlight which have taught us so much and have yet much more to teach us so that although surprising from its transitory splendour the appearance could not strictly be called unexpected moreover its premonitory symptom in the fading out of these rays had been actually described by secchi in 1868526 and looked for by young as the moon covered the sun in august 1869 but with the slit of his spectroscope placed normally to the suns limb the bright lines gave a flash too thin to catch the eye in 1870 the position of the slit was tangentialit ran along the shallow bed of incandescent vapours instead of cutting across it hence his success the same observation was made at xerez de la frontera by mr pye a member of youngs party and although an exceedingly delicate one has since frequently been repeated the whole fraunhofer series appeared bright omitting other instances to maclear herschel and fyers in 1871 at the beginning or end of totality to pogson at the breakup of an annual eclipse june 6 1872 to stone at klipfontein april 16 1874 when he saw the field full of bright lines527 but between the picture presented by the vritable pluie de lignes brilliantes528 which descended into m trpieds spectroscope for three seconds after the disappearance of the sun may 17 1882 and the familiar one of the darkline solar spectrum certain differences were perceiving showing their relation to be not simply that of a positive to a negative impression a reversing layer or stratum of mixed vapours glowing but at a lower temperature than that of the actual solar surface was an integral part of kirchhoffs theory of the production of the fraunhofer lines here it was assumed that the missing rays were stopped and here also it was assumed that the missing rays would be seen bright could they be isolated from the overpowering splendour of their background this isolation is effected by eclipses with the resultbeautifully confirmatory of theoryof reversing or turning from dark to bright the fraunhofer spectrum the completeness and precision of the reversal however could not be visually attested and a quarter of a century elapsed before a successful snapshot provided photographic evidence on the subject it was taken at novaya zemlya by mr shackleton a member of the late sir george badenpowells expedition to observe the eclipse of august 9 1896529 and similar records in abundance were secured during the indian eclipse of january 22 1898530 and the spanishamerican eclipse of may 28 1900531 the result of their leisurely examination has been to verify the existence of a reversinglayer in the literal sense of the term it is true that no single flash photograph is an inverted transcript of the fraunhofer spectrum the lines are indeed in each casespeaking broadlythe same but their relative intensities are widely different yet this need occasion no surprise when we remember that the fraunhofer spectrum integrates the absorption of multitudinous strata various in density and composition while only the upper section of the formation comes within view of the sensitive plates exposed at totalities the lowlying vaporous beds being necessarily covered by the moon the total depth of this glowing envelope may be estimated at 500 to 600 miles and its normal state seems to be one of profound tranquillity judging from the imperturbable aspect of the array of dark lines due to its sifting action upon light the last of the five eclipses which we have grouped together for separate consideration was visible in southern india and australia december 12 1871 some splendid photographs were secured by the english parties on the malabar coast showing for the first time the remarkable branching forms of the coronal emanations but the most conspicuous result was janssens detection of some of the dark fraunhofer lines long vainly sought in the continuous spectrum of the corona chief among these was the dline of sodium the original index it might be said to solar chemistry no proof could be afforded more decisive that this faint echoing back of the distinctive notes of the fraunhofer spectrum that the polariscope had spoken the truth in asserting a large part of the coronal radiance to be reflected sunlight but it is usually so drenched in original luminosity that its special features are almost obliterated janssens success in seizing them was due in part to the extreme purity of the air at sholoor in the neilgherries where he was stationed in part to the use of an instrument adapted by its large aperture and short focus to give an image of the utmost brilliancy his observation repeated during the caroline island eclipse of 1883 was photographically verified ten years later by m de la baume pluvinel in senegal532 an instrument of great value for particular purposes was introduced into eclipsework in 1871 the slitless spectroscope consists simply of a prism placed outside the objectglass of a telescope or the lens of a camera whereby the radiance encompassing the eclipsed sun is separated into as many differently tinted rings as it contains different kinds of light these tinted rings were simultaneously viewed by respighi at poodacottah and by lockyer at baikul their photographic registration by the latter in 1875 initiated the transformation of the slitless spectroscope into the prismatic camera533 meanwhile the use of an ordinary spectroscope by herschel and tennant at dodabetta showed the green ray of coronium to be just as bright in a rift as in the adjacent streamer the visible structure of the corona was thus seen to be independent of the distribution of the gases which enter into its composition by means then of the five great eclipses of 186071 it was ascertained first that the prominences and at least the lower part of the corona are genuine solar appurtenances secondly that the prominences are composed of hydrogen and other gases in a state of incandescence and rise as irregular outliers from a continuous envelope of the same materials some thousands of miles in thickness thirdly that the corona is of a highly complex constitution being made up in part of glowing vapours in part of matter capable of reflecting sunlight we may now proceed to consider the results of subsequent eclipses these have raised and have helped to solve some very curious questions indeed every carefully watched total eclipse of the sun stimulates as well as appeases curiosity and leaves a legacy of outstanding doubt continually as time and inquiry go on removed but continually replaced it cannot be denied that the corona is a perplexing phenomenon and that it does not become less perplexing as we know more about it it presented itself under quite a new and strange aspect on the occasion of the eclipse which visited the western states of north america july 29 1878 the conditions of observation were peculiarly favourable the weather was superb above the rocky mountains the sky was of such purity as to permit the detection of jupiters satellites with the naked eye on several successive nights the opportunity for advancing knowledge was made the most of nearly a hundred astronomers including several englishmen occupied twelve separate posts and prepared for an attack in force the question had often suggested itself and was a natural one to ask whether the corona sympathises with the general condition of the sun whether either in shape or brilliancy it varies with the progress of the sunspot period a more propitious moment for getting this question answered could hardly have been chosen than that at which the eclipse occurred solar disturbance was just then at its lowest ebb the development of spots for the month of july 1878 was represented on wolfs system of relative numbers by the fraction 01 as against 1354 for december 1870 an epoch of maximum activity the chromosphere534 was for the most part shallow and quiescent its depth above the spot zones had sunk from about 6000 to 2000 miles535 prominences were few and faint obviously if a type of corona corresponding to a minimum of sunspots existed it should be seen then or never it was seen but while in some respects it agreed with anticipation in others it completely set it at naught the corona of 1878 as compared with those of 1869 1870 and 1871 was generally admitted to be shrunken in its main outlines and much reduced in brilliancy lockyer pronounced it ten times fainter than in 1871 harkness estimated its light at less than oneseventh that derived from the mistblotted aureola of 1870536 in shape too it was markedly different when sunspots are numerous the corona appears to be most fully developed above the spotzones thus offering to our eyes a rudely quadrilateral contour the four great luminous sheaves forming the corners of the square are made up of rays curving together from each side into synclinal or ogival groups each of which may be compared to the petal of a flower to janssen in 1871 the eclipsing moon seemed like the dark heart of a gigantic dahlia painted in light on the sky and the similitude to the ornament on a compasscard used by airy in 1851 well conveys the decorative effect of the beamy radiated kind of aureola never it would appear absent when solar activity is at a tolerably high pitch in his splendid volume on eclipses537 with which the systematic study of coronal structure may be said to have begun mr ranyard first generalised the synclinal peculiarity by a comparison of records but the symmetry of the arrangement though frequently striking is liable to be confused by secondary formations he further pointed out with the help of careful drawings from the photographs of 1871 made by mr wesley the curved and branching shapes assumed by the component filaments of massive bundles of rays nothing of all this however was visible in 1878 instead there was seen as the groundwork of the corona a ring of pearly light nebulous to the eye but shown by telescopes and in photographs to have a fibrous texture as if made up of tufts of fine hairs north and south a series of short vivid electricallooking flamebrushes diverged with conspicuous regularity from each of the solar poles their direction was not towards the centre of the sun but towards each summit of his axis so that the farther rays on either side started almost tangentially to the surface but the leading and a truly amazing characteristic of the phenomenon was formed by two vast faintlyluminous wings of light expanded on either side of the sun in the direction of the ecliptic these were missed by very few careful onlookers but the extent assigned to them varied with skill in and facilities for seeing by far the most striking observations were made by newcomb at separation wyoming by cleveland abbe from the shoulder of pikes peak and by langley at its summit an elevation of 14100 feet above the sea never before had an eclipse been viewed from anything approaching that altitude or under so translucent a sky a proof of the great reduction in atmospheric glare was afforded by the perceptibility of the corona four minutes after totality was over for the 165 seconds of its duration the remarkable streamers above alluded to continued persistently visible stretching away right and left of the sun to a distance of at least ten million miles one branch was traced over an apparent extent of fully twelve lunar diameters without sign of a definite termination having been reached and there were no grounds for supposing the other more restricted the resemblance to the zodiacal light was striking and a community of origin between that enigmatical member of our system and the corona was irresistibly suggested we should indeed expect to see under such exceptionally favourable atmospheric conditions as professor langley enjoyed on pikes peak the roots of the zodiacal light presenting near the sun just such an appearance as he witnessed but we can imagine no reason why their visibility should be associated with a low state of solar activity nevertheless this seems to be the case with the streamers which astonished astronomers in 1878 for in august 1867 when similar equatorial emanations accompanied by similar symptoms of polar excitement were described and depicted by grosch538 of the santiago observatory sunspots were at a minimum while the corona of 1715 which appears from the record of it by roger cotes539 to have been of the same type preceded by three years the ensuing maximum the eclipsed sun was seen by him at cambridge may 2 1715 encompassed with a ring of light about onesixth of the moons diameter in breadth upon which was superposed a luminous cross formed of long bright branches lying very nearly in the plane of the ecliptic and shorter polar arms so faint as to be only intermittently visible the resemblance between his sketch and cleveland abbes drawing of the corona of 1878 is extremely striking it should nevertheless be noted that some conspicuous spots were visible on the suns disc at the time of cotess eclipse and that the preceding minimum according to wolf occurred in 1712 thus the coincidence of epochs is imperfect professor cleveland abbe was fully persuaded that the long rays carefully observed by him from pikes peak were nothing else than streams of meteorites rushing towards or from perihelion and it is quite certain that the solar neighbourhood must be crowded with such bodies but the peculiar structure at the base of the streamers displayed in the photographs the curved rays meeting in pointed arches like gothic windows the visible upspringing tendency the filamentous texture540 speak unmistakably of the action of forces proceeding from the sun not of extraneous matter circling round him a further proof of sympathetic change in the corona is afforded by the analysis of its light in 1878 the bright line so conspicuous in the coronal spectrum in 1870 and 1871 had faded to the very limit of visibility several skilled observers failed to see it at all but young and eastman succeeded in tracing the green coronium ray all round the sun to a height estimated at 340000 miles the substance emitting it was thus present though in a low state of incandescence the continuous spectrum was relatively strong faint traces of the fraunhofer lines attested for it an origin in part by reflection and polarisation was undoubted increasing towards the limb whereas in 1870 it reached a maximum at a considerable distance from it experiments with edisons tasimeter seemed to show that the corona radiates a sensible amount of heat the next promising eclipse occurred may 17 1882 the concourse of astronomers which has become usual on such occasions assembled this time at sohag in upper egypt rarely have seventyfour seconds been turned to such account to each observer a special task was assigned and the advantages of a strict division of labour were visible in the variety and amount of the information gained the year 1882 was one of numerous sunspots on the eve of the eclipse twentythree separate macul were counted if there were any truth in the theory which connected coronal forms with fluctuations in solar activity it might be anticipated that the vast equatorial expansions and polar brushes of 1878 would be found replaced by the starlike structure of 1871 this expectation was literally fulfilled no lateral streamers were to be seen the universal failure to perceive them after express search in a sky of the most transparent purity justifies the emphatic assertion that they were not there instead the type of corona observed in india eleven years earlier was reproduced with its shining aigrettes complex texture and brilliant radiated aspect concordant testimony was given by the spectroscope the reflected light derived from the corona was weaker than in 1878 while its original emissions were proportionately intensified nevertheless most of the bright lines recorded as coronal541 were really due there can be no doubt to diffused chromospheric light on this occasion the first successful attempt was made to photograph the coronal spectrum procured in the ordinary way with a slit and prisms while the prismatic camera was also profitably employed it served to bring out at least one important factthat of the uncommon strength in chromospheric regions of the twin violet beams of calcium designated h and k and prominencephotography signalised its improvement by the registration in the spectrum of one such object of twentynine rays including many of the ultraviolet hydrogen series discovered by sir william huggins in the emission of white stars542 dr schusters photographs of the corona itself were the most extensive as well as the most detailed of any yet secured one rift imprinted itself on the plates to a distance of nearly a diameter and a half from the limb and the transparency of the streamers was shown by the delineation through them of the delicate tracery beyond the singular and picturesque feature was added of a bright comet selfdepicted in all the exquisite grace of swift movement betrayed by the fine curve of its tail hurrying away from one of its rare visits to our sun and rendered momentarily visible by the withdrawal of the splendour in which it had been and was again quickly veiled from a careful study of these valuable records sir william huggins derived the idea of a possible mode of photographing the corona without an eclipse543 as already stated its ordinary invisibility is entirely due to the glare or reflected light diffused through our atmosphere but huggins found on examining schusters negatives that a large proportion of the light in the coronal spectrum both continuous and interrupted is collected in the violet region between the fraunhofer lines g and h there then he hoped that all other rays being excluded it might prove strong enough to vanquish inimical glare and stamp on prepared plates through local superiority in illuminative power the forms of the appendage by which it is emitted his experiments were begun towards the end of may 1882 and by september 28 he had obtained a fair earnest of success the exclusion of all other qualities of light save that with which he desired to operate was accomplished by using chloride of silver as his sensitive material that substance being chemically inert to all other but those precise rays in which the corona has the advantage544 plates thus sensitised received impressions which it was hardly possible to regard as spurious not only the general features captain abney affirmed545 are the same but details such as rifts and streamers have the same position and form it was found moreover that the corona photographed during the total eclipse of may 6 1883 was intermediate in shape between the coronas photographed by sir william huggins before and after that event each picture taking its proper place in a series of progressive modifications highly interesting in themselves and full of promise for the value of the method employed to record them546 but experiments on the subject were singularly interrupted the volcanic explosion in the straits of sunda in august 1883 brought to astronomers a peculiarly unwelcome addition to their difficulties the magnificent sunglows due to the diffractive effects on light of the vapours and fine dust flung in vast volumes into the air and rapidly diffused all round the globe betokened an atmospheric condition of all others the most prejudicial to delicate researches in the solar vicinity the filmy coronal forms accordingly which had been hopefully traced on the tulse hill plates ceased to appear there nor were any substantially better results obtained by mr c ray woods in the purer air either of the riffel or the cape of good hope during the three ensuing years moreover attempts to obtain coronal photographs during the partial phases of the eclipse of august 29 1886 completely failed no part of the lunar globe became visible in relief against circumfluous solar radiance on any of the plates exposed at grenada and what vestiges of structure there were came out almost better upon the moon than beside her thus stamping themselves at once as of atmospheric origin that the effect sought is a perfectly possible one is proved by the distinct appearance of the moon projected on the corona in photographs of the partially eclipsed sun in 1858 1889 and 1890 and very notably in 1898 and 1900547 in the spring of 1893 professor hale548 attacked the problem of coronal daylight photography employing the doubleslit method so eminently serviceable for the delineation of prominences549 but neither at kenwood nor at the summit of pikes peak whither in the course of the summer he removed his apparatus was any action of the desired kind secured similar ill success attended his and professor riccs employment on mount etna in july 1894 of a specially designed coronagraph yet discouragement did not induce despair the end in view is indeed too important to be readily abandoned but it can be reached only when a more particular acquaintance with the nature of coronal light than we now possess indicates the appropriate device for giving it a preferential advantage in selfportraiture moreover the effectiveness of this device may not improbably be enhanced through changes in the coronal spectrum at epochs of sunspot maximum the prosperous result of the sohag observations stimulated the desire to repeat them on the first favourable opportunity this offered itself one year later may 6 1883 yet not without the drawbacks incident to terrestrial conditions the eclipse promised was of rare length giving no less than five minutes and twentythree seconds of total obscurity but its path was almost exclusively a watertrack it touched land only on the outskirts of the marquesas group in the southern pacific and presented as the one available foothold for observers a coral reef named caroline island seven and a half miles long by one and a half wide unknown previously to 1874 and visited only for the sake of its stores of guano seldom has a more striking proof been given of the vividness of human curiosity as to the condition of the worlds outside our own than in the assemblage of a group of distinguished men from the chief centres of civilisation on a barren ridge isolated in a vast and tempestuous ocean at a distance in many cases of 11000 miles and upwards from the ordinary scene of their labours and all these sacrificesthe cost and care of preparation the transport and readjustment of delicate instruments the contrivance of new and more subtle means of investigating phenomenaon the precarious chance of a clear sky during one particular five minutes the event though fortunate emphasised the hazard of the venture the observation of the eclipse was made possible only by the happy accident of a serene interval between two storms the american expedition was led by professor edward s holden and to it were courteously permitted to be attached messrs lawrance and woods photographers sent out by the royal society of london m janssen was chief of the french academy mission he was accompanied from meudon by trouvelot and joined from vienna by palisa and from rome by tacchini a large share of the work done was directed to assuring or negativing previous results the circumstances of an eclipse favour illusion a single observation by a single observer made under unfamiliar conditions and at a moment of peculiar excitement can scarcely be regarded as offering more than a suggestion for future inquiry but incredulity may be carried too far janssen for instance felt compelled by the survival of unwise doubts to devote some of the precious minutes of obscurity at caroline island to confirming what in his own persuasion needed no confirmationthat is the presence of reflected fraunhofer lines in the spectrum of the corona trouvelot and palisa on the other hand instituted an exhaustive but fruitless search for the spurious intramercurian planets announced by swift and watson in 1878 new information however was not deficient the corona proved identical in type with that of 1882550 agreeably to what was expected at an epoch of protracted solar activity the characteristic aigrettes were of even greater brilliancy than in the preceding year and the chemical effects of the coronal light proved unusually intense janssens photographs owing to the considerable apertures six and eight inches of his objectglasses and the long exposures permitted by the duration of totality were singularly perfect they gave a greater extension to the coronal than could be traced with the telescope551 and showed its forms as absolutely fixed and of remarkable complexity the english pictures taken with exposures up to sixty seconds were likewise of great value they exhibited details of structure from the limb to the tips of the streamers which terminated definitely and as it seemed actually where the impressions on the plates ceased the coronal spectrum was also successfully photographed and although the reversing layer in its entirety evaded record a print was caught of some of its more prominent rays just before and after totality the use of the prismatic camera was baffled by the anomalous scarcity of prominences using an ingenious apparatus for viewing simultaneously the spectrum from both sides of the sun professor hastings noticed at caroline island alternations with the advance of the moon in the respective heights above the right and left solar limbs of the coronal green line which were thought to imply that the corona with its rifts and sheaves and tangled hanks of rays is after all merely an illusive appearance produced by the diffraction of sunlight at the moons edge552 but the observation was assuredly misleading or misinterpreted atmospheric diffusion may indeed under favouring circumstances be effective in deceptively enlarging solar appendages but always to a very limited extent the controversy is an old one as to the part played by our air in producing the radiance visible round the eclipsed sun in its original form it is true it came to an end when professor harkness in 1869553 pointed out that the shadow of the moon falls equally over the air and on the earth and that if the sun had no luminous appendages a circular space of almost absolute darkness would consequently surround the apparent places of the superposed sun and moon mr proctor554 with his usual ability impressed this mathematically certain truth upon public attention and sir john herschel calculated that the diameter of the negative halo thus produced would be in general no less than 23 but about the same time a noteworthy circumstance relating to the state of things in the solar vicinity was brought into view on february 11 1869 messrs frankland and lockyer communicated to the royal society a series of experiments on gaseous spectra under varying conditions of heat and density leading them to the conclusion that the higher solar prominences exist in a medium of excessive tenuity and that even at the base of the chromosphere the pressure is far below that at the earths surface555 this inference was fully borne out by the researches of wllner and janssen expressed the opinion that the chromospheric gases are rarefied almost to the degree of an airpump vacuum556 hence was derived a general and fully justified conviction that there could be outside and incumbent upon the chromosphere no such vast atmosphere as the corona appeared to represent upon the strength of which conviction the glare theory entered chiefly under the auspices of sir norman lockyer upon the second stage of its existence the genuineness of the inner corona to the height of 5 or 6 from the limb was admitted but it was supposed that by the detailed reflection of its light in our air the far more extensive outer corona was optically created the irregularities of the moons edge being called in to account for the rays and rifts by which its structure was varied this view received some countenance from admiral maclears observation during the eclipse of 1870 of bright lines everywhereeven at the centre of the lunar disc here indeed was an undoubted case of atmospheric diffusion but here also was a safe index to the extent of its occurrence light scatters equally in all directions so that when the moons face at the time of an eclipse shows as is the common case a blank in the spectroscope it is quite certain that the corona is not noticeably enlarged by atmospheric causes a sky drifted over with thin cirrus clouds and air changed with aqueous vapour amply accounted for the abnormal amount of scattering in 1870 but even in 1870 positive evidence was obtained of the substantial reality of the radiated outer corona in the appearance on the photographic plates exposed by willard in spain and by brothers in sicily of identical dark rifts the truth is that far from being developed by misty air it is peculiarly liable to be effaced by it the purer the sky the more extensive brilliant and intricate in the details of its structure the corona appears take as an example general myers description of the eclipse of 1869 as seen from the summit of white top mountain virginia at an elevation above the sea of 5523 feet in an atmosphere of peculiar clearness to the unaided eye he wrote557 the eclipse presented during the total obscuration a vision magnificent beyond description as a centre stood the full and intensely black disc of the moon surrounded by the aureola of a soft bright light through which shot out as if from the circumference of the moon straight massive silvery rays seeming distinct and separate from each other to a distance of two or three diameters of the solar disc the whole spectacle showing as on a background of diffused rosecoloured light on the same day at des moines newcomb could perceive through somewhat hazy air no long rays and the fourpointed outline of the corona reached at its farthest only a single semidiameter of the moon from the limb the plain fact that our atmosphere acts rather as a veil to hide the coronal radiance than as the medium through which it is visually formed emerges from further innumerable records no observations of importance were made during the eclipse of september 9 1885 the path of total obscurity touched land only on the shores of new zealand and two minutes was the outside limit of available time hence local observers had the phenomenon to themselves nor were they even favoured by the weather in their efforts to make the most of it one striking appearance was however disclosed it was that of two white prominences of unusual brilliancy shining like a pair of electric lamps hung one at each end of a solar diameter right above the places of two large spots558 this coincidence of diametrically opposite disturbances is of too frequent occurrence to be accidental m trouvelot observed at meudon june 26 1885 two active and evanescent prominences thus situated each rising to the enormous height of 300000 miles and on august 16 one scarcely less remarkable balanced by an antipodal spotgroup559 it towered upward as if by a process of unrolling to a quarter of a million of miles after which in two minutes the light died out of it it had become completely extinct the development again from the ends of a diameter of a pair of similar objects was watched september 19 and 20 1893 by father fnyi director of the kalocsa observatory and the phenomenon has been too often repeated to be accidental the eclipse of august 29 1886 was total during about four minutes over tropical atlantic regions and an english expedition led by sir norman lockyer was accordingly despatched to grenada in the west indies for the purpose of using the opportunity it offered but the rainy season was just then at its height clouds and squalls were the order of the day and the elaborately planned programme of observation could only in part be carried through some good work none the less was done professor tacchini who had been invited to accompany the party ascertained besides some significant facts about prominences from a comparison of their forms and sizes during and after the eclipse it appeared that only the growing vaporous cores of these objects are shown by the spectroscope under ordinary circumstances their upper sections giving a faint continuous spectrum and composed of presumably cooler materials can only be seen when the veil of scattered light usually drawn over them is removed by an eclipse thus all modestly tall prominences have silvery summits but all do not appear to possess the red heart of flame by which alone they can be rendered perceptible to daylight observation some prove to be ordinarily invisible because silvery throughoutsheeted ghosts as it were met only in the dark specimens of the class had been noted as far back as 1842 but tacchini first drew particular attention to them the one observed by him in 1886 rose in a branching form to a height of 150000 miles and gave a brilliantly continuous spectrum with bright lines at h and k but no hydrogenlines560 hence the total invisibility of the object before and after the eclipse during the eclipse it was seen framed as it were in a pointed arch of coronal light the symmetrical arrangement of which with regard to it was obviously significant both its unspringing shape and the violet rays of calcium strongly emitted by it contradicted the supposition that white prominences represent a downrush of refrigerated materials the corona of 1886 as photographed by dr schuster and mr maunder showed neither the petals and plumes of 1871 nor the streamers of 1878 it might be called of a transition type561 wide polar rifts were filled in with tufted radiations and bounded on either side by irregularly disposed compound luminous masses in the southwestern quadrant a triangular ray conspicuous to the naked eye represented mr w h pickering thought the projection of a huge hollow cone562 branched and recurving jets were curiously associated with it the intrinsic photographic brightness of the corona proved from pickerings measures to be about 154 that of the average surface of the full moon the russian eclipse of august 19 1887 can only be remembered as a disastrous failure much was expected of it the shadowpath ran overland from leipsic to the japanese sea so that the solar appurtenances would it was hoped be disclosed to observers echeloned along a line of 6000 miles but the incalculable element of weather rendered all forecasts nugatory the clouds never parted during the critical three minutes over central russia where many parties were stationed and professor d p todd was equally unfortunate in japan some good photographs were nevertheless secured by professor arai director of the tokio observatory as well as by mm blopolsky and glasenapp at petrovsk and jurjevitch respectively they showed a corona of simpler form than that of the year before but not yet of the pronounced type first associated by mr ranyard with the lowest stage of solar activity the genuineness of the association was ratified by the duplicate spectacle of the nextensuing minimum year two total eclipses of the sun distinguished 1889 the first took place on new years day when a narrow shadowpath crossed california allowing less than two minutes for the numerous experiments prompted by the varied nature of modern methods of research american astronomers availed themselves of the occasion to the full the heavens were propitious photographic records were obtained in unprecedented abundance and of unusual excellence their comparison and study placed it beyond reasonable doubt that the radiated corona belonging to periods of maximum sunspots gives place at periods of minimum to the winged type of 1878 professor holden perceived further that the equatorial extensions characterising the latter tend to assume a trumpetshape563 their extremities diverge as if mutually repellent instead of flowing together along a medial plane the maximum actinic brilliancy of the corona of january 1 1889 was determined at lick to be twentyone times less than that of the full moon564 its colour was described as of an intense luminous silver with a bluish tinge similar to the light of an electric arc565 its spectrum was comparatively simple very few bright lines besides those of hydrogen and coronium and apparently no dark ones stood out from the prismatic background the marked structural features of the corona as presented by the negatives taken by professors nipher and charroppin were the filaments and the streamers the filaments issued from polar calottes of 20 radius the impression conveyed to the eye professor pritchett wrote566 is that the equatorial stream of denser coronal matter extends across and through the filaments simply obscuring them by its greater brightness the effect is just as if the equatorial belt were superposed upon or passed through the filamentary structure there is nothing in the photographs to prove that the filaments do not exist all round the sun567 the testimony from negatives of different lengths of exposure goes to show that the equatorial streamers are made up of numerous interlacing parts inclined at varying angles to the suns equator the coronal extensions perceptible with the naked eye to a distance of more than 3 from the sun appeared barely onethird of that length on the best negatives little more could be seen of them either in barnards exquisite miniature pictures or in the photographs obtained by w h pickering with a thirteeninch refractorthe largest instrument so far used in eclipsephotography the total eclipse of december 22 1889 held out a prospect unfortunately not realized of removing some of the doubts and difficulties that impeded the progress of coronal photography568 messrs burnham and schaeberle secured at cayenne some excellent impressions showing enough of the corona to prove its identical character with that depicted in the beginning of the year but not enough to convey additional information about its terminal forms or innermost structure any better result was indeed impossible the moistureladen air having cut down the actinic power of the coronal light to onefourth its previous value two english expeditions organized by the royal astronomical society fared still worse mr taylor was stationed on the west coast of africa one hundred miles south of loanda father perry chose as the scene of his operations the salut islands off french guiana each was supplied with a reflector constructed by dr common endowed by its extremely short focal length of fortyfive combined with an aperture of twenty inches with a lightconcentrating force capable it was hoped of compelling the very filmiest coronal branches to selfregistration had things gone well two sets of coronal pictures absolutely comparable in every respect and taken at an interval of two hours and a half would have been at the disposal of astronomers but things went very far from well clouds altogether obscured the sun in africa they only separated to allow of his shining through a saturated atmosphere in south america father perrys observations were the last heroic effort of a dying man stricken with malaria he crawled to the hospital as soon as the eclipse was over and expired five days later at sea on board the comus he was buried at barbados and the sacrifice of his life had after all purchased no decisive success most of the plates exposed by him suffered deterioration from the climate or from an inevitably delayed development a drawing from the best of them by miss violet common569 represented a corona differing from its predecessor of january 1 chiefly through the oppositely unsymmetrical relations of its parts then the western wing had been broader at its base than the eastern now the inequality was conspicuously the other way570 the next opportunity for retrieving the mischances of the past was offered april 16 1893 the line of totality charted for that day ran from chili to senegambia american parties appropriated the andes both shores of the atlantic were in english occupation french expeditions led by deslandres and bigourdan took up posts south of cape verde a long totality of more than four minutes was favoured by serene skies hence an ample store of photographic data was obtained professor schaeberle of the lick observatory took almost without assistance at mina bronces a mining station 6600 feet above the pacific fiftytwo negatives eight of them with a fortyfoot telescope on a scale of four and a half inches to the solar diameter not only the inner corona but the array of prominences then conspicuous appeared in them to be composed of fibrous jets and arches held to be sections of elliptic orbits described by luminous particles about the suns centre571 one plate received the impression of a curious object572 entangled amidst coronal streamers and the belief in its cometary nature was ratified by the bestowal of a cometmedal in recognition of the discovery similiar paraboloidal forms had nevertheless occasionally been seen to make an integral part of earlier coronas and it remains extremely doubtful whether schaeberles eclipsecomet was justly entitled to the character claimed for it the eclipse of 1893 disclosed a radiated corona such as a year of spotmaximum was sure to bring an unexpected fact about it was however ascertained the coronal has been believed to have much in common with the chromospheric spectrum it proved on investigation with a large prismatic camera employed under sir norman lockyers directions by mr fowler at fundium to be absolutely distinct from it the fundamental green ray had on the west african plates seven more refrangible associates573 but all alike are of unknown origin they may be due to many substances or to one future research will perhaps decide we can at present only say that the gaseous emission of the corona include none from hydrogen helium calcium or any other recognisable terrestrial element deslandres attempt to determine the rotation of the corona through opposite displacements east and west of the interposed moon of the violet calciumlines supposed to make part of the coronal spectrum was thus rendered nugatory yet it gave an earnest of success by definitely introducing the subject into the constantly lengthened programme of eclipsework there is however little prospect of its being treated effectively until the green line is vivified by a fresh access of solar activity the flight of the moons shadow was on august 9 1896 dogged by atrocious weather it traversed besides some of the most inhospitable regions on the earths surface and afforded at the best but a brief interval of obscurity at novaya zemlya however of all places the conditions were tolerably favourable and as we have seen the trophy of a flashspectrograph was carried off some coronal photographs moreover taken by the late sir george badenpowell574 and by m hansky a member of a russian party were marked by features of considerable interest they made apparent a close connection between coronal outflows and chromospheric jets coneshaped beams serving as the sheaths or envelopes of prominences m hansky575 indeed thought that every streamer had a chromospheric eruption at its base further dark veinings of singular shapes unmistakably interrupted the coronal light and bordered brilliant prominences576 reminding us of certain black lines traced by swift across the anvil protuberance august 7 1869577 in type the corona of 1896 reproduced that of 1886 as befitted its intermediate position in the solar cycle the eclipsetrack on january 22 1898 crossed the indian peninsula from viziadrug on the malabar coast to mount everest in the himalayas not a cloud obstructed the view anywhere and an unprecedented harvest of photographic records was garnered the flashspectrum in its successive phases appeared on plates taken by sir norman lockyer mr evershed professor campbell578 and others professor turner579 set on foot a novel mode of research by picturing the corona in the polarised ingredient of its light mrs maunder580 practically solved the problem of photographing the faint coronal extensions one ray on her plates running out to nearly six diameters from the moons limb yet she used a dallmeyer lens of only one and a half inches aperture her success accorded perfectly with professor wadsworths conclusion that effectiveness in delineation by slight contrasts of luminosity varies inversely with aperture triplecoated plates and a comparatively long exposure of twenty seconds contributed to a result unlikely for some time to be surpassed the corona of 1898 presented a mixed aspect the polar plumes due at minimum were combined in it with the quadrilateral ogives belonging to spotmaxima a slow course of transformation in fact seemed in progress and it was found to be completed in 1900 when the eclipse of may 28 revealed the typical halo of a quiescent sun the obscurity on this occasion was shortless than 100 secondsbut was well observed east and west of the atlantic no striking gain in knowledge however resulted important experiments were indeed made on the heat of the corona with langleys bolometer but their upshot can scarcely be admitted as decisive they indicated a marked deficiency of thermal radiations implying for coronal light in professor langleys opinion581 an origin analogous to that of the electric glowdischarge which at low pressures was found by k ngstrm in 1893 to have no invisible heatspectrum582 the corona was photographed by professor barnard at wadesborough north carolina with a 6112foot horizontal coelostat in this instrument of a type now much employed in eclipse operations and first recommended by professor turner a sixinch photographic objective preserved an invariable position while a silvered plane mirror revolving by clockwork once in fortyeight hours since the angle of movement is doubled by reflection supplied the light it brought to a focus a temporary wooden tube connected the lens with the photographic house where the plates were exposed pictures thus obtained with exposures of from one to fourteen seconds were described as remarkably sharp and perfectly defined showing the prominences and inner corona very beautifully the polar fans came out magnificently583 the great sumatra eclipse left behind it manifold memories of foiled expectations a totality of above six minutes drew observers to the far east from several continents each cherishing a plan of inquiry which few were destined to execute all along the line of shadow which on may 18 1901 crossed runion and mauritius and again met land at sumatra and borneo the meteorological forecast was dubious and the meteorological actuality in the main deplorable nevertheless the corona was seen and fairly well photographed through drifting clouds and proved to resemble in essentials the appendage viewed a year previously negatives taken by members of the lick observatory expedition led by mr perrine584 disclosed the unique phenomenon of a violent coronal disturbance with a small compact prominence as its apparent focus tumbling masses and irregular streamers radiating from a point subsequently shown by the greenwich photographs to be the seat of a conspicuous spot suggested the recent occurrence of an explosion the farreaching effects of which might be traced in the confused floccular luminosity of a vast surrounding region again photographs in polarised light attested the radiance of the outer corona to be in large measure reflected while that of the inner ring was original and the inference was confirmed by spectrographs recording many fraunhofer lines when the slit lay far from the suns limb but none in its immediate vicinity on plates exposed by mr dyson and dr humphrys with special apparatus the coronal spectrum continuous and linear impressed itself more extensively in the ultraviolet than on any previous occasion and dr mitchell succeeded in photographing the reversing layer by means of a grating spectroscope finally mrs maunder at mauritius despite mischievous atmospheric tremors obtained with the newbegin telescope an excellent series of coronal pictures585 the principles of explanation applied to the corona may be briefly described as eruptive and electrical the first was adopted by professor schaeberle in his mechanical theory advanced in 1890586 according to this view the eclipsehalo consists of streams of matter shot out with great velocity from the spotzones by forces acting perpendicularly to the suns surface the component particles return to the sun after describing sections of extremely elongated ellipses unless their initial speed happen to equal or exceed the critical rate of 383 miles a second in which case they are finally driven off into space the perspective overlapping and interlacing of these incandescent outflows was supposed to occasion the intricacies of texture visible in the corona and it should be recorded that a virtually identical conclusion was reached by mr perrine in 1901587 by a different train of reasoning based upon a distinct set of facts a theory on very much the same lines was moreover worked out by m blopolsky in 1897588 schaeberle however had the merit of making the first adequate effort to deduce the real shape of the corona as it exists in three dimensions from its projection upon the surface of the sphere he failed indeed to account for the variation in coronal types by the changes in our situation with regard to the suns equator it is only necessary to remark that if this were so they should be subject to an annual periodicity of which no trace can be discerned electromagnetic theories have the charm and the drawback of dealing largely with the unknown but they are gradually losing the vague and intangible character which long clung to them and the improved definition of their outlines has not so far brought them into disaccord with truth the most promising hypothesis of the kind is due to professor bigelow of washington his able discussion of the eclipse photographs of january 1 1889589 showed a striking agreement between the observed coronal forms and the calculated effects of a repulsive influence obeying the laws of electric potential also postulated by huggins in 1885590 finely subdivided matter expelled from the sun along lines of force emanating from the neighbourhood of his poles thus tends to accumulate at equipotential surfaces in deference however to a doubt more strongly felt then than now whether the presence of free electricity is compatible with the solar temperature he avoided any express assertion that the coronal structure is an electrical phenomenon merely pointing out that if it were its details would be just what they are later in 1892 pupin in america591 and ebert in germany592 imitated the coronal streamers by means of electrical discharges in low vacua between small conducting bodies and strips of tinfoil placed on the outside of the containing glass receptacles finally a critical experiment made by ebert in 1895 served as bigelow justly said to clear up the entire subject and put the theory on a working basis having obtained coronoidal effects in the manner described he proceeded to subject them to the action of a strong magnetic field with the result of marshalling the scattered rays into a methodical and highly suggestive array they followed the direction of the magnetic lines of force and forsaking the polar collar of the magnetised sphere surrounded it like a ruffle the obvious analogy with the aurora polaris and the solar corona was insisted upon by ebert himself and has been further developed by bigelow593 according to a recent modification of his hypothesis the latter appendage is controlled by two opposing systems of forces the magnetic causing the rays to diverge from the poles towards the equator and the electrostatic urging their spread through the mutual repulsion of the particles accumulated in the wings from the equator towards either pole the cyclical change in the corona he adds is probably due to a variation in the balance of power thus established the magnetic polar influence dominating at minima the electrostatic at maxima and he may well feel encouraged by the fortunate combination of many experimental details into one explanatory whole no less than by the hopeful prospect of further developments both practical and theoretical along the same lines what we really know about the corona can be summed up in a few words it is certainly not a solar atmosphere it does not gravitate upon the suns surface and share his rotation as our air gravitates upon and shares the rotation of the earth and this for the simple reason that there is no visible growth of pressure downwards of which the spectroscope would infallibly give notice in its gaseous constituents whereas under the sole influence of the suns attractive power their density should be multiplied many million times in the descent through a mere fraction of their actual depth594 they are apparently in a perpetual state of efflux from and influx to our great luminary under the stress of opposing forces it is not unlikely that some part at least of the coronal materials are provided by eruptions from the body of the sun595 it is almost certain that they are organized and arranged round it through electromagnetic action this however would seem to be influential only upon their whitehot or reflective ingredients out of which the streamers and aigrettes are composed since the coronal gases appear from observations during eclipses to form a shapeless envelope with condensations above the spotzones or at the bases of equatorial extensions the corona is undoubtedly affected both in shape and constitution by the periodic ebb and flow of solar activity its lowtide form being winged its hightide form stellate while the rays emitted by the gases contained in it fade and the continuous spectrum brightens at times of minimum sunspots the appendage as a whole must be of inconceivable tenuity since comets cut their way through it without experiencing sensible retardation not even sir william crookess vacua can give an idea of the rarefaction which this fact implies yet the observed luminous effects may not in reality bear witness contradictory of it one solitary molecule in each cubic inch of space might in professor youngs opinion produce them while in the same volume of ordinary air at the sealevel the molecules number according to dr johnstone stoney 20000 trillions the most important lesson however derived from eclipses is that of partial independence of them some of its fruits in the daily study of prominences the next chapter will collect and the harvest has been rendered more abundant as well as more valuable since it has been found possible to enlist in this department too the versatile aid of the camera footnotes footnote 512 vierteljahrsschrift astr ges jahrg xxvi p 274 footnote 513 astr jour vol iv p 33 footnote 514 proc roy soc vol xvii p 116

solar surroundings in the second 1845 and later editions of his treatise on astronomy chapter iv solar spectroscopy the new way struck out by janssen and lockyer was at once and eagerly followed in every part of europe as well as in north america observers devoted themselves to the daily study of the chromosphere and prominences foremost among these were lockyer in england zllner at leipzig sprer at anclam young at hanover new hampshire secchi and respighi at rome there were many others but these names stood out conspicuously the first point to be cleared up was that of chemical composition leisurely measurements verified the presence above the suns surface of hydrogen in prodigious volumes but showed that sodium had nothing to do with the orangeyellow ray identified with it in the haste of the eclipse from its vicinity to the dpair than which it is slightly more refrangible the prominenceline was however designated d3 and the unknown substance emitting it was named by lockyer helium its terrestrial discovery ensued after twentysix years in march 1895 professor ramsay obtained from the rare mineral clevite a volatile gas the spectrum of which was found to include the yellow prominenceray helium was actually at hand and available for examination the identification cleared up many obscurities in chromospheric chemistry several bright lines persistently seen at the edge of the sun and early suspected by young596 to emanate from the same source as d3 were now derived from helium in the laboratory and all the complex emissions of that exotic substance ranged themselves into six sets or series the members of which are mutually connected by numerical relations of a definite and simple kind helium is of rather more than twice the density of hydrogen and has no chemical affinities in almost evanescent quantities it lurks in the earths crust and is diffused through the earths atmosphere the importance of the part played in the prominencespectrum by the violet line of calcium was noticed by professor young in 1872 but since h and k lie near the limit of the visible spectrum photography was needed for a thorough investigation of their appearances aided by its resources professor george e hale then at the beginning of his career detected in 1889 their unfailing and conspicuous presence597 the substance emitting them not only constitutes a fundamental ingredient of the chromosphere but rises in the fantastic jets thence issuing to greater heights than hydrogen itself the isolation of h and k in solar prominences from any other of the lines usually distinctive of calcium was experimentally proved by sir william and lady huggins in 1897 to be due to the extreme tenuity of the emitting vapour598 hydrogen helium and calcium form then the chief and unvarying materials of the solar sierra and its peaks but a number of metallic elements make their appearance spasmodically under the influence of disturbances in the layers beneath in september 1871 young599 drew up at dartmouth college a list of 103 lines significant of injections into the chromosphere of iron titanium chromium magnesium and many other substances during two months observation in the pure air of mount sherman 8335 feet high in the summer of 1872 these telltale lines mounted up to 273600 and he believes their number might still be doubled by steady watching indeed both young and lockyer have more than once seen the whole field of the spectroscope momentarily inundated with bright rays as if the reversing layer had been suddenly thrust upwards into the chromosphere and as quickly allowed to drop back again the opinion would thus appear to be wellgrounded that the two form one continuous region of which the lower parts are habitually occupied by the heaviest vapours but where orderly arrangement is continually overturned by violent eruptive disturbances the study of the forms of prominences practically began with hugginss observation of one through an open slit february 13 1869601 at first it had been thought possible to examine them only in sectionsthat is by admitting mere narrow strips or lines of their various kinds of light while the actual shape of the objects emitting those lines had been arrived at by such imperfect devices as that of giving to the slit of the spectroscope a vibratory moment rapid enough to enable the eye to retain the impression of one part while others were successively presented to it it was an immense gain to find that their rays had strength to bear so much of dilution with ordinary light as was involved in opening the spectroscopic shutter wide enough to exhibit the treelike or hornlike or flameshaped bodies rising over the suns rim in their undivided proportions several diverselycoloured images of them are formed in the spectroscope each may be seen under a crimson a yellow a green and a deep blue aspect the crimson however built up out of the cline of hydrogen is the most intense and is commonly used for purposes of observation and illustration friedrich zllner was by a few days beforehand with huggins in describing the openslit method but was somewhat less prompt in applying it his first survey of a complete prominence pictured in and not simply intersected by the slit of his spectroscope was obtained july 1 1869602 shortly afterwards the plan was successfully adopted by the whole band of investigators a difference in kind was very soon perceived to separate these objects into two wellmarked classes its natural and obvious character was shown by its having struck several observers independently the distinction of cloudprominences from flameprominences was announced by lockyer april 27 by zllner june 2 and by respighi december 4 1870 the first description are tranquil and relatively permanent sometimes enduring without striking change for many days certain of the included species mimic terrestrial cloudscenerynow appearing like fleecy cirrus transpenetrated with the red glow of sunsetnow like prodigious masses of cumulostratus hanging heavily above the horizon the solar clouds however have the peculiarity of possessing stems slender columns can ordinarily be seen to connect the surface of the chromosphere with its outlying portions hence the fantastic likeness to forest scenery presented by the long ranges of fiery trunks and foliage occasionally seeming to fringe the suns limb but while this mode of structure suggests an actual outpouring of incandescent material certain facts require a different interpretation at a distance and quite apart from the chromosphere prominences have been perceived both by secchi and young to form just as clouds form in a clear sky condensation being replaced by ignition filaments were then thrown out downward towards the chromosphere and finally the usual appearance of a stemmed prominence was assumed still more remarkable was an observation made by trouvelot at harvard college observatory june 26 1874603 a gigantic commashaped prominence 82000 miles high vanished from before his eyes by a withdrawal of light as sudden as the passage of a flash of lightning the same observer has frequently witnessed a gradual illumination or gradual extinction of such objects testifying to changes in the thermal or electrical condition of matter already in situ the first photograph of a prominence as shown by the spectroscope in daylight was taken by professor young in 1870604 but neither his method nor that described by dr braun in 1872605 had any practical success this was reserved to reward the efforts towards the same end of professor hale begun at harvard college in 1889606 they were prosecuted soon afterwards at the kenwood observatory chicago the great difficulty was to extricate the coloured image of the gaseous structure spectroscopically visible at the suns limb from the encompassing glare a very little of which goes a long way in fogging sensitive plates to counteract its mischievous effects a second slit607 besides the usual narrow one in front of the collimator was placed on guard as it were behind the dispersing apparatus so as to shut out from the sensitised surface all light save that of the required quality the suns image being then allowed to drift across the outer slit while the plate holder was kept moving at the same rate the successive sectional impressions thus rapidly obtained finally built up a complete picture of the prominence another expedient was soon afterwards contrived608 the h and k rays of calcium are always as we have seen bright in the spectrum of prominences they are besides fine and sharp while the corresponding absorptionlines in the ordinary solar spectrum are wide and diffuse hence prominences formed by the spectroscope out of these particular qualities of violet light can be photographed entire and at once for the simple reason that they are projected upon a naturally darkened background atmospheric glare is abolished by local absorption this beautiful method was first realised by professor hale in june 1891 a spectroheliograph consisting of a spectroscopic and a photographic apparatus of special type attached to the eyeend of an equatoreal twelve inches in aperture was erected at kenwood in march 1891 and with its aid professor hale entered upon original researches of high promise for the advancement of solar physics noteworthy above all is his achievement of photographing both prominences and facul on the very face of the sun the latter had until then been very imperfectly observed they were only visible in fact when relieved by their brilliancy against the dusky edge of the solar disc their convenient emission of calcium light however makes it possible to photograph them in all positions and emphasises their close relationship to prominences the simultaneous picturing moreover of the entire chromospheric ring with whatever trees or fountains of fire chance to be at the moment issuing from it has been accomplished by a very simple device the disc of the sun itself having been screened with a circular metallic diaphragm it is only necessary to cause the slit to traverse the virtually eclipsed luminary in order to get an impression of the whole round of its fringing appendages and the record can be extended to the disc by removing the screen and carrying the slit back at a quicker rate when an image of the suns surface with the facul and spots is formed on the plate exactly within the image of the chromosphere formed during the first exposure the whole operation professor hale continues is completed in less than a minute and the resulting photographs give the first true pictures of the sun showing all of the various phenomena at its surface609 most of these novel researches were by a remarkable coincidence pursued independently and contemporaneously by m deslandres of the paris observatory610 the ultraviolet prominence spectrum was photographed for the first time from an uneclipsed sun in june 1891 at chicago besides h and k four members of the hugginsseries of hydrogenlines imprinted themselves on the plate611 meanwhile m deslandres was enabled by fitting quartz lenses to his spectroscope and substituting a reflecting for a refracting telescope to get rid of the obstructive action of glass upon the shorter lightwaves and thus to widen the scope of his inquiry into the peculiarities of those derived from prominences612 as the result not only all the nine whitestar lines were photographed from a brilliant sunflame but five additional ones were found to continue the series upward the wavelengths of these last had moreover been calculated beforehand with singular exactness from a simple formula known as balmers law613 the new lines accordingly filled places in a manner already prepared for them and were thus unmistakably associated with the hydrogenspectrum this is now known to be represented in prominences by twentyseven lines614 forming a kind of harmonic progression only four of which are visibly darkened in the fraunhofer spectrum of the sun plate i illustration photographs of the solar chromosphere and prominences taken with the spectroheliograph of the kenwood observatory chicago by professor george e hale the chemistry of cloudprominences is simple hydrogen helium and calcium are their chief constituents flameprominences on the other hand show in addition the characteristic rays of a number of metals among which iron titanium barium strontium sodium and magnesium are conspicuous they are intensely brilliant sharply defined in their varying forms of jets spikes fountains waterspouts of rapid formation and speedy dissolution seldom attaining to the vast dimensions of the more tranquil kind eruptive or explosive by origin they occur in close connection with spots whether causally the materials ejected as flames cooling and settling down as dark depressed patches of increased absorption615 or consequentially as a reactive effect of falls of solidified substances from great heights in the solar atmosphere616 the two classes of phenomena at any rate stand in a most intimate relation they obey the same law of periodicity and are confined to the same portions of the suns surface while quiescent prominences may be found right up to the poles and close to the equator the general distribution of prominences including both genera follows that of facul much more closely than that of spots from father secchis and professor respighis observations 186971 were derived the first clear ideas on the subject which have been supplemented and modified by the later researches of professors tacchini and ricc at rome and palermo the results are somewhat complicated but may be stated broadly as follows the district of greatest prominencefrequency covers and overlaps by several degrees that of the greatest spotfrequency that is to say it extends to about 40 north and south of the equator617 there is a visible tendency to a second pair of maxima nearer the poles the poles themselves as well as the equator are regions of minimum occurrence distribution in time is governed by the spotcycle but the maximum lasts longer for prominences than for spots the structure of the chromosphere was investigated in 1869 and subsequent years by professor respighi director of the capitoline observatory as well as by sprer and brdikhine of the moscow observatory they found this supposed solar envelope to be of the same eruptive nature as the vast protrusions from it and to be made up of a congeries of minute flames618 set close together like blades of grass the appearance professor young writes619 which probably indicates a fact is as if countless jets of heated gas were issuing through vents and spiracles over the whole surface thus clothing it with flame which heaves and tosses like the blaze of a conflagration the summits of these filaments of fire are commonly inclined as if by a wind sweeping over them when the suns activity is near its height but erect during his phase of tranquillity sprer in 1871 inferred the influence of permanent polar currents620 but tacchini showed in 1876 that the deflections upon which this inference was based ceased to be visible as the spotminimum drew near621 another peculiarity of the chromosphere denoting the remoteness of its character from that of a true atmosphere622 is the irregularity of its distribution over the suns surface there are no signs of its bulging out at the equator as the laws of fluid equilibrium in a rotating mass would require but there are some that the fluctuations in its depth are connected with the phases of solar agitation at times of minimum it seems to accumulate and concentrate its activity at the poles while maxima probably bring a more equable general distribution with local depressions at the base of great prominences and above spots a lowlying stratum of carbonvapour was in 1897 detected in the chromosphere by professor hale with a gratingspectroscope attached to the 40inch yerkes refractor623 the eclipsephotographs of 1893 disclosed to hartleys examination the presence there of gallium624 and those taken by evershed in 1898 were found by jewell625 to be crowded with ultraviolet lines of the equally rare metal scandium the general rule had been laid down by sir norman lockyer that the metallic radiations from the chromosphere are those enhanced in the electric spark626 hence the comparative study of conditions prevalent in the arc and the spark has acquired great importance in solar physics the reality of the appearance of violent disturbance presented by the flaming kind of prominence can be tested in a very remarkable manner christian doppler627 professor of mathematics at prague enounced in 1842 the theorm that the colour of a luminous body like the pitch of a sonorous body must be changed by movements of approach or recession the reason is this both colour and pitch are physiological effects depending not upon absolute wavelength but upon the number of waves entering the eye or ear in a given interval of time and this number it is easy to see must be increased if the source of light or sound is diminishing its distance and diminished if it is decreasing it in the one case the vibrating body pursues and crowds together the waves emanating from it in the other it retreats from them and so lengthens out the space covered by an identical number the principle may be thus illustrated suppose shots to be fired at a target at fixed intervals of time if the marksman advances say twenty paces between each discharge of his rifle it is evident that the shots will fall faster on the target than if he stood still if on the contrary he retires by the same amount they will strike at correspondingly longer intervals the result will of course be the same whether the target or the marksman be in movement so far doppler was altogether right as regards sound anyone can convince himself that the effect he predicted is a real one by listening to the alternate shrilling and sinking of the steamwhistle when an express train rushes through a station but in applying this principle to the colours of stars he went widely astray for he omitted from consideration the double range of invisible vibrations which partake of and to the eye exactly compensate changes of refrangibility in the visible rays there is then no possibility of finding a criterion of velocity in the hue of bodies shining like the sun and stars with continuous light the entire spectrum is slightly shifted up or down in the scale of refrangibility certain rays normally visible become exalted or degraded as the case may be into invisibility and certain other rays at the opposite end undergo the converse process but the sum total of impressions on the retina continues the same we are not however without the means of measuring this subsensible transportation of the lightgamut once more the wonderful fraunhofer lines came to the rescue they were called by the earlier physicists fixed lines but it is just because they are not fixed that in this instance we find them useful they share and in sharing betray the general shift of the spectrum this aspect of dopplers principle was adverted to by fizeau in 1848628 and the first tangible results in the estimation of movements of approach and recession between the earth and the stars were communicated by sir william huggins to the royal society april 23 1868 eighteen months later zllner devised his reversionspectroscope629 for doubling the measurable effects of linedisplacements aided by which ingenious instrument and following a suggestion of its inventor professor h c vogel succeeded at bothkamp june 9 1871630 in detecting effects of that nature due to the solar rotation this application constitutes at once the test and the triumph of the method631 the eastern edge of the sun is continually moving towards us with an equatorial speed of about a mile and a quarter per second the western edge retreating at the same rate the displacementstowards the violet on the east towards the red on the westcorresponding to this velocity are very small so small that it seems hardly credible that they should have been laid bare to perception they amount to but 1150th part of the interval between the two constituents of the dline of sodium and the dline of sodium itself can be separated into a pair only by a powerful spectroscope nevertheless professor young632 was able to show quite satisfactorily in 1876 not only deviations in the solar lines from their proper places indicating a velocity of rotation 142 miles per second slightly in excess of that given by observations of spots but the exemption of terrestrial lines those produced by absorption in the earths atmosphere from the general push upwards or downwards shortly afterwards professor langley then director of the allegheny observatory having devised a means of comparing with great accuracy light from different portions of the suns disc found that while the obscure rays in two juxtaposed spectra derived from the solar poles were absolutely continuous no sooner was the instrument rotated through 90 so as to bring its luminous supplies from opposite extremities of the equator than the same rays became perceptibly notched the telluric lines meanwhile remained unaffected so as to be virtually mapped by the process633 this rapid and unfailing mode of distinction was used by cornu with perfect ease during his investigation of atmospheric absorption near loiret in august and september 1883634 a beautiful experiment of the same kind was performed by m thollon of m bischoffsheims observatory at nice in the summer of 1880635 he confined his attention to one delicately defined group of four lines in the orange of which the inner pair are solar iron and the outer terrestrial at the centre of the sun the intervals separating them were sensibly equal but when the light was taken alternately from the right and left limbs a relative shift in alternate directions of the solar towards and from the stationary telluric rays became apparent a parallel observation was made at dunecht december 14 1883 when it was noticed that a strong ironline in the yellow part of the solar spectrum is permanently double on the suns eastern but single on his western limb636 opposite motiondisplacements bringing about this curious effect of coincidence with and separation from an adjacent stationary line of our own atmospheres production according as the spectrum is derived from the retreating or advancing margin of the solar globe statements of fact so precise and authoritative amount to a demonstration that results of this kind are worthy of confidence and they already occupy an important place among astronomical data the subtle method of which they served to assure the validity was employed in 18879 by m dunr to test and extend carringtons and sprers conclusions as to the anomalous nature of the suns axial movement637 his observations for the purpose made with a fine diffractionspectroscope just then mounted at the observatory of upsala were published in 1891638 their upshot was to confirm and widen the law of retardation with increasing latitude derived from the progressive motions of spots determinations made within 15 of the pole consequently far beyond the region of spots gave a rotationperiod of 3812 that of the equatorial belt being of 2512 days spots near the equator indeed complete their rounds in a period shorter by at least half a day and proportionate differences were found to exist elsewhere in corresponding latitudes but dunrs observations it must be remembered apply to a distinct part of the complex solar machine from the disturbed photospheric surface it is amply possible that the absorptive strata producing the fraunhofer lines significant by their varying displacements at either limb of the inferred varying rates of rotation may gyrate more slowly than the spotgenerating level moreover facul appear to move at a quicker pace than either639 so that we have for three solar formations three different periods of average rotation the shortest of which belongs to the facul one of intermediate length to the spots and the most protracted to the reversing layer all however agree in lengthening progressively from the equator towards the poles professor holden aptly compared the sun to a vast whirlpool where the velocities of rotation depend not only on the situation of the rotating masses as to latitude but also as to depth beneath the exterior surface640 sir norman lockyer641 promptly perceived the applicability of the surprising discovery of lineshiftings through endon motion to the study of prominences the discontinuous light of which affords precisely the same means of detecting movement without seeming change of place as do lines of absorption in a continuous spectrum indeed his observations at the suns edge almost compelled recourse to an explanation made available just when the need of it began to be felt he saw bright lines not merely pushed aside from their normal places by a barely perceptible amount but bent torn broken as if by the stress of some tremendous violence these remarkable appearances were quite simply interpreted as the effects of movements varying in amount and direction in the different parts of the extensive mass of incandescent vapours falling within a single field of view very commonly they are of a cyclonic character the opposite distortions of the same coloured rays betray the fury of countergales rushing along at the rate of 120 miles a second while their undisturbed sections prove the persistence of a heart of peace in the midst of that unimaginable fiery whirlwind velocities up to 250 miles a second or 15000 times that of an express train at the top of its speed were thus observed by young during his trip to mount sherman august 2 1872 and these were actually doubled in an extraordinary outburst observed by father jules fnyi on june 17 1891 at the haynald observatory in hungary as well as by m trouvelot at meudon642 motions ascertainable in this way near the limb are of course horizontal as regards the suns surface the analogies they present might accordingly be styled meteorological rather than volcanic but vertical displacements on a scale no less stupendous can also be shown to exist observations of the spectra of spots centrally situated where motions in the line of sight are vertical disclose the progress of violent uprushes and downrushes of ignited gases for the most part in the penumbral or outlying districts they appear to be occasioned by fitful and irregular disturbances and have none of the systematic quality which would be required for the elucidation of sunspot theories indeed they almost certainly take place at a great height above the actual openings in the photosphere as to vertical motions above the limb on the other hand we have direct visual evidence of a truly amazing kind the projected glowing matter has by the aid of the spectroscope been watched in its ascent on september 7 1871 young examined at noon a vast hydrogen cloud 100000 miles long as it showed to the eye and 54000 high it floated tranquilly above the chromosphere at an elevation of some 15000 miles and was connected with it by three or four upright columns presenting the not uncommon aspect compared by lockyer to that of a grove of banyans called away for a few minutes at 1230 on returning at 1255 the observer found that in the meantime the whole thing had been literally blown to shreds by some inconceivable uprush from beneath in place of the quiet cloud i had left the air if i may use the expression was filled with flying dbrisa mass of detached vertical fusiform filaments each from 10 to 30 long by 2 or 3 wide643 brighter and closer together where the pillars had formerly stood and rapidly ascending they rose with a velocity estimated at 166 miles a second to fully 200000 miles above the suns surface then gradually faded away like a dissolving cloud and at 115 only a few filmy wisps with some brighter streamers low down near the photosphere remained to mark the place644 a velocity of projection of at least 500 miles per second was by proctors645 calculation required to account for this extraordinary display to which the earth immediately responded by a magnetic disturbance and a fine aurora it has proved by no means an isolated occurrence young saw its main features repeated october 7 1881646 on a still vaster scale for the exploded prominence attained this time an altitude of 350000 milesthe highest yet chronicled lockyer moreover has seen a prominence 40000 miles high shattered in ten minutes while uprushes have been witnessed by respighi of which the initial velocities were judged by him to be 400 or 500 miles a second when it is remembered that a body starting from the suns surface at the rate of 383 miles a second would if it encountered no resistance escape for ever from his control it is obvious that we have in the enormous forces of eruption or repulsion manifested in the outbursts just described the means of accounting for the vast diffusion of matter in the solar neighbourhood nor is it possible to explain them away as cornu647 faye648 and others have sought to do by substituting for the rush of matter in motion progressive illumination through electric discharges chemical processes649 or even through the mere reheating of gases cooled by expansion650 all the appearances are against such evasions of the difficulty presented by velocities stigmatised as fabulous and improbable but which there is the strongest reason to believe really exist on the 12th of december 1878 sir norman lockyer formally expounded before the royal society his hypothesis of the compound nature of the chemical elements651 an hypothesis it is true over and over again propounded from the simply terrestrial point of view what was novel was the supraterrestrial evidence adduced in its support and even this had been in a general and speculative way anticipated by professor f w clarke of washington652 lockyer had been led to his conclusion along several converging lines of research in a letter to m dumas dated december 3 1873 he had sketched out the successive stages of celestial dissociation which he conceived to be represented in the sun and stars the absence from the solar spectrum of metalloidal absorption he explained by the separation in the fierce solar furnace of such substances as oxygen nitrogen sulphur and chlorine into simpler constituents possessing unknown spectra while metals were at that time still admitted to be capable of existing there in a state of integrity three years later he shifted his position onward he announced as the result of a comparative study of the fraunhofer and electricarc spectra of calcium that the molecular grouping of that metal which at low temperatures gives a spectrum with its chief line in the blue is nearly broken up in the sun into another or others with lines in the violet653 this came to be regarded by him as a truly typical case654 during four years 187578 inclusive this diligent observer was engaged in mapping a section of the more refrangible part of the solar spectrum wavelengths 38004000 on a scale of magnitude such that if completed down to the infrared its length would have been about half a furlong the attendant laborious investigation by the aid of photography of metallic spectra seemed to indicate the existence of what he called basic lines these held their ground persistently in the spectra of two or more metals after all possible impurities had been eliminated and were therefore held to attest the presence of a common substratum of matter in a simpler state of aggregation than any with which we are ordinarily acquainted later inquiries have shown however that between the spectral lines of different substances there are probably no absolute coincidences basic lines are really formed of doublets or triplets merged together by insufficient dispersion of thalns original list of seventy rays common to several spectra655 very few resisted thollons and youngs powerful spectroscopes and the process of resolution was completed by rowland thus the argument from community of lines to community of substance has virtually collapsed it was replaced by one founded on certain periodical changes on the spectra of sunspots they emerged from a series of observations begun at south kensington under sir norman lockyers direction in 1879 and continued for fifteen years656 the principle of the method employed is this the whole range of fraunhofer lines is visible when the light from a spot is examined with the spectroscope but relatively few are widened now these widened lines alone constitute presumably the true spotspectrum they and they alone tell what kinds of vapour are thrust down into the strange dusky pit of the nucleus the unaffected lines taking their accustomed origin from the overlying strata of the normal solar atmosphere here then we have the criterion that was wantedthe means of distinguishing spectroscopically and chemically between the cavity and the absorbing layers piled up above it by its persistent employment some marked peculiarities have been brought out such as the unfamiliar character of numerous lines in spotspectra especially at epochs of disturbance and the strange individuality in the behaviour of every one of these darkened and distended rays each seems to act on its own account it comports itself as if it were the sole representative of the substance emitting it its appearance is unconditioned by that of any of its terrestrial companions in the same spectrum the most curious fact however elicited by these inquiries was that of the attendance of chemical vicissitudes upon the advance of the sunspot period as the maximum approached unknown replaced known components of the spotspectra in a most pronounced and unmistakable way657 it seemed as if the vapours emitting lines of iron titanium nickel etc had ceased to exist as such and their room been taken by others total strangers in terrestrial laboratories these were held by lockyer to be simply the finer constituents of their predecessors dissociation having been effected by the higher temperature ensuing upon increased solar activity but father corties supplementary investigations at stonyhurst658 modified while they in the main substantiated the south kensington results they showed that the substitution of unknown for known lines characterizes disturbed spots at all stages of the solar cycle so that no systematic course of chemical change can be said to affect the sun as a whole they showed further659from evidence independent of that obtained by young in 1892660the remarkable conspicuousness in spotspectra of vanadium lines excessively faint in the fraunhofer spectrum lockyers unknown lines may probably thus be accounted for they represent absorption not by new but by scarce elements especially father cortie thinks those with atomic weights of about 50 the circumstance of their development in solar commotions largely to the exclusion of iron is none the less curious but it cannot be explained by any process of dissociation the theory has however to be considered under still another aspect it frequently happens that the contortions or displacements due to motion are seen to affect a single line belonging to a particular substance while the other lines of that same substance remain imperturbable now how is this most singular fact which seems at first sight to imply that a body may be at rest and in motion at one and the same instant to be accounted for it is accounted for on the present hypothesis easily enough by supposing that the rays thus discrepant in their testimony do not belong to one kind of matter but to several combined at ordinary temperatures to form a body in appearance elementary of these different vapours one or more may of course be rushing rapidly towards or from the observer while the others remain still and since the line of sight across the average prominenceregion penetrates at the suns edge a depth of about 300000 miles661 all the incandescent materials separately occurring along which line are projected into a single flame or cloud it will be perceived that there is ample room for diversities of behaviour the alternative mode of escape from the perplexity consists in assuming that the vapour in motion is rendered luminous under conditions which reduce its spectrum to a few rays the unaffected lines being derived from a totally distinct mass of the same substance shining with its ordinary emissions662 thus calcium can be rendered virtually monochromatic by attenuation and analogous cases are not rare sir norman lockyer only asks us to believe that effects which follow certain causes on the earth are carried a stage further in the sun where the same causes must be vastly intensified we find that the bodies we call compound split asunder at fixed degrees of heat within the range of our resources why should we hesitate to admit that the bodies we call simple do likewise at degrees of heat without the range of our resources the term element simply expresses terrestrial incapability of reduction that in celestial laboratories the means and their effect here absent should be present would be an inference challenging in itself no expression of incredulity there are indeed theoretical objections to it which though probably not insuperable are unquestionably grave our seventy chemical elements for instance are placed by the law of specific heats on a separate footing from their known compounds we are not it is true compelled by it to believe their atoms to be really and absolutely suchto contain that is the irreducible minimum of material substance but we do certainly gather from it that they are composed on a different principle from the salts and oxides made and unmade at pleasure by chemists then the multiplication of the species of matter with which lockyers results menace us is at first sight startling they may lead we are told to eventual unification but the prospect appears remote their only obvious outcome is the disruption into several constituents of each terrestrial element the components of iron alone should be counted by the dozen and there are other metals such as cerium which giving a still more complex spectrum would doubtless be still more numerously resolved sir norman lockyer interprets the observed phenomena as indicating the successive combinations in varying proportions of a very few original ingredients663 but no definite sign of their existence is perceptible protyle seems likely long to evade recognition and the only intelligible underlying principle for the reasonings employedthat of one line one elementimplies a throng beyond counting of formative material units thus added complexity is substituted for that fundamental unity of matter which has long formed the dream of speculators and it is extremely remarkable that sir william crookes working along totally different lines has been led to analogous conclusions to take only one example as the outcome of extremely delicate operations of sifting and testing carried on for years he finds that the metal yttrium splits up into five if not eight constituents664 evidently old notions are doomed nor are any preconceived ones likely to take their place it would seem on the contrary as if their complete reconstruction were at hand subversive facts are steadily accumulating the revolutionary ideas springing from them tend if we interpret them aright towards the substitution of electrical for chemical theories of matter dissociation by the brute force of heat is already nearly superseded in the thoughts of physicists by the more delicate process of ionisation precisely what this implies and involves we do not know but the symptoms of its occurrence are probably altogether different from those gathered by sir norman lockyer from the collation of celestial spectra a j ngstrm of upsala takes rank after kirchhoff as a subordinate founder so to speak of solar spectroscopy his great map of the normal solar spectrum665 was published in 1868 two years before he died robert thaln was his coadjutor in its execution and the immense labour which it cost was amply repaid by its eminent and lasting usefulness for more than a score of years it held its ground as the universal standard of reference in all spectroscopic inquiries within the range of the visible emanations those that are invisible by reason of the quickness of their vibrations were mapped by dr henry draper of new york in 1873 and with superior accuracy by m cornu in 1881 the infrared part of the spectrum investigated by langley abney and knut ngstrm reaches perhaps no definite end the radiations oscillating too slowly to affect the eye as light may pass by insensible gradations into the long hertzian waves of electricity666 professor rowlands photographic map of the solar spectrum published in 1886 and in a second enlarged edition in 1889 opened fresh possibilities for its study from far down in the red to high up in the ultraviolet and the accompanying scale of absolute wavelengths667 has been with trifling modifications universally adopted his new table of standard solar lines was published in 1893668 through his work indeed knowledge of the solar spectrum so far outstripped knowledge of terrestrial spectra that the recognition of their common constituents was hampered by intolerable uncertainties thousands of the solar lines charted with minute precision remained unidentified for want of a corresponding precision in the registration of metallic lines rowland himself however undertook to provide a remedy aided by lewis e jewell he redetermined at the johns hopkins university the wavelengths of about 16000 solar lines669 photographing for comparison with them the spectra of all the known chemical elements except gallium of which he could procure no specimen the labour of collation was well advanced when he died at the age of fiftytwo april 16 1901 investigations of metallic arcspectra have also been carried out with signal success by hasselberg670 kayser and runge o lohse671 and others another condition sine qu non of progress in this department is the separation of true solar lines from those produced by absorption in our own atmosphere and here little remains to be done thollons great atlas672 was designed for this purpose of discrimination each of its thirtythree maps exhibits in quadruplicate a subdivision of the solar spectrum under varied conditions of weather and zenithdistance telluric effects are thus made easily legible and they account wholly for 866 partly for 246 out of a total of 3200 lines but the death of the artist april 8 1887 unfortunately interrupted the halffinished task of the last seven years of his life a most satisfactory record meanwhile of selective atmospheric action has been supplied by the experiments and determinations of janssen cornu and egoroff by dr beckers drawings673 and mr mccleans photographs of the analysed light of the sun at high low and medium altitudes and the autographic pictures obtained by mr george higgs of liverpool of certain rhythmical groups in the red emerging with surprising strength near sunset excite general and welldeserved admiration674 the main interest however of all these documents resides in the information afforded by them regarding the chemistry of the sun the discovery that hydrogen exists in the atmosphere of the sun was made by ngstrm in 1862 his list of solar elements published in that year675 the result of an investigation separate from though conducted on the same principle as kirchhoffs included the substance which we now know to be predominant among them dr plcker of bonn had identified in 1859 the fraunhofer line f with the green ray of hydrogen but drew no inference from his observation the agreement was verified by ngstrm two further coincidences were established and in 1866 a fourth hydrogen line in the extreme violet named h was detected in the solar spectrum with thaln he besides added manganese titanium and cobalt to the constituents of the sun enumerated by kirchhoff and raised the number of identical rays in the solar and terrestrial spectra of iron to no less than 460676 thus when sir norman lockyer entered on that branch of inquiry in 1872 fourteen substances were recognised as common to the earth and sun early in 1878 he was able to increase the list provisionally to thirtythree677 all except hydrogen metals this rapid success was due to his adoption of the test of length in lieu of that of strength in the comparison of lines he measured their relative significance in other words rather by their persistence through a wide range of temperature than by their brilliancy at any one temperature the distinction was easily drawn photographs of the electric arc in which any given metal had been volatilised showed some of the rays emitted by it stretching across the axis of the light to a considerable distance on either side while many others clung more or less closely to its central hottest core the former long lines regarded as certainly representative were those primarily sought in the solar spectrum while the attendant short lines often in point of fact due to foreign admixtures were set aside as likely to be misleading678 the criterion is a valuable one and its employment has greatly helped to quicken the progress of solar chemistry carbon was the first nonmetallic element discovered in the sun messrs trowbridge and hutchins of harvard college concluded in 1887679 on the ground of certain spectral coincidences that this protean substance is vaporised in the solar atmosphere at a temperature approximately that of the voltaic arc partial evidence to the same effect had earlier been alleged by lockyer as well as by liveing and dewar and the case was rendered tolerably complete by photographs taken by kayser and runge in 1889680 it was by professor rowland shown to be irresistible two hundred carbonlines were through his comparisons sifted out from sunlight and it contains others significant of the presence of silicona related substance and one as important to rockbuilding on the earth as carbon is to the maintenance of life the general result of rowlands labours was the establishment among solar materials not only of these two out of the fourteen metalloids or nonmetallic substances but of thirtythree metals including silver and tin gold mercury bismuth antimony and arsenic were discarded from the catalogue platinum and uranium with six other metals remained doubtful while iron was recorded as crowding the spectrum with over two thousand obscure rays681 galliumabsorption was detected in it by hartley and ramage in 1889682 dr henry draper683 announced in 1877 his imagined discovery in the solar spectrum of eighteen especially brilliant spaces corresponding to oxygenemissions but the agreement proved when put to the test of very high dispersion to be wholly illusory684 nor has it yet been found possible to identify in analysed sunlight any significant bright beams685 the book of solar chemistry must be read in characters exclusively of absorption nevertheless the whole truth is unlikely to be written there that a substance displays none of its distinctive beams in the spectrum of the sun or of a star affords scarcely a presumption against its presence for it may be situated below the level where absorption occurs or under a pressure such as to efface lines by widening and weakening them it may be at a temperature so high that it gives out more light than it takes up and yet its incandescence may be masked by the absorption of other bodies finally it may just balance absorption by emission with the result of complete spectral neutrality an instructive example is that of the chromospheric element helium father secchi remarked in 1868686 that there is no dark line in the solar spectrum matching its light and his observation has been fully confirmed687 heliumabsorption is however occasionally noticed in the penumbr of spots688 our terrestrial vital element might then easily subsist unrecognisably in the sun the inner organisation of the oxygen molecule is a considerably plastic one it is readily modified by heat and these modifications are reflected in its varying modes of radiating light dr schuster enumerated in 1879689 four distinct oxygen spectra corresponding to various stages of temperature or phases of electrical excitement and a fifth has been added by m egoroffs discovery in 1883690 that certain wellknown groups of dark lines in the red end of the solar spectrum fraunhofers a and b are due to absorption by the cool oxygen of our air these persist down to the lowest temperatures and even survive a change of state they are produced essentially the same by liquid as by arial oxygen691 it seemed however possible to m janssen that these bands owned a joint solar and terrestrial origin oxygen in a fit condition to produce them might he considered exist in the outer atmosphere of the sun and he resolved to decide the point no one could bring more skill and experience to bear upon it than he692 by observations on the summit of the faulhorn as well as by direct experiment he demonstrated nearly thirty years ago the leading part played by watervapour in generating the atmospheric spectrum and he had recourse to similar means for appraising the share in it assignable to oxygen an electric beam transmitted from the eiffel tower to meudon in the summer of 1888 having passed through a weight of oxygen about equal to that piled above the surface of the earth showed the groups a and b just as they appear in the highsun spectrum693 atmospheric action is then adequate to produce them but m janssen desired to prove in addition that they diminish proportionately to its amount his ascent of mont blanc694 in 1890 was undertaken with this object it was perfectly successful in the solar spectrum examined from that eminence oxygenabsorption was so much enfeebled as to leave no possible doubt of its purely telluric origin under another form nevertheless it has been detected as indubitably solar a triplet of dark lines low down in the red photographed from the sun by higgs and mcclean was clearly identified by runge and paschen in 1896695 with the fundamental group of an oxygen series first seen by piazzi smyth in the spectrum of a vacuumtube in 1883696 the pabulum vit of our earth is then to some slight extent effective in arresting transmitted sunlight and oxygen must be classed as a solar element the rays of the sun besides being stopped selectively in our atmosphere suffer also a marked general absorption this tells chiefly upon the shortest wavelengths the ultraviolet spectrum is in fact closed as if by the interposition of an opaque screen nor does the screen appear very sensibly less opaque from an elevation of 10000 feet dr simonys spectral photographs taken on the peak of teneriffe697 extended but slightly further up than m cornus taken in the valley of the loire could the veil be withdrawn some indications as to the originating temperature of the solar spectrum might be gathered from its range since the proportion of quick vibrations given out by a glowing body grows with the intensity of its incandescence and this brings us to the subject of our next chapter

received by the earth from the sun his object in making the experiment was to ascertain the temperature encountered by the comet of 1680 at its passage through perihelion he found it by multiplying the observed heating effects of direct sunshine according to the familiar rule of the inverse squares of the distances to be about 2000 times that of redhot iron698 determinations of the suns thermal power made with some scientific exactness date however from 1837 a few days previous to the beginning of that year herschel began observing at the cape of good hope with an actinometer and obtained results agreeing quite satisfactorily with those derived by pouillet from experiments made in france some months later with a pyrheliometer699 pouillet found that the vertical rays of the sun falling on each square centimetre of the earths surface are competent apart from atmospheric absorption to raise the temperature of 17633 grammes of water one degree centigrade per minute this number 17633 he called the solar constant and the unit of heat chosen is known as the calorie hence it was computed that the total amount of solar heat received during a year would suffice to melt a layer of ice covering the entire earth to a depth of 3089 metres or 100 feet while the heat emitted would melt at the suns surface a stratum 1180 metres thick each minute a careful series of observations showed that nearly half the heat incident upon our atmosphere is stopped in its passage through it herschel got somewhat larger figures though he assigned only a third as the spoil of the air taking a mean between his own and pouillets he calculated that the ordinary expenditure of the sun per minute would have power to melt a cylinder of ice 184 feet in diameter reaching from his surface to that of alpha centauri or putting it otherwise that an icerod 453 miles across continually darted into the sun with the velocity of light would scarcely consume in dissolving the thermal supplies now poured abroad into space700 it is nearly certain that this estimate should be increased by about twothirds in order to bring it up to the truth nothing would at first sight appear simpler than to pass from a knowledge of solar emissiona strictly measurable quantityto a knowledge of the solar temperature this being defined as the temperature to which a surface thickly coated with lampblack that is of standard radiating power should be raised to enable it to send us from the suns distance the amount of heat actually received from the sun sir john herschel showed that heatrays at the suns surface must be 92000 times as dense as when they reach the earth but it by no means follows that either the surface emitting or a body absorbing those heatrays must be 92000 times hotter than a body exposed here to the full power of the sun the reason is that the rate of emissionconsequently the rate of absorption which is its correlativeincreases very much faster than the temperature in other words a body radiates or cools at a continually accelerated pace as it becomes more and more intensely heated above its surroundings newton however took it for granted that radiation and temperature advance pari passuthat you have only to ascertain the quantity of heat received from and the distance of a remote body in order to know how hot it is701 and the validity of this principle known as newtons law of cooling was never questioned until de la roche pointed out in 1812702 that it was approximately true only over a low range of temperature while five years later dulong and petit generalised experimental results into the rule that while temperature grows by arithmetical radiation increases by geometrical progression703 adopting this formula pouillet derived from his observations on solar heat a solar temperature of somewhere between 1461 and 1761 c now the higher of these pointswhich is nearly that of melting platinumis undoubtedly surpassed at the focus of certain burningglasses which have been constructed of such power as virtually to bring objects placed there within a quarter of a million of miles of the photosphere in the rays thus concentrated platinum and diamond become rapidly vaporised notwithstanding the great loss of heat by absorption first in passing through the air and again in traversing the lens pouillets maximum is then manifestly too low since it involves the absurdity of supposing a radiating mass capable of heating a distant body more than it is itself heated less demonstrably but scarcely less surely mr j j waterston who attacked the problem in 1860 erred in the opposite direction working up on newtons principle data collected by himself in india and at edinburgh he got for the potential temperature of the sun 12880000 fahr704 equivalent to 7156000 c the phrase potential temperature for which violle substituted in 1876 effective temperature was designed to express the accumulation in a single surface postulated for the sake of simplicity of the radiations not improbably received from a multitude of separate solar layers reinforcing each other and might thus it was explained be considerably higher than the actual temperature of any one stratum at rome in 1861 father secchi repeated waterstons experiments and reaffirmed his conclusion705 while sorets observations made on the summit of mont blanc in 1867706 furnished him with materials for a fresh and even higher estimate of ten million degrees centigrade707 yet from the very same data substituting dulong and petits for newtons law vicaire deduced in 1872 a provisional solar temperature of 1398708 this is below that at which iron melts and we know that ironvapour exists high up in the suns atmosphere the matter was taken into consideration on the other side of the atlantic by ericsson in 1871 he attempted to reestablish the shaken credit of newtons principle and arrived by its means at a temperature of 4000000 fahrenheit709 subsequently an underrated computation based upon observation of the quantity of heat received by his sun motor gave him 3000000 and the result as he insisted followed inevitably from the principle that the temperature produced by radiant heat is proportional to its density or inversely as its diffusion710 the principle however is demonstrably unsound in 1876 the suns temperature was proposed as the subject of a prize by the paris academy of sciences but although the essay of m jules violle was crowned the problem was declared to remain unsolved violle who adhered to dulong and petits formula arrived at an effective temperature of 1500 c but considered that it might actually reach 2500 c if the emissive power of the photospheric clouds fell far short as seemed probable of the lampblack standard711 experiments made in april and may 1881 giving a somewhat higher result he raised this figure to 3000 c712 appraisements so outrageously discordant as those of waterston secchi and ericsson on the one hand and those of the french savants on the other served only to show that all were based upon a vicious principle professor f rosetti713 accordingly of the paduan university at last perceived the necessity for getting out of the groove of laws plainly in contradiction with facts the temperature for instance of the oxyhydrogen flame was fixed by bunsen at 2800 can estimate certainly not very far from the truth but if the two systems of measurement applied to the sun be used to determine the heat of a solid body rendered incandescent in this flame it comes out by newtons mode of calculation 45000 c by dulong and petits 870 c714 both then are justly discarded the first as convicted of exaggeration the second of undervaluation the formula substituted by rosetti in 1878 was tested successfully up to 2000 c but since like its predecessors it was a purely empirical rule guaranteed by no principle and hence not to be trusted out of sight it was like them liable to break down at still higher elevations radiation by this new prescription increases as the square of the absolute temperaturethat is of the number of degrees counted from the absolute zero of 273 c its employment gave for the suns radiating surface an effective temperature of 20380 c including a supposed loss of onehalf in the solar atmosphere and setting a probable deficiency in emission as compared with lampblack against a probable mutual reinforcement of superposed strata professor rosetti considered effective as nearly equivalent to actual temperature a law of cooling proposed by m stefan at vienna in 1879715 was shown by boltzmann many years later to have a certain theoretical validity716 it is that emission grows as the fourth power of absolute temperature hence the temperature of the photosphere would be proportional to the square root of the square root of its heating effects at a distance and appeared by stefans calculations from violles measures of solar radiative intensity to be just 6000 c while m h le chatelier717 derived 7600 from a formula conveying an intricate and unaccountable relation between the temperature of an incandescent body and the intensity of its red radiations from a series of experiments carefully conducted at daramona ireland with a delicate thermal balance of the kind invented by boys and designated a radiomicrometer messrs wilson and gray arrived in 1893 with the aid of stefans law at a photospheric temperature of 7400 c718 reduced by the firstnamed investigator in 1901 to 6590719 dr paschen of hanover on the other hand ascribed to the sun a temperature of 5000 from comparisons between solar radiative intensity and that of glowing platinum720 while f w very showed in 1895721 that a minimum value of 20000 c for the same datum resulted from paschens formula connecting temperature with the position of maximum spectral energy a new line of inquiry was struck out by zllner in 1870 instead of tracking the solar radiations backward with the dubious guide of empirical formul he investigated their intensity at their source he showed722 that taking prominences to be simple effects of the escape of powerfully compressed gases it was possible from the known mechanical laws of heat and gaseous constitution to deduce minimum values for the temperatures prevailing in the area of their development these came out 27700 c for the strata lying immediately above and 68400 c for the strata lying immediately below the photosphere the former being regarded as the region into which and the latter as the region from which the eruptions took place in this calculation no prominences exceeding 40000 miles 15 in height were included but in 1884 g a hirn of colmar having regard to the enormous velocities of projection observed in the interim fixed two million degrees centigrade as the lowest internal temperature by which they could be accounted for although admitting the photospheric condensations to be incompatible with a higher external temperature than 50000 to 100000 c723 this method of going straight to the sun itself observing what goes on there and inferring conditions has much to recommend it but its profitable use demands knowledge we are still very far from possessing we are quite ignorant for instance of the actual circumstances attending the birth of the solar flames the assumption that they are nothing but phenomena of elasticity is a purely gratuitous one spectroscopic indications again give hope of eventually affording a fixed point of comparison with terrestrial heat sources but their interpretation is still beset with uncertainties nor can indeed the expression of transcendental temperatures in degrees of impossible thermometers be at the best other than a futile attempt to convey notions respecting a state of things altogether outside the range of our experience a more tangible as well as a less disputable proof of solar radiative intensity than any mere estimates of temperature was provided in some experiments made by professor langley in 1878724 using means of unquestioned validity he found the suns disc to radiate 87 times as much heat and 5300 times as much light as an equal area of metal in a bessemer converter after the airblast had continued about twenty minutes the brilliancy of the incandescent steel nevertheless was so blinding that melted iron flowing in a dazzling whitehot stream into the crucible showed deep brown by comparison presenting a contrast like that of dark coffee poured into a white cup its temperature was estimated not quite securely725 at about 2000 c and no allowances were made in computing relative intensities for atmospheric ravages on sunlight for the extra impediments to its passage presented by the smokeladen air of pittsburgh or for the obliquity of its incidence thus a very large balance of advantage lay on the side of the metal a further element of uncertainty in estimating the intrinsic strength of the suns rays has still to be considered from the time that his disc first began to be studied with the telescope it was perceived to be less brilliant near the edges lucas valerius of the lyncean academy seems to have been the first to note this fact which strangely enough was denied by galileo in a letter to prince cesi of january 25 1613726 father scheiner however fully admitted it and devoted some columns of his bulky tome to the attempt to find its appropriate explanation727 in 1729 bouguer measured with much accuracy the amount of this darkening and from his data laplace adopting a principle of emission now known to be erroneous concluded that the sun loses eleventwelfths of his light through absorption in his own atmosphere728 the real existence of this atmosphere which is totally distinct from the beds of ignited vapours producing the fraunhofer lines is not open to doubt although its nature is still a matter of conjecture the separate effects of its action on luminous thermal and chemical rays were carefully studied by father secchi who in 1870729 inferred the total absorption to be 88100 of all radiations taken together and added the important observation that the light from the limb is no longer white but reddishbrown absorptive effects were thus seen to be unequally distributed and they could evidently be studied to advantage only by taking the various rays of the spectrum separately and finding out how much each had suffered in transmission this was done by h c vogel in 1877730 using a polarising photometer he found that only 13 per cent of the violet rays escape at the edge of the solar disc 16 of the blue and green 25 of the yellow and 30 per cent of the red midway between centre and limb 887 of violet light and 967 of red penetrate the absorbing envelope the abolition of which would increase the intensity of the suns visible spectrum above two and a half times in the most and once and a half times in the least refrangible parts the nucleus of a small spot was ascertained to be of the same luminous intensity as a portion of the unbroken surface about two and a half minutes from the limb these experiments having been made during a spotminimum when there is reason to think that absorption is below its average strength vogel suggested their repetition at a time of greater activity they were extended to the heatrays by edwin b frost detailed inquiries made at potsdam in 1892731 went to show that were the suns atmosphere removed his thermal power as regards ourselves would be increased 17 times they established too the practical uniformity in radiation of all parts of his disc a confirmatory result was obtained about the same time by wilson and rambaut who found that the unveiled sun would be once and a half times hotter than the actual sun732 professor langley now of washington gave to measures of the kind a refinement previously undreamt of reliable determinations of the energy of the individual spectral rays were for the first time rendered possible by his invention of the bolometer in 1880733 this exquisitely sensitive instrument affords the means of measuring heat not directly like the thermopile but in its effects upon the conduction of electricity it represents in the phrase of the inventor the finger laid upon the throttlevalve of a steamengine a minute force becomes the modulator of a much greater force and thus from imperceptible becomes conspicuous by locally raising the temperature of an inconceivably fine strip of platinum serving as the conductingwire in a circuit the flow of electricity is impeded at that point and the included galvanometer records a disturbance of the electrical flow amounts of heat were thus detected in less than ten seconds which expended during a thousand years on the melting of a kilogramme of ice would leave a part of the work still undone and further improvements rendered this marvellous instrument capable of thrilling to changes of temperature falling short of one tenmillionth of a degree centigrade734 the heat contained in the diffraction spectrum is with equal dispersions barely onetenth of that in the prismatic spectrum it had accordingly never previously been found possible to measure it in detailthat is ray by ray but it is only from the diffraction or normal spectrum that any true idea can be gained as to the real distribution of energy among the various constituents visible and invisible of a sunbeam the effect of passage through a prism is to crowd together the red rays very much more than the blue to this prismatic distortion was owing the establishment of a pseudomaximum of heat in the infrared which disappeared when the natural arrangement by wavelength was allowed free play langleys bolometer has shown that the hottest part of the normal spectrum virtually coincides with its most luminous part both lying in the orange close to the dline735 thus the last shred of evidence in favour of the threefold division of solar radiations vanished and it became obvious that the varying effectsthermal luminous or chemicalproduced by them are due not to any distinction of quality in themselves but to the different properties of the substances they impinge upon they are simply bearers of energy conveyed in shorter or longer vibrations the result in each separate case depending upon the capacity of the material particles meeting them for taking up those shorter or longer vibrations and turning them variously to account in their inner economy a long series of experiments at allegheny was completed in the summer of 1881 on the crest of mount whitney in the sierra nevada here at an elevation of 14887 feet in the driest and purest air perhaps in the world atmospheric absorptive inroads become less sensible and the indications of the bolometer consequently surer and stronger an enormous expansion was at once given to the invisible region in the solar spectrum below the red captain abney had got chemical effects from undulations twelve tenthousandths of a millimetre in length these were the longest recognised as or indeed believed on theoretical grounds to be capable of existing professor langley now got heating effects from rays of above twice that wavelength his delicate thread of platinum groping its way down nearly to thirty tenthousandths of a millimetre or three microns the known extent of the solar spectrum was thus at once more than doubled its visible portion covers a range of about one octave bolometric indications already in 1884 comprised between three and four the great importance of the newly explored region appears from the fact that threefourths of the entire energy of sunlight reside in the infrared while scarcely more than onehundredth part of that amount is found in the better known ultraviolet space736 these curious facts were reinforced in 1886737 by further particulars learned with the help of rocksalt lenses and prisms glass being impervious to very slow as to very rapid vibrations traces were thus detected of solar heat distributed into bands of transmission alternating with bands of atmospheric absorption far beyond the measurable limit of 53 microns in 1894 langley described at the oxford meeting of the british association738 his new bolographic researches in which the sensitive plate was substituted for the eye in recording deflections of the galvanometer responding to variations of invisible heat finally in 1901739 he embodied in a splendid map of the infrared spectrum 740 absorptionlines of determinate wavelengths ranging from 076 to 53 microns their chemical origin indeed remains almost entirely unknown no extensive investigations having yet been undertaken of the slower vibrations distinctive of particular substances but there is evidence that seven of the nine great bands crossing the new spectrum as langley calls it740 are telluric and subject to seasonal change here then he thought might eventually be found a sure standingground for vitally important previsions of famines droughts and bonanzacrops atmospheric absorption had never before been studied with such precision as it was by langley on mount whitney aided by simultaneous observations from lone pine at the foot of the sierra he was able to calculate the intensity belonging to each ray before entering the earths gaseous envelopein other words to construct an extraatmospheric curve of energy in the spectrum the result showed that the blue end suffered far more than the red absorption varying inversely as wavelength this property of stopping predominantly the quicker vibrations is shared as both vogel and langley741 have conclusively shown by the solar atmosphere the effect of this double absorption is as if two plates of reddish glass were interposed between us and the sun the withdrawal of which would leave his orb not only three or four times more brilliant but in colour distinctly greenishblue742 the fact of the uncovered sun being blue has an important bearing upon the question of his temperature to afford a somewhat more secure answer to which was the ultimate object of professor langleys persevering researches for it is well known that as bodies grow hotter the proportionate representation in their spectra of the more refrangible rays becomes greater the lowest stage of incandescence is the familiar one of red heat as it gains intensity the quicker vibrations come in and an optical balance of sensation is established at white heat the final term of blue heat as we now know is attained by the photosphere on this ground alone then of the large original preponderance of blue light we must raise our estimate of solar heat and actual measurements show the same upward tendency until quite lately pouillets figure of 17 calories per minute per square centimetre of terrestrial surface was the received value for the solar constant forbes had it is true got 285 from observations on the faulhorn in 1842743 but they failed to obtain the confidence they merited pouillets result was not definitely superseded until violle from actinometrical measures at the summit and base of mont blanc in 1875 computed the intensity of solar radiation at 254744 and crova about the same time at montpellier showed it to be above two calories745 langley went higher still working out the results of the mount whitney expedition he was led to conclude atmospheric absorption to be fully twice as effective as had hitherto been supposed scarcely 60 per cent in fact of those solar radiations which strike perpendicularly through a seemingly translucent sky were estimated to attain the sealevel the rest are reflected dispersed or absorbed this discovery involved a large addition to the original supply so mercilessly cut down in transmission and the solar constant rose at once to three calories nor did the rise stop there m savlieff deduced for it a value of 347 from actinometrical observations made at kieff in 1890746 and knut ngstrm taking account of the arrestive power of carbonic acid inferred enormous atmospheric absorption and a solar constant of four calories747 in other words the suns heat reaching the outskirts of our atmosphere is capable of doing without cessation the work of an engine of fourhorse power for each square yard of the earths surface thus modern inquiries tend to render more and more evident the vastness of the thermal stores contained in the great central reservoir of our system while bringing into fair agreement the estimates of its probable temperature this is in great measure due to the acquisition of a workable formula by which to connect temperature with radiation stefans rule of a fourthpower relation if not actually a law of nature is a colourable

temperatur der sonne pp 36 38 chapter vi the suns distance the question of the suns distance arises naturally from the consideration of his temperature since the intensity of the radiations emitted as compared with those received and measured depends upon it but the knowledge of that distance has a value quite apart from its connection with solar physics the semidiameter of the earths orbit is our standard measure for the universe it is the great fundamental datum of astronomythe unit of space any error in the estimation of which is multiplied and repeated in a thousand different ways both in the planetary and sidereal systems hence its determination was called by airy the noblest problem in astronomy it is also one of the most difficult the quantities dealt with are so minute that their sure grasp tasks all the resources of modern science an observational inaccuracy which would set the moon nearer to or farther from us than she really is by one hundred miles would vitiate an estimate of the suns distance to the extent of sixteen million748 what is needed in order to attain knowledge of the desired exactness is no less than this to measure an angle about equal to that subtended by a halfpenny 2000 feet from the eye within a little more than a thousandth part of its value the angle thus represented is what is called the horizontal parallax of the sun by this amountthe breadth of a halfpenny at 2000 feethe is to a spectator on the rotating earth removed at rising and setting from his meridian place in the heavens such in other terms would be the magnitude of the terrestrial radius as viewed from the sun if we knew this magnitude with certainty and precision we should also know with certainty and precisionthe dimensions of the earth being as they are well ascertainedthe distance of the sun in fact the one quantity commonly stands for the other in works treating professedly of astronomy but this angle of parallax or apparent displacement cannot be directly measuredcannot even be perceived with the finest instruments not from its smallness the parallactic shift of the nearest of the stars as seen from opposite sides of the earths orbit is many times smaller but at the suns limb and close to the horizon where the visual angle in question opens out to its full extent atmospheric troubles become overwhelming and altogether swamp the far more minute effects of parallax there remain indirect methods astronomers are well acquainted with the proportions which the various planetary orbits bear to each other they are so connected in the manner expressed by keplers third law that the periods being known it only needs to find the interval between any two of them in order to infer at once the distances separating them all from one another and from the sun the plan is given what we want to discover is the scale upon which it is drawn so that if we can get a reliable measure of the distance of a single planet from the earth our problem is solved now some of our fellowtravellers in our unending journey round the sun come at times well within the scope of celestial trigonometry the orbit of mars lies at one point not more than thirtyfive million miles outside that of the earth and when the two bodies happen to arrive together in or near the favourable spota conjuncture which occurs every fifteen yearsthe desired opportunity is granted mars is then in opposition or on the opposite side of us from the sun crossing the meridian consequently at midnight749 it was from an opposition of mars observed in 1672 by richer at cayenne in concert with cassini in paris that the first scientific estimate of the suns distance was derived it appeared to be nearly eightyseven millions of miles parallax 95 while flamsteed deduced 81700000 parallax 10 from his independent observations of the same occurrencea difference quite insignificant at that stage of the inquiry but picards result was just half flamsteeds parallax 20 distance fortyone million miles and lahire considered that we must be separated from the hearth of our system by an interval of at least 136 million miles750 so that uncertainty continued to have an enormous range venus on the other hand comes closest to the earth when she passes between it and the sun at such times of inferior conjunction she is however still twentysix million miles or in round numbers 109 times as distant as the moon moreover she is so immersed in the suns rays that it is only when her path lies across his disc that the requisite facilities for measurement are afforded these partial eclipses of the sun by venus as encke termed them are coupled together in pairs751 of which the components are separated by eight years recurring at intervals alternately of 10512 and 12112 years thus the first calculated transit took place in december 1631 and its companion observed by horrocks in the same month ns 1639 then after the lapse of 12112 years came the june couple of 1761 and 1769 and again after 10512 the two last observed december 8 1874 and december 6 1882 throughout the twentieth century there will be no transit of venus but the astronomers of the twentyfirst will only have to wait four years for the first of a june pair the rarity of these events is due to the fact that the orbits of the earth and venus do not lie in the same plane if they did there would be a transit each time that our twinplanet overtakes us in her more rapid circlingthat is on an average every 584 days as things are actually arranged she passes above or below the sun except when she happens to be very near the line of intersection of the two tracks such an occurrence as a transit of venus seems at first sight full of promise for solving the problem of the suns distance for nothing would appear easier than to determine exactly either the duration of the passage of a small dark orb across a large brilliant disc or the instant of its entry upon or exit from it and the differences in these times which owing to the comparative nearness of venus are quite considerable as observed from remote parts of the earth can be translated into differences of spacethat is into apparent or parallactic displacements whereby the distance of venus becomes known and thence by a simple sum in proportion the distance of the sun but in that word exactly what snares and pitfalls lie hid it is so easy to think and to say so indefinitely hard to realise the astronomers of the eighteenth century were full of hope and zeal they confidently expected to attain through the double opportunity offered them to something like a permanent settlement of the statistics of our system they were grievously disappointed the uncertainty as to the suns distance which they had counted upon reducing to a few hundred thousand miles remained at many millions in 1822 however encke then director of the seeberg observatory near gotha undertook to bring order out of the confusion of discordant and discordantly interpreted observations his combined result for both transits 1761 and 1769 was published in 1824752 and met universal acquiescence the parallax of the sun thereby established was 85776 corresponding to a mean distance753 of 9514 million miles yet this abolition of doubt was far from being so satisfactory as it seemed serenity on the point lasted exactly thirty years it was disturbed in 1854 by hansens announcement754 that the observed motions of the moon could be drawn into accord with theory only on the terms of bringing the sun considerably nearer to us than he was supposed to be dr matthew stewart professor of mathematics in the university of edinburgh had made a futile attempt in 1763 to deduce the suns distance from his disturbing power over our satellite755 tobias mayer of gttingen however whose short career was fruitful of suggestions struck out the right way to the same end and laplace in the seventh book of the mcanique cleste756 gave a solar parallax derived from the lunar parallactic inequality substantially identical with that issuing from enckes subsequent discussion of the eighteenthcentury transits thus two wholly independent methodsthe trigonometrical or method by survey and the gravitational or method by perturbationseemed to corroborate each the upshot of the use of the other until the nineteenth century was well past its meridian it is singular how often errors conspire to lead conviction astray hansens note of alarm in 1854 was echoed by leverrier in 1858757 he found that an apparent monthly oscillation of the sun which reflects a real monthly movement of the earth round its common centre of gravity with the moon and which depends for its amount solely on the mass of the moon and the distance of the sun required a diminution in the admitted value of that distance by fully four million miles three years later he pointed out that certain perplexing discrepancies between the observed and computed places both of venus and mars would vanish on the adoption of a similar measure758 moreover a favourable opposition of mars gave the opportunity in 1862 for fresh observations which separately worked out by stone and winnecke agreed with all the newer investigations in fixing the great unit at slightly over 91 million miles in newcombs hands they gave 9212 million759 the accumulating evidence in favour of a large reduction in the suns distance was just then reinforced by an auxiliary result of a totally different and unexpected kind the discovery that light does not travel instantaneously from point to point but takes some short time in transmission was made by olaus rmer in 1675 through observing that the eclipses of jupiters satellites invariably occurred later when the earth was on the far side than when it was on the near side of its orbit half the difference or the time spent by a luminous vibration in crossing the mean radius of the earths orbit is called the lightequation and the determination of its precise value has claimed the minute care distinctive of modern astronomy delambre in 1792 made it 493 seconds glasenapp a russian astronomer raised the estimate in 1874 to 501 professor harkness adopts a safe medium value of 498 seconds hence if we had any independent means of ascertaining how fast light travels we could tell at once how far off the sun is there is yet another way by which knowledge of the swiftness of light would lead us straight to the goal the heavenly bodies are perceived when carefully watched and measured to be pushed forward out of their true places in the direction of the earths motion by a very minute quantity this effect already adverted to has been known since bradleys time as aberration it arises from a combination of the two movements of the earth round the sun and of the lightwaves through the ether if the earth stood still or if light spent no time on the road from the stars such an effect would not exist its amount represents the proportion between the velocities with which the earth and the lightrays pursue their respective journeys this proportion is roughly one to ten thousand so that here again if we knew the rate per second of luminous transmission we should also know the rate per second of the earths movement consequently the size of its orbit and the distance of the sun but until lately instead of finding the distance of the sun from the velocity of light there has been no means of ascertaining the velocity of light except through the imperfect knowledge possessed as to the distance of the sun the first successful terrestrial experiments on the point date from 1849 and it is certainly no slight triumph of human ingenuity to have taken rigorous account of the delay of a sunbeam in flashing from one mirror to another fizeau led the way760 and he was succeeded after a few months by lon foucault761 who in 1862 had so far perfected wheatstones method of revolving mirrors as to be able to announce with authority that light travelled slower and that the sun was in consequence nearer than had been supposed762 thus a third line of separate research was found to converge to the same point with the two others such a conspiracy of proof was not to be resisted and at the anniversary meeting of the royal astronomical society in february 1864 the correction of the solar distance took the foremost place in the annals of the year lest however a sudden bound of four million miles nearer to the centre of our system should shake public faith in astronomical accuracy it was explained that the change in the solar parallax corresponding to that huge leap amounted to no more than the breadth of a human hair 125 feet from the eye763 the nautical almanac gave from 1870 the altered value of 895 for which newcombs result of 885 adopted in 1869 in the berlin ephemeris was substituted some ten years later in astronomical literature the change was initiated by sir edmund beckett in the first edition 1865 of his astronomy without mathematics if any doubt remained as to the misleading character of enckes deduction so long implicitly trusted in it was removed by powalkys and stones rediscussions in 1864 and 1868 respectively of the transit observations of 1769 using improved determinations of the longitude of the various stations and a selective judgment in dealing with their materials which however indispensable did not escape adverse criticism they brought out results confirmatory of the no longer disputed necessity for largely increasing the solar parallax and proportionately diminishing the solar distance once more in 1890 and this time with better success the eighteenthcentury transits were investigated by professor newcomb764 turning to account the experience gained in the interim regarding the optical phenomena accompanying such events he elicited from the mass of somewhat discordant observations at his command a parallax 879 in close agreement with the value given by sundry modes of recent research conclusions on the subject however were still regarded as purely provisional a transit of venus was fast approaching and to its arbitrament as to that of a court of final appeal the pending question was to be referred it is true that the verdict in the same case by the same tribunal a century earlier had proved of so indecisive a character as to form only a startingpoint for fresh litigation but that century had not passed in vain and it was confidently anticipated that observational difficulties then equally unexpected and insuperable would yield to the elaborate care and skill of forewarned modern preparation the conditions of the transit of december 8 1874 were sketched out by sir george airy then astronomerroyal in 1857765 and formed the subject of eager discussion in this and other countries down to the very eve of the occurrence in these mr proctor took a leading part and it was due to his urgent representations that provision was made for the employment of the method identified with the name of halley766 which had been too hastily assumed inapplicable to the first of each transitpair it depends upon the difference in the length of time taken by the planet to cross the suns disc as seen from various points of the terrestrial surface and requires accordingly the visibility of both entrance and exit at the same station since these were in 1874 separated by about three and a half hours and the interval may be much longer the choice of posts for the successful use of the method of durations is a matter of some difficulty the system described by delisle in 1760 on the other hand involves merely noting the instant of ingress or egress according to situation from opposite extremities of a terrestrial diameter the disparity in time giving a measure of the planets apparent displacement hence of its actual rate of travel in miles per minute from which its distances severally from earth and sun are immediately deducible its chief attendant difficulty is the necessity for accurately fixing the longitudes of the points of observation but this was much more sensibly felt a century ago than it is now the improved facility and certainty of modern determinations tending to give the delislean plan a decided superiority over its rival these two traditional methods were supplemented in 1874 by the camera and the heliometer from photography above all much was expected observations made by its means would have the advantages of impartiality multitude and permanence peculiarities of vision and bias of judgment would be eliminated the slow progress of the phenomenon would permit an indefinite number of pictures to be taken their epochs fixed to a fraction of a second while subsequent leisurely comparison and measurement could hardly fail it was thought to educe approximate truth from the mass of accumulated evidence the use of the heliometer much relied on by german observers was so far similar to that of the camera that the object aimed at by both was the determination of the relative positions of the centres of the sun and venus viewed at the same absolute instant from opposite sides of the globe so that the principle of the two older methods was to ascertain the exact times of meeting between the solar and planetary limbs that of the two modern to determine the position of the dark body already thrown into complete relief by its shining background the former are methods by contact the latter methods by projection every country which had a reputation to keep or to gain for scientific zeal was forward to cooperate in the great cosmopolitan enterprise of the transit france and germany each sent out six expeditions twentysix stations were in russian twelve in english eight in american three in italian one in dutch occupation in all at a cost of nearly a quarter of a million some fourscore distinct posts of observation were provided among them such inhospitable and all but inaccessible rocks in the bleak southern ocean as st pauls and campbell islands swept by hurricanes and fitted only for the habitation of seabirds where the daring votaries of science in the wise prevision of a long leaguer by the elements were supplied with stores for many months or even a whole year siberia and the sandwich islands were thickly beset with observers parties of three nationalities encamped within the mists of kerguelen island expressively termed the land of desolation in the sanguine though not wholly frustrated hope of a glimpse of the sun at the right moment m janssen narrowly escaped destruction from a typhoon in the china seas on his way to nagasaki lord lindsay now earl of crawford and balcarres equipped at his private expense an expedition to mauritius which was in itself an epitome of modern resource and ingenuity during several years the practical methods best suited to insure success for the impending enterprise formed a subject of european debate official commissions were appointed to receive and decide upon evidence and experiments were in progress for the purpose of defining the actual circumstances of contacts the precise determination of which constituted the only tried though by no means an assuredly safe road to the end in view in england america france and germany artificial transits were mounted and the members of the various expeditions were carefully trained to unanimity in estimating the phases of junction and separation between a moving dark circular body and a broad illuminated disc in the previous century a formidable and prevalent phenomenon which acquired notoriety as the black drop or black ligament had swamped all pretensions to rigid accuracy it may be described as substituting adhesion for contact the limbs of the sun and planet instead of meeting and parting with the desirable clean definiteness clinging together as if made of some glutinous material and prolonging their connection by means of a dark band or dark threads stretched between them some astronomers ascribed this baffling appearance entirely to instrumental imperfections others to atmospheric agitation others again to the optical encroachment of light upon darkness known as irradiation it is probable that all these causes conspired in various measure to produce it and it is certain that its conspicuous appearance may by suitable precautions be obviated the organisation of the british forces reflected the utmost credit on the energy and ability of lieutenantcolonel tupman who was responsible for the whole no useful measure was neglected each observer went out ticketed with his personal equation his senses drilled into a species of martial discipline his powers absorbed so far as possible in the action of a cosmopolitan observing machine instrumental uniformity and uniformity of method were obtainable and were attained but diversity of judgment unhappily survived the bestdirected efforts for its extirpation the eventful day had no sooner passed than telegrams began to pour in announcing an outcome of considerable though not unqualified success the weather had proved generally favourable the manifold arrangements had worked well contacts had been plentifully observed photographs in lavish abundance had been secured a store of materials in short had been laid up of which it would take years to work out the full results by calculation gradually nevertheless it came to be known that the hope of a definitive issue must be abandoned unanimity was found to be as remote as ever the dreaded black ligament gave indeed less trouble than was expected but another appearance supervened which took most observers by surprise this was the illumination due to the atmosphere of venus astronomers it is true were not ignorant that the planet had on previous occasions been seen girdled with a lucid ring but its power to mar observations by the distorting effect of refraction had scarcely been reckoned with it proved however to be very great such was the difficulty of determining the critical instant of internal contact that in colonel tupmans words observers side by side with adequate optical means differed as much as twenty or thirty seconds in the times they recorded for phenomena which they have described in almost identical language767 such uncertainties in the data admitted of a corresponding variety in the results from the british observations of ingress and egress sir george airy768 derived in 1877 a solar parallax of 876 corrected to 8754 indicating a mean distance of 93375000 miles mr stone obtained a value of ninetytwo millions parallax 888 and held any parallax less than 884 or more than 893 to be absolutely negatived by the documents available769 yet from the same colonel tupman deduced 881770 implying a distance 700000 miles greater than stone had obtained the best french observations of contacts gave a parallax of about 888 french micrometric measures the obviously exaggerated one of 905771 photography as practised by most of the european parties was a total failure utterly discrepant values of the microscopic displacements designed to serve as sounding lines for the solar system issued from attempts to measure even the most promising pictures you might as well try to measure the zodiacal light it was remarked to sir george airy those taken on the american plan of using telescopes of so great focal length as to afford without further enlargement an image of the requisite size gave notably better results from an elaborate comparison of those dating from vladivostock nagasaki and pekin with others from kerguelen and chatham islands professor d p todd of amherst college deduced a solar distance of about ninetytwo million miles parallax 8883 0034772 and the value was much favoured by concurrent evidence on the whole estimates of the great spatial unit cannot be said to have gained any security from the combined effort of 1874 a few months before the transit mr proctor considered that the uncertainty then amounted to 1448000 miles773 five years after the transit professor harkness judged it to be still 1575950 miles774 yet it had been hoped that it would have been brought down to 100000 as regards the end for which it had been undertaken the grand campaign had come to nothing nevertheless no sign of discouragement was apparent there was a change of view but no relaxation of purpose the problem it was seen could be solved by no single heroic effort but by the patient approximation of gradual improvements astronomers accordingly looked round for fresh means or more refined expedients for applying those already known a new phase of exertion was entered upon on september 5 1877 mars came into opposition near the part of his orbit which lies nearest to that of the earth and dr gill now sir david took advantage of the circumstance to appeal once more to him for a decision on the qustio vexata of the suns distance he chose as the scene of his labours the island of ascension and for their plan a method recommended by airy in 1857775 but never before fairly tried this is known as the diurnal method of parallaxes its principle consists in substituting successive morning and evening observations from the same spot for simultaneous observations from remote spots the rotation of the earth supplying the necessary difference in the points of view its great advantage is that of unity in performance a single mind looking through the same pair of eyes reinforced with the same optical appliances is employed throughout and the errors inseparable from the combination of data collected under different conditions are avoided there are many cases in which one man can do the work of two better than two men can do the work of one the result of gills skilful determinations made with lord lindsays heliometer was a solar parallax of 878 corresponding to a distance of 93080000 miles776 the bestowal of the royal astronomical societys gold medal stamped the merit of this distinguished service but there are other subjects for this kind of inquiry besides mars and venus professor galle of breslau suggested in 1872777 that some of the minor planets might be got to repay astronomers for much disinterested toil spent in unravelling their motions by lending aid to their efforts towards a correct celestial survey ten or twelve come near enough and are bright enough for the purpose in fact the absence of sensible magnitude is one of their chief recommendations since a point of light offers far greater facilities for exact measurement than a disc the first attempt to work this new vein was made at the opposition of phoca in 1872 and from observations of flora in the following year at twelve observatories in the northern and southern hemispheres galle deduced a solar parallax of 887778 at mauritius in 1874 lord lindsay and sir david gill applied the diurnal method to juno then conveniently situated for the purpose and the continued use of similar occasions affords an unexceptionable means for improving knowledge of the suns distance they frequently recur they need no elaborate preparation a single astronomer armed with a heliometer can do all the requisite work dr gill however organized a more complex plan of operations upon iris in 1888 and upon victoria and sappho in 1889 a novel method was adopted its object was to secure simultaneous observations made from opposite sides of the globe just when the planet lay in the plane passing through the centre of the earth and the two observers the same pair of referencestars being used on each occasion the displacements caused by parallax were thus in a sense doubled since the star to which the planet seemed approximated in the northern hemisphere showed as if slightly removed from it in the southern and vice vers as the planet pursued its course fresh starcouples came into play during the weeks that the favourable period lasted in these determinations only heliometers were employed dr elkin of yale college cooperated throughout and the heliometers of dresden gttingen bamberg and leipzig shared in the work while dr auwers of berlin was sir david gills personal coadjutor at the cape voluminous data were collected meridian observations of the stars of reference for victoria occupied twentyone establishments during four months the direct work of triangulation kept four heliometers in almost exclusive use for the best part of a year and the ensuing toilsome computations carried out during three years at the cape observatory filled two bulky tomes779 with their details gills final result published in 1897 was a parallax of 8802 equivalent to a solar distance of 92874000 and it was qualified by a probable error so small that the value might well have been accepted as definitive but for an unlookedfor discovery the minor planet eros detected august 14 1898 was found to pursue a course rendering it an almost ideal intermediary in solar parallaxdeterminations once in thirty years it comes within fifteen million miles of the earth and although the next of these choice epochs must be awaited for some decades an opposition too favourable to be neglected occurred in 1900 at an international conference accordingly held at paris in july of that year a plan of photographic operations was concerted between the representatives of no less than 58 observatories780 its primary object was to secure a large stock of negatives showing the planet with the comparisonstars along the route traversed by it from october 1900 to march 1901781 and this at least was successfully attained their measurement will in due time educe the apparent displacements of the moving object as viewed simultaneously from remote parts of the earth and the upshot should be a solar parallax adequate in accuracy to the exigent demands of the twentieth century the second of the nineteenthcentury pair of venustransits was looked forward to with much abated enthusiasm russia refused her active cooperation in observing it on the ground that oppositions of the minor planets were trigonometrically more useful and financially far less costly and her example was followed by austria while italian astronomers limited their sphere of action to their own peninsula nevertheless it was generally held that a phenomenon which the world could not again witness until it was four generations older should at the price of any effort not be allowed to pass in neglect the persuasion of its importance justified the summoning of an international conference at paris in 1881 from which however america preferring independent action held aloof it was decided to give delisles method another trial and the ambiguities attending and marring its use were sought to be obviated by careful regulations for insuring agreement in the estimation of the critical moments of ingress and egress782 but in fact as m puiseux had shown783 contacts between the limbs of the sun and planet so far from possessing the geometrical simplicity attributed to them are really made up of a prolonged succession of various and varying phases impossible either to predict or identify with anything like rigid exactitude sir robert ball compared the task of determining the precise instant of their meeting or parting to that of telling the hour with accuracy on a watch without a minute hand and the comparison is admittedly inadequate for not only is the apparent movement of venus across the sun extremely slow being but the excess of her real motion over that of the earth but three distinct atmospheresthe solar terrestrial and cythereancombine to deform outlines and mask the geometrical relations which it is desired to connect with a strict count of time the result was very much what had been expected the arrangements were excellent and were only in a few cases disconcerted by bad weather the british parties under the experienced guidance of mr stone the late radcliffe observer took up positions scattered over the globe from queensland to bermuda the americans collected a whole library of photographs the germans and belgians trusted to the heliometer the french used the camera as an adjunct to the method of contacts yet little or no approach was made to solving the problem thus from 606 measures of venus on the sun taken with a new kind of heliometer at santiago in chili m houzeau of the brussels observatory derived a solar parallax of 8907 and a distance of 91727000 miles784 but the probable errors of this determination amounted to 0084 either way it was subject to a more or less of 900000 or to a total uncertainty of 1800000 miles the probable error of the english result published in 1887 was less formidable785 yet the details of the discussion showed that no great confidence could be placed in it the suns distance came out 92560000 miles while 92360000 was given by professor harknesss investigation of 1475 american photographs786 finally dr auwers deduced from the german heliometric measures the unsatisfactorily small value of 92000000 miles787 the transit of 1882 had not then brought about the desired unanimity the state and progress of knowledge on this important topic were summed up by faye and harkness in 1881788 the methods employed in its investigation fall as we have seen into three separate classesthe trigonometrical the gravitational and the phototachymetricalan ungainly adjective used to describe the method by the velocity of light each has its special difficulties and sources of error each has counterbalancing advantages the only trustworthy result from celestial surveys was at that time furnished by gills observations of mars in 1877 but the method by lunar and planetary disturbances is unlike all the others in having time on its side it is this which leverrier declared with emphasis must inevitably prevail because its accuracy is continually growing789 the scarcely perceptible errors which still impede its application are of such a nature as to accumulate year by year eventually then they will challenge and must receive a more and more perfect correction the lightvelocity method however claimed and for some years justified m fayes preference by a beautiful series of experiments on foucaults principle michelson fixed in 1879 the rate of luminous transmission at 299930 corrected later to 299910 kilometres a second790 this determination was held by professor todd to be entitled to four times as much confidence as any previous one and if the solar parallax of 8758 deduced from it by professor harkness errs somewhat by defect it is doubtless because glasenapps lightequation with which it was combined errs slightly by excess but all earlier efforts of the kind were thrown into the shade by professor newcombs arduous operations at washington in 18801882791

light were to run their timed course were set up on opposite shores of the potomac at a distance of nearly four kilometres this advantage was turned to the utmost account by ingenuity and skill in contrivance and execution and the deduced velocity of 299860 kilometres 186328 miles a second had an estimated error 30 kilometres only onetenth that ascribed by cornu to his own result in 1874 just as these experiments were concluded in 1882 m magnus nyrn of st petersburg published an elaborate investigation of the small annular displacements of the stars due to the successive transmission of light involving an increase of struves constant of aberration from 20445 to 20492 and from the new value combined with newcombs lightvelocity was derived a valuable approximation to the suns distance concluded at 92905021 miles parallax 8794 yet it is not quite certain that nyrns correction was an improvement a differential method of determining the amount of aberration struck out by m loewy of paris792 avoids most of the objections to the absolute method previously in vogue and the upshot of its application in 1891 was to show that struves constant might better be retained than altered loewys of 20447 varying from it only to an insignificant extent professor hall had moreover deduced nearly the same value 20454 from the washington observations since 1862 of alpha lyr vega whence in conjunction with newcombs rate of light transmission he arrived at a solar parallax of 881793 inverting the process sir david gill in 1897 derived the constant from the parallax if the earths orbit

correction professor harkness surveyed in 1891794 from an eclectic point of view the general situation as regarded the suns parallax convinced that no single method deserved an exclusive preference he reached a plausible result through the combination on the principle of least squaresthat is by the mathematical rules of probabilityof all the various quantities upon which the great datum depends it thus summed up and harmonised the whole of the multifarious evidence bearing upon the point and as modified in 1894795 falls very satisfactorily into line with the cape determination we may then at

possess the more brilliant gifts of his rival herschels piercing discernment comprehensive intelligence and inventive splendour were wanting to him he was nevertheless the founder of descriptive astronomy in germany as herschel was in england born at erfurt in 1745 he prosecuted legal studies at gttingen and there imbibed from kstner a lifelong devotion to science from the law however he got the means of living and what was to the full as precious to him the means of observing entering the sphere of hanoverian officialism in 1788 he settled a few years later at lilienthal near bremen as oberamtmann or chief magistrate here he built a small observatory enriched in 1785 with a sevenfoot reflector by herschel then one of the most powerful instruments to be found anywhere out of england it was soon surpassed through his exertions by the firstfruits of native industry in that branch schrader of kiel transferred his workshops to lilienthal in 1792 and constructed there under the superintendence and at the cost of the astronomical oberamtmann a thirteenfoot reflector declared by lalande to be the finest telescope in existence and one twentyseven feet in focal length probably as inferior to its predecessor in real efficiency as it was superior in size thus with instruments of gradually increasing power schrter studied during thirtyfour years the topography of the moon and planets the field was then almost untrodden he had but few and casual predecessors and has since had no equal in the sustained and concentrated patience of his hourly watchings both their prolixity and their enthusiasm are faithfully reflected in his various treatises yet the one may be pardoned for the sake of the other especially when it is remembered that he struck out a substantially new line and that one of the main lines of future advance moreover his infectious zeal communicated itself he set the example of observing when there was scarcely an observer in germany and under his roof harding and bessel received their training as practical astronomers but he was reserved to see evil days early in 1813 the french under vandamme occupied bremen on the night of april 20 the vale of lilies was by their wanton destructiveness laid waste with fire the government offices were destroyed and with them the chief part of schrters property including the whole stock of his books and writings there was worse behind a few days later his observatory which had escaped the conflagration was broken into pillaged and ruined his life was wrecked with it he survived the catastrophe three years without the means to repair or the power to forget it and gradually sank from disappointment into decay terminated by death august 29 1816 he had indeed done all the work he was capable of and though not of the first quality it was far from contemptible he laid the foundation of the comparative study of the moons surface and the descriptive particulars of the planets laboriously collected by him constituted a store of more or less reliable information hardly added to during the ensuing half century they rested it is true under some shadow of doubt but the most recent observations have tended on several points to rehabilitate the discredited authority of the lilienthal astronomer we may now briefly resume and pursue in its further progress the course of his studies taking the planets in the order of their distances from the sun in april 1792 schrter saw reason to conclude from the gradual degradation of light on its partially illuminated disc that mercury possesses a tolerably dense atmosphere796 during the transit of may 7 1799 he was moreover struck with the appearance of a ring of softened luminosity encircling the planet to an apparent height of three seconds or about a quarter of its own diameter797 although a mere thought in texture it remained persistently visible both with the sevenfoot and the thirteenfoot reflectors armed with powers up to 288 it had a wellmarked grayish boundary and reminded him though indefinitely fainter of the penumbra of a sunspot a similar appendage had been noticed by de plantade at montpellier november 11 1736 and again in 1786 and 1789 by prosperin and flaugergues but herschel on november 9 1802 saw the preceding limb of the planet projected on the sun cut the luminous solar clouds with the most perfect sharpness798 the presence however of a halo was unmistakable in 1832 when professor moll of utrecht described it as a nebulous ring of a darker tinge approaching to the violet colour799 again to huggins and stone november 5 1868 it showed as lucid and most distinct no change in the colour of the glasses used or the powers applied could get rid of it and it lasted throughout the transit800 it was next seen by christie and dunkin at greenwich may 6 1878801 and with much precision of detail by trouvelot at cambridge us802 professor holden on the other hand noted at hastingsonhudson the total absence of all anomalous appearances803 nor could any vestige of them be perceived by barnard at lick on november 10 1894804 various effects of irradiation and diffraction were however observed by lowell and w h pickering at flagstaff805 and davidson was favoured at san francisco with glimpses of the historic aureola806 as well as of a central whitish spot which often accompanies it that both are somehow of optical production can scarcely be doubted nothing can be learned from them regarding the planets physical condition airy showed that refraction in a mercurian atmosphere could not possibly originate the noted aureola which must accordingly be set down as strictly an ocular nervous phenomenon807 it is the less easy to escape from this conclusion that we find the virtually airless moon capable of exhibiting a like appendage professor stephen alexander of the united states survey with two other observers perceived during the eclipse of the sun of july 18 1860 the advancing lunar limb to be bordered with a bright band808 and photographic effects of the same kind appear in pictures of transits of venus and partial solar eclipses the spectroscope affords little information as to the constitution of mercury its light is of course that of the sun reflected and its spectrum is consequently a faint echo of the fraunhofer spectrum dr h c vogel who first examined it in april 1871 suspected traces of the action of an atmosphere like ours809 but it would seem on slight grounds it is however certainly very poor in blue rays more definite conclusions were in 1874810 derived by zllner from photometric observations of mercurian phases a similar study of the waxing and waning moon had afforded him the curious discovery that lightchanges dependent upon phase vary with the nature of the reflecting surface following a totally different law on a smooth homogeneous globe and on a rugged and mountainous one now the phases of mercuryso far as could be determined from only two sets of observationscorrespond with the latter kind of structure strictly analogous to those of the moon they seem to indicate an analogous mode of surfaceformation this conclusion was fully borne out by mllers more extended observations at potsdam during the years 18851893811 practical assurance was gained from them that the innermost planet has a rough rind of dusky rock absorbing all but 17 per cent of the light poured upon it by the fierce adjacent sun its albedo in other words is 017812 which is precisely that ascribed to the moon the absence of any appreciable mercurian atmosphere followed almost necessarily from these results on march 26 1800 schrter observing with his 13foot reflector in a peculiarly clear sky perceived the southern horn of mercurys crescent to be quite distinctly blunted813 interception of sunlight by a mercurian mountain rather more than eleven english miles high explained the effect to his satisfaction by carefully timing its recurrence he concluded rotation on an axis in a period of 24 hours 4 minutes the first determination of the kind rewarded twenty years of unceasing vigilance it received ostensible confirmation from the successive appearances of a dusky streak and blotch in may and june 1801814 these however were inferred to be no permanent markings on the body of the planet but atmospheric formations the streak at times drifting forwards it was thought under the fluctuating influence of mercurian breezes from a rediscussion of these somewhat doubtful observations bessel inferred that mercury rotates on an axis inclined 70 to the plane of its orbit in 24 hours 53 seconds the rounded appearance of the southern horn seen by schrter was more or less doubtfully caught by noble 1864 burton and franks 1877815 but was obvious to mr w f denning at bristol on the morning of november 5 1882816 that the southern polar regions are usually less bright than the northern is well ascertained but the cause of the deficiency remains dubious if inequalities of surface are in question they must be on a considerable scale and a similar explanation might be given of the deformations of the terminatoror dividingline between darkness and light in the planets phasesfirst remarked by schrter and again clearly seen by trouvelot in 1878 and 1881817 the displacement during four days of certain brilliant and dusky spaces on the disc indicated to mr denning in 1882 rotation in about twentyfive hours while the general aspect of the planet reminded him of that of mars818 but the difficulties in the way of its observation are enormously enhanced by its constant close attendance on the sun in his sustained study of the features of mercury schrter had no imitator until schiaparelli took up the task at milan in 1882 his observations were made in daylight it was found that much more could be seen and higher magnifying powers used high up in the sky near the sun than at low altitudes through the agitated air of morning or evening twilight a notable discovery ensued819 following the planet hour by hour instead of making necessarily brief inspections at intervals of about a day as previous observers had done it was found that the markings faintly visible remained sensibly fixed hence that there was no rotation in a period at all comparable with that of the earth and after long and patient watching the conclusion was at last reached that mercury turns on his axis in the same time needed to complete a revolution in his orbit one of his hemispheres then is always averted from the sun as one of the moons hemispheres from the earth while the other never shifts from beneath his torrid rays the librations however of mercury are on a larger scale than those of the moon because he travels in a more eccentric path the temporary inequalities arising between his even pacing on an axis and his alternately accelerated and retarded elliptical movement occasion in fact an oscillation to and fro of the boundaries of light and darkness on his globe over an arc of 47 22 in the course of his year of 88 days thus the regions of perpetual day and perpetual night are separated by two segments amounting to onefourth of the entire surface where the sun rises and sets once in 88 days else there is no variation from the intense glare on one side of the globe and the nocturnal blackness on the other to schiaparellis scrutiny mercury appeared as a spotty globe enveloped in a tolerably dense atmosphere the brownish stripes and streaks discerned on his rosetinged disc and judged to be permanent were made the basis of a chart they were not indeed always equally well seen they disappeared regularly near the limb and were at times veiled even when centrally situated some of them had been clearly perceived by de ball at bothkamp in 1882820 mr lowell followed schiaparellis example by observing mercury in the full glare of noon the best time to study him he remarked is when planetary almanacs state mercury invisible a remarkable series of drawings executed some at flagstaff in 1896 the remainder at mexico in 1897 supplied grounds for the following among other conclusions821 mercury rotates synchronously with its revolutionthat is once in 88 dayson an axis sensibly perpendicular to its orbital plane no certain signs of a mercurian atmosphere are visible the globe is seamed and furrowed with long narrow markings explicable as cracks in cooling it is and always was a dead world from micrometrical measures moreover the inferences were drawn that the planets mass has a probable value about 120 that of the earth while its mean density falls considerably short of the terrestrial standard the theory of mercurys movements has always given trouble in lalandes822 as in mstlins time the planet seemed to exist for no other purpose than to throw discredit on astronomers and even to leverriers powerful analysis it long proved recalcitrant on the 12th of september 1869 however he was able to announce before the academy of sciences823 the terms of a compromise between observation and calculation they involved the addition of a new member to the solar system the hitherto unrecognised presence of a body about the size of mercury itself revolving at somewhat less than half its mean distance from the sun or if farther then of less mass and vice vers would it was pointed out produce exactly the effect required of displacing the perihelion of the former planet 38 a century more than could otherwise be accounted for the planes of the two orbits however should not lie far apart as otherwise a nodal disturbance would arise not perceived to exist it was added that a ring of asteroids similarly placed would answer the purpose equally well and was more likely to have escaped notice upon the heels of this forecast followed promptly a seeming verification dr lescarbault a physician residing at orgres whose slender opportunities had not blunted his hopes of achievement had ever since 1845 when he witnessed a transit of mercury cherished the idea that an unknown planet might be caught thus projected on the solar background unable to observe continuously until 1858 he on march 26 1859 saw what he had expecteda small perfectly round object slowly traversing the suns disc the fruitless expectation of reobserving the phenomenon however kept him silent and it was not until december 22 after the news of leverriers prediction had reached him that he wrote to acquaint him with his supposed discovery824 the imperial astronomer thereupon hurried down to orgres and by personal inspection of the simple apparatus used by searching crossexamination and local inquiry convinced himself of the genuine character and substantial accuracy of the reported observation he named the new planet vulcan and computed elements giving it a period of revolution slightly under twenty days825 but it has never since been seen m liais director of the brazilian coast survey thought himself justified in asserting that it never had been seen observing the sun for twelve minutes after the supposed ingress recorded at orgres he noted those particular regions of its surface as trs uniformes dintensit826 he subsequently however admitted lescarbaults good faith at first rashly questioned the planetseeking doctor was in truth only one among many victims of similar illusions waning interest in the subject was revived by a fresh announcement of a transit witnessed it was asserted by weber at peckeloh april 4 1876827 the pseudoplanet indeed was detected shortly afterwards on the greenwich photographs and was found to have been seen by m ventosa at madrid in its true character of a sunspot without penumbra but leverrier had meantime undertaken the investigation of a list of twenty similar dubious appearances collected by haase and republished by wolf in 1872828 from these five were picked out as referring in all likelihood to the same body the reality of whose existence was now confidently asserted and of which more or less probable transits were fixed for march 22 1877 and october 15 1882829 but widespread watchfulness notwithstanding no suspicious object came into view at either epoch the next announcement of the discovery of vulcan was on the occasion of the total solar eclipse of july 29 1878830 this time it was stated to have been seen at some distance southwest of the obscured sun as a ruddy star with a minute planetary disc and its simultaneous detection by two observersthe late professor james c watson stationed at rawlins wyoming territory and professor lewis swift at denver coloradowas at first readily admitted but their separate observations could on a closer examination by no possibility be brought into harmony and if valid certainly referred to two distinct objects if not to four each astronomer eventually claiming a pair of planets nor could any one of the four be identified with lescarbaults and leverriers vulcan which if a substantial body revolving round the sun must then have been found on the east side of that luminary831 the most feasible explanation of the puzzle seems to be that watson and swift merely saw each the same two stars in cancer haste and excitement doing the rest832 nevertheless they strenuously maintained their opposite conviction833 intramercurian planets have since been diligently searched for when the opportunity of a total eclipse offered especially during the long obscuration at caroline island not only did professor holden sweep in the solar vicinity but palisa and trouvelot agreed to divide the field of exploration and thus make sure of whatever planetary prey there might be within reach yet with only negative results photographic explorations during recent eclipses have been equally fruitless belief in the presence of any considerable body or bodies within the orbit of mercury is accordingly at a low ebb yet the existence of the anomaly in the mercurian movements indicated by leverrier has been made only surer by further research834 its elucidation constitutes one of the pending problems of astronomy from the observation at bologna in 166667 of some very faint spots domenico cassini concluded a rotation or libration of venushe was not sure whichin about twentythree hours835 by bianchini in 1726 the period was augmented to twentyfour days eight hours j j cassini however in 1740 showed that the data collected by both observers were consistent with rotation in twentythree hours twenty minutes836 so the matter rested until schrters time after watching nine years in vain he at last february 28 1788 perceived the ordinarily uniform brightness of the planets disc to be marbled with a filmy streak which returned periodically to the same position in about twentythree hours twentyeight minutes this approximate estimate was corrected by the application of a more definite criterion on december 28 1789 the southern horn of the crescent venus was seen truncated an outlying lucid point interrupting the darkness beyond precisely the same appearance recurred two years later giving for the planets rotation a period of 23h 21m837 to this only twentytwo seconds were added by de vico as the result of over 10000 observations made with the cauchoix refractor of the collegio romano 183941838 the axis of rotation was found to be much more bowed towards the orbital plane than that of the earth the equator making with it an angle of 53 11 these conclusions inspired it is true much distrust consequently there were no received ideas on the subject to be subverted nevertheless a shock of surprise was felt at schiaparellis announcement early in 1890839 that venus most probably rotates after the fashion just previously ascribed to mercury a continuous series of observations from november 1877 to february 1878 with their records in above a hundred drawings supplied the chief part of the data upon which he rested his conclusions they certainly appeared exceptionally wellgrounded and the doubts at first qualifying them were removed by a fresh set of determinations in july 1895840 most observers had depended in their attempts to ascertain the rotationperiod of venus upon evanescent shadings most likely of atmospheric origin and scarcely recognisable from day to day schiaparelli fixed his attention upon round defined lustrously white spots the presence of which near the cusps of the illuminated crescent has been attested for close upon two centuries his steady watch over them showed the invariability of their position with regard to the terminator and this is as much as to say that the regions of day and night do not shift on the surface of the planet in other words she keeps the same face always turned towards the sun moreover since her orbit is nearly circular libratory effects are very small they amount in fact to only just onethirtieth of those serving to modify the severe contrasts of climate in mercury confirmatory evidence of schiaparellis result for venus is not wanting thus observations irreconcilable with a swift rate of rotation were made at bothkamp in 1871 by vogel and lohse841 and a drawing executed by professor holden with the great washington reflector december 15 1877 showed the same markings in the positions recorded at milan to have been occupied by them eight hours previously further a series of observations carried out by m perrotin at nice may 15 to october 4 1890 and from mount mounier in 18956 with the special aim of testing the inference of synchronous rotation and revolution proved strongly corroborative of it842 a remarkable collection of drawings made by mr lowell in 1896 appeared decisive in its favour843 tacchini at rome844 mascari at catania and etna845 cerulli at terano846 obtained in 18926 evidence similar in purport on the other hand niesten of brussels found reason to revert to vicos discarded elements for the planets rotation847 and trouvelot848 stanley williams849 villiger850 and leo brenner851 so far agreed with him as to adopt a period of approximately twentyfour hours finally e von oppolzer suggested an appeal to the spectroscope852 and blopolsky secured in 1900853 spectrograms apparently marked by the minute displacements corresponding to a rapid rate of axial movement but they were avowedly taken only as an experiment with unsuitable apparatus and the desirable verification of their supposed import is not yet forthcoming until it is schiaparellis period of 225 days must be allowed to hold the field effects attributed to great differences of level in the surface of venus have struck many observers francesco fontana at naples in 1643 noticed irregularities along the inner edge of the crescent854 lahire in 1700 considered themregard being had to difference of distanceto be much more strongly marked than those visible in the moon855 schrters assertions to the same effect though scouted with some unnecessary vehemence by herschel856 have since been repeatedly confirmed amongst others by mdler de vico langdon who in 1873 saw the broken line of the terminator with peculiar distinctness through a veil of auroral cloud857 by denning858 march 30 1881 despite preliminary impressions to the contrary as well as by c v zenger at prague january 8 1883 the great mountain mass presumed to occasion the periodical blunting of the southern horn was precariously estimated by the lilienthal observer to rise to the prodigious height of nearly twentyseven miles or just five times the elevation of mount everest yet the phenomenon persists whatever may be thought of the explanation moreover the speck of light beyond interpreted as the visible sign of a detached peak rising high enough above the encircling shadow to catch the first and last rays of the sun was frequently discerned by baron van ertborn in 1876859 while an object near the northern horn of the crescent strongly resembling a lunar ringmountain was delineated both by de vico in 1841 and by denning forty years later we are almost equally sure that venus as that the earth is encompassed with an atmosphere yet notwithstanding luminous appearances plainly due to refraction during the transits both of 1761 and 1769 schrter in 1792 took the initiative in coming to a definite conclusion on the subject860 it was founded first on the rapid diminution of brilliancy towards the terminator attributed to atmospheric absorption next on the extension beyond a semicircle of the horns of the crescent lastly on the presence of a bluish gleam illuminating the early hours of the cytherean night with what was taken to be genuine twilight even herschel admitted that sunlight by the same effect through which the heavenly bodies show visibly above our horizons while still geometrically below them appeared to be bent round the shoulder of the globe of venus ample confirmation of the fact has since been afforded at dorpat in may 1849 the planet being within 3 26 of inferior conjunction mdler found the arms of waning light upon the disc to embrace no less than 240 of its extent861 and in december 1842 mr guthrie of bervie nb actually observed under similar conditions the whole circumference to be lit up with a faint nebulous glow862 the same curious phenomenon was intermittently seen by mr leeson prince at uckfield in september 1861863 but with more satisfactory distinctness by mr c s lyman of yale college864 before and after the conjunction of december 11 1866 and during nearly five hours previous to the transit of 1874 when the yellowish ring of refracted light showed at one point an approach to interruption possibly through the intervention of a bank of clouds again on december 2 1898 venus being 1 45 from the suns centre mr h n russell of the halsted observatory descried the coalescence of the cusps and founded on the observation a valuable discussion of such effects865 taking account of certain features in the case left unnoticed by neison866 and proctor867 he inferred from them the presence of a cytherean atmosphere considerably less refractive than our own although possibly in its lower strata encumbered with dust or haze similar appearances are conspicuous during transits but while the mercurian halo is characteristically seen on the sun the silver thread round the limb of venus commonly shows on the part off the sun there are however instances of each description in both cases mr grant in collecting the records of physical phenomena accompanying the transits of 1761 and 1769 remarks that no one person saw both kinds of annulus and argues a dissimilarity in their respective modes of production868 such a dissimilarity probably exists in the sense that the inner section of the ring is illusory the outer a genuine result of the bending of light in a gaseous envelope but the distinction of separate visibility has not been borne out by recent experience several of the australian observers during the transit of 1874 witnessed the complete phenomenon mr j macdonnell at eden saw a shadowy nebulous ring surround the whole disc when ingress was twothirds accomplished mr tornaghi at goulburn perceived a halo entire and unmistakable at half egress869 similar observations were made at sydney870 and were renewed in 1882 by lescarbault at orgres by metzger in java and by barnard at vanderbilt university871 spectroscopic indications of aqueous vapour as present in the atmosphere of venus were obtained in 1874 and 1882 by tacchini and ricc in italy and by young in new jersey872 janssen however who made a special study of the point subsequently to the transit of 1882 found them much less certain than he had anticipated873 and vogel by repeated examinations 187173 could detect only the very slightest variations from the pattern of the solar spectrum some additions there indeed seem to be in the thickening of a few water and oxygenlines but so nearly evanescent as to induce the persuasion that most of the light we receive from venus has traversed only the tenuous upper portion of its atmosphere874 it is reflected at any rate with comparatively slight diminution on the 26th and 27th of september 1878 a close conjunction gave mr james nasmyth the rare opportunity of watching venus and mercury for several hours side by side in the field of his reflector when the former appeared to him like clean silver the latter as dull as lead or zinc875 yet the light incident upon mercury is on an average three and a half times as strong as the light reaching venus thus the reflective power of venus must be singularly strong and we find accordingly from a combination of zllners with mllers results that its albedo is but little inferior to that of newfallen snow in other words it gives back 77 per cent of the luminous rays impinging upon it this extraordinary brilliancy would be intelligible were it permissible to suppose that we see nothing of the planet but a dense canopy of clouds but the hypothesis is discountenanced by the flagstaff observations and is irreconcilable with the visibility of mountainous elevations and permanent surfacemarkings to mr lowell these were so distinct and unchanging as to furnish data for a chart of the cytherean globe and the peculiar arrangement of divergent shading exhibited in it cannot offhand be set down as unreal in view of perrotins earlier discernment of analogous linear traces gruithuisens snowcaps876 howeverit is safe to saydo not exist as such although shining regions near the poles form a wellattested trait of the strange cytherean landscape the secondary or ashen light of venus was first noticed by riccioli in 1643 it was seen by derham about 1715 by kirch in 1721 by schrter and harding in 1806877 and the reality of the appearance has since been authenticated by numerous and trustworthy observations it is precisely similar to that of the old moon in the new moons arms and zenger who witnessed it with unusual distinctness january 8 1883878 supposes it due to the same causenamely to the faint gleam of reflected earthlight from the nightside of the planet when we remember however that full earthlight on venus at its nearest has little more than 112000 its intensity on the moon we see at once that the explanation is inadequate nor can professor safariks879 by phosphorescence of the warm and teeming oceans with which zllner880 regarded the globe of venus as mainly covered be seriously entertained vogels suggestion is more plausible he and o lohse at bothkamp november 3 to 11 1871 saw the dark hemisphere partially illuminated by secondary light extending 30 from the terminator and thought the effect might be produced by a very extensive twilight881 others have had recourse to the analogy of our auror and j lamp suggested that the grayish gleam visible to him at bothkamp october 21 and 26 1887882 might be an accompaniment of electrical processes connected with the planets meteorology whatever the origin of the phenomenon it may serve on a nightenwrapt hemisphere to dissipate some of the thick darkness otherwise encroached upon only by the pale light of stars venus was once supposed to possess a satellite but belief in its existence has died out no one indeed has caught even a deceptive glimpse of such an object during the last 125 years yet it was repeatedly and one might have thought well observed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries fontana discovered it in 1645 cassinian adept in the art of seeingrecognised it in 1672 and again in 1686 short watched it for a full hour in 1740 with varied instrumental means tobias mayer in 1759 montaigne in 1761 several astronomers at copenhagen in march 1764 noted what they considered its unmistakable presence as did horrebow in 1768 but m paul stroobant883 who in 1887 submitted all the available data on the subject to a searching examination identified horrebows satellite with theta libr a fifthmagnitude star and a few other apparitions were by his industry similarly explained away nevertheless several withstood all efforts to account for them and together form a most curious case of illusion for it is quite certain that venus has no such conspicuous attendant the third planet encountered in travelling outward from the sun is the abode of man he has in consequence opportunities for studying its physical habitudes altogether different from the baffling glimpse afforded to him of the other members of the solar family regarding the earth then a mass of knowledge so varied and comprehensive has been accumulated as to form a scienceor rather several sciencesapart but underneath all lie astronomical relations the recognition and investigation of which constitute one of the most significant intellectual events of the present century it is indeed far from easy to draw a line of logical distinction between items of knowledge which have their proper place here and those which should be left to the historian of geology there are some however of which the cosmical connections are so close that it is impossible to overlook them among these is the ascertainment of the solidity of the globe at first sight it seems difficult to conceive what the apparent positions of the stars can have to do with subterranean conditions yet it was from star measurements alone that hopkins in 1839 concluded the earth to be solid to a depth of at least 800 or 1000 miles884 his argument was that if it were a mere shell filled with liquid precession and nutation would be much larger than they are observed to be for the shell alone would follow the pull of the sun and moon on its equatorial girdle leaving the liquid behind and being thus so much the lighter would move the more readily there is it is true grave reason to doubt whether this reasoning corresponds with the actual facts of the case885 but the conclusion to which it led has been otherwise affirmed and extended indications of an identical purport have been derived from another kind of external disturbance affecting our globe through the same agencies lord kelvin then sir william thomson pointed out in 1862886 that tidal influences are brought to bear on land as well as on water although obedience to them is perceptible only in the mobile element some bodily distortion of the earths figure must however take place unless we suppose it of absolute or preternatural rigidity and the amount of such distortion can be determined from its effect in diminishing oceanic tides below their calculated value for if the earth were perfectly plastic to the stresses of solar and lunar gravity tidesin the ordinary sensewould not exist continents and oceans would swell and subside together it is to the difference in the behaviour of solid and liquid terrestrial constituents that the ebb and flow of the waters are due six years later the distinguished glasgow professor suggested that this criterion might by the aid of a prolonged series of exact tidal observations be practically applied to test the interior condition of our planet887 in 1882 accordingly suitable data extending over thirtythree years having at length become available mr g h darwin performed the laborious task of their analysis with the general result that the effective rigidity of the earths mass must be at least as great as that of steel888 ratification from an unexpected quarter has lately been brought to this conclusion the question of a possible mobility in the earths axis of rotation has often been mooted now at last it has received an affirmative reply dr kstner detected in his observations of 188485 effects apparently springing from a minute variation in the latitude of berlin the matter having been brought before the international geodetic association in 1888 special observations were set on foot at berlin potsdam prague and strasbourg the upshot of which was to bring plainly to view synchronous and seemingly periodic fluctuations of latitude to the extent of half a second of arc the reality of these was verified by an expedition to honolulu in 189192 the variations there corresponding inversely to those simultaneously determined in europe889 their character was completely defined by mr s c chandlers discussion in october 1891890 he showed that they could be explained by supposing the pole of the earth to describe a circle with a radius of thirty feet in a period of fourteen months confirmation of this hypothesis was found by dr b a gould in the cordoba observations891 and it was provided with a physical basis through the able cooperation of professor newcomb892 the earth owing to its ellipsoidal shape should apart from disturbance rotate upon its axis of figure or shortest diameter since thus alone can the centrifugal forces generated by its spinning balance each other temporary causes however such as heavy falls of snow or rain limited to one continental area the shifting of icemasses even the movements of winds may render the globe slightly lopsided and thus oblige it to forsake its normal axis and rotate on one somewhat divergent from it this instantaneous axis for it is incessantly changing must by mathematical theory revolve round the axis of figure in a period of 306 days provided that is to say the earth were a perfectly rigid body but it is far from being so it yields sensibly to every strain put upon it and this yielding tends to protract the time of circulation of the displaced pole the length of its period then serves as a kind of measure of the plasticity of the globe which according to newcombs and s s houghs independent calculations893 seems to be a little less than that of steel in an earth compacted of steel the instantaneous axis would revolve in 441 days in the actual earth the process is accomplished in 428 days by this new path accordingly astronomers have been led to an identical estimate of the consistence of our globe with that derived from tidal investigations variations of latitude are intrinsically complex to produce them an incalculable interplay of causes must be at work each with its proper period and law of action894 all the elements of the phenomenon are then in a perpetual state of flux895 and absorb for their continual redetermination the arduous and combined labours of many astronomers nor is this trouble superfluous minute in extent though they be the shiftings of the pole menace the very foundations of exact celestial science their neglect would leave the entire fabric insecure just at the beginning of the present century they reached a predicted minimum but are expected again to augment their range after the year 1902 the interesting suggestion has been made by mr j halm that such fluctuations are in some obscure way affected by changes in solar activity and conform like them to an elevenyear cycle896 in a paper read before the geological society december 15 1830897 sir john herschel threw out the idea that the perplexing changes of climate revealed by the geological record might be explained through certain slow fluctuations in the eccentricity of the earths orbit produced by the disturbing action of the other planets shortly afterwards however he abandoned the position as untenable898 and it was left to the late dr james croll in 1864899 and subsequent years to reoccupy and fortify it within restricted limits as lagrange and more certainly and definitely leverrier proved the path pursued by our planet round the sun alternately contracts in the course of ages into a moderate ellipse and expands almost to a circle the major axis and consequently the mean distance remaining invariable even at present when the eccentricity approaches a minimum the sun is nearer to us in january than in july by above three million miles and some 850000 years ago this difference was more than four times as great dr croll brought together900 a mass of evidence to support the view that at epochs of considerable eccentricity the hemisphere of which the winter occurring at aphelion was both intensified and prolonged must have undergone extensive glaciation while the opposite hemisphere with a short mild winter and long cool summer enjoyed an approach to perennial spring these conditions were exactly reversed at the end of 10500 years through the shifting of the perihelion combined with the precession of the equinoxes the frozen hemisphere blooming into a luxuriant garden as its seasons came round to occur at the opposite sites of the terrestrial orbit and the vernal hemisphere subsiding simultaneously into icebound rigour901 thus a plausible explanation was offered of the anomalous alternations of glacial and semitropical periods attested on incontrovertible geological evidence as having succeeded each other in times past over what are now temperate regions they succeeded each other it is true with much less frequency and regularity than the theory demanded but the discrepancy was overlooked or smoothed away the most recent glacial epoch was placed by dr croll about 200000 years ago when the eccentricity of the earths orbit was 34 times as great as it is now at present a faint representation of such a state of things is afforded by the southern hemisphere one condition of glaciation in the coincidence of winter with the maximum of remoteness from the sun is present the othera high eccentricityis deficient yet the ring of icebound territory hemming in the southern pole is well known to be far more extensive than the corresponding region in the north the verification of this ingenious hypothesis depends upon a variety of intricate meteorological conditions some of which have been adversely interpreted by competent authorities902 what is still more serious its acceptance seems precluded by timerelations of a simple kind dr wright903 has established with some approach to certainty that glacial conditions ceased in canada and the united states about ten or twelve thousand years ago the erosive action of the falls of niagara qualifies them to serve as a clepsydra or waterclock on a grand scale and their chronological indications have been amply corroborated elsewhere and otherwise on the same continent the astronomical ice age however should have been enormously more antique no reconciliation of the facts with the theory appears possible the first attempt at an experimental estimate of the mean density of the earth was maskelynes observation in 1774 of the deflection of a plumbline through the attraction of schehallien the conclusion thence derived that our globe weighs 412 times as much as an equal bulk of water904 was not very exact it was considerably improved upon by cavendish who in 1798 brought into use the torsionbalance constructed for the same purpose by john michell the resulting estimate of 548 was raised to 566 by francis bailys elaborate repetition of the process in 183842 from experiments on the subject made in 187273 by cornu and baille the slightly inferior value of 556 was derived and it was further shown that the data collected by baily when corrected for a systematic error gave practically the same result 555905 m wilsings of 558 obtained at potsdam in 1889906 nearly agreed with it while professor poynting by means of a common balance arrived at a terrestrial mean density of 549907 professor boys next entered the field with an exquisite apparatus in which a quartz fibre performed the functions of a torsionrod and the figure 553 determined by him and exactly confirmed by dr brauns research at mariaschein bohemia in 1896908 may be called the standard value of the required datum newtons guess at the average weight of the earth as five or six times that of water has thus been curiously verified operations for determining the figure of the earth were carried out during the last century on an unprecedented scale the russoscandinavian arc of which the measurement was completed under the direction of the elder struve in 1855 reached from hammerfest to ismailia on the danube a length of 25 20 but little inferior to it was the indian arc begun by lambton in the first years of the century continued by everest revised and extended by walker both were surpassed in compass by the anglofrench arc which embraced 28 and considerable segments of meridians near the atlantic and pacific shores of north america were measured under the auspices of the united states coast survey but these operations shrink into insignificance by comparison with sir david gills grandiose scheme for uniting two hemispheres by a continuous network of triangulation the history of geodesy in south africa began with lacailles measurements in 1752 they were repeated and enlarged in scope by sir thomas maclear in 184148 and his determinations prepared the way for a complete survey of cape colony and natal executed during the ten years 188392 by colonel morris re under the direction of sir david gill909 bechuanaland and rhodesia were subsequently included in the work and the royal astronomer obtained in 1900 the support of the international geodetic association for its extension to the mouth of the nile nor was this the limit of his design by carrying the survey along the levantine coast connection can be established with struves system and the magnificent amplitude of 105 will be given to the conjoined african and european arcs meantime the french have undertaken the remeasurement of bouguers peruvian arc and a corresponding russoswedish910 enterprise is progressing in spitzbergen so that abundant materials will ere long be provided for fresh investigations of the shape and size of our planet the smallness of the outstanding uncertainty can be judged of by comparing j b listings911 with general clarkes912 results published in the same year 1878 listing stated the dimensions of the terrestrial spheroid as follows equatorial radius 3960 miles polar radius 3947 miles ellipticity 12885 clarkes corresponding figures were 3963 and 3950 miles giving an ellipticity of 12935 the value of the latter fraction at present generally adopted is 1292 that is to say the thickness of the protuberant equatorial ring is held to be 1292 of the equatorial radius from astronomical considerations it is true newcomb estimated the ratio at 1308913 but for obtaining this particular datum geodetical methods are unquestionably to be preferred the moon possesses for us a unique interest she in all probability shared the origin of the earth she perhaps prefigures its decay she is at present its minister and companion her existence so far as we can see serves no other purpose than to illuminate the darkness of terrestrial nights and to measure by swiftlyrecurring and conspicuous changes of aspect the long span of terrestrial time inquiries stimulated by visible dependence and aided by relatively close vicinity have resulted in a wonderfully minute acquaintance with the features of the single lunar hemisphere open to our inspection selenography in the modern sense is little more than a hundred years old it originated with the publication in 1791 of schrters selenotopographische fragmente914 not but that the lunar surface had already been diligently studied chiefly by hevelius cassini riccioli and tobias mayer the idea however of investigating the moons physical condition and detecting symptoms of the activity there of natural forces through minute topographical inquiry first obtained effect at lilienthal schrters delineations accordingly imperfect though they were afforded a startingpoint for a comparative study of the superficial features of our satellite the first of the curious objects which he named rills was noted by him in 1787 before 1801 he had found eleven lohrmann added 75 mdler 55 schmidt published in 1866 a catalogue of 425 of which 278 had been detected by himself915 and he eventually brought the number up to nearly 1000 they are then a very persistent lunar feature though wholly without terrestrial analogue there is no difference of opinion as to their nature they are quite obviously clefts in a rocky surface 100 to 500 yards deep usually a couple of miles across and pursuing straight curved or branching tracks up to 150 miles in length as regards their origin the most probable view is that they are fissures produced in cooling but neison inclines to consider them rather as dried watercourses916 on february 24 1792 schrter perceived what he took to be distinct traces of a lunar twilight and continued to observe them during nine consecutive years917 they indicated he thought the presence of a shallow atmosphere about 29 times more tenuous than our own bessel on the other hand considered that the only way of saving a lunar atmosphere was to deny it any refractive power the sharpness and suddenness of staroccultations negativing the possibility of gaseous surroundings of greater density admitting an extreme supposition than 1500 that of terrestrial air918 newcomb places the maximum at 1400 sir john herschel concluded the nonexistence of any atmosphere at the moons edge having 11980 part of the density of the earths atmosphere919 this decision was fully borne out by sir william hugginss spectroscopic observation of the disappearance behind the moons limb of the small star eta piscium january 4 1865920 not the slightest sign of selective absorption or unequal refraction was discernible the entire spectrum went out at once as if a slide had suddenly dropped over it the spectroscope has uniformly told the same tale for m thollons observation during the total solar eclipse at sohag of a supposed thickening at the moons rim of certain dark lines in the solar spectrum is now acknowledged to have been illusory moonlight analysed with the prism is found to be pure reflected sunlight diminished in quantity owing to the low reflective capability of the lunar surface to less than onefifth its incident intensity but wholly unmodified in quality nevertheless the diameter of the moon appeared from the greenwich observations discussed by airy in 1865921 to be 4 smaller than when directly measured and the effect would be explicable by refraction in a lunar atmosphere 2000 times thinner than our own at the sealevel but the difference was probably illusory it resulted in part if not wholly from the visual enlargement by irradiation of the bright disc of the moon professor comstock employing the 16inch clark equatoreal of the washburn observatory found in 1897 the refractive displacements of occulted stars so trifling as to preclude the existence of a permanent lunar atmosphere of much more than 15000 the density of the terrestrial envelope922 the possibility however was admitted that on the illuminated side of the moon temporary exhalations of aqueous vapour might arise from icestrata evaporated by sunheat meantime some renewed evidence of actual crepuscular gleams on the moon had been gathered by mm paul and prosper henry of the paris observatory as well as by mr w h pickering in the pure air of arequipa at an altitude of 8000 feet above the sea923 an occultation of jupiter too observed by him august 12 1892924 was attended with a slight flattening of the planets disc through the effect it was supposed of lunar refractionbut of refraction in an atmosphere possessing at the most 14000 the density at the sealevel of terrestrial air and capable of holding in equilibrium no more than 1250 of an inch of mercury yet this small barometric value corresponds mr pickering remarks to a pressure of hundreds of tons per square mile of the lunar surface the compression downward of gaseous strata on the moon should in any case proceed very gradually owing to the slight power of lunar gravity925 and they might hence play an important part in the economy of our satellite while evading spectroscopic and other tests thusas mr ranyard remarked926the cliffs and pinnacles of the moon bear witness by their unworn condition to the efficiency of atmospheric protection against meteoric bombardment and mr pickering shows that it could be afforded by such a tenuous envelope as that postulated by him the first to emulate schrters selenographical zeal was wilhelm gotthelf lohrmann a landsurveyor of dresden who in 1824 published four out of twentyfive sections of the first scientifically executed lunar chart on a scale of 3712 inches to a lunar diameter his sight however began to fail three years later and he died in 1840 leaving materials from which the work was completed and published in 1878 by dr julius schmidt late director of the athens observatory much had been done in the interim beer and mdler began at berlin in 1830 their great trigonometrical survey of the lunar surface as yet neither revised nor superseded a map issued in four parts 183436 on nearly the same scale as lohrmanns but more detailed and authoritative embodied the results it was succeeded in 1837 by a descriptive volume bearing the imposing title der mond oder allgemeine vergleichende selenographie this summation of knowledge in that branch though in truth leaving many questions open had an air of finality which tended to discourage further inquiry927 it gave form to a reaction against the sanguine views entertained by hevelius schrter herschel and gruithuisen as to the possibilities of agreeable residence on the moon and relegated the selenites one of whose cities schrter thought he had discovered and of whose festal processions gruithuisen had not despaired of becoming a spectator to the shadowy land of the ivory gate all examples of change in lunar formations were moreover dismissed as illusory the light contained in the work was in short a dry light not stimulating to the imagination a mixture of a lie bacon shrewdly remarks doth ever add pleasure for many years accordingly schmidt had the field of selenography almost to himself reviving interest in the subject was at once excited and displayed by the appointment in 1864 of a lunar committee of the british association the indirect were of greater value than the direct fruits of its labours an english school of selenography rose into importance popularity was gained for the subject by the diffusion of works conspicuous for ingenuity and research nasmyths and carpenters beautifully illustrated volume 1874 was succeeded after two years by a still more weighty contribution to lunar science in mr neisons wellknown book accompanied by a map based on the survey of beer and mdler but adding some 500 measures of positions besides the representation of several thousand new objects with schmidts charte der gebirge der mondes germany once more took the lead this splendid delineation built upon lohrmanns foundation embraced the detail contained in upwards of 3000 original drawings representing the labour of thirtyfour years no less than 32856 craters are represented in it on a scale of seventyfive inches to a diameter an additional help to lunar inquiries was provided at the same time in this country by the establishment through the initiative of the late mr w r birt of the selenographical society but the strongest incentive to diligence in studying the rugged features of our celestial helpmate has been the idea of probable or actual variation in them a change always seems to the inquisitive intellect of man like a breach in the defences of natures secrets through which it may hope to make its way to the citadel what is desirable easily becomes credible and thus statements and rumours of lunar convulsions have successively during the last hundred years obtained credence and successively on closer investigation been rejected the subject is one as to which illusion is peculiarly easy our view of the moons surface is a birdseye view its conformation reveals itself indirectly through irregularities in the distribution of light and darkness the forms of its elevations and depressions can be inferred only from the shapes of the black unmitigated shadows cast by them but these shapes are in a state of perpetual and bewildering fluctuation partly through changes in the angle of illumination partly through changes in our point of view caused by what are called the moons librations928 the result is that no single observation can be exactly repeated by the same observer since identical conditions recur only after the lapse of a great number of years local peculiarities of surface besides are liable to produce perplexing effects the reflection of earthlight at a particular angle from certain bright summits completely though temporarily deceived herschel into the belief that he had witnessed in 1783 and 1787 volcanic outbursts on the dark side of the moon the persistent recurrence indeed of similar appearances under circumstances less amenable to explanation inclined webb to the view that effusions of native light actually occur929 more cogent proofs must however be adduced before a fact so intrinsically improbable can be admitted as true but from the publication of beer and mdlers work until 1866 the received opinion was that no genuine sign of activity had ever been seen or was likely to be seen on our satellite that her face was a stereotyped page a fixed and irrevisable record of the past a profound sensation accordingly was produced by schmidts announcement in october 1866 that the crater linn in the mare serenitatis had disappeared930 effaced as it was supposed by an igneous outflow the case seemed undeniable and is still dubious linn had been known to lohrmann and mdler 182232 as a deep crater five or six miles in diameter the third largest in the dusky plain known as the mare serenitatis and schmidt had observed and drawn it 184043 under a practically identical aspect now it appears under high light as a whitish spot in the centre of which as the rays begin to fall obliquely a pit scarcely two miles across emerges into view931 the crateral character of this comparatively minute depression was detected by father secchi february 11 1867 this is not all schrters description of linn as seen by him november 5 1788 tallies quite closely with modern observation932 while its inconspicuousness in 1797 is shown by its omission from russells lunar globe and maps933 we are thus driven to adopt one of two suppositions either lohrmann mdler and schmidt were entirely mistaken in the size and importance of linn or a real change in its outward semblance supervened during the first half of the century and has since passed away perhaps again to recur the latter hypothesis seems the more probable and its probability is strengthened by much evidence of actual obscuration or variation of tint in other parts of the lunar surface more especially on the floor of the great walled plain named plato934 from a reexamination with a 13inch refractor at arequipa in 189192 of this region and of the mare serenitatis mr w h pickering inclines to the belief that lunar volcanic action once apparently so potent is not yet wholly extinct935 an instance of an opposite kind of change was alleged by dr hermann j klein of cologne in march 1878936 in linn the obliteration of an old crater had been assumed in hyginus n the formation of a new crater was asserted yet quite possibly the same cause may have produced the effects thought to be apparent in both it is however far from certain that any real change has affected the neighbourhood of hyginus the novelty of kleins observation of may 19 1877 may have consisted simply in the detection of a hitherto unrecognised feature the region is one of complex formation consequently of more than ordinary liability to deceptive variations in aspect under rapid and entangled fluctuations of light and shade937 moreover it seems to be certain from messrs pratt and caprons attentive study that hyginus n is no true crater but a shallow saucerlike depression difficult of clear discernment938 under suitable illumination nevertheless it contains and is marked by an ample shadow939 in both these controverted instances of change lunar photography was invoked as a witness but notwithstanding the great advances made in the art by de la rue in this country by draper and above all by rutherford in america without decisive results investigations of the kind began to assume a new aspect in 1890 when professor holden organised them at the lick observatory940 autographic moonpictures were no longer taken casually but on system and dr weineks elaborate study and skilful reproductions of them at prague941 gave them universal value they were designed to provide materials for an atlas on the scale of beer and mdlers of which some beautiful specimenplates have been issued at paris in 1894 with the aid of a large equatoreal coud a work of similar character was set on foot by mm loewy and puiseux its progress has been marked by the successive publication of five instalments of a splendid atlas on a scale of about eight feet to the lunar diameter accompanied by theoretical dissertations designed to establish a science of selenology the moons formations are thus not only delineated under every variety of lightincidence but their meaning is sought to be elicited and their history and mutual relations interpreted942 henceforth at any rate the lunar volcanoes can scarcely without notice taken breathe hard in their agelong sleep melloni was the first to get undeniable heating effects from moonlight his experiments made on mount vesuvius early in 1846943 were repeated with like result by zantedeschi at venice four years later a rough measure of the intensity of those effects was arrived at by piazzi smyth at guajara on the peak of teneriffe in 1856 at a distance of fifteen feet from the thermomultiplier a prices candle was found to radiate just twice as much heat as the full moon944 then after thirteen years in 186972 an exact and extensive series of observations on the subject were made by the present earl of rosse the lunar radiations from the first to the last quarter displayed when concentrated with the parsonstown threefoot mirror appreciable thermal energy increasing with the phase and largely due to dark heat distinguished from the quickervibrating sort by inability to traverse a plate of glass this was supposed to indicate an actual heating of the surface during the long lunar day of 300 hours to about 500 f945 corrected later to 197946 the moon thus acting as a direct radiator no less than as a reflector of heat but the conclusion was very imperfectly borne out by dr boeddickers observations with the same instrument and apparatus during the total lunar eclipse of october 4 1884947 this initial opportunity of measuring the heat phases of an eclipsed moon was used with the remarkable result of showing that the heat disappeared almost completely though not quite simultaneously with the light confirmatory evidence of the extraordinary promptitude with which our satellite parts with heat already to some extent appropriated was afforded by professor langleys bolometric observations at allegheny of the partial eclipse of september 23 1885948 yet it is certain that the moon sends us a perceptible quantity of heat on its own account besides simply throwing back solar radiations for in february 1885 professor langley succeeded after many fruitless attempts in getting measures of a lunar heatspectrum the incredible delicacy of the operation may be judged of from the statement that the sumtotal of the thermal energy dispersed by his rocksalt prisms was insufficient to raise a thermometer fully exposed to it onethousandth of a degree centigrade the singular fact was however elicited that this almost evanescent spectrum is made up of two superposed spectra one due to reflection the other with a maximum far down in the infrared to radiation949 the corresponding temperature of the moons sunlit surface professor langley considers to be about that of freezing water950 repeated experiments having failed to get any thermal effects from the dark part of the moon it was inferred that our satellite has no internal heat sensible at the surface so that the radiations from the lunar soil giving the low maximum in the heatspectrum must be due purely to solar heat which has been absorbed and almost immediately reradiated professor langleys explorations of the terra incognita of immensely long wavelengths where lie the unseen heatemissions from the earth into space led him to the discovery that these contrary to the received opinion are in good part transmissible by our atmosphere although they are completely intercepted by glass another important result of the allegheny work was the abolition of the anomalous notion of the temperature of space fixed by pouillet at 140 c for space in itself can have no temperature and stellar radiation is a negligible quantity thus it is safe to assume that a perfect thermometer suspended in space at the distance of the earth or moon from the sun but shielded from its rays would sensibly indicate the absolute zero951 ordinarily placed at 273 c a prize essay on the distribution of the moons heat the hague 1891 by mr frank w very who had taken an active part in professor langleys longsustained inquiry embodies the fruits of its continuation they show the lunar disc to be tolerably uniform in thermal power the brighter parts are also indeed hotter but not much the traces perceived of a slight retention of heat by the substances forming the lunar surface agreed well with the parsonstown observations of the total eclipse of the moon january 28 1888952 for they brought out an unmistakable divergence between the heat and light phases a curious decrease of heat previous to the first touch of the earths shadow upon the lunar globe remains unexplained unless it be admissible to suppose the terrestrial atmosphere capable of absorbing heat at an elevation of 190 miles the probable range of temperature on the moon was discussed by professor very in 1898953 he concluded it to be very wide hotter than boiling water under the suns vertical rays the arid surface of our dependent globe must he found cool in the 14day lunar night to about the temperature of liquid air although that fundamental part of astronomy known as celestial mechanics lies outside the scope of this work and we therefore pass over in silence the immense labours of plana damoiseau hansen delaunay g w hill and airy in reconciling the observed and calculated motions of the moon there is one slight but significant discrepancy which is of such importance to the physical history of the solar system that some brief mention must be made of it halley discovered in 1693 by examining the records of ancient eclipses that the moon was going faster then than 2000 years previouslyso much faster as to have got ahead of the place in the sky she would otherwise have occupied by about two of her own diameters it was one of laplaces highest triumphs to have found an explanation of this puzzling fact he showed in 1787 that it was due to a very slow change in the ovalness of the earths orbit tending during the present age of the world to render it more nearly circular the pull of the sun upon the moon is thereby lessened the counterpull of the earth gets the upper hand and our satellite drawn nearer to us by something less than an inch each year954 proportionately quickens her pace many thousands of years hence the process will be reversed the terrestrial orbit will close in at the sides the lunar orbit will open out under the growing stress of solar gravity and our celestial chronometer will lose instead of gaining time this is all quite true as laplace put it but it is not enough adams the virtual discoverer of neptune found with surprise in 1853 that the received account of the matter was essentially incomplete and explained when the requisite correction was introduced only half the observed acceleration955 what was to be done with the remaining half here delaunay the eminent french mathematical astronomer unhappily drowned at cherbourg in 1872 by the capsizing of a pleasureboat came to the rescue956 it is obvious to anyone who considers the subject a little attentively that the tides must act to some extent as a frictionbrake upon the rotating earth in other words they must bring about an almost infinitely slow lengthening of the day for the two masses of water piled up by lunar influence on the hither and farther sides of our globe strive as it were to detach themselves from the unity of the terrestrial spheroid and to follow the movements of the moon the moon accordingly holds them against the whirling earth which revolves like a shaft in a fixed collar slowly losing motion and gaining heat eventually dissipated through space957 this must go on so far as we can see until the periods of the earths rotation and of the moons revolution coincide nay the process will be continuedshould our oceans survive so longby the feebler tideraising power of the sun ceasing only when day and night cease to alternate when one side of our planet is plunged in perpetual darkness and the other seared by unchanging light here then we have the secret of the moons turning always the same face towards the earth it is that in primeval times when the moon was liquid or plastic an earthraised tidal wave rapidly and forcibly reduced her rotation to its present exact agreement with her period of revolution this was divined by kant958 nearly a century before the necessity for such a mode of action presented itself to any other thinker in a weekly paper published at knigsberg in 1754 the modern doctrine of tidal friction was clearly outlined by him both as regards its effects actually in progress on the rotation of the earth and as regards its effects already consummated on the rotation of the moonthe whole forming a preliminary attempt at what he called a natural history of the heavens his sagacious suggestion however remained entirely unnoticed until revivedit would seem independentlyby julius robert mayer in 1848959 while similar and probably original conclusions were reached by william ferrel of allensville kentucky in 1858960 delaunay was not then the inventor or discoverer of tidal friction he merely displayed it as an effective cause of change he showed reason for believing that its action in checking the earths rotation far from being as ferrel had supposed completely neutralised by the contraction of the globe through cooling was a fact to be reckoned with in computing the movements as well as in speculating on the history of the heavenly bodies the outstanding acceleration of the moon was thus at once explained it was explained as apparent onlythe reflection of a real lengthening by one second in 100000 years of the day but on this point the last word has not yet been spoken professor newcomb undertook in 1870 the onerous task of investigating the errors of hansens lunar tables as compared with observations prior to 1750 the results published in 1878961 proved somewhat perplexing they tend in general to reduce the amount of acceleration left unaccounted for by laplaces gravitational theory and proportionately to diminish the importance of the part played by tidal friction but in order to bring about this diminution and at the same time conciliate alexandrian and arabian observations it is necessary to reject as total the ancient solar eclipses known as those of thales and larissa this may be a necessary but it must be admitted to be a hazardous expedient its upshot was to indicate a possibility that the observed and calculated values of the moons acceleration might after all prove to be identical and the small outstanding discrepancy was still further diminished by tisserands investigation differently conducted of the same arabian eclipses discussed by newcomb962 the necessity of having recourse to a lengthening day is then less pressing than it seemed some time ago and the effect if perceptible in the moons motion should m tisserand remarked be proportionately so in the motions of all the other heavenly bodies the presence of the apparent general acceleration that should ensue can be tested with most promise of success according to the same authority by delicate comparisons of past and future transits of mercury newcomb further showed that small residual irregularities are still found in the movements of our satellite inexplicable either by any known gravitational influence or by any uniform value that could be assigned to secular acceleration963 if set down to the account of imperfections in the timekeeping of the earth it could only be on the arbitrary supposition of fluctuations in its rate of going themselves needing explanation this it is true might be found in very slight changes of figure964 not altogether unlikely to occur but into this cloudy and speculative region astronomers for the present decline to penetrate they prefer if possible to deal only with calculable causes and thus to preserve for their most perfect of sciences

far the greatest in the whole solar system so herschel wrote in 1783965 and so we may safely say today after six score further years of scrutiny the circumstance lends a particular interest to inquiries into the physical habitudes of our exterior planetary neighbour fontana first caught glimpses at naples in 1636 and 1638966 of dusky stains on the ruddy disc of mars they were next seen by hooke and cassini in 1666 and this time with sufficient distinctness to serve as indexes to the planets rotation determined by the latter as taking place in a period of twentyfour hours forty minutes967 increased confidence was given to this result through maraldis precise verification of it in 1719968 among the spots observed by him he distinguished two as stable in position though variable in size they were of a peculiar character showing as bright patches round the poles and had already been noticed during sixty years back a current conjecture of their snowy nature obtained validity when herschel connected their fluctuations in extent with the progress of the martian seasons the inference of frozen precipitations could scarcely be resisted when once it was clearly perceived that the shining polar zones did actually by turns diminish and grow with the alternations of summer and winter in the corresponding hemisphere this it may be said was the opening of our acquaintance with the state of things prevailing on the surface of mars it was accompanied by a steady assertion on herschels part of permanence in the dark markings notwithstanding partial obscurations by clouds and vapours floating in a considerable but moderate atmosphere hence the presumed inhabitants of the planet were inferred to probably enjoy a situation in many respects similar to ours969 schrter on the other hand went altogether wide of the truth as regards mars he held that the surface visible to us is a mere shell of drifting cloud deriving a certain amount of apparent stability from the influence on evaporation and condensation of subjacent but unseen areographical features970 and his opinion prevailed with his contemporaries it was however rejected by kunowsky in 1822 and finally overthrown by beer and mdlers careful studies during five consecutive oppositions 183039 they identified at each the same dark spots frequently blurred with mists especially when the local winter prevailed but fundamentally unchanged971 in 1862 lockyer established a marvellous agreement with beer and mdlers results of 1830 leaving no doubt as to the complete fixity of the main features amid daily nay hourly variations of detail through transits of clouds972 on seventeen nights of the same opposition f kaiser of leyden obtained drawings in which nearly all the markings noted in 1830 at berlin reappeared besides spots frequently seen respectively by arago in 1813 by herschel in 1783 and one sketched by huygens in 1672 with a writingpen in his diary973 from these data the leyden observer arrived at a period of rotation of 24h 37m 2262s being just one second shorter than that deduced exclusively from their own observations by beer and mdler the exactness of this result was practically confirmed by the inquiries of professor bakhuyzen of leyden974 using for a middle term of comparison the disinterred observations of schrter with those of huygens at one and of schiaparelli at the other end of an interval of 220 years he was enabled to show with something like certainty that the time of rotation 24h 37m 22735s ascribed to mars by mr proctor975 in reliance on a drawing executed by hooke in 1666 was too long by nearly onetenth of a second the minuteness of the correction indicates the nicety of care employed nor employed vainly for owing to the comparative antiquity of the records available in this case an almost infinitesimal error becomes so multiplied by frequent repetition as to produce palpable discrepancies in the positions of the markings at distant dates hence bakhuyzens period of 24h 37m 2266s is undoubtedly of a precision unapproached as regards any other heavenly body save the earth itself two facts bearing on the state of things at the surface of mars were then fully acquired to science in or before the year 1862 the first was that of the seasonal fluctuations of the polar spots the second that of the general permanence of certain dark gray or greenish patches perceived with the telescope as standing out from the deep yellow ground of the disc that these varieties of tint correspond to the real diversities of a terraqueous globe the ripe cornfield976 sections representing land the dusky spots and streaks oceans and straits has long been the prevalent opinion sir j herschel in 1830 led the way in ascribing the redness of the planets light to an inherent peculiarity of soil977 previously it had been assimilated to our sunset glows rather than to our red sandstone formationsset down that is to an atmospheric stoppage of blue rays but the extensive martian atmosphere implicitly believed in on the strength of some erroneous observations by cassini and rmer in the seventeenth century vanished before the sharp occultation of a small star in leo witnessed by sir james south in 1822978 and dawess observation in 1865979 that the ruddy tinge is deepest near the central parts of the disc certified its nonatmospheric origin the absolute whiteness of the polar snowcaps was alleged in support of the same inference by sir william huggins in 1867980 all recent operations tend to show that the atmosphere of mars is much thinner than our own this was to have been expected priori since the same proportionate mass of air would on his smaller globe form a relatively sparse covering981 besides gravity there possesses less than fourtenths its force here so that this sparser covering would weigh less and be less condensed than if it enveloped the earth atmospheric pressure would accordingly be of about two and a quarter instead of fifteen terrestrial pounds per square inch this corresponds with what the telescope shows us it is extremely doubtful whether any features of the earths actual surface could be distinguished by a planetary spectator however well provided with optical assistance professor langleys inquiries982 led him to conclude that fully twice as much light is absorbed by our air as had previously been supposedsay 40 per cent of vertical rays in a clear sky of the sixty reaching the earth less than a quarter would be reflected even from white sandstone and this quarter would again pay heavy toll in escaping back to space thus not more than perhaps ten or twelve out of the original hundred sent by the sun would under the most favourable circumstances and from the very centre of the earths disc reach the eye of a martian or lunar observer the light by which he views our world is there is little doubt light reflected from the various strata of our atmosphere cloud or mistladen or serene as the case may be with an occasional snowmountain figuring as a permanent white spot this consideration at once shows us how much more tenuous the martian air must be since it admits of topographical delineations of the martian globe the clouds too that form in it seem in general to be rather of the nature of groundmists than of heavy cumulus983 occasionally indeed durable and extensive strata become visible during the latter half of october 1894 for instance a region as large as europe remained apparently cloudcovered yet most recent observers are unable to detect the traces of aqueous absorption in the martian spectrum noted by huggins in 1867984 and by vogel in 1873985 campbell vainly looked for them986 visually in 1894 spectrographically in 1896 keeler was equally unsuccessful987 jewell988 holds that they could with present appliances only be perceived if the atmosphere of mars were much richer in watervapour than that of the earth there can be little doubt however that its supply is about the minimum adequate to the needs of a living and perhaps a lifenuturing planet the climate of mars seems to be unexpectedly mild its theoretical mean temperature taking into account both distance from the sun and albedo is 34 c below freezing989 yet its polar snows are both less extensive and less permanent than those on the earth the southern white hood noticed by schiaparelli in 1877 to have survived the summer only as a small lateral patch melted completely in 1894 moreover mr w h pickering observed with astonishment the disappearance in the course of thirtythree days of june and july 1892 of 1600000 square miles of southern snow990 curiously enough the initial stage of shrinkage in the white calotte was marked by its division into two unequal parts as if in obedience to the mysterious principle of duplication governing so many martian phenomena991 changes of the hues associated respectively with land and water accompanied in lower latitudes and were thought to be occasioned by floods ensuing upon this rapid antarctic thaw it is true that scarcity of moisture would account for the scantiness and transitoriness of snowy deposits easily liquefied because thinly spread but we might expect to see the whole wintry hemisphere at any rate frostbound since the sun radiates less than half as much heat on mars as on the earth water seems nevertheless to remain as a rule uncongealed everywhere outside the polar regions we are at a loss to imagine by what beneficent arrangement the rigorous conditions naturally to be looked for can be modified into a climate which might be found tolerable by creatures constituted like ourselves martian topography may be said to form nowadays a separate subdepartment of descriptive astronomy the amount of detail become legible by close scrutiny on a little disc which once in fifteen years attains a maximum of about 15000 the area of the full moon must excite surprise and might provoke incredulity spurious discoveries however have little chance of holding their own where there are so many competitors quite as ready to dispute as to confirm the first really good map of mars was constructed in 1869 by proctor from drawings by dawes kaiser of leyden followed in 1872 with a representation founded upon data of his own providing in 186264 and terby in his valuable arographie presented to the brussels academy in 1873992 a careful discussion of all important observations from the time of fontana downwards thus virtually adding to knowledge by summarising and digesting it the memorable opposition of september 5 1877 marked a fresh epoch in the study of mars while executing a trigonometrical survey the first attempted of the disc then of the unusual size of 25 across g v schiaparelli director of the milan observatory detected a novel and curious feature what had been taken for martian continents were found to be in point of fact agglomerations of islands separated from each other by a network of socalled canals more properly channels993 these are obviously extensions of the seas originating and terminating in them and sharing their graygreen hue but running sometimes to a length of three or four thousand miles in a straight line and preserving throughout a nearly uniform breadth of about sixty miles further inquiries have fully substantiated the discovery made at the brera observatory the canals of mars are an actually existent and permanent phenomenon an examination of the drawings in his possession showed m terby that they had been seen though not distinctively recognised by dawes secchi and holden several were independently traced out by burton at the opposition of 1879 all were recovered by schiaparelli himself in 1879 and 188182 and their indefinite multiplication resulted from lovells observations in 1894 and 1896 when the planet culminated at midnight and was therefore in opposition december 26 1881 its distance was greater and its apparent diameter less than in 1877 in the proportion of sixteen to twentyfive its atmosphere was however more transparent and ours of less impediment to northern observers the object of scrutiny standing considerably higher in northern skies never before at any rate had the true aspect of mars come out so clearly as at milan with the 834inch merz refractor of the observatory between december 1881 and february 1882 the canals were all again there but this time they werein as many as twenty casesseen in duplicate that is to say a twincanal ran parallel to the original one at an interval of 200 to 400 miles994 we are here brought face to face with an apparently insoluble enigma schiaparelli regards the germination of his canals as a periodical phenomenon depending on the martian seasons it is assuredly not an illusory one since it was plainly apparent during the opposition of 1886 to mm perrotin and thollon at nice995 and to the former using the new 30inch refractor of that observatory in 1888 mr a stanley williams with the help of only a 612inch reflector distinctly perceived in 1890 seven of the duplicate objects noted at milan996 and the lick observations both of 1890 and of 1892 together with the drawings made at flagstaff and mexico during the last favourable oppositions of the nineteenth century brought unequivocal confirmation to the accuracy of schiaparellis impressions997 various conjectures have been hazarded in explanation of this bizarre appearance the difficulty of conceiving a physical reality corresponding to it has suggested recourse to an optical rationale proctor regarded it as an effect of diffraction998 stanislas meunier of oblique reflection from overlying mistbanks999 flammarion considers it possible that companioncanals might under special circumstances be evoked by refraction as a kind of mirage1000 but none of these speculations are really admissible when all the facts are taken into account the view that the canals of mars are vast rifts due to the cooling of the globe is recommended by the circumstance that they tend to follow great circles nevertheless it would break down if as schiaparelli holds the fluctuations in their visibility depend upon actual obliterations and reemergencies fantastic though the theory of their artificial origin appear it is held by serious astronomers its vogue is largely due to mr lowells ingenious advocacy he considers the martian globe to be everywhere intersected by an elaborate system of irrigationworks rendered necessary by a perennial waterfamine relieved periodically by the melting of the polar snows nor does he admit the existence of oceans or lakes what have been taken for such are really tracts covered with vegetation the bright areas intermixed with them representing sandy deserts and it is noteworthy in this connection that professor barnard obtained in 18941001 with the great lick refractor suggestive and impressive views disclosing details of light and shade on the graygreen patches so intricate and minute as almost to preclude the supposition of their aqueous nature the closeness of the terrestrial analogy has thus of late been much impaired even if the surface of mars be composed of land and water their distribution must be of a completely original type the interlacing everywhere of continents with arms of the sea if that be the correct interpretation of the visual effects implies that their levels scarcely differ1002 and schiaparelli carries most observers with him in holding that their outlines are not absolutely constant encroachments of dusky upon bright tints suggesting extensive inundations1003 the late n e greens observations at madeira in 1877 indicated on the other hand a rugged south polar region the contour of the snowcap not only appeared indented as if by valleys and promontories but brilliant points were discerned outside the white area attributed to isolated snowpeaks1004 still more elevated if similarly explained must be the ice island first seen in a comparatively low latitude by dawes in january 1865 on august 4 1892 mars stood opposite to the sun at a distance of only 34865000 miles from the earth in point of vicinity then its situation was scarcely less favourable than in 1877 the low altitude of the planet however practically neutralised this advantage for northern observers and public expectation which had been raised to the highest pitch by the announcements of sensationmongers was somewhat disappointed at the meagreness of the news authentically received from mars valuable series of observations were nevertheless made at lick and arequipa and they unite in testifying to the genuine prevalence of surfacevariability especially in certain regions of intermediate tint and perhaps of the crude consistence of boggy syrtes neither sea nor good dry land professor holden insisted on the enormous difficulties in the way of completely explaining the recorded phenomena by terrestrial analogies1005 mr w h pickering spoke of conspicuous and startling changes they however merely overlaid and partially disguised a general stability among the novelties detected by mr pickering were a number of lakes or oases in lowells phraseology under the aspect of black dots at the junctions of two or more canals1006 and he no less than the lick astronomers and m perrotin at nice1007 observed brilliant clouds projecting beyond the terminator or above the limb while carried round by the planets rotation they seemed to float at an altitude of at least twenty miles or about four times the height of terrestrial cirrus but this was not wonderful considering the low power of gravity acting upon them great capital was made in the journalistic interest out of these imaginary signals from intelligent martians desirous of opening communications with to them problematical terrestrial beings similar effects had however been seen before by mr knobel in 1873 by m terby in 1888 and at the lick observatory in 1890 and they were discerned again with particular distinctness by professor hussey at lick august 27 18961008 the first photograph of mars was taken by gould at cordoba in 1879 little real service in planetary delineation has it is true been so far rendered by the art yet one achievement must be recorded to its credit a set of photographs obtained by mr w h pickering on wilsons peak california april 9 1890 showed the southern polar cap of mars as of moderate dimensions but with a large dim adjacent area twentyfour hours later on a corresponding set the dim area was brilliantly white the polar cap had become enlarged in the interim apparently through a widespreading snowfall by the annexation of a territory equal to that of the united states the season was towards the close of winter in mars never until then had the process of glacial extension been actually it might be said superintended in that distant globe mars was gratuitously supplied with a pair of satellites long before he was found actually to possess them kepler interpreted galileos anagram of the triple saturn in this sense they were perceived by micromgas on his long voyage through space and the laputan astronomers had even arrived at a knowledge curiously accurate under the circumstances of their distances and periods but terrestrial observers could see nothing of them until the night of august 11 1877 the planet was then within one month of its second nearest approach to the earth during the last century and in 1845 the washington 26inch refractor was not in existence1009 professor asaph hall accordingly determined to turn the conjecture to account for an exhaustive inquiry into the surroundings of mars keeping his glaring disc just outside the field of view a minute attendant speck of light was glimpsed august 11 bad weather however intervened and it was not until the 16th that it was ascertained to be what it appeareda satellite on the following evening a second still nearer to the primary was discovered which by the bewildering rapidity of its passages hither and thither produced at first the effect of quite a crowd of little moons1010 both these delicate objects have since been repeatedly observed both in europe and america even with comparatively small instruments at the opposition of 1884 indeed the distance of the planet was too great to permit of the detection of both elsewhere than at washington but the lick equatoreal showed them july 18 1888 when their brightness was only 012 its amount at the time of their discovery so that they can now be followed for a considerable time before and after the least favourable oppositions the names chosen for them were taken from the iliad where deimos and phobos fear and panic are represented as the companions in battle of ares in several respects they are interesting and remarkable bodies as to size they may be said to stand midway between meteorites and satellites from careful photometric measures executed at harvard in 1877 and 1879 professor pickering concluded their diameters to be respectively six and seven miles1011 this is on the assumption that they reflect the same proportion of the light incident upon them that their primary does but it may very well be that they are less reflective in which case they would be more extensive the albedo of mars is put by mller at 027 his surface in other words returns 27 per cent of the rays striking it if we put the albedo of his satellites equal to that of our moon 017 their diameters will be increased from 6 and 7 to 712 and 9 miles phobos the inner one being the larger mr lowell however formed a considerably larger estimate of their dimensions1012 it is interesting to note that deimos according to professor pickerings very distinct perception does not share the reddish tint of mars deimos completes its nearly circular revolutions in thirty hours eighteen minutes at a distance from the surface of its ruling body of 12500 miles phobos traverses an elliptical orbit1013 in seven hours thirtynine minutes twentytwo seconds at a distance of only 3760 miles this is the only known instance of a satellite circulating faster than its primary rotates and is a circumstance of some importance as regards theories of planetary development to a martian spectator the curious effect would ensue of a celestial object seemingly exempt from the general motion of the sphere rising in the west setting in the east and culminating twice or even thrice a day which moreover in latitudes above 69 north or south would be permanently and altogether hidden by the intervening curvature of the globe the detection of new members of the solar system has come to be one of the most ordinary of astronomical events since 1846 no single year has passed without bringing its tribute of asteroidal discovery in the last of the seventies alone a full score of miniature planets were distinguished from the thronging stars amid which they seem to move 1875 brought seventeen such recognitions their number touched a minimum of one in 1881 it rose in 1882 and again in 1886 to eleven dropped to six in 1889 and sprang up with the aid of photography to twentyseven in 1892 that high level has since on an average been maintained and on january 1 1902 nearly 500 asteroids were recognised as revolving between the orbits of mars and jupiter of these considerably more than one hundred are claimed by one investigator alonedr max wolf of heidelburg m charlois of nice comes second with 102 while among the earlier observers palisa of vienna contributed 86 and c h f peters of clinton n y whose varied and useful career terminated july 19 1890 52 to the grand total the construction by chacornac and his successors at paris and more recently by peters at clinton of ecliptical charts showing all stars down to the thirteenth and fourteenth magnitudes respectively rendered the picking out of moving objects above that brightness a mere question of time and diligence both however are vastly economised by the photographic method tedious comparisons of the sky with charts are no longer needed for the identification of unrecorded because simulated stars planetary bodies declare themselves by appearing upon the plate not in circular but in linear form their motion converts their images into trails long or short according to the time of exposure the first asteroid no 323 thus detected was by max wolf december 22 18911014 eighteen others were similarly discovered in 1892 by the same skilful operator and ten more through charloiss adoption at nice of the novel plan now in exclusive use for picking up errant lightspecks far more onerous than the task of their discovery is that of keeping them in view once discoveredof tracking out their paths ixing their places and calculating the disturbing effects upon them of the mighty jovian mass these complex operations have come to be centralised at berlin under the superintendence of professor tietjen and their results are given to the public through the medium of the berliner astronomisches jahrbuch the cui bono however began to be agitated was it worth while to maintain a staff of astronomers for the sole purpose of keeping hold over the identity of the innumerable component particles of a cosmical ring the prospect indeed of all but a select few of the asteroids being thrown back by their contemptuous captors into the sea of space seemed so imminent that professor watson provided by will against the dereliction of the twentytwo discovered by himself but the fortunes of the whole family improved through the distinction obtained by one of them on august 14 1898 the trail of a rapidlymoving starlike object of the eleventh magnitude imprinted itself on a plate exposed by herr witt at the urania observatory berlin its originator proved to be unique among asteroids eros is in sober fact one of those mysterious stars which hide themselves between the earth and mars divined or imagined by shelley1015 true several of its congeners invade the martian sphere at intervals but the proper habitat of eros is within that limit although its excursions transcend it in other words its mean distance from the sun is about 135 as compared with the martian distance of 141 million miles further its orbit being so fortunately circumstanced as to bring it once in sixtyseven years within some 15 millions of miles of the earth it is of extraordinary value to celestial surveyors the calculation of its movements was much facilitated by detections through a retrospective search1016 of many of its linear images among the stardots on the harvard plates1017 the little bodywhich can scarcely be more than twenty miles in diametershows peculiarities of behaviour as well as of position dr von oppolzer in february 19011018 announced it to be extensively and rapidly variable once in 2 hours 38 minutes it lost about threefourths of its light1019 but these fluctuations quickly diminished in range and in the beginning of may ceased altogether1020 evidently then they depend upon the situation of the asteroid relatively to ourselves and so far events lent countenance to m andrs eclipse hypothesis since mutual occultations of the supposed planetary twins could only take place when the plane of their revolutions passed through the earth and this condition would be transitory yet the recognition in eros of an algol asteroid seems on other grounds inadmissible1021 nor until the phenomenon is conspicuously renewedas it probably will be at the opposition of 1903can there be much hope of finding its appropriate rationale the crowd of orbits disclosed by asteroidal detections invites attentive study darrest remarked in 18511022 when only thirteen minor planets were known that supposing their paths to be represented by solid hoops not one of the thirteen could be lifted from its place without bringing the others with it the complexity of interwoven tracks thus illustrated has grown almost in the numerical proportion of discovery yet no two actually intersect because no two lie exactly in the same plane so that the chances of collision are at present nil there is only one case indeed in which it seems to be eventually possible m lespiault has pointed out that the curves traversed by fids and maa approach so closely that a time may arrive when the bodies in question will either coalesce or unite to form a binary system1023 the maze threaded by the 500 asteroids contrasts singularly with the harmoniously ordered and rhythmically separated orbits of the larger planets yet the seeming confusion is not without a plan the established rules of our system are far from being totally disregarded by its minor members the orbit of pallas with its inclination of 34 42 touches the limit of departure from the ecliptic level the average obliquity of the asteroidal paths is somewhat less than that of the suns equator1024 their mean eccentricity is below that of the curve traced out by mercury and all without exception are pursued in the planetary directionfrom west to east the zone in which these small bodies travel is about three times as wide as the interval separating the earth from the sun it extends perilously near to jupiter and dovetails into the sphere of mars their distribution is very unequal they are most densely congregated about the place where a single planet ought by bodes law to revolve it may indeed be said that only stragglers from the main body are found more than fifty million miles within or without a mean distance from the sun 28 times that of the earth significant gaps too occur where some force prohibitive of their presence would seem to be at work the probable nature of that force was suggested by the late professor kirkwood first in 1866 when the number of known asteroids was only eightyeight and again with more confidence in 1876 from the study of a list then run up to 1721025 it appears that these bare spaces are found just where a revolving body would have a period connected by a simple relation with that of jupiter it would perform two or three circuits to his one five to his two nine to his five and so on kirkwoods inference was that the gaps in question were cleared of asteroids by the attractive influence of jupiter for disturbances recurring time after timeowing to commensurability of periodsnearly at the same part of the orbit would have accumulated until the shape of that orbit was notably changed the body thus displaced would have come in contact with other cosmical particles of the same family with itselfthen it may be assumed more evenly scattered than nowwould have coalesced with them and permanently left its original track in this way the regions of maximum perturbation would gradually have become denuded of their occupants we can scarcely doubt that this law of commensurability has largely influenced the present distribution of the asteroids but its effects must have been produced while they were still in an unformed perhaps a nebular condition in a system giving room for considerable modification through disturbance the recurrence of conjunctions with a dominating mass at the same orbital point need not involve instability1026 on the whole the correspondence of facts with kirkwoods hypothesis has not been impaired by their more copious collection1027 some chasms of secondary importance have indeed been bridged but the principal stand out more conspicuously through the denser scattering of orbits near their margins nor is it doubtful that the influence of jupiter in some way produced them m de freycinets study of the problem they present1028 has however led him to the conclusion that they existed ab origine thus testifying rather to the preventive than to the perturbing power of the giant planet the existence too of numerous asteroidal pairs travelling in approximately coincident tracks must date from a remote antiquity they result professor kirkwood1029 believed from the divellent action of jupiter upon embryo pigmy planets just as comets moving in pursuit of one another are a consequence of the sundering influence of the sun leverrier fixed in 18531030 onefourth of the earths mass as the outside limit for the combined masses of all the bodies circulating between mars and jupiter but it is far from probable that this maximum is at all nearly approached m berberich1031 held that the moon would more than outweigh the whole of them a million of the lesser bodies shining like stars of the twelfth magnitude being needed according to his judgment to constitute her mass and m niesten estimated that the whole of the 216 asteroids discovered up to august 1880 amounted in volume to only 14000th of our globe1032 and we may safely addsince they are tolerably certain to be lighter bulk for bulk than the earththat their proportionate mass is smaller still a fairly concordant result was published in 1895 by mr b m roszel1033 he found that the lunar globe probably contains forty times the terrestrial globe 3240 times the quantity of matter parcelled out among the first 311 minor planets the actual size of a few of them may now be said to be known professor pickering from determinations of lightintensity assigned to vesta a diameter of 319 miles to pallas 167 to juno 94 down to twelve and fourteen for the smaller members of the group1034 an albedo equal to that of mars was assumed as the basis of the calculation moreover professor g mller1035 of potsdam examined photometrically the phases of seven among them of which fournamely vesta iris massalia and amphitritewere found to conform precisely to the behaviour of mars as regards lightchange from position while ceres pallas and irene varied after the manner of the moon and mercury the first group were hence inferred to resemble mars in physical constitution nature of atmosphere and reflective capacity the second to be moonlike bodies finally professor barnard directly measuring with the yerkes refractor the minute discs presented by the original quartette obtained the following authentic data concerning them1036 diameter of ceres 477 miles albedo 018 diameter of pallas 304 miles albedo 023 diameter of vesta 239 miles albedo 074 diameter of juno 120 miles albedo 045 thus the rank of premier asteroid proves to belong to ceres and to have been erroneously assigned to vesta in consequence of its deceptive brilliancy what kind of surface this indicates it is hard to say the dazzling whiteness of snow can hardly be attributed to bare rock yet the dynamical theory of gasesas dr johnstone stoney pointed out in 18671037prohibits the supposition that bodies of insignificant gravitative power can possess aerial envelopes even our moon it is calculated could not permanently hold back the particles of oxygen nitrogen or watergas from escaping into infinite space still less a globe one thousand times smaller vogels suspicion of an airline in the spectrum of vesta1038 has accordingly not been confirmed crossing the zone of asteroids on our journey outward from the sun we meet with a group of bodies widely different from the inferior or terrestrial planets their gigantic size low specific gravity and rapid rotation obviously from the first threw the superior planets into a class apart and modern research has added qualities still more significant of a dissimilar physical constitution jupiter a huge globe 86000 miles in diameter stands preeminent among them he is however only primus inter pares all the wider inferences regarding his condition may be extended with little risk of error to his fellows and inferences in his case rest on surer grounds than in the case of the others from the advantages offered for telescopic scrutiny by his comparative nearness now the characteristic modern discovery concerning jupiter is that he is a body midway between the solar and terrestrial stages of cosmical existencea decaying sun or a developing earth as we choose to put itwhose vast unexpended stores of internal heat are mainly if not solely efficient in producing the interior agitations betrayed by the changing features of his visible disc this view impressed upon modern readers by mr proctors popular works was anticipated in the last century buffon wrote in his poques de la nature 17781039la surface de jupiter est comme lon sait sujette des changemens sensibles qui semblent indiquer que cette grosse plante est encore dans un tat dinconstance et de bouillonnement primitive incandescence attendant in his fantastic view on planetary origin by cometary impacts with the sun combined he concluded with vast bulk to bring about this result jupiter has not yet had time to cool kant thought similarly in 17851040 but the idea did not commend itself to the astronomers of the time and dropped out of sight until mr nasmyth arrived at it afresh in 18531041 even still however terrestrial analogies held their ground the dark belts running parallel to the equator first seen at naples in 1630 continued to be associatedas herschel had associated them in 1781with jovian tradewinds in raising which the deficient power of the sun was supposed to be compensated by added swiftness of rotation but opinion was not permitted to halt here in 1860 g p bond of cambridge us derived some remarkable indications from experiments on the light of jupiter1042 they showed that fourteen times more of the photographic rays striking it are reflected by the planet than by our moon and that unlike the moon which sends its densest rays from the margin jupiter is brightest near the centre but the most perplexing part of his results was that jupiter actually seemed to give out more light than he received bond however rightly considered his data too uncertain for the support of so bold an assumption as that of original luminosity and even if the presence of native light were proved thought that it might emanate from auroral clouds of the terrestrial kind the conception of a sunlike planet was still a remote and seemed an extravagant one only since it was adopted and enforced by zllner in 18651043 can it be regarded as permanently acquired to science the rapid changes in the cloudbelts both of jupiter and saturn he remarked attest a high internal temperature for we know that all atmospheric movements on the earth are sunheat transformed into motion but sunheat at the distance of jupiter possesses but 127 at that of saturn 1100 of its force here the large amount of energy then obviously exerted in those remote firmaments must have some other source to be found nowhere else than in their own active and allpervading fires not yet banked in with a thick solid crust the same acute investigator dwelt in 18711044 on the similarity between the modes of rotation of the great planets and of the sun applying the same principles of explanation to each case the fact of this similarity is undoubted cassini1045 and schrter both noticed that markings on jupiter travelled quicker the nearer they were to his equator and cassini even hinted at their possible assimilation to sunspots1046 it is now well ascertained that as a rule not without exceptions equatorial spots give a period some 512 minutes shorter than those in latitudes of about 30 but as mr denning has pointed out1047 no single period will satisfy the observations either of different markings at the same epoch or of the same markings at different epochs accelerations and retardations depending upon processes of growth or change take place in very much the same kind of way as in solar macul inevitably suggesting similarity of origin the interesting query as to jupiters surface incandescence has been studied since bonds time with the aid of all the appliances furnished to physical inquirers by modern inventiveness yet without bringing to it a categorical reply zllner in 1865 mller in 1893 estimated his albedo at 062 and 075 respectively that of freshfallen snow being 078 and of white paper 0701048 but the disc of jupiter is by no means purely white the general ground is tinged with ochre the polar zones are leaden or fawn coloured large spaces are at times stained or suffused with chocolatebrowns and rosy hues it is occasionally seen ruled from pole to pole with dusky bars and is never wholly free from obscure markings the reflection then by it as a whole of about 70 per cent of the rays impinging upon it might well suggest some original reinforcement nevertheless the spectroscope gives little countenance to the supposition of any considerable permanent lightemission the spectrum of jupiter as examined by huggins 186264 and by vogel 187173 shows the familiar fraunhofer rays belonging to reflected sunlight but it also shows lines of native absorption some of these are identical with those produced by the action of our own atmosphere especially one or more groups due to aqueous vapours others are of unknown origin and it is remarkable that one among the lattera strong band in the redagrees in position with a dark line in the spectra of some ruddy stars1049 there is besides a general absorption of blue rays intensifiedas le sueur observed at melbourne in 18691050in the dusky markings evidently through an increase of depth in the atmospheric strata traversed by the light proceeding from them all these observations however setting aside the stellar line as of doubtful significance point to a cool planetary atmosphere one spectrograph it is true taken by dr henry draper september 27 18791051 seemed to attest the action of intrinsic light but the peculiarity was referred by dr vogel with convincing clearness to a flaw in the film1052 so far then native emissions from any part of jupiters diversified surface have not been detected and indeed the blackness of the shadows cast by his satellites on his disc sufficiently proves that he sends out virtually none but reflected light1053 this conclusion however by no means invalidates that of his high internal temperature the curious phenomena attending jovian satellitetransits may be explained partly as effects of contrast partly as due to temporary obscurations of the small discs projected on the large disc of jupiter at their first entry upon its marginal parts which are several times less luminous than those near the centre they invariably show as bright spots then usually vanish as the background gains lustre to reappear after crossing the disc thrown into relief as before against the dusky limb but instances are not rare more especially of the third and fourth satellites standing out during the entire middle part of their course in such inky darkness as to be mistaken for their own shadows the earliest witness of a black transit was cassini september 2 1665 rmer in 1677 and maraldi in 1707 and 1713 made similar observations which have been multiplied in recent years in some cases the process of darkening has been visibly attended by the formation or emergence into view of spots on the transiting body as noted by the two bonds at harvard march 18 18481054 the third satellite was seen by dawes half dark half bright when crossing jupiters disc august 21 18671055 onethird dark by davidson of california january 15 1884 under the same circumstances1056 and unmistakably spotted both on and off the planet by schrter secchi dawes and lassell the first satellite sometimes looks dusky but never absolutely black in travelling over the disc of jupiter the second appears uniformly whitea circumstance attributed by dr spitta1057 to its high albedo the singularly different aspects even during successive transits of the third and fourth satellites are connected by professor holden1058 with the varied luminosity of the segments of the planetary surface they are projected upon and w h pickering inclines to the same opinion but fluctuations in their own brightness1059 may be a concurrent cause herschel concluded in 1797 that like our moon they always turn the same face towards their primary and as regards the outer satellite engelmanns researches in 1871 and c e burtons in 1873 made this almost certain while both for the third and fourth jovian moons it was completely assured by w h pickerings and a e douglasss observations at arequipa in 18921060 and at flagstaff in 1894951061 strangely enough however the interior members of the system have preserved a relatively swift rotation notwithstanding the enormous checking influence upon it of joveraised tides all the satellites are stated on good authority to be more or less eggshaped on september 8 1890 barnard saw the first elongated and bisected by a bright equatorial belt during one of its dark transits1062 and his observation repeated august 3 1891 was completely verified by schaeberle and campbell who ascertained moreover that the longer axis of the prolate body was directed towards jupiters centre1063 the ellipticity of its companions was determined by pickering and douglass indeed that of no 3 had long previously been noticed by secchi1064 no 3 also shows equatorial stripes perceived in 1891 by schaeberle and campbell1065 and evident later to pickering and douglass1066 nor need we hesitate to admit as authentic their records of similar though less conspicuous markings on the other satellites a constitution analogous to that of jupiter himself was thus unexpectedly suggested and vogels detection of linesor traces of linesin their spectra agreeing with absorptionrays derived from their primary lends support to the conjecture that they possess gaseous envelopes similar to his the system of jupiter as it was discovered by galileo and investigated by laplace appeared in its outward aspect so symmetrical and displayed in its inner mechanism such harmonious dynamical relations that it might well have been deemed complete nevertheless a new member has been added to it near midnight on september 9 1892 professor barnard discerned with the lick 36inch a tiny speck of light closely following the planet1067 he instantly divined its nature watched its hurried disappearance in the adjacent glare and made sure of the reality of his discovery on the ensuing night it was a delicate business throughout the liliputian luminary subsiding into invisibility before the slightest glint of jovian light and tarrying only for brief intervals far enough from the disc to admit of its exclusion by means of an occulting plate the new satellite is estimated to be of the thirteenth stellar magnitude and if equally reflective of light with its next neighbour io satellite no 1 its diameter must be about one hundred miles it revolves at a distance of 112500 miles from jupiters centre and of 68000 from his bulging equatorial surface its period of 11h 57m 23s is just two hours longer than jupiters period of rotation so that phobos still remains a unique example of a secondary body revolving faster than its primary rotates jupiters innermost moon conforms in its motions strictly indeed inevitably to the plane of his equatorial protuberance following however a sensibly elliptical path the major axis of which is in rapid revolution1068 its very insignificance raises the suspicion that it may not prove solitary possibly it belongs to a zone peopled by asteroidal satellites more than fifteen thousand such small bodies could be furnished out of the materials of a single fullsized satellite spoiled in the making but we must be content for the present to register the fact without seeking to penetrate the meaning of its existence very high and very fine telescopic power is needed for its perception outside the united states it has been very little observed the only instruments in this country successfully employed for its detection are we believe dr commons 5foot reflector and mr newalls 25inch refractor in the course of his observations on jupiter at brussels in 1878 m niesten was struck with a rosy cloud attached to a whitish zone beneath the dark southern equatorial band1069 its size was enormous at the distance of jupiter its measured dimensions of 13 by 3 implied a real extension in longitude of 30000 in latitude of something short of 7000 miles the earliest record of its appearance seems to be by professor pritchett director of the morrison observatory us who figured and described it july 9 18781070 it was again delineated august 9 by tempel at florence1071 in the following year it attracted the wonder and attention of almost every possessor of a telescope its colour had by that time deepened into a full brickred and was set off by contrast with a white equatorial spot of unusual brilliancy during three ensuing years these remarkable objects continued to offer a visible and striking illustration of the compound nature of the planets rotation the red spot completed a circuit in nine hours fiftyfive minutes thirtysix seconds the white spot in about five and a half minutes less their relative motion was thus no less than 260 miles an hour bringing them together in the same meridian at intervals of fortyfour days ten hours fortytwo minutes neither however preserved continuously the same uniform rate of travel the period of each had lengthened by some seconds in 1883 while sudden displacements associated with the recovery of lustre after recurrent fadings were observed in the position of the white spot1072 recalling the leap forward of a reviving sunspot just the opposite effect attended the rekindling of the companion object while semiextinct in 188284 it lost little motion but a fresh access of retardation was observed by professor young1073 in connection with its brightening in 1886 this suggests very strongly that the red spot is fed from below a shining aureola of facul described by bredichin at moscow and by lohse at potsdam as encircling it in september 18791074 was held to strengthen the solar analogy the conspicuous visibility of this astonishing object lasted three years when the planet returned to opposition in 188283 it had faded so considerably that riccs uncertain glimpse of it at palermo may 31 1883 was expected to be the last it had nevertheless begun to recover in december and presented to mr denning in the beginning of 1886 much the same aspect as in october 18821075 observed by him in an intermediate stage february 25 1885 when a mere skeleton of its former self it bore a striking likeness to an elliptical ring descried in the same latitude by mr gledhill in 186970 this indeed might be called the preliminary sketch for the famous object brought to perfection ten years later but which mr h c russell of sydney saw and drew still unfinished in june 18761076 before it had separated from its matrix the dusky south tropical belt in earlier times too a marking at once fixed and transient had been repeatedly perceived attached to the southernmost of the central belts it gave cassini in 1665 a rotationperiod of nine hours fiftysix minutes1077 reappeared and vanished eight times during the next fortythree years and was last seen by maraldi in 1713 it was however very much smaller than the recent object and showed no unusual colour1078 the assiduous observations made on the great red spot by mr denning at bristol and by professor hough at chicago afforded grounds only for negative conclusions as to its nature it certainly did not represent the outpourings of a jovian volcano it was in no sense attached to the jovian soilif the phrase have any application to that planet it was not a mere disclosure of a glowing mass elsewhere seethed over by rolling vapours it was indeed certainly not selfluminous a satellite projected upon it in transit having been seen to show as bright as upon the dusky equatorial bands a fundamental objection to all three hypotheses is that the rotation of the spot was variable it did not then ride at anchor but floated free some held that its surface was depressed below the average cloudlevel and that the cavity was filled with vapours professor wilson on the other hand observing with the 16inch equatorial of the goodsell observatory in minnesota received a persistent impression of the object being at a higher level than the other markings1079 a crucial experiment on this point was proposed by mr stanley williams in 18901080 a dark spot moving faster along the same parallel was timed to overtake the red spot towards the end of july a unique opportunity hence appeared to be at hand of determining the relative vertical depths of the two formations one of which must inevitably it was thought pass above the other no forecast included a third alternative which was nevertheless adopted by the dark spot it evaded the obstacle in its path by skirting round its southern edge1081 nothing then was gained by the conjunction beyond an additional proof of the singular repellent influence exerted by the red spot over the markings in its vicinity it has for example gradually carved out a deep bay for its accommodation in the gray belt just north of it the effect was not at first steadily present a premonitory excavation was drawn by schwabe at dessau september 5 1831 and again by trouvelot barnard and elvins in 1879 yet there was no sign of it in the following year its development can be traced in dr boeddickers beautiful delineations of jupiter made with the parsonstown 3foot reflector from 1881 to 18861082 they record the belt as straight in 1881 but as strongly indented from january 1883 and the cavity now promises to outlast the spot so long as it survives however the forces at work in the spot can have lost little of their activity for it must be remembered that the belt has a shorter rotationperiod than the red spot which accordingly as mr elvins of toronto has pointed out breasts and diverts by its interior energy a current of flowing matter ever ready to fill up its natural bed and override the barrier of obstruction the famous spot was described by keeler in 1889 as of a pale pink colour slightly lighter in the middle its outline was a fairly true ellipse framed in by bright white clouds1083 the fading continuously in progress from 1887 was temporarily interrupted in 1891 the revival indeed was brief professor barnard wrote in august 1892 the great red spot is still visible but it has just passed through a crisis that seemingly threatened its very existence for the past month it has been all but impossible to catch the feeblest trace of the spot though the everpersistent bay in the equatorial belt close north of it and which has been so intimately connected with the history of the red spot has been as conspicuous as ever it is now however possible to detect traces of the entire spot an obscuring medium seems to have been passing over it and has now drifted somewhat preceding the spot1084 the object is now always inconspicuous and often practically invisible and may be said to float passively in the environing medium1085 yet there are sparks beneath the ashes a rosy tinge faintly suffused it in april 19001086 and its absolute end may still be remote the extreme complexity of the planets surfacemovements has been strikingly evinced by mr stanley williamss detailed investigations he enumerated in 18961087 nine principal currents all flowing parallel to the equator but unsymmetrically placed north and south of it and showing scant signs of conformity to the solar rule of retardation with increase of latitude the linear rate of the planets equatorial rotation was spectroscopically determined by blopolsky and deslandres in 1895 both found it to fall short of the calculated speed whence an enlargement by selfrefraction of the apparent disc was inferred1088 jupiter was systematically photographed with the lick 36inch telescope during the oppositions of 1890 1891 and 1892 the image thrown on the plates after eightfold direct enlargement being one inch in diameter mr stanley williamss measurements and discussion of the set for 1891 showed the high value of the materials thus collected although much more minute details can be seen than can at present be photographed the red spot shows as very distinctly annular in several of these pictures1089 recently the planet has been portrayed by deslandres with the 62foot meudon refractor1090 the extreme actinic feebleness of the equatorial bands was strikingly apparent on his plates in 1870 mr ranyard1091whose death december 14 1894 was a serious loss to astronomyacting upon an earlier suggestion of sir william huggins collected records of unusual appearances on the disc of jupiter with a view to investigate the question of their recurrence at regular intervals he concluded that the development of the deeper tinges of colour and of the equatorial porthole markings girdling the globe in regular alternations of bright and dusky agreed so far as could be ascertained with epochs of sunspot maximum the further inquiries of dr lohse at bothkamp in 18731092 went to strengthen the coincidence which had been anticipated priori by zllner in 18711093 moreover separate and distinct evidence was alleged by mr denning in 1899 of decennial outbreaks of disturbance in north temperate regions1094 it may indeed be taken for granted that what hahn terms the universal pulse of the solar system1095 affects the vicissitudes of jupiter but the law of those vicissitudes is far from being so obviously subordinate to the rhythmical flow of central disturbance as are certain terrestrial phenomena the great planet being in fact himself a semisun may be regarded as an originator no less than a recipient of agitating influences the combined effects of which may well appear insubordinate to any obvious law it is likely that saturn is in a still earlier stage of planetary development than jupiter he is the lightest for his size of all the planets in fact he would float in water and since his density is shown by the amount of his equatorial bulging to increase centrally1096 it follows that his superficial materials must be of a specific gravity so low as to be inconsistent on any probable supposition with the solid or liquid states moreover the chief arguments in favour of the high temperature of jupiter apply with increased force to saturn so that it may be concluded without much risk of error that a large proportion of his bulky globe 73000 miles in diameter is composed of heated vapours kept in active and agitated circulation by the process of cooling his unique set of appendages has since the middle of the last century formed the subject of searching and fruitful inquiries both theoretical and telescopic the mechanical problem of the stability of saturns rings was left by laplace in a very unsatisfactory condition considering them as rotating solid bodies he pointed out that they could not maintain their position unless their weight were in some way unsymmetrically distributed but made no attempt to determine the kind or amount of irregularity needed to secure this end some observations by herschel gave astronomers an excuse for taking for granted the fulfilment of the condition thus vaguely postulated and the question remained in abeyance until once more brought prominently forward by the discovery of the dusky ring in 1850 the younger bond led the way among modern observers in denying the solidity of the structure the fluctuations in its aspect were he asserted in 18511097 inconsistent with such a hypothesis the fine dark lines of division frequently detected in both bright rings and as frequently relapsing into imperceptibility were due in his opinion to the real nobility of their particles and indicated a fluid formation professor benjamin peirce of harvard university immediately followed with a demonstration on abstract grounds of their nonsolidity1098 streams of some fluid denser than water were he maintained the physical reality giving rise to the anomalous appearance first disclosed by galileos telescope the mechanism of saturns rings proposed as the subject of the adams prize was dealt with by james clerk maxwell in 1857 his investigation forms the groundwork of all that is at present known in the matter its upshot was to show that neither solid nor fluid rings could continue to exist and that the only possible composition of the system was by an aggregated multitude of unconnected particles each revolving independently in a period corresponding to its distance from the planet1099 this idea of a satelliteformation had been remarkably enough several times entertained and lost sight of it was first put forward by roberval in the seventeenth century again by jacques cassini in 1715 and with perfect definiteness by wright of durham in 17501100 little heed however was taken of these casual anticipations of a truth which reappeared a virtual novelty as the legitimate outcome of the most refined modern methods the details of telescopic observation accord on the whole admirably with this hypothesis the displacements or disappearance of secondary dividinglinesthe singular striated appearance first remarked by short in the eighteenth century last by perrotin and lockyer at nice march 18 18841101show the effects of waves of disturbance traversing a moving mass of gravitating particles1102 the broken and changing line of the planets shadow on the ring gives evidence of variety in the planes of the orbits described by those particles the whole ringsystem too appears to be somewhat elliptical1103 the satellitetheory has derived unlookedfor support from photometric inquiries professor seeliger pointed out in 18881104 that the unvarying brilliancy of the outer rings under all angles of illumination from 0 to 30 can be explained from no other point of view nor does the constitution of the obscure inner ring offer any difficulty for it is doubtless formed of similar small bodies to those aggregated in the lucid members of the system only much more thinly strewn and reflecting consequently much less light it is not indeed at first easy to see why these sparser flights should show as a dense dark shading on the body of saturn yet this is invariably the case the objection has been urged by professor hastings of baltimore the brightest parts of these appendages he remarked1105 are more lustrous than the globe they encircle but if the inner ring consists of identical materials possessing presumably an equal reflective capacity the mere fact of their scanty distribution would not cause them to show as dark against the same globe professor seeliger however replied1106 that the darkening is due to the neverending swarms of their separate shadows transiting the planets disc sunlight is not indeed wholly excluded many rays come and go between the open ranks of the meteorites for the dusky ring is transparent the planet it encloses shows through it as if veiled with a strip of crape a beautiful illustration of its quality in this respect was derived by professor barnard from an eclipse of japetus november 1 18891107 the eighth moon remained steadily visible during its passage through the shadow of the inner ring but with a progressive loss of lustre in approaching its bright neighbour there was no breach of continuity the satellite met no gap corresponding to that between the dusky ring and the body of saturn through which it could shine with undiminished light but was slowly lost sight of as it plunged into deeper and deeper gloom the important facts were thus established that the brilliant and obscure rings merge into each other and that the latter thins out towards the saturnian globe the meteoric constitution of these appendages was beautifully demonstrated in 1895 by professor keeler1108 then director of the alleghany observatory pittsburgh from spectrographs taken with the slit adjusted to coincidence with the equatorial plane of the system he determined the comparative radial velocities of its different parts and these supply a crucial test of clerk maxwells theory for if the rings were solid the swiftest rates of rotation should be at their outer edges corresponding to wider circles described in the same period while if they are pulverulent the inverse relation must hold good this proved to be actually the case the motion slowed off outward in agreement with the diminishing speed of particles travelling freely each in its own orbit keelers result was promptly confirmed by campbell1109 as well as by deslandres and blopolsky a question of singular interest and one which we cannot refrain from putting to ourselves iswhether we see in the rings of saturn a finished structure destined to play a permanent part in the economy of the system or whether they represent merely a stage in the process of development out of the chaotic state in which it is impossible to doubt that the materials of all planets were originally merged m otto struve attempted to give a definite answer to this important query a study of early and later records of observations disclosed to him in 1851 an apparent progressive approach of the inner edge of the bright ring to the planet the rate of approach he estimated at about fiftyseven english miles a year or 11000 miles during the 194 years elapsed since the time of huygens1110 were it to continue a collapse of the system must be far advanced within three centuries but was the change real or illusorya plausible but deceptive inference from insecure data m struve resolved to put it to the test a set of elaborately careful micrometrical measures of the dimensions of saturns rings executed by himself at pulkowa in the autumn of 1851 was provided as a standard of future comparison and he was enabled to renew them under closely similar circumstances in 18821111 but the expected diminution of the space between saturns globe and his rings had not taken place a slight extension in the width of the system both outward and inward was indeed hinted at and it is worth notice that just such a separation of the rings was indicated by clerk maxwells theory so that there is an priori likelihood of its being in progress yet halls measures in 1884871112 failed to supply evidence of alteration with time and barnards executed at lick in 1894951113 showed no sensible divergence from them hence much weight cannot be laid upon huygenss drawings and descriptions which had been held to prove conclusively a partial filling up since 1657 of the interval between the ring and the planet1114 the rings of saturn replace in professor g h darwins view1115 an abortive satellite scattered by tidal action into annular form for they lie closer to the planet than is consistent with the integrity of a revolving body of reasonable bulk the limit of possible existence for such a mass was fixed by roche of montpellier in 18481116 at 244 mean radii of its primary while the outer edge of the ringsystem is distant 238 radii of saturn from his centre the virtual discovery of its pulverulent condition dates then according to professor darwin from 1848 he conjectures that the appendage will eventually disappear partly through the dispersal of its constituent particles inward and their subsidence upon the planets surface partly by their dispersal outward to a region beyond roches limit where coalescence might proceed unhindered by the strain of unequal attractions one modest satellite revolving inside mimas would then be all that was left of the singular appurtenances we now contemplate with admiration there seems reason to admit that kirkwoods law of commensurability has had some effect in bringing about the present distribution of the matter composing them here the influential bodies are saturns moons while the divisions and boundaries of the rings represent the spaces where their disturbing action conspires to eliminate revolving particles kirkwood in fact showed in 18671117 that a body circulating in the chasm between the bright rings known as cassinis division would have a period nearly commensurable with those of four out of the eight moons and meyer of geneva subsequently calculated all such combinations with the result of bringing out coincidences between regions of maximum perturbation and the limiting and dividing lines of the system1118 this is in itself a strong confirmation of the view that the rings are made up of independently revolving small bodies on december 7 1876 professor asaph hall discovered at washington a bright equatorial spot on saturn which he followed and measured through above sixty rotations each performed in ten hours fourteen minutes twentyfour seconds1119 this he was careful to add represented the period not necessarily of the planet but only of the individual spot the only previous determination of saturns axial movement setting aside some insecure estimates by schrter was herschels in 1794 giving a period of ten hours sixteen minutes the substantial accuracy of halls result was verified by mr denning in 18911120 in may and june of that year ten vague bright markings near the equator were watched by mr stanley williams who derived from them a rotation period only two seconds shorter than that determined at washington nevertheless similarly placed spots gave in 1892 and 1893 notably quicker rates1121 so that the task of timing the general drift of the saturnian surface by the displacements of such objects is hampered to an indefinite extent by their individual proper motions saturns outermost satellite japetus is markedly variableso variable that it sends us when brightest just 412 times as much light as when faintest moreover its fluctuations depend upon its orbital position in such a way as to make it a conspicuous telescopic object when west a scarcely discernible one when east of the planet herschels inference1122 of a partially obscured globe turning always the same face towards its primary seems the only admissible one and is confirmed by pickerings measurements of the varying intensity of its light he remarked further that the dusky and brilliant hemispheres must be so posited as to divide the disc viewed from saturn into nearly equal parts so that this saturnian moon even when full appears very imperfectly illuminated over onehalf of its surface1123 zllner estimated the albedo of saturn at 051 mller at 088 a value impossibly high considering that the spectrum includes no vestige of original emissions closely similar to that of jupiter it shows the distinctive dark line in the red wavelength 618 which we may call the redstar line and janssen from the summit of etna in 18671124 found traces in it of aqueous absorption the light from the ring appears to be pure reflected sunshine unmodified by original atmospheric action1125 uranus when favourably situated can easily be seen with the naked eye as a star between the fifth and sixth magnitudes there is indeed some reason to suppose that he had been detected as a wandering orb by savage watchers of the skies in the pacific long before he swam into herschels ken nevertheless inquiries into his physical habitudes are still in an early stage they are exceedingly difficult of execution even with the best and largest modern telescopes and their results remain clouded with uncertainty it will be remembered that uranus presents the unusual spectacle of a system of satellites travelling nearly at right angles to the plane of the ecliptic the existence of this anomaly gives a special interest to investigations of his axial movement which might be presumed from the analogy of the other planets to be executed in the same tilted plane yet this is far from being certainly the case mr buffham in 187072 caught traces of bright markings on the uranian disc doubtfully suggesting a rotation in about twelve hours in a plane not coincident with that in which his satellites circulate1126 dusky bands resembling those of jupiter but very faint were barely perceptible to professor young at princeton in 1883 yet though almost necessarily inferred to be equatorial they made a considerable angle with the trend of the satellites orbits1127 more distinctly by the brothers henry with the aid of their fine refractor two gray parallel rulings separated by a brilliant zone were discerned every clear night at paris from january to june 18841128 what were taken to be the polar regions appeared comparatively dusky the direction of the equatorial rulings for so we may safely call them made an angle of 40 with the satellites line of travel similar observations were made at nice by mm perrotin and thollon march to june 1884 a lucid spot near the equator in addition indicating rotation in a period of about ten hours1129 the discrepancy was however considerably reduced by perrotins study of the planet in 1889 with the new 30inch equatoreal1130 the dark bands thus viewed to better advantage than in 1884 appeared to deviate no more than 10 from the satellites orbitplane no definitive results on the other hand were derived by professors holden schaeberle and keeler from their observations of uranus in 188990 with the potent instrument on mount hamilton shadings it is true were almost always though faintly seen but they appeared under an anomalous possibly an illusory aspect they consisted not of parallel but of forked bands1131 measurements of the little seagreen disc which represents to us the massive bulk of uranus by young schiaparelli1132 safarik h c wilson1133 and perrotin prove it to be quite distinctly bulged the compression at once caught barnards trained eye in 18941134 when he undertook at lick a micrometrical investigation of the system and he was surprised to perceive that the major axis of the elliptical surface made an angle of about 28 with the line of travel pursued by the satellites nothing more can be learned on this curious subject for some years since the pole of the planet is just now turned nearly towards the earth but barnards conclusion is unlikely to be seriously modified he fixed the mean diameter of uranus at 34900 miles but this estimate was materially reduced through dr sees elimination of irradiative effects by means of daylight measures executed at washington in 19011135 the visual spectrum of this planet was first examined by father secchi in 1869 and later with more advantages for accuracy by huggins vogel1136 and keeler1137 it is a very remarkable one in lieu of the reflected fraunhofer lines imperceptible perhaps through feebleness of light six broad bands of original absorption appear one corresponding to the bluegreen ray of hydrogen f another to the redstar line of jupiter and saturn the rest as yet unidentified the hydrogen band seems much too strong and diffuse to be the mere echo of a solar line and might accordingly be held to imply the presence of free hydrogen in the uranian atmosphere this however would be difficult of reconcilement with keelers identification of an absorptiongroup in the yellow with a telluric waterband notwithstanding its high albedo062 according to zllnerproof is wanting that any of the light of uranus is inherent mr albert taylor announced indeed in 1889 his detection with commons giant reflector of bright flutings in its spectrum1138 but professor keelers examination proved them to be merely contrast effects1139 sir william and lady huggins moreover obtained about the same time a photograph purely solar in character the spectrum it represented was crossed by numerous fraunhofer lines and by no others it was then presumably composed entirely of reflected light judging from the indications of an almost evanescent spectrum neptune as regards physical condition is the twin of uranus as saturn of jupiter of the circumstances of his rotation we are as good as completely ignorant mr maxwell hall indeed noticed at jamaica in november and december 1883 certain rhythmical fluctuations of brightness suggesting revolution on an axis in slightly less than eight hours1140 but professor pickering reduces the supposed variability to an amount altogether too small for certain perception and dr g mller denies its existence in toto it is true their observations were not precisely contemporaneous with those of mr hall1141 who believes the partial obscurations recorded by himself to have been of a passing kind and to have suddenly ceased after a fortnight of prevalence their less conspicuous renewal was visible to him in november 1884 confirming a rotation period of 792 hours it was ascertained at first by indirect means that the orbit of neptunes satellite is inclined about 20 to his equator mr marth1142 having drawn attention to the rapid shifting of its plane of motion m tisserand and professor newcomb1143 independently published the conclusion that such shifting necessarily results from neptunes ellipsoidal shape the movement is of the kind exemplifiedalthough with inverted relationsin the precession of the equinoxes the pole of the satellite owing to the pull of neptunes equatorial protuberance describes a circle round the pole of his equator in a retrograde direction and in a period of over five hundred years the amount of compression indicated for the primary body is at the outside 185 whence it can be inferred that neptune possesses a lower rotatory velocity than the other giant planets direct verification of the trend theoretically inferred for the satellites movement was obtained by dr see in 1899 the washington 26inch refractor disclosed to him under exceptionally favourable conditions a set of equatorial belts on the disc of neptune and they took just the direction prescribed by theory their objective reality cannot be doubted although barnard was unable either with the lick or the yerkes telescope1144 to detect any definite markings on this planet its diameter was found by him to be 32900 miles the possibility that neptune may not be the most remote body circling round the sun has been contemplated ever since he has been known to exist within the last few years the position at a given epoch of a planet far beyond his orbital verge has been approximately fixed by two separate investigators professor george forbes of edinburgh adopted in 1880 a novel plan of search for unknown members of the solar system the first idea of which was thrown out by m flammarion in november 18791145 it depends upon the movements of comets it is well known that those of moderately short periods are for a reason already explained connected with the larger planets in such a way that the cometary aphelia fall near some planetary orbit jupiter claims a large retinue of such partial dependents neptune owns six and there are two considerable groups the farthest distances of which from the sun lie respectively near 100 and 300 times that of the earth at each of these vast intervals one involving a period of 1000 the other of 5000 years professor forbes maintains that an unseen planet circulates he even computed elements for the nearer of the two and fixed its place on the celestial sphere1146 but the photographic searches made for it by dr roberts at crowborough and by mr wilson at daramona proved unavailing undeterred by deichmllers discouraging opinion that cometary orbits extending beyond the recognised bounds of the solar system are too imperfectly known to serve as the basis of trustworthy conclusions1147 the edinburgh professor returned to the attack in 19011148 he now sought to prove that the lost comet of 1556 actually returned in 1844 but with elements so transformed by ultraneptunian perturbations as to have escaped immediate identification if so the wanted planet has just entered the sign libra and being larger than jupiter should be possible to find almost simultaneously with forbes professor todd set about groping for the same object by the help of a totally different set of indications adamss approved method commended itself to him but the hypothetical divagations of neptune having scarcely yet had time to develop he was thrown back upon the residual errors of uranus they gave him a virtually identical situation for the new planet with that derived from the clustering of cometary aphelia1149 yet its assigned distance was little more than half that of the nearer of professor forbess remote pair and it completed a revolution in 375 instead of 1000 years the agreement in them between the positions determined on separate grounds for the ultraneptunian traveller was merely an odd coincidence nor can we be certain until it is seen that we have really got into touch with

of some process of growththat during innumerable ages the forces of nature were at work upon its materials blindly modelling them into the shape appointed for them from the beginning by omnipotent wisdom to set ourselves to inquire what that process was may be an audacity but it is a legitimate nay an inevitable one for mans implanted instinct to look before and after does not apply to his own little life alone but regards the whole history of creation from the highest to the lowestfrom the microscopic germ of an alga or a fungus to the visible frame and furniture of the heavens kant considered that the inquiry into the mode of origin of the world was one of the easiest problems set by nature but it cannot be said that his own solution of it was satisfactory he however struck out in 1755 a track which thought still pursues in his allgemeine naturgeschichte the growth of sun and planets was traced from the cradle of a vast and formless mass of evenly diffused particles and the uniformity of their movements was sought to be accounted for by the unvarying action of attractive and repulsive forces under the dominion of which their development was carried forward in its modern form the nebular hypothesis made its appearance in 17961150 it was presented by laplace with diffidence as a speculation unfortified by numerical buttresses of any kind yet with visible exultation at having as he thought penetrated the birthsecret of our system he demanded indeed more in the way of postulates than kant had done he started with a sun ready made1151 and surrounded with a vast glowing atmosphere extending into space out beyond the orbit of the farthest planet and endowed with a slow rotatory motion as this atmosphere or nebula cooled it contracted and as it contracted its rotation by a wellknown mechanical law became accelerated at last a point arrived when tangential velocity at the equator increased beyond the power of gravity to control and equilibrium was restored by the separation of a nebulous ring revolving in the same period as the generating mass after a time the ring broke up into fragments all eventually reunited in a single revolving and rotating body this was the first and farthest planet meanwhile the parent nebula continued to shrink and whirl quicker and quicker passing as it did so through successive crises of instability each resulting in and terminated by the formation of a planet at a smaller distance from the centre and with a shorter period of revolution than its predecessor in these secondary bodies the same process was repeated on a reduced scale the birth of satellites ensuing upon their contraction or not according to circumstances saturns ring it was added afforded a striking confirmation of the theory of annular separation1152 and appeared to have survived in its original form in order to throw light on the genesis of the whole solar system while the four first discovered asteroids offered an example in which the dbris of a shattered ring had failed to coalesce into a single globe this scene of cosmical evolution was a characteristic bequest from the eighteenth century to the nineteenth it possessed the selfsufficing symmetry and entireness appropriate to the ideas of a time of renovation when the complexity of nature was little accounted of in comparison with the imperious orderliness of the thoughts of man since its promulgation however knowledge has transgressed many boundaries and set at naught much ingenious theorising how has it fared with laplaces sketch of the origin of the world it has at least not been discarded as effete the groundwork of speculation on the subject is still furnished by it it is nevertheless admittedly inadequate of much that exists it gives no account or an erroneous one the march of events certainly did not everywhereeven if it did anywherefollow the exact path prescribed for it yet modern science attempts to supplement but scarcely ventures to supersede it thought has in many directions been profoundly modified by mayers and joules discovery in 1842 of the equivalence between heat and motion its corollary was the grand idea of the conservation of energy now one of the cardinal principles of science this means that under the ordinary circumstances of observation the old maxim ex nihilo nihil fit applies to force as well as to matter the supplies of heat light electricity must be kept up or the stream will cease to flow the question of the maintenance of the suns heat was thus inevitably raised and with the question of maintenance that of origin is indissolubly connected dr julius robert mayer a physician residing at heilbronn was the first to apply the new light to the investigation of what sir john herschel had termed the great secret he showed that if the sun were a body either simply cooling or in a state of combustion it must long since have gone out had an equal mass of coal been set alight four or five centuries after the building of the pyramid of cheops and kept burning at such a rate as to supply solar light and heat during the interim only a few cinders would now remain in lieu of our undiminished glorious orb mayer looked round for an alternative he found it in the meteoric hypothesis of solar conservation1153 the importance in the economy of our system of the bodies known as falling stars was then in 1848 beginning to be recognised it was known that they revolved in countless swarms round the sun that the earth daily encountered millions of them and it was surmised that the cone of the zodiacal light represented their visible condensation towards the attractive centre from the zodiacal light then mayer derived the store needed for supporting the suns radiations he proved that by the stoppage of their motion through falling into the sun bodies would evolve from 4600 to 9200 times as much heat according to their ultimate velocity as would result from the burning of equal masses of coal their precipitation upon the suns surface being brought about by the resisting medium observed to affect the revolutions of enckes comet there was however a difficulty the quantity of matter needed to keep by the sacrifice of its movement the hearth of our system warm and bright would be very considerable mayers lowest estimate put it at 94000 billion kilogrammes per second or a mass equal to that of our moon biannually but so large an addition to the gravitating power of the sun would quickly become sensible in the movement of the bodies dependent upon him their revolutions would be notably accelerated mayer admitted that each year would be shorter than the previous one by a not insignificant fraction of a second and postulated an unceasing waste of substance such as newton had supposed must accompany emission of the material corpuscles of light to neutralise continual reinforcement mayers views obtained a very small share of publicity and owned mr waterston as their independent author in this country the meteoric or dynamical theory of solar sustentation was expounded by him before the british association in 1853 it was developed with his usual ability by lord kelvin in the following year the inflow of meteorites he remarked is the only one of all conceivable causes of solar heat which we know to exist from independent evidence1154 we know it to exist but we now also know it to be entirely insufficient the supplies presumed to be contained in the zodiacal light would be quickly exhausted a constant inflow from space would be needed to meet the demand but if moving bodies were drawn into the sun at anything like the required rate the air even out here at ninetythree millions of miles distance would be thick with them the earth would be redhot from their impacts1155 geological deposits would be largely meteoric1156 to say nothing of the effects on the mechanism of the heavens lord kelvin himself urged the inadmissibility of the extraplanetary theory of meteoric supply on the very tangible ground that if it were true the year would be shorter now actually by six weeks than at the opening of the christian era the intraplanetary supply however is too scanty to be anything more than a temporary makeshift the meteoric hypothesis was naturally extended from the maintenance of the suns heat to the formation of the bodies circling round him the earthno less doubtless than the other planetsis still growing cosmical matter in the shape of falling stars and arolites to the amount adopting professor newtons estimate of 100 tons daily is swept up by it as it pursues its orbital round inevitably the idea suggested itself that this process of appropriation gives the key to the lifehistory of our globe and that the momentary streak of fire in the summer sky represents a feeble survival of the glowing hailstorm by which in old times it was fashioned and warmed mr e w brayley supported this view of planetary production in 18641157 and it has recommended itself to haidinger helmholtz proctor and faye but the negative evidence of geological deposits appears fatal to it the theory of solar energy now generally regarded as the true one was enounced by helmholtz in a popular lecture in 1854 it depends upon the same principle of the equivalence of heat and motion which had suggested the meteoric hypothesis but here the movement surrendered and transformed belongs to the particles not of any foreign bodies but of the sun itself drawn together from a wide ambit by the force of their own gravity their fall towards the suns centre must have engendered a vast thermal store of which 453454 are computed to be already spent presumably however this stream of reinforcement is still flowing in the very act of parting with heat the sun develops a fresh stock his radiations in short are the direct result of shrinkage through cooling a diminution of the solar diameter by 380 feet yearly would just suffice to cover the present rate of emission and would for ages remain imperceptible with our means of observation since after the lapse of 6000 years the lessening of angular size would scarcely amount to one second1158 but the process though not terminated is strictly a terminable one in less than five million years the sun will have contracted to half its present bulk in seven million more it will be as dense as the earth it is difficult to believe that it will then be a luminous body1159 nor can an unlimited past duration be admitted helmholtz considered that radiation might have gone on with its actual intensity for twentytwo langley allows only eighteen million years the period can scarcely be stretched by the most generous allowances to double the latter figure but this is far from meeting the demands of geologists and biologists an attempt was made in 1881 to supply the sun with machinery analogous to that of a regenerative furnace enabling it to consume the same fuel over and over again and so to prolong indefinitely its beneficent existence the inordinate waste of energy which shocks our thrifty ideas was simultaneously abolished the earth stops and turns variously to account one 2250millionth part of the solar radiations each of the other planets and satellites takes a proportionate share the rest being all but an infinitesmal fraction of the whole is dissipated through endless space to serve what purpose we know not now on the late sir william siemenss plan this reckless expenditure would cease the solar incomings and outgoings would be regulated on approved economic principles and the inevitable final bankruptcy would be staved off to remote ages but there was a fatal flaw in its construction he imagined a perpetual circulation of combustible materials alternately surrendering and regaining chemical energy the round being kept going by the motive force of the suns rotation1160 this however was merely to perch the globe upon a tortoise while leaving the tortoise in the air the suns rotation contains a certain definite amount of mechanical powerenough according to lord kelvin if directly converted into heat to keep up the suns emission during 116 years and six daysa mere moment in cosmical time more economically applied it would no doubt go farther its exhaustion would nevertheless under the most favourable circumstances ensue in a comparatively short period1161 many other objections equally unanswerable have been urged to the regenerative hypothesis but this one suffices dr crolls collision hypothesis1162 is less demonstrably unsound but scarcely less unsatisfactory by the mutual impact of two dark masses rushing together with tremendous speed he sought to provide the solar nebula with an immense original stock of heat for the reinforcement of that subsequently evolved in the course of its progressive contraction the sun while still living on its capital would thus have a larger capital to live on and the timedemands of the less exacting geologists and biologists might be successfully met but the primitive event assumed for the purpose of dispensing them from the inconvenience of hurrying up their phenomena is not one that a sane judgment can readily admit to have ever in point of actual fact happened there remains then as the only intelligible rationale of solar sustentation helmholtzs shrinkage theory and this has a very important bearing upon the nebular view of planetary formation it may in fact be termed its complement for it involves the idea that the suns materials once enormously diffused gradually condensed to their present volume with development of heat and light and it may plausibly be added with the separation of dependent globes the data furnished by spectrum analysis too favour the supposition of a common origin for sun and planets by showing their community of substance while gaseous nebul present examples of vast masses of tenuous vapour such as our system may plausibly be conjectured to have primitively sprung from but recent science raises many objections to the details if it supplies some degree of confirmation to the fundamental idea of laplaces cosmogony the detection of the retrograde movement of neptunes satellite made it plain that the anomalous conditions of the uranian world were due to no extraordinary disturbance but to a systematic variety of arrangement at the outskirts of the solar domain so that were a transneptunian planet discovered we should be fully prepared to find it rotating and surrounded by satellites circulating from east to west the uniformity of movement upon the probabilities connected with which the french geometer mainly based his scheme thus at once vanishes the excessively rapid revolution of the inner martian moon is a further stumblingblock on laplaces view no satellite can revolve in a shorter time than its primary rotates for in its period of circulation survives the period of rotation of the parent mass which filled the sphere of its orbit at the time of giving it birth and rotation quickens as contraction goes on therefore the older time of axial rotation should invariably be the longer this obstacle can however as we shall presently see be turned more serious is one connected with the planetary periods pointed out by babinet in 18611163 in order to make them fit in with the hypothesis of successive separation from a rotating and contracting body certain arbitrary assumptions have to be made of fluctuations in the distribution of the matter forming that body at the various epochs of separation1164 such expedients usually merit the distrust which they inspire primitive and permanent irregularities of density in the solar nebula such as miss youngs calculations suggest1165 do not on the other hand appear intrinsically improbable again it was objected by professor kirkwood in 18691166 that there could be no sufficient cohesion in such an enormously diffused mass as the planets are supposed to have sprung from to account for the wide intervals between them the matter separated through the growing excess of centrifugal speed would have been cast off not by rarely recurring efforts but continually fragmentarily pari passu with condensation and acceleration each wisp of nebula as it found itself unduly hurried would have declared its independence and set about revolving and condensing on its own account the result would have been a meteoric not a planetary system moreover it is a question whether the relative ages of the planets do not follow an order just the reverse of that concluded by laplace professor newcomb holds the opinion that the rings which eventually constituted the planets divided from the main body of the nebula almost simultaneously priority if there were any being on the side of the inner and smaller ones1167 while in m fayes cosmogony1168 the retrograde motion of the systems formed by the two outer planets is ascribedon grounds it is true of dubious validityto their comparatively late origin this ingenious scheme was designed not merely to complete but to supersede that of laplace which undoubtedly through the inclusion by our system of oppositely directed rotations forfeits its claim simply and singly to account for the fundamental peculiarities of its structure m fayes leading contention is that under the circumstances assumed by laplace not the two outer planets alone but the whole company must have been possessed of retrograde rotation for they were formedex hypothesiafter the sun central condensation had reached an advanced stage when the rings they were derived from separated the principle of inverse squares consequently held good and keplers laws were in full operation now particles circulating in obedience to these laws can onlysince their velocity decreases outward from the centre of attractioncoalesce into a globe with a backward axial movement nor was laplace blind to this flaw in his theory but his effort to remove it though it passed muster for the best part of a century1169 was scarcely successful his planetforming rings were made to rotate all in one piece their outer parts thus necessarily travelling at a swifter linear rate than their inner parts and eventually uniting equally of necessity into a forwardspinning body the strength of cohesion involved may however safely be called impossible especially when it is considered that nebulous materials were in question the reform proposed by m faye consists in admitting that all the planets inside uranus are of presolar originthat they took globular form in the bosom of a nearly homogeneous nebula revolving in a single period with motion accelerated from centre to circumference and hence agglomerating into masses with a direct rotation uranus and neptune owe their exceptional characteristics to their later birth when they came into existence the development of the sun was already far advanced central force had acquired virtually its present strength unity of period had been abolished by its predominance and motion was retarded outward thus what we may call the relative chronology of the solar system is thrown once more into confusion the order of seniority of the planets is now no easier to determine than the who first who last among the victims of hectors spear for m fayes arrangements notwithstanding the skill with which he has presented them cannot be unreservedly accepted the objections to them thoughtfully urged by m c wolf1170 and professor darwin1171 are grave not the least so is his omission to take account of an agency of change presently to be noticed a further valuable discussion of the matter was published by m du ligonds in 18971172 his views are those of faye modified to disarm the criticisms they had encountered and special attention may be claimed for his weighty remark that each planet has a lifehistory of its own essentially distinct from those of the others and despite original unity not to be confounded with them the drift of recent investigations seems indeed to be to find the embryonic solar system already potentially complete in the parent nebula like the oak in an acorn and to relegate detailed explanations of its peculiarities to the dim prenebular foretime we now come to a most remarkable investigationone indeed unique in its profession to lead us back with mathematical certainty towards the origin of a heavenly body we refer to professor darwins inquiries into the former relations of the earth and moon1173 they deal exclusively with the effects of tidal friction and primarily with those resulting not from oceanic but from bodily tides such as the sun and moon must have raised in past ages on a liquid or viscous earth the immediate effect of either is as already explained to destroy the rotation of the body on which the tide is raised as regards the tideraising body bringing it to turn always the same face towards its disturber this we can see has been completely brought about in the case of the moon there is however a secondary or reactive effect action is always mutual precisely as much as the moon pulls the terrestrial tidal wave backward the tidal wave pulls the moon forward but pulling a body forward in its orbit implies the enlargement of that orbit in other words the moon is as a consequence of tidal friction very slowly receding from the earth this will go on other circumstances remaining unchanged until the lengthening day overtakes the more tardily lengthening month when each will be of about 1400 hours1174 a position of what we may call tidal equilibrium between earth and moon will apart from disturbance by other bodies then be attained if however it be true that in the time to come the moon will be much farther from us it follows that in the time past she was much nearer to us than she now is tracing back her history by the aid of professor darwins clue we at length find her revolving in a period of somewhere between two and four hours almost in contact with an earth rotating just at the same rate this was before tidal friction had begun its work of grinding down axial velocity and expanding orbital range but the position was not one of stable equilibrium the slightest inequality must have set on foot a series of uncompensated changes if the moon had whirled the least iota faster than the earth spun she must have been precipitated upon it her actual existence shows that the trembling balance inclined the other way by a second or two to begin with the month exceeded the day the tidal wave crept ahead of the moon tidal friction came into play and our satellite started on its long spiral journey outward from the parent globe this must have occurred it is computed at least fiftyfour million years ago that this kind of tidal reactive effect played its part in bringing the moon into its present position and is still to some slight extent at work in changing it there can be no doubt whatever an irresistible conjecture carried the explorer of its rigidly deducible consequences one step beyond them the moons time of revolution when so near the earth as barely to escape contact with it must have been by keplers law more than two and less than two and a half hours now it happens that the most rapid rate of rotation of a fluid mass of the earths average density consistent with spheroidal equilibrium is two hours and twenty minutes quicken the movement but by one second and the globe must fly asunder hence the inference that the earth actually did fly asunder through overfast spinning the ensuing disruption representing the birththroes of the moon it is likely that the event was hastened or helped by solar tidal disturbance to recapitulate analysis tracks backward the two bodies until it leaves them in very close contiguity one rotating and the other revolving in approximately the same time and that time certainly not far different from and quite possibly identical with the critical period of instability for the terrestrial spheroid is this professor darwin asks a mere coincidence or does it not rather point to the breakup of the primeval planet into two masses in consequence of a too rapid rotation1175 we are tempted but are not allowed to give an unqualified assent mr james nolan of victoria has made it clear that the moon could not have subsisted as a continuous mass under the powerful disruptive strain which would have acted upon it when revolving almost in contact with the present surface of the earth and professor darwin admitting the objection concedes to our satellite in its initial stage the alternative form of a flock of meteorites1176 but such a congregation must have been quickly dispersed by tidal action into a meteoric ring the same investigator subsequently fixed 6500 miles from centre to centre as the minimum distance at which the moon could have revolved in its entirety and he concluded it necessary to suppose that after the birth of a satellite if it takes place at all in this way a series of changes occur which are quite unknown1177 the evidence however for the efficiency of tidal friction in bringing about the actual configuration of the lunarterrestrial system is not invalidated by this failure to penetrate its natal mystery under its influence the principal elements of that system fall into interdependent mutual relations it connects casually and quantitatively the periods of the moons revolution and of the earths rotation the obliquity of the ecliptic the inclination and eccentricity of the lunar orbit all this can scarcely be accidental professor darwins first researches on this subject were communicated to the royal society december 18 1879 they were followed january 20 18811178 by an inquiry on the same principles into the earlier condition of the entire solar system the results were a warning against hasty generalisation they showed that the lunarterrestrial system far from being a pattern for their development was a singular exception among the bodies swayed by the sun its peculiarity resides in the fact that the moon is proportionately by far the most massive attendant upon any known planet its disturbing power over its primary is thus abnormally great and tidal friction has in consequence played a predominant part in bringing their mutual relations into their present state the comparatively late birth of the moon tends to ratify this inference the dimensions of the earth did not differ according to our present authority very greatly from what they now are when her solitary offspring came somehow into existence this is found not to have been the case with any other of the planets it is unlikely that the satellites of jupiter saturn or mars we may safely add of uranus or neptune ever revolved in much narrower orbits than those they now traverse it is practically certain that they did not like our moon originate very near the present surfaces of their primaries1179 what follows the tideraising power of a body grows with vicinity in a rapidly accelerated ratio lunar tides must then have been on an enormous scale when the moon swung round at a fraction of its actual distance from the earth but no other satellite with which we are acquainted occupied at any time a corresponding position hence no other satellite ever possessed tideraising capabilities in the least comparable to those of the moon we conclude once more that tidal friction had an influence here very different from its influence elsewhere quite possibly however that influence may be more nearly spent than in less advanced combinations of revolving globes mr nolan concluded in 18951180 that it still retains appreciable efficacy in the several domains of the outer planets the moons of jupiter and saturn are by his calculations in course of sensible retreat under compulsion of the perennial ripples raised by them on the surfaces of their gigantic primaries he thus connects the interior position of the fifth jovian satellite with its small mass the feebleness of its tideraising power obliged it to remain behind its companions for there is no sign of its being more juvenile than the galilean quartette the yielding of plastic bodies to the strain of unequal attractions is a phenomenon of farreaching consequence we know that the sun as well as the moon causes tides in our oceans there must then be solar no less than lunar tidal friction the question at once arises what part has it played in the development of the solar system has it ever been one of leading importance or has its influence always been as it now is subordinate almost negligible to this too professor darwin supplies an answer it can be stated without hesitation that the sun did not give birth to the planets as the earth has been supposed to have given birth to the moon by the disruption of its already condensed though viscous and glowing mass pushing them then gradually backward from its surface into their present places for the utmost possible increase in the length of the year through tidal friction is one hour and five minutes is a more probable estimate1181 so far as the pull of tidewaves raised on the sun by the planets is concerned then the distances of the latter have never been notably different from what they now are though that cause may have converted the paths traversed by them from circles into ellipses over their physical history however it was probably in a large measure influential the first vital issue for each of them wassatellites or no satellites were they to be governors as well as governed or should they revolve in sterile isolation throughout the ons of their future existence here there is strong reason to believe that solar tidal friction was the overruling power it is remarkable that planetary fecundity increasesat least so far outward as saturnwith distance from the sun can these two facts be in any way related in other words is there any conceivable way by which tidal influence could prevent or impede the throwingoff of secondary bodies we have only to think for a moment in order to see that this is precisely one of its direct results1182 tidal friction whether solar or lunar tends to reduce the axial movement of the body it acts upon but the separation of satellites dependsaccording to the received viewupon the attainment of a disruptive rate of rotation hence if solar tidal friction were strong enough to keep down the pace below this critical point the contracting mass would remain intactthere would be no satelliteproduction this in all probability actually occurred in the case both of mercury and venus they cooled without dividing because the solar frictionbrake applied to them was too strong to permit acceleration to pass the limit of equilibrium the complete destruction of their relative axial movement has been rendered probable by recent observations and that the process went on rapidly is a reasonable further inference the earth barely escaped the fate of loneliness incurred by her neighbours her first and only epoch of instability was retarded until she had nearly reached maturity the late appearance of the moon accounts for its large relative sizethrough the increased cohesion of an already strongly condensed parent massand for the distinctive peculiarities of its history and influence on the producing globe solar tidal friction although it did not hinder the formation of two minute dependents of mars has been invoked to explain the anomalously rapid revolution of one of them phobos we have seen completes more than three revolutions while mars rotates once but this was probably not always so the two periods were originally nearly equal the difference it is alleged was brought about by tidal waves raised by the sun on the semifluid spheroid of mars rotatory velocity was thereby destroyed the martian day slowly lengthened and as a secondary consequence the period of the inner satellite become shorter than the augmented day began progressively to diminish so that phobos unlike our moon was in the beginning farther from its primary than now but here again mr nolan entered a caveat applying the simple test of numerical evaluation he showed that before solar tidal friction could lengthen the rotationperiod of mars by so much as one minute phobos should have been precipitated upon its surface1183 for the enormous disparity of mass between it and the sun is so far neutralised by the enormous disparity in their respective distances from mars that solar tidal force there is only fifty times that of the little satellite but the tidal effects of a satellite circulating quicker than its primary rotates exactly reverse those of one moving like our moon comparatively slowly so that the tides raised by phobos tend to shorten both periods its orbital momentum however is so extremely small in proportion to the rotational momentum of mars that any perceptible inroad upon the latter is attended by a lavish and ruinous expenditure of the former it is as if a man owning a single fivepound note were to play for equal stakes with a man possessing a million the bankruptcy sure to ensue is typified by the coming fate of the martian inner satellite the catastrophe of its fall needs to bring it about only a very feeble reactive pull compared with the friction which the sun should apply in order to protract the martian day by one minute and from the proportionate strength of the forces at work it is quite certain that one result cannot take place without the other nor can things have been materially different in the past hence the idea must be abandoned that the primitive time of rotation of mars survives in the period of its inner satellite the anomalous shortness of the latter may however in m wolfs opinion1184 be explained by the tranes elliptiques with which roche supplemented nebular annulation1185 these are traced back to the descent of separating strata from the shoulders of the great nebulous spheroid towards its equatorial plane their rotational velocity being thus relatively small they formed inner rings very much nearer to the centre of condensation than would have been possible on the unmodified theory of laplace phobos might in this view be called a polar offset of mars and the rings of saturn are thought to own a similar origin outside the orbit of mars solar tidal friction can scarcely be said to possess at present any sensible power but it is far from certain that this was always so it seems not unlikely that its influence was the overruling one in determining the direction of planetary rotation m faye as we have seen objected to laplaces scheme that only retrograde secondary systems could be produced by it in this he was anticipated by kirkwood who however supplied an answer to his own objection1186 sunraised tides must have acted with great power on the diffused masses of the embryo planets by their means they doubtless very soon came to turn in lunar fashion the same hemisphere always towards their centre of motion this amounts to saying that even if they started with retrograde rotation it was by solar tidal friction quickly rendered direct1187 for it is scarcely necessary to point out that a planet turning an invariable face to the sun rotates in the same direction in which it revolves and in the same period as with the progress of condensation tides became feebler and rotation more rapid the accelerated spinning necessarily proceeded in the sense thus prescribed for it hence the backward axial movements of uranus and neptune may very well be a survival due to the inefficiency of solar tides at their great distance of a state of things originally prevailing universally throughout the system the general outcome of mr darwins researches has been to leave laplaces cosmogony untouched he concludes nothing against it and what perhaps tells with more weight in the long run has nothing to substitute for it in one form or the other if we speculate at all on the development of the planetary system our speculations are driven into conformity with the broad lines of the nebular hypothesisto the extent at least of admitting an original material unity and motive uniformity but we can see now better than formerly that these supply a bare and imperfect sketch of the truth we should err gravely were we to suppose it possible to reconstruct with the help of any knowledge our race is ever likely to possess the real and complete history of our admirable system the subtlety of nature bacon says transcends in many ways the subtlety of the intellect and senses of man by no mere barren formula of evolution indiscriminately applied all round the results

june 1858 giambattista donati discovered at florence a feeble round nebulosity in the constellation leo about onetenth the diameter of the full moon it proved to be a comet approaching the sun but it changed little in apparent place or brightness for some weeks the gradual development of a central condensation of light was the first symptom of coming splendour at harvard in the middle of july a strong stellar nucleus was seen on august 14 a tail began to be thrown out as the comet wanted still over six weeks of the time of its perihelionpassage it was obvious that great things might be expected of it they did not fail of realisation not before the early days of september was it generally recognised with the naked eye though it had been detected without a glass at pulkowa august 19 but its growth was thenceforward surprisingly rapid as it swept with accelerated motion under the hindmost foot of the great bear and past the starry locks of berenice a sudden leap upward in lustre was noticed on september 12 when the nucleus shone with about the brightness of the polestar and the tail notwithstanding large foreshortening could be traced with the lowest telescopic power over six degrees of the sphere the appendage however attained its full development only after perihelion september 30 by which time too it lay nearly square to the line of sight from the earth on october 10 it stretched in a magnificent scimitarlike curve over a third and upwards of the visible hemisphere representing a real extension in space of fiftyfour million miles but the most striking view was presented on october 5 when the brilliant star arcturus became involved in the brightest part of the tail and during many hours contributed its lustre undiminished by the interposed nebulous screen to heighten the grandeur of the most majestic celestial object of which living memories retain the impress donatis comet was according to admiral smyths testimony1188 outdone as a mere sightobject by the great comet of 1811 but what it lacked in splendour it surely made up in grace and variety of what we may call scenic effects some of these were no less interesting to the student than impressive to the spectator at pulkowa on the 16th september winnecke1189 the first director of the strasburg observatory observed a faint outer envelope resembling a veil of almost evanescent texture flung somewhat widely over the head next evening the first of the secondary tails appeared possibly as part of the same phenomenon this was a narrow straight ray forming a tangent to the strong curve of the primary tail and reaching to a still greater distance from the nucleus it continued faintly visible for about three weeks during part of which time it was seen in duplicate for from the chief train itself at a point where its curvature abruptly changed issued as if through the rejection of some of its materials a second beam nearly parallel to the first the rigid line of which contrasted singularly with the softly diffused and waving aspect of the plume of light from which it sprang olberss theory of unequal repulsive forces was never more beautifully illustrated the triple tail seemed a visible solar analysis of cometary matter the processes of luminous emanation going on in this body forcibly recalled the observations made on the comets of 1744 and 1835 from the middle of september the nucleus estimated by bond to be under five hundred miles in diameter was the centre of action of the most energetic kind seven distinct envelopes were detached in succession from the nebulosity surrounding the head and after rising towards the sun during periods of from four to seven days finally cast their material backward to form the right and left branches of the great train the separation of these by an obscure axisapparently as black quite close up to the nucleus as the skyindicated for the tail a hollow conelike structure1190 while the repetition of certain spots and rays in the same corresponding situation on one envelope after another served to show that the nucleusto some local peculiarity of which they were doubtless duehad no proper rotation but merely shifted sufficiently on an axis to preserve the same aspect towards the sun as it moved round it1191 this observation of bonds was strongly confirmatory of bessels hypothesis of opposite polarities in such bodies opposite sides the protrusion towards the sun on september 25 of a brilliant luminous fanshaped sector completed the resemblance to halleys comet the appearance of the head was now somewhat that of a batswing gaslight there were however no oscillations to and fro such as bessel had seen and speculated upon in 1835 as the size of the nucleus contracted with approach to perihelion its intensity augmented on october 2 it outshone arcturus and for a week or ten days was a conspicuous object half an hour after sunset its lustresetting aside the light derived from the tailwas at that date 6300 times what it had been on june 15 though theoreticallytaking into account that is only the differences of distance from sun and earthit should have been only 133 of that amount here it might be thought was convincing evidence of the comet itself becoming ignited under the growing intensity of the solar radiations yet experiments with the polariscope were interpreted in an adverse sense and bonds conclusion that the comet sent us virtually unmixed reflected sunshine was generally acquiesced in it was nevertheless negatived by the first application of the spectroscope to these bodies very few comets have been so well or so long observed as donatis it was visible to the naked eye during 112 days it was telescopically discernible for 275 the last observation having been made by mr william mann at the cape of good hope march 4 1859 its course through the heavens combined singularly with the orbital place of the earth to favour curious inspection the tail when near its greatest development lost next to nothing by the effects of perspective and at the same time lay in a plane sufficiently inclined to the line of sight to enable it to display its exquisite curves to the greatest advantage even the weather was on both sides of the atlantic propitious during the period of greatest interest and the moon as little troublesome as possible the volume compiled by the younger bond is a monument to the care and skill with which these advantages were turned to account yet this stately apparition marked no turningpoint in the history of cometary science by its study knowledge was indeed materially advanced but along the old lines no quick and vivid illumination broke upon its path quite insignificant objectsas we have already partly seenhave often proved more vitally instructive donatis comet has been identified with no other its path is an immensely elongated ellipse lying in a plane far apart from that of the planetary movements carrying it at perihelion considerably within the orbit of venus and at aphelion out into space to 512 times the distance from the sun of neptune the entire circuit occupies over 2000 years and is performed in a retrograde direction or against the order of the signs before its next return about the year 4000 ad the enigma of its presence and its purpose may have been to some extentthough we may be sure not completelypenetrated on june 30 1861 the earth passed for the second time in the century through the tail of a great comet some of our readers may remember the unexpected disclosure on the withdrawal of the sun below the horizon on that evening of an object so remarkable as to challenge universal attention a goldenyellow planetary disc wrapt in dense nebulosity shone out while the june twilight of these latitudes was still in its first strength the number and complexity of the envelopes surrounding the head produced according to the late mr webb1192 a magnificent effect portions of six distinct emanations were traceable it was as though a number of light hazy clouds were floating round a miniature full moon as the sky darkened the tail emerged to view1193 although in brightness and sharpness of definition it could not compete with the display of 1858 its dimensions proved to be extraordinary it reached upwards beyond the zenith when the head had already set by some authorities its extreme length was stated at 118 and it showed no trace of curvature most remarkable however was the appearance of two widely divergent rays each pointing towards the head though cut off from it by skyillumination of which one was seen by mr webb and both by mr williams at liverpool a quarter of an hour before midnight there seems no doubt that webbs interpretation was the true one and that these beams were in fact the perspective representation of a conical or cylindrical tail hanging closely above our heads and probably just being lifted up out of our atmosphere1194 the cometary train was then rapidly receding from the earth so that the sides of the outspread fan of light shown by it when we were right in the line of its axis must have appeared as they did to close up in departure the swiftness with which the visually opened fan shut proved its vicinity and indeed mr hinds calculations showed that we were not so much near as actually within its folds at that very time already m liais from his observations at rio de janeiro june 11 to 14 and mr tebbutt by whom the comet was discovered in new south wales on may 13 had anticipated such an encounter while the former subsequently proved that it must have occurred in such a way as to cause an immersion of the earth in cometary matter to a depth of 300000 miles1195 the comet then lay between the earth and the sun at a distance of about fourteen million miles from the former its tail stretched outward just along the line of intersection of its own with the terrestrial orbit to an extent of fifteen million miles so that our globe happening to pass at the time found itself during some hours involved in the flimsy appendage no perceptible effects were produced by the meeting it was known to have occurred by theory alone a peculiar glare in the sky thought by some to have distinguished the evening of june 30 was at best inconspicuous nor were there any symptoms of unusual electric excitement the greenwich instruments were indeed disturbed on the following night but it would be rash to infer that the comet had art or part in their agitation the perihelionpassage of this body occurred june 11 1861 and its orbit has been shown by m kreutz of bonn from a very complete investigation founded on observations extending over nearly a year to be an ellipse traversed in a period of 409 years1196 towards the end of august 1862 a comet became visible to the naked eye high up in the northern hemisphere with a nucleus equalling in brightness the lesser stars of the plough and a feeble tail 20 in length it thus occupied quite a secondary position among the members of its class it was nevertheless a splendid object in comparison with a telescopic nebulosity discovered by tempel at marseilles december 19 1865 this the sole comet of 1866 slipped past perihelion january 11 without pomp of train or other appendages and might have seemed hardly worth the trouble of pursuing fortunately this was not the view entertained by observers and computers since upon the knowledge acquired of the movements of these two bodies has been founded one of the most significant discoveries of modern times the first of them is now styled the comet 1862 iii of the august meteors the second 1866 i that of the november meteors the steps by which this curious connection came to be ascertained were many and were taken in succession by a number of individuals but the final result was reached by schiaparelli of milan and remains deservedly associated with his name the idea prevalent in the eighteenth century as to the nature of shooting stars was that they were mere aerial ignes fatuiinflammable vapours accidentally kindled in our atmosphere but halley had already entertained the opinion of their cosmical origin and chladni in 1794 formally broached the theory that space is filled with minute circulating atoms which drawn by the earths attraction and ignited by friction in its gaseous envelope produce the luminous effects so frequently witnessed1197 acting on his suggestion brandes and benzenberg two students at the university of gttingen began in 1798 to determine the heights of falling stars by simultaneous observations at a distance they soon found that they move with planetary velocities in the most elevated regions of our atmosphere and by the ascertainment of this fact laid a foundation of distinct knowledge regarding them some of the data collected however served only to perplex opinion and even caused chladni temporarily to renounce his many high authorities headed by laplace in 1802 declared for the lunarvolcanic origin of meteorites but thought on the subject was turbid and inquiry seemed only to stir up the mud of ignorance it needed one of those amazing spectacles at which man assists no longer in abject terror for his own frail fortunes but with keen curiosity and the vivid expectation of new knowledge to bring about a clarification on the night of november 1213 1833 a tempest of falling stars broke over the earth north america bore the brunt of its pelting from the gulf of mexico to halifax until daylight with some difficulty put an end to the display the sky was scored in every direction with shining tracks and illuminated with majestic fireballs at boston the frequency of meteors was estimated to be about half that of flakes of snow in an average snowstorm their numbers while the first fury of their coming lasted were quite beyond counting but as it waned a reckoning was attempted from which it was computed on the basis of that much diminished rate that 240000 must have been visible during the nine hours they continued to fall1198 now there was one very remarkable feature common to the innumerable small bodies which traversed or were consumed in our atmosphere that night they all seemed to come from the same part of the sky traced backward their paths were invariably found to converge to a point in the constellation leo moreover that point travelled with the stars in their nightly round in other words it was entirely independent of the earth and its rotation it was a point in interplanetary space the effective perception of this fact1199 amounted to a discovery as olmsted and twining who had simultaneous ideas on the subject were the first to realize denison olmsted was then professor of mathematics in yale college he showed early in 18341200 that the emanation of the showering meteors from a fixed radiant proved their approach to the earth along nearly parallel lines appearing to diverge by an effect of perspective and that those parallel lines must be sections of orbits described by them round the sun and intersecting that of the earth for the november phenomenon was now seen to be a periodical one on the same night of the year 1832 although with less dazzling and universal splendour than in america in 1833 it had been witnessed over great part of europe and in arabia olmsted accordingly assigned to the cloud of cosmical particles or comet as he chose to call it by terrestrial encounters with which he supposed the appearances in question to be produced a period of about 182 days its path a narrow ellipse meeting near its farthest end from the sun the place occupied by the earth on november 12 once for all then as the result of the starfall of 1833 the study of luminous meteors became an integral part of astronomy their membership of the solar system was no longer a theory or a conjectureit was an established fact the discovery might be compared to if it did not transcend in importance that of the asteroidal group cest un nouveau monde plantaire arago wrote1201 qui commence se rvler nous evidences of periodicity continued to accumulate it was remembered that humboldt and bonpland had been the spectators at cumana after midnight on november 12 1799 of a fiery shower little inferior to that of 1833 and reported to have been visible from the equator to greenland moreover in 1834 and some subsequent years there were waning repetitions of the display as if through the gradual thinningout of the meteoric supply the extreme irregularity of its distribution was noted by olbers in 1837 who conjectured that we might have to wait until 1867 to see the phenomenon renewed on its former scale of magnificence1202 this was the first hint of a thirtythree or thirtyfour year period the falling stars of november did not alone attract the attention of the learned similar appearances were traditionally associated with august 10 by the popular phrase in which they figured as the tears of st lawrence but the association could not be taken on trust from medival authority it had to be proved scientifically and this quetelet of brussels succeeded in doing in december 18361203 a second meteoric revolving system was thus shown to exist but its establishment was at once perceived to be fatal to the cosmical cloud hypothesis of olmsted for if it be a violation of probability to attribute to one such agglomeration a period of an exact year or submultiple of a year it would be plainly absurd to suppose the movements of two or more regulated by such highly artificial conditions an alternative was proposed by adolf erman of berlin in 18391204 no longer in clouds but in closed rings he supposed meteoric matter to revolve round the sun thus the mere circumstance of intersection by a meteoric of the terrestrial orbit without any coincidence of period would account for the earth meeting some members of the system at each annual passage through the node or point of intersection this was an important step in advance yet it decided nothing as to the forms of the orbits of such annular assemblages nor was it followed up in any direction for a quarter of a century hubert a newton took up in 18641205 the dropped thread of inquiry the son of a mathematical mother he attained at the age of twentyfive to the dignity of professor of mathematics in yale university and occupied the post until his death in 1896 the diversion of his powers however from purely abstract studies stimulated their effective exercise and constituted him one of the founders of meteoric astronomy a search through old records carried the november phenomenon back to the year 902 ad long distinguished as the year of the stars for in the same night in which taormina was captured by the saracens and the cruel aghlabite tyrant ibrahim ibn ahmed died by the judgment of god before cosenza stars fell from heaven in such abundance as to amaze and terrify beholders far and near this was on october 13 and recurrences were traced down through the subsequent centuries always with a days delay in about seventy years it was easy too to derive from the dates a cycle of 3314 years so that professor newton did not hesitate to predict the exhibition of an unusually striking meteoric spectacle on november 1314 18661206 for the astronomical explanation of the phenomena recourse was had to a method introduced by erman of computing meteoric orbits it was found however that conspicuous recurrences every thirtythree or thirtyfour years could be explained on the supposition of five widely different periods combined with varying degrees of extension in the revolving group professor newton himself gave the preference to the shortestof 35412 days but indicated the means of deciding with certainty upon the true one it was furnished by the advancing motion of the node or that days delay of the november shower every seventy years which the old chronicles had supplied data for detecting for this is a strictly measurable effect of gravitational disturbance by the various planets the amount of which naturally depends upon the course pursued by the disturbed bodies here the great mathematical resources of professor adams were brought to bear by laborious processes of calculation he ascertained that four out of newtons five possible periods were entirely incompatible with the observed nodal displacement while for the fifththat of 3314 yearsa perfectly harmonious result was obtained1207 this was the last link in the chain of evidence proving that the november meteorsor leonids as they had by that time come to be calledrevolve round the sun in a period of 3327 years in an ellipse spanning the vast gulf between the orbits of the earth and uranus the group being so extended as to occupy nearly three years in defiling past the scene of terrestrial encounters but before it was completed in march 1867 the subject had assumed a new aspect and importance professor newtons prediction of a remarkable starshower in november 1866 was punctually fulfilled this time europe served as the main target of the celestial projectiles and observers were numerous and forewarned the display although according to mr baxendells memory1208 inferior to that of 1833 was of extraordinary impressiveness dense crowds of meteors equal in lustre to the brightest stars and some rivalling venus at her best1209 darted from east to west across the sky with enormous apparent velocities and with a certain determinateness of aim as if let fly with a purpose and at some definite object1210 nearly all left behind them trains of emerald green or clear blue light which occasionally lasted many minutes before they shrivelled and curled up out of sight the maximum rush occurred a little after one oclock on the morning of november 14 when attempts to count were overpowered by frequency but during a previous interval of seven minutes five seconds four observers at mr bishops observatory at twickenham reckoned 514 and during an hour 11201211 before daylight the earth had fairly cut her way through the starbearing stratum the ethereal rockets had ceased to fly this event brought the subject of shooting stars once more vividly to the notice of astronomers schiaparelli had indeed been already attracted by it the results of his studies were made known in four remarkable letters addressed before the close of the year 1866 to father secchi and published in the bulletino of the roman observatory1212 their upshot was to show in the first place that meteors possess a real velocity considerably greater than that of the earth and travel accordingly to enormously greater distances from the sun along tracks resembling those of comets in being very eccentric in lying at all levels indifferently and in being pursued in either direction it was next inferred that comets and meteors equally have an origin foreign to the solar system but are drawn into it temporarily by the suns attraction and occasionally fixed in it by the backward pull of some planet but the crowning fact was reserved for the last it was the astonishing one that the august meteors move in the same orbit with the bright comet of 1862that the comet in fact is but a larger member of the family named perseids because their radiant point is situated in the constellation perseus this discovery was quickly capped by others of the same kind leverrier published january 21 18671213 elements for the november swarm founded on the most recent and authentic observations at once identified by dr c f w peters of altona with oppolzers elements for tempels comet of 18661214 a few days later schiaparelli having recalculated the orbit of the meteors from improved data arrived at the same conclusion while professor weiss of vienna pointed to the agreement between the orbits of a comet which had appeared in 1861 and of a starshower found to recur on april 20 lyrads as well as between those of bielas comet and certain conspicuous meteors of november 281215 these instances do not seem to be exceptional the number of known or suspected accordances of cometary tracks with meteor streams contained in a list drawn up in 18781216 by professor alexander s herschel who has made the subject peculiarly his own amounts to seventysix although the four first detected still remain the most conspicuous and perhaps the only absolutely sure examples of a relation as significant as it was to most astronomers unexpected there had indeed been anticipatory ideas not that keplers comparison of shooting stars to minute comets or maskelynes forse risulter che essi sono comete in a letter to the abate cesaris december 12 17741217 need count for much but chladni in 18191218 considered both to be fragments or particles of the same primitive matter irregularly scattered through space as nebul and morstadt of prague suggested about 18371219 that the meteors of november might be dispersed atoms from the tail of bielas comet the path of which is cut across by the earth near that epoch professor kirkwood however by a luminous intuition penetrated the whole secret so far as it has yet been made known in an article published or rather buried in the danville quarterly review for december 1861 he argued from the observed division of biela and other less noted instances of the same kind that the sun exercises a divellent influence on the nuclei of comets which may be presumed to continue its action until their corporate existence so to speak ends in complete pulverisation may not he continued our periodic meteors be the dbris of ancient but now disintegrated comets whose matter has become distributed round their orbits1220 the gist of schiaparellis discovery could not be more clearly conveyed for it must be borne in mind that with the ultimate destiny of comets tails this had nothing to do the tenuous matter composing them is no doubt permanently lost to the body from which it emanated but science does not pretend to track its further wanderings through space it can however state categorically that these will no longer be conducted along the paths forsaken under solar compulsion from the central and probably solid parts of comets on the other hand are derived the granules by the swift passage of which our skies are seamed with periodic fires it is certain that a loosely agglomerated mass such as cometary nuclei most likely are must gradually separate through the unequal action of gravity on its various partsthrough in short solar tidal influence thenceforward its fragments will revolve independently in parallel orbits at first as a swarm finallywhen time has been given for the full effects of the lagging of the slower moving particles to developas a closed ring the first condition is still more or less that of the november meteors those of august have already arrived at the second for this reason leverrier pronounced in 1867 the perseid to be of older formation than the leonid system he even assigned a date at which the introduction of the lastnamed bodies into their present orbit was probably effected through the influence of uranus in 126 ad a close approach must have taken place between the planet and the parent comet of the november stars after which its regular returns to perihelion and the consequent process of its disintegration set in though not complete it is already far advanced the view that meteorites are the dust of decaying comets was now to be put to a definite test of prediction bielas comet had not been seen since its duplicate return in 1852 yet it had been carefully watched for with the best telescopes its path was accurately known every perturbation it could suffer was scrupulously taken into account under these circumstances its repeated failure to come up to time might fairly be thought to imply a cessation from visible existence might it not however be possible that it would appear under another formthat a starshower might have sprung from and would commemorate its dissolution an unusually large number of falling stars were seen by brandes december 6 1798 similar displays were noticed in the years 1830 1838 and 1847 and the point from which they emanated was shown by heis at aixlachapelle to be situated near the bright star gamma andromed1221 now this is precisely the direction in which the orbit of bielas comet would seem to lie as it runs down to cut the terrestrial track very near the place of the earth at the above dates the inference was then an easy one that the meteors were pursuing the same path with the comet and it was separately arrived at early in 1867 by weiss darrest and galle1222 but biela travels in the opposite direction to tempels comet and its attendant leonids its motion is direct or from west to east while theirs is retrograde consequently the motion of its node is in the opposite direction too in other words the meetingplace of its orbit with that of the earth retreats and very rapidly along the ecliptic instead of advancing so that if the andromedes stood in the supposed intimate relation to bielas comet they might be expected to anticipate the times of their recurrence by as much as a week in half a century all doubt as to the fact may be said to have been removed by signor zeziolis observation of the annual shower in more than usual abundance at bergamo november 30 1867 the missing comet was next due at perihelion in the year 1872 and the probability was contemplated by both weiss and galle of its being replaced by a copious discharge of falling stars the precise date of the occurrence was not easily determinable but galle thought the chances in favour of november 28 the event anticipated the prediction by twentyfour hours scarcely had the sun set in western europe on november 27 when it became evident that bielas comet was shedding over us the pulverised products of its disintegration the meteors came in volleys from the foot of the chained lady their numbers at times baffling the attempt to keep a reckoning at moncalieri about 8 pm they constituted as father denza said1223 a real rain of fire four observers counted on an average four hundred each minute and a half and not a few fireballs equalling the moon in diameter traversed the sky on the whole however the stars of 1872 though about equally numerous were less brilliant than those of 1866 the phosphorescent tracks marking their passage were comparatively evanescent and their movements sluggish this is easily understood when we remember that the andromedes overtake the earth while the leonids rush to meet it the velocity of encounter for the first class of bodies being under twelve for the second above fortyfour miles a second the spectacle was nevertheless magnificent it presented itself successively to various parts of the earth from bombay and the mauritius to new brunswick and venezuela and was most diligently and extensively observed here it had wellnigh terminated by midnight1224 it was attended by a slight aurora and although tacchini had telegraphed that the state of the sun rendered some show of polar lights probable it has too often figured as an accompaniment of starshowers to permit the coincidence to rank as fortuitous admiral wrangel was accustomed to describe how during the prevalence of an aurora on the siberian coast the passage of a meteor never failed to extend the luminosity to parts of the sky previously dark1225 and an enhancement of electrical disturbance may well be associated with the flittings of such cosmical atoms a singular incident connected with the meteors of 1872 has now to be recounted the late professor klinkerfues who had observed them very completely at gttingen was led to believe that not merely the dbris strewn along its path but the comet itself must have been in immediate proximity to the earth during their appearance1226 if so it might be possible he thought to descry it as it retreated in the diametrically opposite direction from that in which it had approached on november 30 accordingly he telegraphed to mr pogson the madras astronomer biela touched earth november 27 search near theta centaurithe antiradiant as it is called being situated close to that star bad weather prohibited observation during thirtysix hours but when the rain clouds broke on the morning of december 2 there a comet was just in the indicated position in appearance it might have passed well enough for one of the biela twins it had no tail but a decided nucleus and was about 45 seconds across being thus altogether below the range of nakedeye discernment it was again observed december 3 when a short tail was perceptible but overcast skies supervened and it has never since been seen its identity accordingly remains in doubt it seems tolerably certain however that it was not the lost comet which ought to have passed that spot twelve weeks earlier and was subject to no conceivable disturbance capable of delaying to that extent its revolution on the other hand there is the strongest likelihood that it belonged to the same system1227that it was a third fragment torn from the parentbody of the andromedes at a period anterior to our first observations of it in thirteen years bielas comet or its relics travels nearly twice round its orbit so that a renewal of the meteoric shower of 1872 was looked for on the same day of the year 1885 the probability being emphasised by an admonitory circular from dunecht astronomers were accordingly on the alert and were not disappointed in england observation was partially impeded by clouds but at malta palermo beyrout and other southern stations the scene was most striking the meteors were both larger and more numerous than in 1872 their numbers in the densest part of the drift were estimated by professor newton at 75000 per hour visible from one spot to so large a group of spectators that practically none could be missed yet each of these multitudinous little bodies was found by him to travel in a clear cubical space of which the edge measured twenty miles1228 thus the dazzling effect of a luminous throng was produced without jostling or overcrowding by particles it might almost be said isolated in the void their aspect was strongly characteristic of the andromede family of meteors they invariably mr denning wrote1229 traversed short paths with very slow motions and became extinct in evolved streams of yellowish sparks the conclusion seemed obvious that these meteors are formed of very soft materials which expand while incalescent and are immediately crumbled and dissipated into exiguous dust the biela meteors of 1885 did not merely gratify astronomers with a fulfilled prediction but were the means of communicating to them some valuable information although their main body was cut through by the moving earth in six hours and was not more than 100000 miles across skirmishers were thrown out to nearly a million miles on either side of the compact central battalions members of the system were on the 26th of november recorded by mr denning at the hourly rate of about 130 and they did not wholly cease to be visible until december 1 they afforded besides a particularly wellmarked example of that diffuseness of radiation previously observed in some less conspicuous displays their paths seemed to diverge from an area rather than from a point in the sky they came so ill to focus that divergences of several degrees were found between the most authentically determined radiants these incongruities are attributed by professor newton to the irregular shape of the meteoroids producing unsymmetrical resistance from the air and hence causing them to glance from their original direction on entering it thus their luminous tracks did not always represent even apart from the effects of the earths attraction the true prolongation of their course through space the andromedes of 1872 were laggards behind the comet from which they sprang those of 1885 were its avantcouriers that wasted and disrupted body was not due at the node until january 26 1886 sixty days that is after the earths encounter with its meteoric fragments these are now probably scattered over more than five hundred million miles of its orbits1230 yet professor newton considers that all must have formed one compact group with biela at the time of its close approach to jupiter about the middle of 1841 for otherwise both comet and meteorites could not have experienced as they seem to have done the same kind and amount of disturbance the rapidity of cometary disintegration is thus curiously illustrated a shortlived persuasion that the missing heavenly body itself had been recovered was created by mr edwin holmss discovery at london november 6 1892 of a tolerably bright tailless comet just in a spot which bielas comet must have traversed in approaching the intersection of its orbit with that of the earth a hasty calculation by berberich assigned elements to the newcomer seeming not only to ratify the identity but to promise a quasiencounter with the earth on november 21 the only effect of the prediction however was to raise a panic among the negroes of the southern states of america the comet quietly ignored it and moved away from instead of towards the appointed meetingplace its projection then on the night of its discovery upon a point of the bielaorbit was by a mere caprice of chance north america nevertheless was visited on november 23 by a genuine andromede shower although the meteors were less numerous than in 1885 professor young estimated that 30000 at the least of their orange firestreaks came during five hours within the range of view at princeton1231 brdikhine estimated the width of the space containing them at about 2700000 miles1232 the anticipation of their due time by four days impliedif they were a prolongation of the main biela group the nucleus of which passed the spot of encounter five months previouslya recession of the node since 1885 by no less than three degrees unless indeed mr denning were right in supposing the display to have proceeded from an associated branch of the main swarm through which we passed in 1872 and 18851233 the existence of separated detachments of biela meteors due to disturbing planetary action was contemplated as highly probable by schiaparelli1234 such may have been the belated flights met with in 1830 1838 1841 and 1847 and such the advance flight plunged through in 1892 a shower looked for november 23 1899 did not fall and no further display from this quarter is probable until november 17 1905 although one is possible a year earlier1235 the leonids through the adverse influence of jupiter and saturn inflicted upon multitudes of eager watchers a still more poignant disappointment a dense part of the swarm having nearly completed a revolution since 1866 should travelling normally have met the earth november 15 1899 in point of fact it swerved sunward and the millions of meteorites which would otherwise have been sacrificed for the illumination of our skies escaped a fiery doom the contingency had been forecast in the able calculations of dr johnstone stoney and dr a m w downing1236 superintendent of the nautical almanac office but the verification scarcely compensated the failure nor was the situation retrieved in the following years only ragged fringes of the great tempestcloud here and there touched our globe as the same investigators warned us to expect the course of the meteorites had been not only rendered sinuous by perturbation but also broken and irregular we can no longer count upon the leonids their glory for scenic purposes is departed the comet associated with them also evaded observation although it doubtless kept its tryst with the sun in the spring of 1899 the attendant circumstances were too unfavourable to allow it to be seen from the earth1237 by an almost fantastic coincidence nevertheless a faint comet was photographed november 14 18981238 by dr chase of the yale college observatory close to the leonid radiant whither a meteorograph was directed with a view to recording trails left by precursors of the main leonid body a promising start too was made on the same occasion with meteoric researches from sensitive plates1239 indeed schaeberle and colton1240 had already in 1896 determined the height of a leonid by means of photographs taken at stations on different ridges of mount hamilton and professor pickering has prosecuted similar work at harvard with encouraging results everything in this branch of science depends upon how far they can be carried without the meteorograph rigid accuracy in the observation of shooting stars is unattainable and rigid accuracy is the sine qu non for obtaining exact knowledge biela does not offer the only example of cometary disruption setting aside the unauthentic reports of early chroniclers we meet the double comet discovered by liais at olinda brazil february 27 1860 of which the division appeared recent and about to be carried farther1241 but a division once established separation must continually progress the periodic times of the fragments will never be identical one must drop a little behind the other at each revolution until at length they come to travel in remote parts of nearly the same orbit thus the comet predicted by klinkerfues and discovered by pogson had already lagged to the extent of twelve weeks and we shall meet instances farther on where the retardation is counted not by weeks but by years here original identity emerges only from calculation and comparison of orbits comets then die as kepler wrote long ago sicut bombyces filo fundendo this certainty anticipated by kirkwood in 1861 we have at least acquired from the discovery of their generative connection with meteors nay their actual materials become in smaller or larger proportions incorporated with our globe it is not indeed universally admitted that the ponderous masses of which according to daubres estimate1242 at least 600 fall annually from space upon the earth ever formed part of the bodies known to us as comets some follow tschermak in attributing to aerolites a totally different origin from that of periodical shootingstars that no clear line of demarcation can be drawn is no valid reason for asserting that no real distinction exists and it is certainly remarkable that a meteoric fusillade may be kept up for hours without a single solid projectile reaching its destination it would seem as if the celestial army had been supplied with blank cartridges yet since a few detonating meteors have been found to proceed from ascertained radiants of shootingstars it is difficult to suppose that any generic difference separates them their assimilation is further urgedthough not with any demonstrative forceby two instances the only two on record of the tangible descent of an aerolite during the progress of a starshower on april 4 1095 the saxon chronicle informs us that stars fell so thickly that no man could count them and adds that one of them having struck the ground in france a bystander cast water upon it which was raised in steam with a great noise of boiling1243 and again on november 27 1885 while the skirts of the andromedetempest were trailing over mexico a ball of fire was precipitated from the sky at mazapil within view of a ranchman1244 scientific examination proved it to be a siderite or mass of nickeliron its weight exceeded eight pounds and it contained many nodules of graphite we are not however authorised by the circumstances of its arrival to regard the mazapil fragment of cosmic metal as a specimen torn from bielas comet in this as in the preceding case the coincidence of the fall with the shower may have been purely casual since no hint is given of any sort of agreement between the tracks followed by the sample provided for curious study and the swarming meteors consumed in the upper air professor newtons inquiries into the tracks pursued by meteorites previous to their collisions with the earth tend to distinguish them at least specifically from shootingstars he found that nearly all had been travelling with a direct movement in orbits the perihelia of which lay in the outer half of the space separating the earth from the sun1245 shootingstars on the contrary are entirely exempt from such limitations the yale professor concluded that the larger meteorites moving in our solar system are allied much more closely with the group of comets of short period than with the comets whose orbits are nearly parabolic they would thus seem to be more at home than might have been expected amid the planetary family father carbonelle has moreover shown1246 that meteorites if explosionproducts of the earth or moon should with rare exceptions follow just the kind of paths assigned to them from data of observation by professor newton yet it is altogether improbable that projectiles from terrestrial volcanoes should at any geological epoch have received impulses powerful enough to enable them not only to surmount the earths gravity but to penetrate its atmosphere a strikingindeed an almost startlingpeculiarity on the other hand divides from their congeners a class of meteors identified by mr denning during ten years patient watching of such phenomena at bristol1247 these are described as meteors with stationary radiants since for months together they seem to come from the same fixed points in the sky now this implies quite a portentous velocity the direction of meteorradiants is affected by a kind of aberration analogous to the aberration of light it results from a composition of terrestrial with meteoric motion hence unless that of the earth in its orbit be by comparison insignificant the visual line of encounter must shift if not perceptibly from day to day at any rate conspicuously from month to month the fixity then of many systems observed by mr denning seems to demand the admission that their members travel so fast as to throw the earths movement completely out of the account the required velocity would be by mr ranyards calculation at least 880 miles a second1248 but the aspect of the meteors justifies no such extravagant assumption their seeming swiftness is very various andwhat is highly significantit is notably less when they pursue than when they meet the earth yet the incredible and unaccountable1249 fact of the existence of these long radiants although doubted by tisserand1250 because of its theoretical refractoriness must apparently be admitted the first plausible explanation of them was offered by professor turner in 18991251 they represent in his view the cumulative effects of the earths attraction the validity of his reasoning is however denied by m brdikhine1252 who prefers to regard them as a congeries of separate streams the enigma they present has evidently not yet received its definitive solution the perseids afford on the contrary a remarkable instance of a shifting radiant mr dennings observations of these yellowish leisurely meteors extend over nearly six weeks from july 8 to august 16 the point of radiation meantime progressing no less than 57 in right ascension doubts as to their common origin were hence freely expressed especially by mr monck of dublin1253 but the late dr kleiber1254 showed by strict geometrical reasoning that the fortynine radiants successively determined for the shower were all in fact comprised within one narrowly limited region of space in other words the application of the proper correction for the terrestrial movement and the effects of attraction by which each individual shootingstar is compelled to describe a hyperbola round the earths centre reduces the extended line of radiants to a compact group with the cometary radiant for its central point the cometary radiant being the spot in the sky met by a tangent to the orbit of the perseid comet of 1862 at its intersection with the orbit of the earth the reality of the connection between the comet and the meteors could scarcely be more clearly proved while the vast dimensions of the stream into which the latter are found to be diffused cannot but excite astonishment not unmixed with perplexity the first successful application of the spectroscope to comets was by donati in 18641255 a comet discovered by tempel july 4 brightened until it appeared like a star somewhat below the second magnitude with a feeble tail 30 in length it was remarkable as having on august 7 almost totally eclipsed a small stara very rare occurrence1256 on august 5 donati admitted its light through his train of prisms and found it thus analysed to consist of three bright bandsyellow green and blueseparated by wider dark intervals this implied a good deal comets had previously been considered as we have seen to shine mainly if not wholly by reflected sunlight they were now perceived to be selfluminous and to be formed to a large extent of glowing gas the next step was to determine what kind of gas it was that was thus glowing in them and this was taken by sir william huggins in 18681257 a comet of subordinate brilliancy known as comet 1868 ii or sometimes as winneckes was the subject of his experiment on comparing its spectrum with that of an olefiantgas vacuum tube rendered luminous by electricity he found the agreement exact it has since been abundantly confirmed all the eighteen comets tested by light analysis between 1868 and 1880 showed the typical hydrocarbon spectrum1258 common to the whole group of those compounds but probably due immediately to the presence of acetylene some minor deviations from the laboratory pattern in the shifting of the maxima of light from the edge towards the middle of the yellow and blue bands have been experimentally reproduced by vogel and hasselberg in tubes containing a mixture of carbonic oxide with olefiant gas1259 their illumination by disruptive electric discharges was however a condition sine qu non for the exhibition of the cometary type of spectrum when a continuous current was employed the carbonic oxide bands asserted themselves to the exclusion of the hydrocarbons the distinction has great significance as regards the nature of comets of particular interest in this connection is the circumstance that carbonic oxide is one of the gases evolved by meteoric stones and irons under stress of heat1260 for it must apparently have formed part of an aeriform mass in which they were immersed at an earlier stage of their history plate ii illustration great comet photographed may 5 1901 with the thirteeninch astrographic refractor of the royal observatory cape of good hope in a few exceptional comets the usual carbonbands have been missed two such were observed by sir william huggins in 1866 and 1867 respectively1261 in each a green ray approximating in position to the fundamental nebular line crossed an otherwise unbroken spectrum and holmess comet of 1892 displayed only a faint prismatic band devoid of any characteristic feature1262 now these three might well be set down as partially effete bodies but a brilliant comet visible in southern latitudes in april and may 1901 so far resembled them in the quality of its light as to give a spectrum mainly if not purely continuous this accordingly is no symptom of decay the earliest comet of firstclass lustre to present itself for spectroscopic examination was that discovered by coggia at marseilles april 17 1874 invisible to the naked eye till june it blazed out in july a splendid ornament of our northern skies with a just perceptibly curved tail reaching more than half way from the horizon to the zenith and a nucleus surpassing in brilliancy the brightest stars in the swan brdikhine vogel and huggins1263 were unanimous in pronouncing its spectrum to be that of marsh or olefiant gas father secchi in the clear sky of rome was able to push the identification even closer than had heretofore been done the complete hydrocarbon spectrum consists of five zones of variously coloured light three of these onlythe three central oneshad till then been obtained from comets owing it was supposed to their temperature not being high enough to develop the others the light of coggias comet however was found to contain all five traces of the violet band emerging june 4 of the red july 21264 presumably all five would show universally in cometary spectra were the dispersed rays strong enough to enable them to be seen the gaseous surroundings of comets are then largely made up of a compound of hydrogen with carbon other materials are also present but the hydrocarbon element is probably unfailing and predominant its luminosity is there is little doubt an effect of electrical excitement zllner showed in 18721265 that owing to evaporation and other changes produced by rapid approach to the sun electrical processes of considerable intensity must take place in comets and that their original light is immediately connected with these and depends upon solar radiation rather through its direct or indirect electrifying effects than through its more obvious thermal power may be considered a truth permanently acquired to science1266 they are not it thus seems bodies incandescent through heat but glowing by electricity and this is compatible under certain circumstances with a relatively low temperature the gaseous spectrum of comets is accompanied in varying degrees by a continuous spectrum this is usually derived most strongly from the nucleus but extends more or less to the nebulous appendages in part it is certainly due to reflected sunlight in part most likely to the ignition of minute solid particles footnotes footnote 1188 month not vol xix p 27 footnote 1189 mm de lac imp t ii 1859 p 46 footnote 1190 harvard annals vol iii p 368 footnote 1191 ibid p 371 footnote 1192 month not vol xxii

chapter xi recent comets continued the mystery of comets tails had been to some extent penetrated so far at least that by making certain assumptions strongly recommended by the facts of the case their forms can be with very approximate precision calculated beforehand we have then the assurance that these extraordinary appendages are composed of no ethereal or supersensual stuff but of matter such as we know it and subject to the ordinary laws of motion though in a state of extreme tenuity olbers as already stated originated in 1812 the view that the tails of comets are made up of particles subject to a force of electrical repulsion proceeding from the sun it was developed and enforced by bessels discussion of the appearances presented by halleys comet in 1835 he moreover provided a formula for computing the movement of a particle under the influence of a repulsive force of any given intensity and thus laid firmly the foundation of a mathematical theory of cometary emanations professor w a norton of yale college considerably improved this by inquiries begun in 1844 and resumed on the apparition of donatis comet and dr c f pape at altona1267 gave numerical values for the impulses outward from the sun which must have actuated the materials respectively of the curved and straight tails adorning the same beautiful and surprising object the physical theory of repulsion however was it might be said still in the air nor did it even begin to assume consistency until zllner took it in hand in 18711268 it is perfectly well ascertained that the energy of the push or pull produced by electricity depends other things being the same upon the surface of the body acted on that of gravity upon its mass the efficacy of solar electrical repulsion relatively to solar gravitational attraction grows consequently as the size of the particle diminishes make this small enough and it will virtually cease to gravitate and will unconditionally obey the impulse to recession this principle zllner was the first to realise in its application to comets it gives the key to their constitution admitting that the sun and they are similarly electrified their more substantially aggregated parts will still follow the solicitations of his gravity while the finely divided particles escaping from them will simply by reason of their minuteness fall under the sway of his repellent electric power they will in other words form tails nor is any extravagant assumption called for as to the intensity of the electrical charge concerned in producing these effects zllner in fact showed1269 that it need not be higher than that attributed by the best authorities to the terrestrial surface forty years have elapsed since m brdikhine director successively of the moscow and of the pulkowa observatories turned his attention to these curious phenomena his persistent inquiries on the subject however date from the appearance of coggias comet in 1874 on computing the value of the repulsive force exerted in the formation of its tail and comparing it with values of the same force arrived at by him in 1862 for some other conspicuous comets it struck him that the numbers representing them fell into three welldefined classes i suspect he wrote in 1877 that comets are divisible into groups for each of which the repulsive force is perhaps the same1270 this idea was confirmed on fuller investigation in 1882 the appendages of thirtysix wellobserved comets had been reconstructed theoretically without a single exception being met with to the rule of the three types a further study of forty comets led in 1885 only to a modification of the numerical results previously arrived at in the first of these the repellent energy of the sun is fourteen times stronger than his attractive energy1271 the particles forming the enormously long straight rays projected outward from this kind of comet leave the nucleus with a mean velocity of just seven kilometres per second which becoming constantly accelerated carries them in a few days to the limit of visibility the great comets of 1811 1843 and 1861 that of 1744 so far as its principal tail was concerned and halleys comet at its various apparitions belonged to this class less narrow limits were assigned to the values of the repulsive force employed to produce the second type for the axis of the tail it exceeds by onetenth 11 the power of solar gravity for the anterior edge it is more than twice 22 for the posterior only half as strong the corresponding initial velocity for the axis is 1500 metres a second and the resulting appendage a scimitarlike or plumy tail such as donatis and coggias comets furnished splendid examples of tails of the third type are constructed with forces of repulsion from the sun ranging from onetenth to threetenths that of his gravity producing an accelerated movement of attenuated matter from the nucleus beginning at the leisurely rate of 300 to 600 metres a second they are short strongly bent brushlike emanations and in bright comets seem to be only found in combination with tails of the higher classes multiple tails indeedthat is tails of different types emitted simultaneously by one cometare perceived as experience advances and observation becomes closer to be rather the rule than the exception1272 now what is the meaning of these three types is any translation of them into physical fact possible to this question brdikhine supplied in 1879 a plausible answer1273 it was already a current surmise that multiple tails are composed of different kinds of matter differently acted on by the sun both olbers and bessel had suggested this explanation of the straight and curved emanations from the comet of 1807 norton had applied it to the faint light tracks proceeding from that of donati1274 winnecke to the varying deviations of its more brilliant plumage brdikhine defined and ratified the conjecture he undertook to determine provisionally as yet the several kinds of matter appropriated severally to the three classes of tails these he found to be hydrogen for the first hydrocarbons for the second and iron for the third the ground of this apportionment is that the atomic weights of these substances bear to each other the same inverse proportion as the repulsive forces employed in producing the appendages they are supposed to form and zllner had pointed out in 1875 that the heliofugal power by which comets tails are developed would in fact be effective just in that ratio1275 hydrogen as the lightest known elementthat is the least under the influence of gravitywas naturally selected as that which yielded most readily to the counterpersuasions of electricity hydrocarbons had been shown by the spectroscope to be present in comets and were fitted by their specific weight as compared with that of hydrogen to form tails of the second type while the atoms of iron were just heavy enough to compose those of the third and from the plentifulness of their presence in meteorites might be presumed to enter in no inconsiderable proportion into the mass of comets these three substances however were by no means supposed to be the sole constituents of the appendages in question on the contrary the great breadth of what for the present were taken to be characteristically iron tails was attributed to the presence of many kinds of matter of high and slightly different specific weights1276 while the expanded plume of donati was shown to be in reality a whole system of tails made up of many substances each spreading into a separate hollow cone more or less deviating from and partially superposed upon the others yet these felicities of explanation must not make us forget that the chemical composition attributed to the first type of cometary trains has so far received no countenance from the spectroscope the emission lines of free incandescent hydrogen have never been derived from any part of these bodies dissentient opinions accordingly were expressed as to the cause of their structural peculiarities ranyard1277 zenker and others advocated the agency of heat repulsion in producing them kiaer somewhat obscurely explains them through the evolution of gases by colliding particles1278 herz of vienna concludes tails to be mere illusory appendages produced by electrical discharges through the rare medium assumed to fill space1279 but hirn1280 conclusively showed that no such medium could possibly exist without promptly bringing ruin upon our ddal earth and its revolving companions on the whole modern researches tend to render superfluous the chemical diversities postulated by brdikhine electricity alone seems competent to produce the varieties of cometary emanation they were designed to account for the distinction of types rests on a solid basis of fact but probably depends upon differences rather in the mode of action than in the kind of substance acted upon suggestive sketches of electrical and lightpressure theories of comets have been published respectively by mr fessenden of alleghany1281 and by m arrhenius at stockholm1282 although evidently of a tentative character they possess great interest brdikhines hypothesis was promptly and profusely illustrated within three years of its promulgation five bright comets made their appearance each presenting some distinctive peculiarity by which knowledge of these curious objects was materially helped forward the first of these is remembered as the great southern comet it was never visible in these latitudes but made a short though stately progress through southern skies its earliest detection was at cordoba on the last evening of january 1880 and it was seen on february 1 as a luminous streak extending just after sunset from the southwest horizon towards the pole in new south wales at monte video and the cape of good hope the head was lost in the solar rays until february 4 when dr gould then director of the national observatory of the argentine republic at cordoba caught a glimpse of it very low in the west and on the following evening mr eddie at grahams town discovered a faint nucleus of a strawcoloured tinge about the size of the annular nebula in lyra its condensation however was very imperfect and the whole apparition showed an exceedingly filmy texture the tail was enormously long on february 5 it extendedlarge perspective retrenchment notwithstandingover an arc of 50 but its brightness nowhere exceeded that of the milky way in taurus there was little curvature perceptible the edges of the appendage ran parallel forming a nebulous causeway from star to star and the comparison to an auroral beam was appropriately used the aspect of the famous comet of 1843 was forcibly recalled to the memory of mr janisch governor of st helena and the resemblance proved not merely superficial but the comet of 1880 was less brilliant and even more evanescent after only eight days of visibility it had faded so much as no longer to strike though still discoverable by the unaided eye and on february 20 it was invisible with the great cordoba equatoreal pointed to its known place but the most astonishing circumstance connected with this body is the identity of its path with that of its predecessor in 1843 this is undeniable dr gould1283 mr hind and dr copeland1284 each computed a separate set of elements from the first rough observations and each was struck with an agreement between the two orbits so close as to render them virtually indistinguishable can it be possible mr hind wrote to sir george airy that there is such a comet in the system almost grazing the suns surface in perihelion and revolving in less than thirtyseven years i confess i feel a difficulty in admitting it notwithstanding the above extraordinary resemblance of orbits1285 mr hinds difficulty was shared by other astronomers it would indeed be a violation of commonsense to suppose that a celestial visitant so striking in appearance had been for centuries back an unnoticed frequenter of our skies various expedients accordingly were resorted to for getting rid of the anomaly the most promising at first sight was that of the resisting medium it was hard to believe that a body largely vaporous shooting past the sun at a distance of less than a hundred thousand miles from his surface should have escaped powerful retardation it must have passed through the very midst of the corona it might easily have had an actual encounter with a prominence escape from such proximity might indeed very well have been judged beforehand to be impossible even admitting no other kind of opposition than that dubiously supposed to have affected enckes comet the result in shortening the period ought to be of the most marked kind it was proved by oppolzer1286 that if the comet of 1843 had entered our system from stellar space with parabolic velocity it would by the action of a medium such as encke postulated varying in density inversely as the square of the distance from the sun have been brought down by its first perihelion passage to elliptic movement in a period of twentyfour years with such rapid diminution that its next return would be in about ten but such restricted observations as were available on either occasion of its visibility gave no sign of such a rapid progress towards engulfment another form of the theory was advocated by klinkerfues1287 he supposed that four returns of the same body had been witnessed within historical memorythe first in 371 bc the next in 1668 besides those of 1843 and 1880 an original period of 2039 years being successively reduced by the withdrawal at each perihelion passage of 11320 of the velocity acquired by falling from the far extremity of its orbit towards the sun to 175 and 37 years a continuance of the process would bring the comet of 1880 back in 1897 unfortunately the earliest of these apparitions cannot be identified with the recent ones unless by doing violence to the plain meaning of aristotles words in describing it he states that the comet was first seen during the frosts and in the clear skies of winter setting due west nearly at the same time as the sun1288 this implies some considerable north latitude but the objects lately observed had practically no north latitude they accomplished their entire course above the ecliptic in two hours and a quarter during which space they were barely separated a handsbreadth one might say from the suns surface for the purposes of the desired assimilation aristotles comet should have appeared in march it is not credible however that even a native of thrace should have termed march winter with the comet of 1668 the case seemed more dubious the circumstances of its appearance are barely reconcilable with the identity attributed to it although too vaguely known to render certainty one way or the other attainable it might however be expected that recent observations would at least decide the questions whether the comet of 1843 could have returned in less than thirtyseven and whether the comet of 1880 was to be looked for at the end of 1712 years but the truth is that both these objects were observed over so small an arc8 and 3 respectivelythat their periods remained virtually undetermined for while the shape and position of their orbits could be and were fixed with a very close approach to accuracy the length of those orbits might vary enormously without any very sensible difference being produced in the small part of the curves traced out near the sun dr wilhelm meyer however arrived by an elaborate discussion at a period of thirtyseven years for the comet of 18801289 while the observations of 1843 were admittedly best fitted by hubbards ellipse of 533 years but these dr meyer supposed to be affected by some constant source of error such as would be produced by a mistaken estimate of the position of the comets centre of gravity he inferred finally that in spite of previous nonappearances the two comets represented a single regular denizen of our system returning once in thirtyseven years along an orbit of such extreme eccentricity that its movement might be described as one of precipitation towards and rapid escape from the sun rather than of sedate circulation round it the geometrical test of identity has hitherto been the only one which it was possible to apply to comets and in the case before us it may fairly be said to have broken down we may then tentatively and with much hesitation try a physical test though scarcely yet properly speaking available we have seen that the comets of 1843 and 1880 were strikingly alike in general appearance though the absence of a formed nucleus in the latter and its inferior brilliancy detracted from the convincing effect of the resemblance nor was it maintained when tried by exact methods of inquiry m brdikhine found that the gigantic ray emitted in 1843 belonged to his type no 1 that of 1880 to type no 21290 the particles forming the one were actuated by a repulsive force ten times as powerful as those forming the other it is true that a second noticeably curved tail was seen in chili march 1 and at madras march 11 1843 and the conjecture was accordingly hazarded that the materials composing on that occasion the principal appendage having become exhausted those of the secondary one remained predominant and reappeared alone in the hydrocarbon train of 1880 but the one known instance in point is against such a supposition halleys comet the only great comet of which the returns have been securely authenticated and carefully observed has preserved its type unchanged through many successive revolutions the dilemma presented to astronomers by the great southern comet of 1880 was unexpectedly renewed in the following year on the 22nd of may 1881 mr john tebbutt of windsor new south wales scanning the western sky discerned a hazylooking object which he felt sure was a strange one a marine telescope at once resolved it into two small stars and a comet the latter of which quickly attracted the keen attention of astronomers for dr gould computing its orbit from his first observations at cordoba found it to agree so closely with that arrived at by bessel for the comet of 1807 that he telegraphed to europe june 1 announcing the unexpected return of that body so unexpected that theoretically it was not possible before the year 3346 and bessels investigation was one which inspired and eminently deserved confidence here then once more the perplexing choice had to be made between a premature and unaccountable reappearance and the admission of a plurality of comets moving nearly in the same path but in this case facts proved decisive tebbutts comet passed the sun june 16 at a distance of sixtyeight millions of miles and became visible in europe six days later it was in the opinion of some the finest object of the kind since 1861 in traversing the constellation auriga on its dbut in these latitudes it outshone capella on june 24 and some subsequent nights it was unmatched in brilliancy by any star in the heavens in the telescope the two interlacing arcs of light which had adorned the head of coggias comet were reproduced while a curious dorsal spine of strong illumination formed the axis of the tail which extended in clear skies over an arc of 20 it belonged to the same type as donatis great plume the particles composing it being driven from the sun by a force twice as powerful as that urging them towards it1291 but the appendage was for a few nights and by two observers perceived to be double tempel on june 27 and lewis boss at albany ny june 26 and 28 saw a long straight ray corresponding to a far higher rate of emission than the curved train and shown by brdikhine to be a member of the socalled hydrogen class it had vanished by july 1 but made a temporary reappearance july 221292 the appendages of this comet were of remarkable transparency small stars shone wholly undimmed across the tail and a very nearly central transit of the head over one of the seventh magnitude on the night of june 29 producedif any changean increase of brilliancy in the object of this spontaneous experiment1293 dr meyer indeed at the geneva observatory detected apparent signs of refractive action upon rays thus transmitted1294 but his observations remain isolated and were presumably illusory the track pursued by this comet gave peculiar advantages for its observation ascending from auriga through camelopardus it stood july 19 on a line between the pointers and the pole within 8 of the latter and thus remained for a lengthened period constantly above the horizon of northern observers its brightness too was no transient blaze but had a lasting quality which enabled it to be kept steadily in view during nearly nine months visible to the naked eye until the end of august the last telescopic observation of it was made february 14 1882 when its distance from the earth considerably exceeded 300 million miles under these circumstances the knowledge acquired of its orbit was of more than usual accuracy and showed conclusively that the comet was not a simple return of bessels for this would involve a period of seventyfour years whereas tebbutts comet cannot revisit the sun until after the lapse of two and a half millenniums1295 nevertheless the twin bodies move so nearly in the same path that an original connection of some kind is obvious and the recent example of biela readily suggested a conjecture as to what the nature of that connection might have been the comets of 1807 and 1881 are then regarded with much probability as fragments of a primitive disrupted body one following in the wake of the other at an interval of seventyfour years imperfect photographs were taken of donatis comet both in england and america1296 but tebbutts comet was the first to which the process was satisfactorily applied the difficulties to be overcome were very great the chemical intensity of cometary light is to begin with extraordinarily small janssen estimated it at 1300000 of moonlight1297 hence if the ordinary process by which lunar photographs are taken had been applied to the comet of 1881 an exposure of at least three days would have been required in order to get an impression of the head with about a tenth part of the tail but by that time a new method of vastly increased sensitiveness had been rendered available by which dry gelatineplates were substituted for the wet collodionplates hitherto in use and this improvement alone reduced the necessary time of exposure to two hours it was brought down to half an hour by janssens employment of a reflector specially adapted to give an image illuminated eight or ten times as strongly as that produced in the focus of an ordinary telescope1298 the photographic feebleness of cometary rays was not the only obstacle in the way of success the proper motion of these bodies is so rapid as to render the usual devices for keeping a heavenly body steadily in view quite inapplicable the machinery by which the diurnal movement of the sphere is followed must be especially modified to suit each eccentric career this too was done and on june 30 1881 janssen secured a perfect photograph of the brilliant object then visible showing the structure of the tail with beautiful distinctness to a distance of 212 from the head an impression to nearly 10 was obtained about the same time by dr henry draper at new york with an exposure of 162 minutes1299 tebbutts or comet 1881 iii was also the first comet of which the spectrum was so much as attempted to be chemically recorded both huggins and draper were successful in this respect but huggins was more completely so1300 the importance of the feat consisted in its throwing open to investigation a part of the spectrum invisible to the eye and so affording an additional test of cometary constitution the result was fully to confirm the origin from carboncompounds assigned to the visible rays by disclosing additional bands belonging to the same series in the ultraviolet as well as to establish unmistakably the presence of a not inconsiderable proportion of reflected solar light by the clear impression of some of the principal fraunhofer lines thus the polariscope was found to have told the truth though not the whole truth the photograph so satisfactorily communicative was taken by sir william huggins on the night of june 24 and on the 29th at greenwich the telltale fraunhofer lines were perceived to interrupt the visible range of the spectrum this was at first so vividly continuous that the characteristic cometary bands could scarcely be detached from their bright background but as the nucleus faded towards the end of june they came out strongly and were more and more clearly seen both at greenwich and at princeton to agree not with the spectrum of hydrocarbons glowing in a vacuum tube but with that of the same substances burning in a bunsen flame1301 it need not however be inferred that cometary materials are really in a state of combustion this from all that we know may be called an impossibility the additional clue furnished was rather to the manner of their electrical illumination1302 the spectrum of the tail was in this comet found to be not essentially different from that of the head professor wright of yale college ascertained a large percentage of its light to be polarized in a plane passing through the sun and hence to be reflected sunlight1303 a faint continuous spectrum corresponded to this portion of its radiance but gaseous emissions were also present at potsdam on june 30 the hydrocarbon bands were indeed traced by vogel to the very end of the tail1304 and they were kept in sight by young at a greater distance from the nucleus than the more equably dispersed light there seems little doubt that as in the solar corona the relative strength of the two orders of spectra is subject to fluctuations the comet of 1881 iii was thus of signal service to science it afforded when compared with the comet of 1807 the first undeniable example of two such bodies travelling so nearly in the same orbit as to leave absolutely no doubt of the existence of a genetic tie between them cometary photography came to its earliest fruition with it and cometary spectroscopy made a notable advance by means of it before it was yet out of sight it was provided with a successor at ann arbor observatory michigan on july 14 a comet was discovered by dr schaeberle which as his claim to priority is undisputed is often allowed to bear his name although designated in strict scientific parlance comet 1881 iv it was observed in europe after three days became just discernible by the naked eye at the end of july and brightened consistently up to its perihelion passage august 22 when it was still about fifty million miles from the sun during many days of that month the uncommon spectacle was presented of two bright comets circling together though at widely different distances round the north pole of the heavens the newcomer however never approached the pristine lustre of its predecessor its nucleus when brightest was comparable to the star cor caroli a narrow perfectly straight ray proceeding from it to a distance of 10 this was easily shown by brdikhine to belong to the hydrogen type of tails1305 while a strange faint second tail or bifurcation of the first one observed by captain noble august 241306 fell into the hydrocarbon class of emanations it was seen august 22 and 24 by dr f terby of louvain1307 as a short nebulous brush like the abortive beginning of a congeries of curving trains but appeared no more its wellattested presence was significant of the complex constitution of such bodies and the manifold kinds of action progressing in them the only peculiarity in the spectrum of schaeberles comet consisted in the almost total absence of continuous light the carbonbands were nearly isolated and very bright barely from the nucleus proceeded a rainbowtinted streak indicative of solid or liquid matter which in this comet must have been of very scanty amount its visit to the sun in 1881 was so far as is known the first the elements of its orbit showed no resemblance to those of any previous comet nor any marked signs of periodicity so that although it may be considered probable we do not know that it is moving in a closed curve or will ever again penetrate the precincts of the solar system it was last seen from the southern hemisphere october 19 1881 the third of a quartette of lucid comets visible within sixteen months was discovered by mr c s wells at the dudley observatory albany march 17 1882 two days later it was described by mr lewis boss as a great comet in miniature so well defined and regularly developed were its various parts and appendages discernible with optical aid early in may it was on june 5 observed on the meridian at albany just before noonan astronomical event of extreme rarity comet wells however never became an object so conspicuous as to attract general attention owing to its immersion in the evening twilight of our northern june but the study of its spectrum revealed new facts of the utmost interest all the comets till then examined had been found with the two transiently observed exceptions already mentioned to conform to one invariable type of luminous emission individual distinctions there had been but no specific differences now all these bodies had kept at a respectful distance from the sun for of the great comet of 1880 no spectroscopic inquiries had been made comet wells on the other hand approached its surface within little more than five million miles on june 10 1882 and the vicinity had the effect of developing a novel feature in its incandescence during the first half of april its spectrum was of the normal type though the carbon bands were unusually weak but with approach to the sun they died out and the entire light seemed to become concentrated into a narrow unbroken brilliant streak hardly to be distinguished from the spectrum of a star this unusual behaviour excited attention and a strict watch was kept it was rewarded at the dunecht observatory may 27 by the discernment of what had never before been seen in a cometthe yellow ray of sodium1308 by june 1 this had kindled into a blaze overpowering all other emissions the light of the comet was practically monochromatic and the image of the entire head with the root of the tail could be observed like a solar prominence depicted in its new saffron vesture of vivid illumination within the jaws of an open slit at potsdam the bright yellow line was perceived with astonishment by vogel on may 31 and was next evening identified with fraunhofers d its character led him to infer a very considerable density in the glowing vapour emitting it1309 hasselberg founded an additional argument in favour of the electrical origin of cometary light on the changes in the spectrum of comet wells1310 for they were closely paralleled by some earlier experiments of wiedemann in which the gaseous spectra of vacuum tubes were at once effaced on the introduction of metallic vapours it seemed as if the metal had no sooner been rendered volatile by heat than it usurped the entire office of carrying the discharge the resulting light being thus exclusively of its production had simple incandescence by heat been in question the effect would have been different the two spectra would have been superposed without prejudice to either similarly the replacement of the hydrocarbon bands in the spectrum of the comet by the sodium line proved electricity to be the exciting agent for the increasing thermal power of the sun might indeed have ignited the sodium but it could not have extinguished the hydrocarbons sir william huggins succeeded in photographing the spectrum of comet wells by an exposure of one hour and a quarter1311 the result was to confirm the novelty of its character none of the ultraviolet carbon groups were apparent but certain bright rays as yet unidentified had imprinted themselves otherwise the spectrum was strongly continuous uninterrupted even by the fraunhofer lines detected in the spectrum of tebbutts comet hence it was concluded that a smaller proportion of reflected light was mingled with the native emissions of the later arrival all that is certainly known about the extent of the orbit traversed by the first comet of 1882 is that it came from and is now retreating towards vastly remote depths of space an american computer1312 found a period indicated for it of no less than 400000 years a thraen of dingelstdt arrived at one of 36171313 both are perhaps equally insecure we have now to give some brief account of one of the most remarkable cometary apparitions on record andwith the single exception of that identified with the name of halleythe most instructive to astronomers the lessons learned from it were as varied and significant as its aspect was splendid although from the circumstance of its being visible in general only before sunrise the spectators of its splendour were comparatively few the discovery of a great comet at rio janeiro september 11 1882 became known in europe through a telegram from m cruls director of the observatory at that place it had however as appeared subsequently been already seen on the 8th by mr finlay of the cape observatory and at auckland as early as september 3 a later but very singularly conditioned detection quite unconnected with any of the preceding was effected by dr common at ealing since the eclipse of may 17 when a cometnamed tewfik in honour of the khedive of egyptwas caught on dr schusters photographs entangled one might almost say in the outer rays of the corona he had scrutinized the neighbourhood of the sun on the infinitesimal chance of intercepting another such body on its rapid journey thence or thither we record with wonder that after an interval of exactly four months that infinitesimal chance turned up in his favour on the forenoon of sunday september 17 he saw a great comet close to and rapidly approaching the sun it was in fact then within a few hours of perihelion some measures of position were promptly taken but a cloudveil covered the interesting spectacle before midday was long past mr finlay at the cape was more completely fortunate divided from his fellowobserver by half the world he unconsciously finished under a clearer sky his interrupted observation the comet of which the silvery radiance contrasted strikingly with the reddishyellow glare of the suns margin it drew near to was followed continuously right into the boiling of the limba circumstance without precedent in cometary history1314 dr elkin who watched the progress of the event with another instrument thought the intrinsic brilliancy of the nucleus scarcely surpassed by that of the suns surface nevertheless it had no sooner touched it than it vanished as if annihilated so sudden was the disappearance at 4h 50m 58s cape mean time that the comet was at first believed to have passed behind the sun but this proved not to have been the case the observers at the cape had witnessed a genuine transit nor could nonvisibility be explained by equality of lustre for the gradations of light on the suns disc are amply sufficient to bring out against the dusky background of the limb any object matching the brilliancy of the centre while an object just equally luminous with the limb must inevitably show dark at the centre the only admissible view then is that the bulk of the comet was of too filmy a texture and its presumably solid nucleus too small to intercept any noticeable part of the solar raysa piece of information worth remembering plate iii illustration the great comet of september 1882 photographed at the royal observatory cape of good hope on the following morning the object of this unique observation showed in sir david gills words an astonishing brilliancy as it rose behind the mountains on the east of table bay and seemed in no way diminished in brightness when the sun rose a few minutes afterward it was only necessary to shade the eye from direct sunlight with the hand at arms length to see the comet with its brilliant white nucleus and dense white sharply bordered tail of quite half a degree in length1315 all over the world wherever the sky was clear during that day september 18 it was obvious to ordinary vision since 1843 nothing had been seen like it from spain italy algeria southern france despatches came in announcing the extraordinary appearance at cordoba in south america the blazing star near the sun was the one topic of discourse1316 moreoverand this is altogether extraordinarythe records of its daylight visibility to the naked eye extend over three days at reus near tarragona it showed bright enough to be seen through a passing cloud when only three of the suns diameters from his limb just before its final rush past perihelion on september 17 while at carthagena in spain on september 19 it was kept in view during two hours before and two hours after noon and was similarly visible in algeria on the same day1317 but still more surprising than the appearance of the body itself were the nature and relations of the path it moved in the first rough elements computed for it by mr tebbutt dr chandler and mr white assistant at the melbourne observatory showed at once a striking resemblance to those of the twin comets of 1843 and 1880 this suggestive fact became known in this country september 27 through the medium of a dunecht circular it was fully confirmed by subsequent inquiries for which ample opportunities were luckily provided the likeness was not indeed so absolutely perfect as in the previous case it included some slight though real differences but it bore a strong and unmistakable stamp broadly challenging explanation two hypotheses only were really available either the comet of 1882 was an accelerated return of those of 1843 and 1880 or it was a fragment of an original mass to which they also had belonged for the purposes of the first view the resisting medium was brought into full play the opinion of its efficacy was for some time both prevalent and popular and formed the basis moreover of something of a sensational panic for a comet which at a single passage through the suns atmosphere encountered sufficient resistance to shorten its period from thirtyseven to two years and eight months must in the immediate future be brought to rest on his surface and the solar conflagration thence ensuing was represented in some quarters with more licence of imagination than countenance from science as likely to be of catastrophic import to the inhabitants of our little planet but there was a test available in 1882 which it had not been possible to apply either in 1843 or in 1880 the two bodies visible in those years had been observed only after they had already passed perihelion1318 the third member of the group on the other hand was accurately followed for a week before that event as well as during many months after it finlays and elkins observation of its disappearance at the suns edge formed besides a peculiarly delicate test of its motion the opportunity was thus afforded by directly comparing the comets velocity before and after its critical plunge through the solar surroundings of ascertaining with approximate certainty whether any considerable retardation had been experienced in the course of that plunge the answer distinctly given was that there had not the computed and observed places on both sides of the sun fitted harmoniously together the effect if any were produced was too small to be perceptible this result is in itself a memorable one it seems to give the coup de grce to enckes theorydiscredited in addition by backlunds investigationof a resisting medium growing rapidly denser inwards for the perihelion distance of the comet of 1882 though somewhat greater than that of its predecessors was nevertheless extremely small it passed at less than 300000 miles of the suns surface but the ethereal substance long supposed to obstruct the movement of enckes comet would there be nearly 2000 times denser than at the perihelion of the smaller body and must have exerted a conspicuous retarding influence that none such could be detected seems to argue that no such medium exists further evidence of a decisive kind was not wanting on the question of identity the great september comet of 1882 was in no hurry to withdraw itself from curious terrestrial scrutiny it was discerned with the naked eye at cordoba as late as march 7 1883 and still showed in the field of the great equatoreal on june 1 as an excessively faint whiteness1319 it was then about 480 millions of miles from the eartha distance to which no other cometnot even excepting the peculiar one of 1729had been pursued1320 moreover an arc of 340 out of the entire 360 degrees of its circuit had been described under the eyes of astronomers so that its course came to be very well known that its movement is in a very eccentric ellipse traversed in several hundred years was ascertained1321 the later inquiries of dr kreutz1322 completed in a volume published in 19011323 demonstrated the period to be of about 800 years while that of its predecessor in 1843 might possibly agree with it but is much more probably estimated at 512 years the hypothesis that they or any of the comets associated with them were returns of an individual body is peremptorily excluded they may all however have been separated from one original mass by the divellent action of the sun at close quarters each has doubtless its own period since each has most likely suffered retardations or accelerations special to itself which though trifling in amount would avail materially to alter the length of the major axis while leaving the remaining elements of the common orbit virtually unchanged1324 a fifth member was added to the family in 1887 on the 18th of january in that year m thome discovered at cordoba a comet reproducing with curious fidelity the lineaments of that observed in the same latitudes seven years previously the narrow ribbon of light contracting towards the sun and running outward from it to a distance of thirtyfive degrees the unsubstantial heada veiled nothingness as it appeared since no distinct nucleus could be made out the quick fading into invisibility were all accordant peculiarities and they were confirmed by some rough calculations of its orbit showing geometrical affinity to be no less unmistakable than physical likeness the observations secured were indeed from the nature of the apparition neither numerous nor overreliable and the earliest of them dated from a week after perihelion passed almost by a touchandgo escape january 11 on january 27 this mysterious object could barely be discerned telescopically at cordoba1325 that it belonged to the series of southern comets can scarcely be doubted but the inference that it was an actual return of the comet of 1880 improbable in itself was negatived by its nonappearance in 1894 meyers incorporation with this extraordinary group of the eclipsecomet of 18821326 has been approved by kreutz after searching examination the idea of cometary systems was first suggested by thomas clausen in 18311327 it was developed by the late m hoek director of the utrecht observatory in 1865 and some following years1328 he found that in quite a considerable number of cases the paths of two or three comets had a common point of intersection far out in space indicating with much likelihood a community of origin this consisted according to his surmise in the disruption of a parent mass during its sweep round the star latest visited be this as it may the fact is undoubted that numerous comets fall into groups in which similar conditions of motion betray a preexistent physical connection never before however had geometrical relationship been so notorious as between the comets now under consideration and never before in a comet still it might be said in the prime of life had physical peculiarities tending to account for that affinity been so obvious as in the chief member of the group observation of a granular structure in cometary nuclei dates far back into the seventeenth century when cysatus and hevelius described the central parts of the comets of 1618 and 1652 respectively as made up of a congeries of minute stars analogous symptoms of a loose state of aggregation have of late been not unfrequently detected in telescopic comets besides the instances of actual division offered by those connected with the names of biela and liais the forces concerned in producing these effects seem to have been peculiarly energetic in the great comet of 1882 the segmentation of the nucleus was first noticed in the united states and at the cape of good hope september 30 it proceeded rapidly at kiel on october 5 and 7 professor krger perceived two centres of condensation a definite and progressive separation into three masses was observed by professor holden october 13 and 171329 a few days later m tempel found the head to consist of four lucid aggregations ranged nearly along the prolongation of the caudal axis1330 and dr common january 27 1883 saw five nuclei in a line like pearls on a string1331 this remarkable character was preserved to the last moment of the comets distinct visibility it was a consequence according to dr kreutz of violent interior action in the comet itself while close to the sun there were however other curious proofs of a disaggregative tendency in this body on october 9 schmidt discovered at athens a nebulous object 4 southwest of the great comet and travelling in the same direction it remained visible for a few days and from oppenheims and hinds calculations there can be little doubt that it was really the offspring by fission of the body it accompanied1332 this is rendered more probable by the unexampled spectacle offered october 14 to professor barnard then of nashville tennessee of six or eight distinct cometary masses within 6 south by west of the comets head none of which reappeared on the next opportunity for a search1333 a week later however one similar object was discerned by mr w r brooks in the opposite direction from the comet thus space appeared to be strewn with the filmy dbris of this beautiful but fragile structure all along the track of its retreat from the sun its tail was only equalled if it were equalled in length by that of the comet of 1843 it extended in space to the vast distance of 200 millions of miles from the head but so imperfectly were its proportions displayed to terrestrial observers that it at no time covered an arc of the sky of more than 30 this apparent extent was attained during a few days previous to september 25 by a faint thin rigid streak noticed only by a few observersby elkin at the cape observatory eddie at grahamstown and cruls at rio janeiro it diverged at a low angle from the denser curved train and was produced according to brdikhine1334 by the action of a repulsive force twelve times as strong as the counterpull of gravity it belonged that is to type 1 while the great bifurcate appendage obvious to all eyes corresponded to the lower rate of emission characteristic of type 2 this was remarkable for the perfect definiteness of its termination for its stronglyforked shape and for its unusual permanence down to the end of january 1883 its length according to schmidts observations was still 93 million miles and a week later it remained visible to the naked eye without notable abridgment most singular of all was an anomalous extension of the appendage towards the sun during the greater part of october and november a luminous tube or sheath of prodigious dimensions seemed to surround the head and project in a direction nearly opposite to that of the usual outpourings of attentuated matter see plate iii its diameter was computed by schmidt to be october 15 no less than four million miles and it was described by cruls as a truncated cone of nebulosity stretching 3 or 4 sunwards1335 this and the entire anterior part of the comet were again surrounded by a thin but enormously voluminous paraboloidal envelope observed by schiaparelli for a full month from october 191336 there can be little doubt that these abnormal effluxes were a consequence of the tremendous physical disturbance suffered at perihelion and it is worth remembering that something analogous was observed in the comet of 1680 newtons also noted for its excessively close approach to the sun and possibly moving in a related orbit the only plausible hypothesis as to the mode of their production is that of an opposite state of electrification in the particles composing the ordinary and extraordinary appendages the spectrum of the great comet of 1882 was in part a repetition of that of its immediate predecessor thus confirming the inference that the previously unexampled sodiumblaze was in both a direct result of the intense solar action to which they were exposed but the d line was this time not seen alone at dunecht on the morning of september 18 drs copeland and j g lohse succeeded in identifying six brilliant rays in the green and yellow with as many prominent ironlines1337 a very significant addition to our knowledge of cometary constitution and one which lent countenance to brdikhines assumption of various kinds of matter issuing from the nucleus with velocities inversely as their atomic weights all the lines equally showed a slight displacement indicating a recession from the earth of the radiating body at the rate of 37 to 46 miles a second a similar observation made by m thollon at nice on the same day gave emphatic sanction to the spectroscopic method of estimating movement in the line of sight before anything was as yet known of the comets path or velocity he announced from the position of the double sodiumline alone that at 3 pm on september 18 it was increasing its distance from our planet by from 61 to 76 kilometres per second1338 m bigourdans subsequent calculations showed that its actual swiftness of recession was at that moment 73 kilometres changes in the inverse order to those seen in the spectrum of comet wells soon became apparent in the earlier body carbon bands had died out with approach to perihelion and had been replaced by sodium emissions in its successor sodium emissions became weakened and disappeared with retreat from perihelion and found their substitute in carbon bands professor ricc was in fact able to infer from the sequence of prismatic phenomena that the comet had already passed the sun thus establishing a novel criterion for determining the position of a comet in its orbit by the varying quality of its radiations recapitulating what was learnt from the five conspicuous comets of 188082 we find that the leading facts acquired to science were these three first that comets may be met with pursuing each other after intervals of many years in the same or nearly the same track so that identity of orbit can no longer be regarded as a sure test of individual identity secondly that at least the outer corona may be traversed by such bodies with perfect apparent impunity finally that their chemical constitution is highly complex and that they possess in some cases at least a metallic core resembling the meteoric masses which occasionally reach the earth from planetary space a group of five comets including halleys own a sort of cliental dependence upon the planet neptune they travel out from the sun just to about his distance from it as if to pay homage to a powerful protector who gets the credit of their establishment as periodical visitors to the solar system the second of these bodies to affect a lookedfor return was a cometthe sixteenth within ten yearsdiscovered by pons july 20 1812 and found by encke to revolve in an elliptic orbit with a period of nearly 71 years it was not however until september 1 1883 that mr brooks caught its reappearance it passed perihelion january 25 and was last seen june 2 1884 at its brightest it had the appearance of a second magnitude star furnished with a poorly developed double tail and was fairly conspicuous to the naked eye in southern europe from december to march one exceptional feature distinguished it its fluctuations in form and luminosity were unprecedented in rapidity and extent on september 21 dr chandler1339 observed it at harvard as a very faint diffused nebulosity with slight central condensation on the next night there was found in its place a bright star of the eighth magnitude scarcely marked out by a bare trace of environing haze from the genuine stars it counterfeited the change was attended by an eightfold augmentation of light and was proved by schiaparellis confirmatory observations1340 to have been accomplished within a few hours the stellar disguise was quickly cast aside the comet appeared on september 23 as a wide nebulous disc and soon after faded down to its original dimness its distance from the sun was then no less than 200 million miles and its spectrum showed nothing unusual these strange variations recurred slightly on october 15 and with marked emphasis on january 1 when they were witnessed with amazement and photometrically studied by mller of potsdam1341 the entire cycle this time was run through in less than four hoursthe comet having in that brief space condensed with a vivid outburst of light into a seeming star and the seeming star having expanded back again into a comet scarcely less transient though not altogether similar changes of aspect were noted by m perrotin1342 january 13 and 19 1884 on the latter date the continuous spectrum given by a reddishyellow disc surrounding the true nucleus seemed intensified by bright knots corresponding to the rays of sodium a comet discovered by mr sawerthal at the royal observatory cape of good hope february 19 1888 distinguished itself by blazing up on may 19 to four or five times its normal brilliancy at the same time throwing out from the head two lustrous lateral branches1343 these had on june 1 spread backward so as to join the tail with an effect like the playing of a fountain ten or eleven days later they had completely disappeared leaving the comet in its former shape and insignificance its abrupt display of vitality occurred two full months after perihelion on the morning of july 7 1889 mr w r brooks of geneva new york eminent as a successful comethunter secured one of his customary trophies the faint object in question was moving through the constellation cetus and turned out to be a member of jupiters numerous family of comets revolving round the sun in a period of seven years its past history came then to a certain extent within the scope of investigation and proved to have been singularly eventful nor had the body escaped scatheless from the vicissitudes to which it had been exposed observing from mount hamilton august 2 and 5 professor barnard noticed this comet 1889 v to be attended in its progress through space by four outriders the two brighter companions the fainter pair survived a very short time were perfect miniatures professor barnard tells us1344 of the larger comet each having a small fairly defined head and nucleus with a faint hazy tail the more distant one being the larger and less developed the three comets were in a straight line nearly east and west their tails lying along this line there was no connecting nebulosity between these objects the tails of the two smaller not reaching each other or the large comet to all appearance they were absolutely independent comets nevertheless spitaler at vienna in the early days of august perceived as it were a thin cocoon of nebulosity woven round the entire trio1345 one of them faded from view september 5 the other actually outshone the original comet on august 31 but was plainly of inferior vitality it was last seen by barnard on november 25 with the thirtysix inch refractor while its primary afforded an observation for position with the twelveinch march 20 18901346 a cause for the disruption it had presumably undergone had before then been plausibly assigned the adventures of lexells comet have long served to exemplify the effects of jupiters despotic sway over such bodies although bright enough in 1770 to be seen with the naked eye and ascertained to be circulating in five and a half years it had never previously been seen and failed subsequently to present itself the explanation of this anomaly suggested by lexell and fully confirmed by the analytical inquiries both of laplace and leverrier1347 was that a very close approach to jupiter in 1767 had completely changed the character of its orbit and brought it within the range of terrestrial observation while in 1779 after having only twice traversed its new path at its second return it was so circumstanced as to be invisible from the earth it was by a fresh encounter diverted into one entirely different yet the possibility was not lost sight of that the great planet by inverting its mode of action might undo its own work and fling the comet once more into the inner part of the solar system this possibility seemed to be realized by chandlers identification of brookss and lexells comet1348 an exceedingly close approach to jupiter in 1886 had he found reason to believe produced such extensive alterations in the elements of its motion as to bring the errant body back to our neighbourhood in 1889 but his inference though ratified by mr charles lane poors preliminary calculations proved dubious on closer inquiry and was rendered wholly inadmissible by the circumstances attending the return of brookss comet in 18961349 the companionobjects watched by barnard in 1889 had by that time perhaps become dissipated in space for they were not redetected they represented in all likelihood wreckage from a collision with jupiter dating perhaps so far back as 1791 when mr lane poor found that one of the fateful meetings to which shortperiod comets are especially subject had taken place the lexellbrooks case was almost duplicated by the resemblance to de vicos lost comet of 18441350 of one detected november 20 1894 by edward son of lewis swift schulhof1351 announced the identity and chandler1352 under reserve vouched for it had the comet continued to pursue the track laboriously laid down for it at boston and shown itself at the due epoch in 1900 its individuality might have been considered assured but the formidable vicegerent of the sun once more interposed and in 1897 swept it out of the terrestrial range of view hence the recognition remains ambiguous on the morning of march 7 1892 professor lewis swift discovered the brightest comet that had been seen by northern observers since 1882 about the time of perihelion which occurred on april 6 it was conspicuous as it crossed the celestial equator from aquarius towards pegasus with a nucleus equal to a third magnitude star and a tail twenty degrees long this tail was multiple and multiple in a most curiously variable manner it divided up into many thin nebulous streaks the number and relative lustre of which underwent rapid and marked changes their permanent record on barnards and w h pickerings plates marked a noteworthy advance in cometary photography plate iv reproduces two of the lick pictures taken with a sixinch camera on april 5 and 7 respectively with in each case an exposure of about one hour the tail is in the first composed of three main branches the middle one having sprung out since the previous morning and the branches are in their turn split up into finer rays to the number of perhaps a dozen in all in the second a very different state of things is exhibited the southern component professor barnard remarked which was the brightest on the 5th had become diffused and fainter while the middle tail was very bright and broad its southern side which was the best defined was wavy in numerous places the tail appearing as if disturbing currents were flowing at right angles to it at 42 from the head the tail made an abrupt bend towards the south as if its current was deflected by some obstacle in the densest portion of the tail at the point of deflection are a couple of dark holes similar to those seen in some of the nebul the middle portion of the tail is brighter and looks like crumpled silk in places1353 next morning the southern was the prominent branch and it was loaded at 1 42 from the head with a strange excrescence suggesting the buddingout of a fresh comet in that incongruous situation1354 some of these changes professor barnard thought might possibly be explained by a rotation of the tail on an axis passing through the nucleus and pickering who formed a similar opinion on independent grounds assigned about 94 hours as the period of the gyrating movement1355 he moreover determined accelerative velocities outward from the sun of definite condensations in the tail indicating for its materials on brdikhines theory a density less than one half that of hydrogen1356 this conclusion applied also to rordames comet which exhibited a year later phenomena analogous to those remarked in swifts their photographic study led professor hussey1357 to significant inferences as to the structure and rapid changes of cometary appendages plate iv illustration photographs of swifts comet by professor e e barnard no 1 taken april 4 1892 exposure 1 h no 2 taken april 6 1892 exposure 1 h 5 m seven comets were detected in 1892 and all strange to say were visible together towards the close of the year1358 among them was a faint object which unexpectedly left a trail on a plate exposed by professor barnard to the stars in aquila1359 on october 12 this was the first comet actually discovered by photography the sohag comet having been simultaneously seen and pictured it has a period of about six years holmess comet is likewise periodical in rather less than seven years its path which is wholly comprised between the orbits of mars and jupiter is less eccentric than that of any other known comet subsequently to its discovery on november 6 it underwent some curious vicissitudes at first bright and condensed it expanded rapidly with increasing distance from the sun to which it had made its nearest approach on june 13 until by the middle of december it was barely discernible with powerful telescopes as a feebly luminous mist on the face of the sky1360 but on january 16 1893 observers in europe and america were bewildered to find as if substituted for it a yellow star of the seventh magnitude enveloped in a thin nebulous husk which enclosed a faint miniature tail1361 this condensation and recovery of light lasted in its full intensity only a couple of days the almost evanescent faintness of holmess comet at its next return accounted for its invisibility previous to 1892 when it was evidently in a state of peculiar excitement mr perrine was barely able with the lick 36inch to find the vague nebulous patch which occupied its predicted place on june 10 1899 the origin of comets has been long and eagerly inquired into not altogether apart from the cheering guidance of ascertained facts sir william herschel regarded them as fragments of nebul1362scattered dbris of embryo worlds and laplace approved of and adopted the idea1363 but there was a difficulty no comet has yet been observed to travel in a decided hyperbola the typical cometary orbit apart from disturbance is parabolicthat is to say it is indistinguishable from an enormously long ellipse but this circumstance could only be reconciled with the view that the bodies thus moving were casual visitors from outer space by making as laplace did the tacit assumption that the solar system was at rest his reasoning was indeed thereby completely vitiated as gauss pointed out in 18151364 and the objections then urged were reiterated by schiaparelli1365 who demonstrated in 1871 that a large preponderance of wellmarked hyperbolic orbits should result if comets were picked up en route by a swiftlyadvancing sun the fact that their native movement is practically parabolic shows it to have been wholly imparted from without they passively obeyed the pull exerted upon them in other words their condition previous to being attracted by the sun was one very nearly of relative repose1366 they shared accordingly the movement of translation through space of the solar system this significant conclusion had been indicated on other grounds as the upshot of researches undertaken independently by carrington1367 and mohn1368 in 1860 with a view to ascertaining the anticipated existence of a relationship between the general lie of the paths of comets and the direction of the suns journey it is tolerably obvious that if they wander at haphazard through interstellar regions their apparitions should markedly aggregate towards the vicinity of the constellation lyra that is to say we should meet considerably more comets than would overtake us for the very same reason that falling stars are more numerous after than before midnight moreover the comets met by us should be apparently swiftermoving objects than those coming up with us from behind because in the one case our own real movement would be added to in the other subtracted from theirs but nothing of all this can be detected comets approach the sun indifferently from all quarters and with velocities quite independent of direction we conclude then that the cosmical current which bears the solar system towards its unknown goal carries also with it nebulous masses of undefined extent and at an undefined remoteness fragments detached from which continually entering the sphere of the suns attraction flit across our skies under the form of comets these are however almost certainly so far strangers to our system that they had no part in the long processes of development by which its present condition was attained they are perhaps survivals of an earlier and by us scarcely and dimly conceivable state of things when the swirling chaos from which sun and planets were by a supreme edict to emerge had not

stellar chemistry should not only have become possible but should already have made material advances is assuredly one of the most amazing features in the swift progress of knowledge our age has witnessed custom can never blunt the wonder with which we must regard the achievement of compelling rays emanating from a source devoid of sensible magnitude through immeasurable distance to reveal by its distinctive qualities the composition of that source the discovery of revolving double stars assured us that the great governing force of the planetary movements and of our own material existence sways equally the courses of the farthest suns in space the application of prismatic analysis certified to the presence in the stars of the familiar materials no less of the earth we tread than of the human bodies built up out of its dust and circumambient vapours we have seen that as early as 1823 fraunhofer ascertained the generic participation of stellar light in the peculiarity by which sunlight spread out by transmission through a prism shows numerous transverse rulings of interrupting darkness no sooner had kirchhoff supplied the key to the hidden meaning of those ciphered characters than it was eagerly turned to the interpretation of the dim scrolls unfolded in the spectra of the stars donati made at florence in 1860 the first efforts in this direction but with little result owing to the imperfections of the instrumental means at his command his comparative failure however was a prelude to others success almost simultaneously in 1862 the novel line of investigation was entered upon by huggins near london by father secchi at rome and by lewis m rutherfurd in new york fraunhofers device of using a cylindrical lens for the purpose of giving a second dimension to stellar spectra was adopted by all and was indeed indispensable for a luminous point such as a star appears becomes when viewed through a prism a variegated line which until broadened into a band by the intervention of a cylindrical lens is all but useless for purposes of research this process of rolling out involves it is true much loss of lighta scanty and precious commodity as coming from the stars but the loss is an inevitable one and so fully is it compensated by the great lightgrasping power of modern telescopes that important information can now be gained from the spectroscopic examination of stars far below the range of the unarmed eye the effective founders of stellar spectroscopy then since rutherfurd shortly turned his efforts elsewhither were father secchi the eminent jesuit astronomer of the collegio romano where he died february 26 1878 and sir william huggins with whom the late professor w a miller was associated the work of each was happily directed so as to supplement that of the other with less perfect appliances the roman astronomer sought to render his extensive rather than precise at tulse hill searching accuracy over a narrow range was aimed at and attained to father secchi is due the merit of having executed the first spectroscopic survey of the heavens above 4000 stars were passed in review by him and classified according to the varying qualities of their light his provisional establishment 186367 of four types of stellar spectra1369 has proved a genuine aid to knowledge through the facilities afforded by it for the arrangement and comparison of rapidly accumulating facts moreover it is scarcely doubtful that these spectral distinctions correspond to differences in physical condition of a marked kind the first order comprises more than half the visible and probably an overwhelming proportion of the faintest stars sirius vega regulus altair are amongst its leading members their spectra are distinguished by the breadth and intensity of the four dark bars due to the absorption of hydrogen and by the extreme faintness of the metallic lines of which nevertheless hundreds are disclosed by careful examination the light of these sirian orbs is white or bluish and it is found to be rich in ultraviolet rays capella and arcturus belong to the second or solar type of stars which is about onesixth less numerously represented than the first their spectra are quite closely similar to that of sunlight in being ruled throughout by innumerable fine dark lines and they share its yellowish tinge the third class includes most red and variable stars commonly synonymous of which betelgeux in the shoulder of orion and mira in the whale are noted examples their characteristic spectrum is of the fluted description it shows like a strongly illuminated range of seven or eight variously tinted columns seen in perspective the light falling from the red end towards the violet this kind of absorption is produced by the vapours of metalloids or of compound substances to the fourth order of stars belongs also a colonnaded spectrum but reversed the light is thrown the other way the three broad zones of absorption which interrupt it are sharp towards the red insensibly gradated towards the violet end the individuals composing class iv are few and apparently insignificant the brightest of them not exceeding the fifth magnitude they are commonly distinguished by a deep red tint and gleam like rubies in the field of the telescope father secchi who in 1867 detected the peculiarity of their analyzed light ascribed it to the presence of carbon in some form in their atmospheres and this was confirmed by the researches of h c vogel1370 director of the astrophysical observatory at potsdam the hydrocarbon bands in fact seen bright in comets are dark in these singular objectsthe only ones in the heavens save one brightline star and a rare meteor1371 which display a cometary analogy of the fundamental sort revealed by the spectroscope the members of all four orders are however emphatically suns they possess it would appear photospheres radiating all kinds of light and differ from each other mainly in the varying qualities of their absorptive atmospheres the principle that the colours of stars depend not on the intrinsic nature of their light but on the kinds of vapours surrounding them and stopping out certain portions of that light was laid down by huggins in 18641372 the phenomena of double stars seem to indicate a connection between the state of the investing atmospheres by the action of which their often brilliantly contrasted tints are produced and their mutual physical relations a tabular statement put forward by professor holden in june 18801373 made it at any rate clear that inequality of magnitude between the components of binary systems accompanies unlikeness in colour and that stars more equally matched in one respect are pretty sure to be so in the other besides blue and green stars of a decided tinge are never solitary they invariably form part of systems so that association has undoubtedly a predominant influence upon colour nevertheless the crude notion thrown out by zllner in 18651374 that yellow and red stars are simply white stars in various stages of cooling obtained for a time undeserved currency darrest indeed protested against it and ngstrm in 18681375 substituted atmospheric quality for mere colour1376 as a criterion of age and temperature his lead was followed by lockyer in 18731377 and by vogel in 18741378 the scheme of classification due to the potsdam astrophysicist differed from father secchis only in presenting his third and fourth types as subdivisions of the same order and in inserting three subordinate categories but their variety was rationalised by the addition of the seductive idea of progressive development thus the white sirian stars were represented as the youngest because the hottest of the sidereal family those of the solar pattern as having already wasted much of their store by radiation and being well advanced in middle life while the red stars with banded spectra figured as effete suns hastening rapidly down the road to final extinction vogels scheme is however incomplete it traces the downward curve of decay but gives no account of the slow ascent to maturity the present splendour of vega for instance was prepared according to all creative analogy by almost endless processes of gradual change what was its antecedent condition the question has been variously answered dr johnstone stoney advocated in 1867 the comparative youth of red stars1379 a ritter of aixlachapelle divided them in 18831380 into two squadrons posted the one on the ascending the other on the descending branch of the temperaturecurve and corresponding presumably with secchis third and fourth orders of stars with banded spectra whether in the interim they should display spectra of the sirian or of the solar type was made to depend on their greater or less massiveness1381 but the relation actually existing perhaps inverts that contemplated by ritter certainly the evidence collected by mr maunder in 1891 strongly supports the opinion that the average solar star is a weightier body than the average sirian star1382 on november 17 1887 sir norman lockyer communicated to the royal society the first of a series of papers embodying his meteoritic hypothesis of cosmical constitution stated and supported more at large in a separate work bearing that name published in 1890 the fundamental proposition wrought out in it was that all selfluminous bodies in the celestial space are composed either of swarms of meteorites or of masses of meteoric vapour produced by heat1383 on the basis of this supposed community of origin sidereal objects were distributed in seven groups along a temperaturecurve ascending from nebul and gaseous or brightline stars through red stars of the third type and a younger division of solar stars to the high sirian level then descending through the more strictly solar stars to red stars of the fourth type carbonstars below which lay only the caput mortuum entitled group vii the groundwork of this classification was however insecure and has given way certain spectroscopic coincidences avowedly only approximate suggesting that stars and nebul of every species might be formed out of variously aggregated meteorites failed of verification by exact inquiry and spectroscopic coincidences admit of no compromise those that are merely approximate are as a rule unmeaning in his presidential address at the cardiff meeting of the british association in 1891 dr huggins adhered in the main to the line of advance traced by vogel the inconspicuousness of metallic lines in the spectra of the white stars he attributed not to the paucity but to the high temperature of the vapours producing them and the consequent deficiency of contrast between their absorptionrays and the continuous light of the photospheric background such a state of things would more probably in his opinion be found in conditions anterior to the solar stage while a considerable cooling of the sun would probably give rise to banded spectra due to compounds he adverted also to the influential effects upon stellar types of varying surface gravity which being a function of both mass and bulk necessarily gains strength with wasting heat and consequent shrinkage the same leading ideas were more fully worked out in an atlas of representative stellar spectra published by sir william and lady huggins in 1899 they were moreover splendidly illustrated by a set of original spectrographic plates while precision was added to the adopted classification by the separation of helium from hydrogen stars the spectrum of the exotic substance terrestrially captured in 1895 is conspicuous by absorption as vogel lockyer and deslandres promptly recognised in a considerable number of white stars among them the pleiades and most of the brilliants in orion mr mcclean whose valuable spectrographic survey of the heavens was completed at the cape in 1897 found reason to conclude that they are in the first stage of development from gaseous nebul1384 and in this the tulse hill investigators unhesitatingly concur the strongest evidence for the primitive state of white stars is found in their nebular relations the components of groups still involved and entangled with silver braids of cosmic mist show perhaps invariably spectra of the helium type occasionally crossed by bright rays possibly all such stars have passed through a brightline stage but further evidence on the point is needed relative density furnishes another important test of comparative age and sirian stars are on the whole undoubtedly more bulky proportionately to their mass than solar stars the rule however seems to admit of exceptions hence the change from one kind of spectrum to the other is not inevitably connected with the attainment of a particular degree of condensation there is reason to believe that it is anticipated in the more massive globes despite their comparatively slow cooling as a consequence of the greater power of gravity over their investing vaporous envelopes this conclusion is enforced by the relations of doublestar spectra the fact that in unequal pairs the chief star most frequently shows a solar its companion a sirian spectrum can scarcely be otherwise explained than by admitting that while the sequence of types is pursued in an invariable order it is pursued much more rapidly in larger than in small orbs it need not indeed be supposed that all stars are identical in constitution and present identical lifehistories1385 individualities in the one and divergencies in the other must be allowed for yet the main track is plainly continuous and leads by insensible gradations from nebul through helium stars to the sirian and onward to the solar type whence by an inevitable transition fluted or antarian1386 spectra develop the firstknown examples of the class of gaseous starsbeta lyr and gamma cassiopeiwere noticed by father secchi at the outset of his spectroscopic inquiries both show bright lines of hydrogen and helium so that the peculiarity of their condition probably consists in the intense ignition of their chromospheric surroundings their entire radiating surfaces might be described as faculous that is to say brilliant formations such as have been photographed by professor hale on the suns disc1387 cover perhaps the whole instead of being limited to a small portion of the photospheric area but this state of things is more or less inconstant some at least of the bright rays indicative of it are subject to temporary extinctions already in 187172 dr vogel1388 suspected the prevalence of such vicissitudes and their reality was ascertained by m eugen von gothard after the completion of his new astrophysical observatory at herny in the autumn of 1881 he repeatedly observed the spectra of both stars without perceiving a trace of bright lines and was thus taken quite by surprise when he caught a twinkling of the crimson c in gamma cassiopei august 13 18831389 a few days later the whole range including d3 was lustrous duly apprised of the recurrence of a phenomenon he had himself vainly looked for during some years m von konkoly took the opportunity of the great vienna refractor being placed at his disposal to examine with it the relighted spectrum on august 271390 in its wealth of light c was dazzling d3 and the green and blue hydrogen rays shone somewhat less vividly d and the group b showed faintly dark while three broad absorptionbands sharply terminated towards the red diffuse towards the violet shaded the spectrum near its opposite extremities the previous absence of bright lines from the spectrum of this star was however by no means so protracted or complete as m von gothard supposed at dunecht c was superbly visible december 20 18791391 f was seen bright on october 28 of the same year and frequently at greenwich in 188081 the curious fact has moreover been adverted to by dr copeland that c is much more variable than f to vogel june 18 1872 the first was invisible while the second was bright at dunecht january 11 1887 the conditions were so far inverted that c was resplendent f comparatively dim no spectral fluctuations were detected in gamma cassiopei by keeler in 1889 but even with the giant telescope of mount hamilton the heliumray was completely invisible1392 it made nevertheless capricious appearances at south kensington during that autumn and again october 21 18941393 while in september 1892 blopolsky could obtain no trace of it on orthochromatic plates exposed with the 30inch pulkowa refractor1394 still more noteworthy is the circumstance that the wellknown green triplet of magnesium b recorded as dark by keeler in 1889 came out bright on fiftytwo spectrographs of the star taken by father sidgreaves during the years 1891991395 no fluctuations in the hydrogenspectrum were betrayed by them but subordinate lines of unknown origin showed alternate fading and vivification the spectrum of beta lyr undergoes transitions to some extent analogous yet involving a different set of considerations first noticed by von gothard in 18821396 they were imperfectly made out two years later to be of a cyclical character1397 this however could only be effectively determined by photographic means beta lyr is a shortperiod variable its light changes with great regularity from 34 to 44 magnitude every twelve days and twentytwo hours during which time it attains a twofold maximum with an intervening secondary minimum the question then is of singular interest whether the changes of spectral quality visible in this object correspond to its changes in visual brightness a distinct answer in the affirmative was supplied through mrs flemings examination of the harvard plates of the stars spectrum upon which in 1891 she found recorded diverse complex changes of bright and dark lines obviously connected with the phases of luminous variation and obeying in the longrun precisely the same period1398 something more will be said presently as to the import of this discovery bright hydrogen lines have so far been detectedfor the most part photographically at harvard collegein about sixty stars including pleione the surmised lost pleiad p cygni noted for instability of light in the seventeenth century and the extraordinary southern variable eta carin in most of these objects other vivid rays are associated with those due to hydrogen a blaze of hydrogen moreover accompanies the recurring outbursts of about one hundred and fifty longperiod variables giving banded spectra of the third type professor pickering discovered the first example of this class towards the close of 1886 in mira ceti further detections were made visually by mr espin and the conjunction of bright hydrogenlines with dusky bands has been proved by mrs flemings long experience in studying the harvard photographs to indicate unerringly the subjection of the stars thus characterised to variations of lustre accomplished in some months a third variety of gaseous star is named after mm wolf and rayet who discovered at paris in 18671399 its three typical representatives close together in the constellation cygnus six further specimens were discovered by dr copeland five of them in the course of a trip for the exploration of visual facilities in the andes in 18831400 and a large number have been made known through spectral photographs taken in both hemispheres under professor pickerings direction at the close of the nineteenth century over a hundred such objects had been registered none brighter than the sixth magnitude with the single exception of gamma args the resplendent continuous spectrum of which first examined by respighi and lockyer in 1871 is embellished with the yellow and blue rays distinctive of the type1401 here then we have a stellar globe apparently at the highest point of sunlike incandescence sharing the peculiarities of bodies verging towards the nebulous state examined with instruments of adequate power their spectra are seen to be highly complex they include a fairly strong continuous element a numerous set of absorptionlines and a range of emissionlines more or less completely represented in different stars especially conspicuous is a broad effluence of azure light found by dr vogel in 18831402 and by sir william and lady huggins in 18901403 to be of multiple structure and hence to vary in its mode of display its suggested identification with the blue carbonfluting was disproved at tulse hill metallic vapours give no certain sign of their presence in the atmospheres of these remarkable bodies but nebulum is stated to shine in some1404 hydrogen and helium account for a large proportion of their spectral rays thirtytwo wolfrayet stars were investigated spectroscopically and spectrographically by professor campbell with the great lick refractor in 1892941405 and several disclosed the singularity already noticed by him in gamma args of giving out mixed series the members of which change from vivid to obscure with increase of refrangibility it is difficult to imagine by what chromospheric machinery this curious result can be produced alcyone in the pleiades presents the same characteristic alone among the hydrogen lines crimson c glows in its spectrum while all the others are dark luminosity of the wolfrayet kind is particularly constant both in quantity and quality it seems to be incapable of developing save under galactic conditions all the stars marked by it lie near the central line of the milky way or in the magellanic clouds they tend also to gather into groups circles of four degrees radius include respectively seven in argo eight in cygnus the first spectroscopic star catalogue was published by dr vogel at potsdam in 18831406 it included 4051 stars distributed over a zone of the heavens extending from 20 north to 20 south of the celestial equator1407 more than half of these were white stars while red stars with banded spectra occurred in the proportion of about onethirteenth of the whole to the latter genus m dunr then of lund now director of the upsala observatory devoted a work of standard authority issued at stockholm in 1884 this was a catalogue with descriptive particulars of 352 stars showing banded spectra 297 of which belong to secchis third 55 to his fourth class vogels iii a and iii b since then discovery has progressed so rapidly at first through the telescopic reviews of mr espin then in the course of the photographic survey carried on at harvard college that considerably over one thousand stars are at present recognised as of the family of betelgeux and mira while about 250 have so far exhibited the spectral pattern of 19 piscium one fact well ascertained as regards both species is the invariability of the type the prismatic flutings of the one and the broader zones of the other are as if stereotypedthey undergo in their fundamental outlines no modification though varying in relative intensity from star to star they are always accompanied by or superposed upon a spectrum of dark lines in producing which sodium and iron have an obvious share and certain bright rays noticed by secchi with imperfect appliances as enhancing the chiaroscuro effects in carbonstars came out upon plates exposed by hale and ellerman in 1898 with the stellar spectrograph of the yerkes observatory1408 their genuineness was shortly afterwards visually attested by keeler campbell and dunr1409 but no chemical interpretation has been found for them a fairly complete preliminary answer to the question what are the stars made of was given by sir william huggins in 18641410 by laborious processes of comparison between stellar dark lines and the bright rays emitted by terrestrial substances he sought to assure his conclusions regardless of cost in time and pains he averred indeed thattaking into account restrictions by weather and positionthe thorough investigation of a single starspectrum would be the work of some years of two howeverthose of betelgeux and aldebaranhe was able to furnish detailed and accurate drawings the dusky flutings in the prismatic light of the first of these stars have not been identified with the absorption of any particular substance but associated with them are metallic lines of which 78 were measured and a good many identified by huggins while the wavelengths of 97 were determined by vogel in 18711411 a photographic research made by keeler at the alleghany observatory in 1897 convinced him that the linear spectrum of thirdtype stars of the betelgeux pattern essentially repeats that of the sun but with marked differences in the comparative strength of its components1412 hydrogen rays are inconspicuously present that an exalted temperature reigns at least in the lower strata of the atmosphere is certified by the vaporisation there of matter so refractory to heat as iron1413 nine elementsamong them iron sodium calcium and magnesiumwere recognised by huggins as having stamped their signature on the spectrum of aldebaran while the existence in sirius and nearly all the other stars inspected of hydrogen together with sundry metals was rendered certain or highly probable this was admitted to be a bare gleaning of results nor is there reason to suppose any of his congeners inferior to our sun in complexity of constitution definite knowledge on the subject however made little advance beyond the point to which it was brought by hugginss early experiments until spectroscopic photography became thoroughly effective as a means of research in this as in so many other directions sir william huggins acted as pioneer in march 1863 he obtained microscopic prints of the spectra of sirius and capella1414 but they told nothing no lines were visible in them they were mere characterless streaks of light nine years later dr henry draper of new york got an impression of four lines in the spectrum of vega then huggins attacked the subject again in 1876 when the 18inch speculum of the royal society had come into his possession using prisms of iceland spar and lenses of rock crystal and this time with better success a photograph of the spectrum of vega showed seven strong lines1415 still he was not satisfied he waited and worked for three years longer at length on december 18 1879 he was able to communicate to the royal society1416 results answering to his expectations the delicacy of eye and hand needed to obtain them may be estimated from the single fact that the image of a star had to be kept by continual minute adjustments exactly projected upon a slit 1350 of an inch in width during nearly an hour in order to give it time to imprint the characters of its analyzed light upon a gelatine plate raised to the highest pitch of sensitiveness but by this time he had secured in his wife a rarely qualified assistant the ultraviolet spectrum of the white starsof which vega was taken as the typewas thus shown to be a very remarkable one a group of broad dark lines intersected it arranged at intervals diminishing regularly upward and falling into a rhythmical succession with the visible hydrogen lines all belonged presumably to the same substance and the presumption was rendered a certainty by direct photographs of the hydrogen spectrum taken by h w vogel at berlin a few months earlier1417 in them seven of the whitestar series of grouped lines were visible and the full complement of twelve appeared on cornus plates in 18861418 in yellow stars such as capella and arcturus the same rhythmical series was partially represented but associated with a great number of other lines their state as regards ultraviolet absorption approximating to that of the sun while the redder stars betrayed so marked a deficiency in actinic rays that from betelgeux with an exposure forty times that required for sirius only a faint spectral impression could be obtained and from aldebaran in the strictly invisible region almost none at all thus by the means of stellar lightanalysis acquaintance was first made with the ultraviolet spectrum of hydrogen1419 and its harmonic character as expressed by balmers law supplies a sure test for discriminating among newly discovered lines those that appertain from those that are unrelated to it deslandres five additional prominencerays for instance were at once seen to make part of the series because conforming to its law1420 while a group of six dusky bands photographed by sir william and lady huggins april 4 18901421 near the extreme upper end of the spectrum of sirius were pronounced without hesitation for the opposite reason to have nothing to do with hydrogen their true affinities are still a matter for inquiry as regards the hydrogen spectrum however the stars had further information in reserve until recently it was supposed to consist of a single harmonic series although by analogy three should coexist in 1896 accordingly a second bound to the first by unmistakable numerical relationships was recognised by professor pickering in spectrographs of the 25 magnitude star zeta puppis1422 and the identification was shortly afterwards extended to prominent wolfrayet emission lines the discovery was capped by dr rydbergs indication of the wolfrayet blue band at lambda 4688 as the fundamental member of the third and principal hydrogen series1423 none of the pickering lines as they may be called to distinguish them from the huggins series can be induced to glimmer in vacuumtubes they seem to characterise bodies in a primitive state1424 and are in many cases associated with absorption rays of oxygen the identification of which by mr mcclean in 18971425 was fully confirmed by sir david gill1426 the typical oxygen star is beta crucis one of the brilliants of the southern cross but the distinctive notes of its spectrum occur in not a few specimens of the helium class thus sir william and lady huggins photographed several ultraviolet oxygen lines in beta lyr1427 and found in rigel signs of the presence of nitrogen1428 which as well as silicium proves to be a tolerably frequent constituent of such orbs1429 for some unknown reason metalloids tend to become effaced as metals in the normal course of stellar development exert a more and more conspicuous action dr scheiners spectrographic researches at potsdam in 1890 and subsequently exemplify the immense advantages of selfregistration in a restricted section of the spectrum of capella he was enabled to determine nearly three hundred lines with more precision than had then been attained in the measurement of terrestrial spectra this star appeared to be virtually identical with the sun in physical constitution although it emits according to the best available data about 140 times as much light and is hence presumably 1600 times more voluminous an equally close examination of the spectrum of betelgeux showed the predominance in it of the linear absorption of iron1430 but its characteristic flutings do not extend to the photographic region spectra of the second and third orders are for this reason not easily distinguished on the sensitive plate a spectrographic investigation of all the brighter northern stars was set on foot in 1886 at the observatory of harvard college under the form of a memorial to dr h draper whose promising work in that line was brought to a close by his premature death in 1882 no individual exertions could however have realized a tithe of what has been and is being accomplished under professor pickerings able direction with the aid of the draper and other instruments supplemented by mrs drapers liberal provision of funds a novel system was adopted or rather an old oneoriginally used by fraunhoferwas revived1431 the use of a slit was discarded as unnecessary for objects like the stars devoid of sensible dimensions and giving hence a naturally pure spectrum and a large prism placed in front of the objectglass analysed at once with slight loss of light the rays of all the stars in the field their spectra were taken as it were wholesale as many as two hundred stars down to the eighth magnitude were occasionally printed on a single plate with a single exposure no cylindrical lens was employed the movement of the stars themselves was turned to account for giving the desirable width to their spectra the star was allowedby disconnecting or suitably regulating the clockto travel slowly across the line of its own dispersed light so broadening it gradually into a band excellent results were secured in this way about fifty lines appear in the photographed spectrum of aldebaran and eight in that of vega on january 26 1886 with an exposure of thirtyfour minutes a simultaneous impression was obtained of the spectra among many others of close upon forty pleiades with few and doubtful exceptions they all proved to belong to the same type an additional argument for the common origin of the stars forming this beautiful group was thus provided1432 the draper catalogue of stellar spectra was published in 18901433 it gives the results of a rapid analytical survey of the heavens north of 25 of southern declination and includes 10351 stars down to about the eighth magnitude the telescope used was of eight inches aperture and fortyfive focus its field of viewowing to the portraitlens or doublet form given to itembracing with fair definition no less than one hundred square degrees an objective prism eight inches square was attached and exposures of a few minutes were given to the most sensitive plates that could be procured in this way the sky was twice covered in duplicate each star appearing as a rule on four plates the registration of their spectra was sought to be made more distinctive than had previously been attempted secchis first type being divided into four his second into five subdivisions but the differences regarded in them could be confidently established only for stars above the sixth magnitude the work supplies none the less valuable materials for general inferences as to the distribution and relations of the spectral types the labour of its actual preparation was borne by a staff of ladies under the direction of mrs fleming materials for its completion to the southern pole have been accumulated with the identical instrument used at cambridge transferred for the purpose in 1889 to peru and the forthcoming second draper catalogue will comprise 30000 stars in both hemispheres as supplements to this great enterprise two important detailed discussions of stellar spectra were issued in 1897 and 1901 respectively1434 the first by miss a c maury dealt with 681 bright stars visible in the northern hemisphere the second by miss a j cannon with 1122 southern stars both authors traced with care and ability the minute gradations by which the long process of stellar evolution appears to be accomplished the progress of the draper memorial researches was marked by discoveries of an unexampled kind the principle upon which motion in the line of sight can be detected and measured with the spectroscope has already been explained1435 it depends as our readers will remember upon the removal of certain lines dark or bright it matters not which from their normal places by almost infinitesimal amounts the whole spectrum of the moving object in fact is very slightly shoved hither or thither according as it is travelling towards or from the eye but for convenience of measurement one line is usually picked out from the rest and attention concentrated upon it the application of this method to the stars however is encompassed with difficulties it needs a powerfully dispersive spectroscope to show linedisplacements of the minute order in question and powerful dispersion involves a strictly proportionate enfeeblement of light this where the supply is already to a deplorable extent niggardly can ill be afforded for which reason the operation of determining a stars approach or recession is even apart from atmospheric obstacles an excessively delicate one it was first executed by sir william huggins early in 18681436 selecting the brightest star in the heavens as the most promising subject of experiment he considered the f line in the spectrum of sirius to be just so much displaced towards the red as to indicate the orbital motion of the earth being deducted recession at the rate of twentynine miles a second and the reality and direction of the movement were ratified by vogel and lohses observation march 22 1871 of a similar but even more considerable displacement1437 the inquiry was resumed by huggins with improved apparatus in the following year when the velocities of thirty stars were approximately determined1438 the retreat of sirius which proved slower than had at first been supposed was now announced to be shared at rates varying from twelve to twentynine miles by betelgeux rigel castor regulus and five of the principal stars in the plough arcturus on the contrary gave signs of rapid approach as well as pollux vega deneb in the swan and the brightness of the pointers numerically indeed these results were encompassed with uncertainty thus arcturus is now fully ascertained to be travelling towards the sun at the comparatively slow pace of less than five miles a second and sirius moves twice as fast in the same direction the great difficulty of measuring so distended a line as the sirian f might indeed well account for some apparent anomalies the scope of sir william hugginss achievement was not however to provide definitive data but to establish as practicable the method of procuring them in this he was thoroughly successful and his success was of incalculable value spectroscopic investigations of stellar movements may confidently be expected to play a leading part in the unravelment of the vast and complex relations which we can dimly detect as prevailing among the innumerable orbs of the sidereal world for it supplements the means which we possess of measuring by direct observation movements transverse to the line of sight and thus completes our knowledge of the courses and velocities of stars at ascertained distances while supplying for all a valuable index to the amount of perspective foreshortening of apparent movement thus some even if an imperfect knowledge may at length be gained of the revolutions of the starsof the systems they unite to form of the paths they respectively pursue and of the forces under the compulsion of which they travel the applicability of the method to determining the orbital motions of double stars was pointed out by fox talbot in 18711439 but its use for their discovery revealed itself spontaneously through the harvard college photographs in spectrograms of zeta urs majoris mizar taken in 1887 and again in 1889 the k line was seen to be double while on other plates it appeared single a careful study of miss a c maury of a series of seventy impressions indicated for the doubling a period of fiftytwo days and showed it to affect all the lines in the spectrum1440 the only available and no doubt the true explanation of the phenomenon was that two similar and nearly equal stars are here merged into one telescopically indivisible their combined light giving a single or double spectrum according as their orbital velocities are directed across or along our line of sight the movements of a revolving pair of stars must always be opposite in sense and proportionately equal in amount that is they at all times travel with speeds in the inverse ratio of their masses hence unless the plane of their orbits be perpendicular to a plane passing through the eye there must be two opposite points where their velocities in the line of sight reach a maximum and two diametrically opposite points where they touch zero the lines in their common spectrum would thus appear alternately double and single twice in the course of each revolution to that of mizar at first supposed to need 104 days for its completion a period of only twenty days fourteen hours was finally assigned by vogel1441 anomalous spectral effects probably due to the very considerable eccentricity of the orbit long impeded its satisfactory determination the mean distance apart of the component stars as now ascertained is just twentytwo million miles and their joint mass quadruples that of the sun but these are minimum estimates for if the orbital plane be inclined much or little to the line of sight the dimensions and mass of the system should be proportionately increased an analogous discovery was made by miss maury in 1889 but in the spectrum of beta aurig the lines open out and close up on alternate days indicating a relative orbit1442 with a radius of less than eight million miles traversed in about four days this implies a rate of travel for each star of sixtyfive miles a second and a combined mass 47 times that of the sun the components are approximately equal both in mass and light1443 and the system formed by them is transported towards us with a speed of some sixteen miles a second the lineshiftings so singularly communicative proceed in this star with perfect regularity this new class of spectroscopic binaries could never have been visually disclosed the distance of beta aurig from the earth as determined somewhat doubtfully by professor pritchard is nearly three and a third million times that of the earth from the sun parallax 006 whence it has been calculated that the greatest angular separation of the revolving stars is only fivethousandths of a second of arc1444 to make this evanescent interval perceptible a telescope eighty feet in aperture would be required the zodiacal star spica alpha virginis was announced by dr vogel april 24 18901445 to belong to the novel category with the difference however of possessing a nearly dark instead of a brilliantly lustrous companion in this case accordingly the telltale spectroscopic variations consist merely in a slight swinging to and fro of single lines no second spectrum leaves a legible trace on the plate spica revolves in four days at the rate of fiftyseven miles a second1446 or quicker in proportion as its orbit is more inclined to the line of sight round a centre at a minimum distance of three millions of miles but the position of the second star being unknown the mass of the system remains indeterminate the lesser component of the splendid slowly revolving binary castor is also closely double its spectral lines were found by blopolsky in 18961447 to oscillate once in nearly three days the secondary globe being apparently quite obscure further study of the movements thus betrayed elicited the fact that the major axis of the eclipse traversed revolves in a period of 2100 days as a consequence most likely of the flattened shape of the stars1448 still more unexpected was the simultaneous assignment by campbell and newall of a duplex character to capella1449 here both components shine though with a different quality of light one giving a pure solar spectrum the other claiming prismatic affinity with procyon their mutual circulation is performed in 104 days and the radius of their orbit cannot be less and may be a great deal more than 51000000 miles hence the possibility is not excluded that the starwhich has an authentic parallax of 008may be visually resolved indeed signs of elongation were thought to be perceptible with the greenwich 28inch refractor1450 while only round images could be seen at lick1451 another noteworthy case is that of polaris found by campbell to have certainly one and probably two obscure attendants1452 through his systematic investigations of stellar radial velocities with the mills spectrograph knowledge in this department has since 1897 progressed so rapidly that the spectroscopic binaries of our acquaintance already number half a hundred and ten times as many more doubtless lie within easy range of detection now it is evident that a spectroscopic binary if the plane of its motion made a very small angle with the line of sight would be a variable star for during a few hours of each revolution some at least of its light should be cut off by a transit of its dusky companion such eclipsestars are actually found in the heavens the best and longestknown member of the group is algol in the head of medusa the demonstar of the arabs1453 this remarkable object normally above the third magnitude loses and regains threefifths of its light once in 688 hours the change being completed in about twelve hours its definite and limited nature and punctual recurrence suggested to goodricke of york by whom the periodicity of the star was discovered in 17831454 the interposition of a large dark satellite but the conditions involved by the explanation were first seriously investigated by pickering in 18801455 he found that the phenomena could be satisfactorily accounted for by supposing an obscure body 0764 the bright stars diameter to revolve round it in a period identical with that of its observed variation this theoretical forecast was verified with singular exactitude at potsdam in 18891456 a series of spectral photographs taken there showed each of algols minima to be preceded by a rapid recession from the earth and succeeded by a rapid movement of approach towards it they take place accordingly when the star is at the furthest point from ourselves of an orbit described round an invisible companion the transits of which across its disc betray themselves to notice by the luminous vicissitudes they occasion the diameter of this orbit traversed at the rate of twentysix miles a second is just 2000000 miles and it is an easy further inference from the duration and extent of the phases exhibited that algol itself must be in round numbers one million its attendant 830000 miles in diameter assuming both to be of the same density vogel found their respective masses to be fourninths and twoninths that of the sun and their distance asunder to be 3230000 miles this singularly assorted pair of stars possibly form part of a larger system their period of revolution is shorter now by six seconds than it was in goodrickes time and dr chandler has shown by an exhaustive discussion that its inequalities are comprised in a cycle of about 130 years1457 they arise in his view from a common revolution in that period of the close couple about a third distant body emitting little or no light in an orbit inclined 20 to our line of vision and of approximately the size of that described by uranus round the sun the time spent by light in crossing this orbit causes an apparent delay in the phases of the variable when algol and its eclipsing satellite are on its further side from ourselves balanced by acceleration while they traverse its hither side dr chandler derives confirmation for his plausible and ingenious theory from a supposed undulation in the line traced out by algols small proper motion but the reality of this disturbance has yet to be established1458 meanwhile m tisserand1459 late director of the paris observatory preferred to account for algols inequalities on the principle later applied by blopolsky to those of castor that is to say he assumed a revolving line of apsides in an elliptical orbit traversed by a pretty strongly compressed pair of globes the truth of this hypothesis can be tested by close observation of the phases of the star during the next few years the variable in the head of medusa is the exemplar of a class including 26 recognised members all of which doubtless represent occulting combinations of stars but their occultations result merely from the accident of their orbital planes passing through our line of sight hence the heavens must contain numerous systems similarly constituted though otherwise situated as regards ourselves some of which like spica virginis will become known through their spectroscopic changes while others because revolving in planes nearly tangent to the sphere or at right angles to the visual line may never disclose to us their true nature among eclipsing stars should probably be reckoned the peculiar variables beta lyr and v puppis each believed to consist of a pair of bright stars revolving almost in contact1460 three stars on the other hand distinguished by rapid and regular fluctuations have been proved by blopolsky to be attended by nonocculting satellites which circulate nevertheless in the identical periods of lightchange gores catalogue of known variables1461 included in 1884 190 entries and the number was augmented to 243 on its revision in 18881462 chandlers first list of 225 such objects1463 published about the same time received successive expansions in 1893 and 18961464 and finally included 400 entries a new catalogue of variable stars still wider in scope will shortly be issued by the german astronomische gesellschaft mr a w robertss researches on southern variables1465 have greatly helped to give precision while adding to the extent of knowledge in this branch dr gould held the opinion that most stars fluctuate slightly in brightness through surfacealterations similar to but on a larger scale than those of the sun and the solar analogy might be pushed somewhat further it perhaps affords a clue to much that is perplexing in stellar behaviour wolf pointed out in 1852 the striking resemblance in character between curves representing sunspot frequency and curves representing the changing luminous intensity of many variable stars there were the same steep ascent to maximum and more gradual decline to minimum the same irregularities in heights and hollows and it may be added the same tendency to a double maximum and complexity of superposed periods1466 it is impossible to compare the two sets of phenomena thus graphically portrayed without reaching the conclusion that they are of closely related origin but the correspondence indicated is not as has often been hastily assumed between maxima of sunspots and minima of stellar brightness but just the reverse the luminous outbursts not the obscurations of variable stars obey a law analogous to that governing the development of spots on the sun objects of the kind do not then gain light through the closingup of dusky chasms in their photospheres but by an actual increase of surfacebrilliancy together with an immense growth of these brilliant formationsprominences and faculwhich in the sun accompany or are appended to spots a comparison of lightcurves with curves of spotfrequency leaves no doubt on this point and the strongest corroborative evidence is derived from the emergence of bright lines in the spectra of longperiod variables rising to their recurring maxima every kind and degree of variability is exemplified in the heavens at the bottom of the scales are stars like the sun of which the lustre istried by our instrumental meanssensibly steady at the other extreme are ranged the astounding apparitions of new or temporary stars within the last thirtysix years eleven of these stellar guests as the chinese call them have presented themselves and we meet with a twelfth no farther back than april 27 1848 but of the new star in ophiuchus found by mr hind on that night little more could be learnt than of the brilliant objects of the same kind observed by tycho and kepler the spectroscope had not then been invented let us hear what it had to tell of later arrivals about thirty minutes before midnight of may 12 1866 mr john birmingham of millbrook near tuam in ireland saw with astonishment a bright star of the second magnitude unfamiliarly situated in the constellation of the northern crown four hours earlier schmidt of athens had been surveying the same part of the heavens and was able to testify that it was not visible there that is to say a few hours or possibly a few minutes sufficed to bring about a conflagration the news of which may have occupied hundreds of years in travelling to us across space the rays which were its messengers admitted within the slit of sir william hugginss spectroscope may 16 proved to be of a composition highly significant as to the nature of the catastrophe the starwhich had already declined below the third magnitudeshowed what was described as a double spectrum to the dusky flutings of secchis third type four brilliant rays were added1467 the chief of these agreed in position with lines of hydrogen so that the immediate cause of the outburst was inferred to have been the eruption or ignition of vast masses of that subtle kind of matter the universal importance of which throughout the cosmos is one of the most curious facts revealed by the spectroscope t coron as the new star was called quickly lost its adventitious splendour nine days after its discovery it was again invisible to the naked eye it is now a pale yellow slightly variable star near the tenth magnitude and finds a place as such in argelanders charts1468 it was thus obscurely known before it made its sudden leap into notoriety the next temporary discovered by dr schmidt at athens november 24 1876 could lay no claim to previous recognition even in that modest rank it was strictly a parvenu there was no record of its existence until it made its appearance as a star of nearly the third magnitude in the constellation of the swan its spectrum was examined december 2 by cornu at paris1469 and a few days later by vogel and o lohse at potsdam1470 it proved of a closely similar character to that of t coron a range of bright lines including those of hydrogen and probably of helium stood out from a continuous background impressed with strong absorption it may be presumed that in reality the gaseous substances which by their sudden incandescence had produced the apparent conflagration lay comparatively near the surface of the star while the screen of cooler materials intercepting large portions of its light was situated at a considerable elevation in its atmosphere the object meanwhile steadily faded by the end of the year it was of no more than seventh magnitude after the second week of march 1877 strengthening twilight combined with the decline of its radiance to arrest further observation it was resumed september 2 at dunecht with a strange result practically the whole of its scanty light it had then sunk below the tenth magnitude was perceived to be gathered into a single bright line in the green and that the most characteristic line of gaseous nebul1471 the star had in fact so far as outward appearance was concerned become transformed into a planetary nebula many of which are so minute as to be distinguishable from small stars only by the quality of their radiations it is now having sunk to about the fourteenth magnitude1472 entirely beyond the reach of spectroscopic scrutiny perhaps none of the marvellous changes witnessed in the heavens has given a more significant hint as to their construction than the stellar blaze kindled in the heart of the great andromeda nebula some undetermined number of years or centuries before its rays reached the earth in the month of august 1885 the first published discovery was by dr hartwig at dorpat on august 31 but it was found to have been already seen on the 19th by mr isaac w ward of belfast and on the 17th by m ludovic gully of rouen the negative observations on the 16th of tempel1473 and max wolf limited very narrowly the epoch of the apparition nevertheless it did not like most temporaries attain its maximum brightness all at once when first detected it was of the ninth by september 1 it had risen to the seventh magnitude from which it so rapidly fell off that in march it touched the limit of visibility sixteenth magnitude with the washington 26inch its light bleached very perceptibly as it faded1474 during the earlier stages of its decline the contrast was striking between the sharply defined ruddy disc of the star and the hazy greenishwhite background upon which it was projected1475 and with which it was inevitably suggested to be in some sort of physical connection let us consider what evidence was really available on this point to begin with the position of the star was not exactly central it lay sixteen seconds of arc to the southwest of the true nebular nucleus its appearance did not then signify a sudden advance of the nebula towards condensation nor was it attended by any visible change in it save the transient effect of partial effacement through superior brightness equally indecisive information was derived from the spectroscope to vogel hasselberg and young the light of the nova seemed perfectly continuous but huggins caught traces of bright lines on september 2 confirmed on the 9th1476 and copeland succeeded on september 30 in measuring three bright bands with an acuteangled prism specially constructed for the purpose1477 a shimmer of f was suspected and had also been perceived by mr o t sherman of yale college still the effect was widely different from that of the characteristic blazing spectrum of a temporary star and prompted the surmise that here too a variable might be under scrutiny the star however was certainly so far new that its rays until their sudden accession of strength were too feeble to affect even our reinforced senses not one of the 1283 small stars recorded in charts of the nebula could be identified with it and a photograph taken by dr common august 16 1884 on which a multitude of stars down to the fifteenth magnitude had imprinted themselves showed the uniform soft gradation of nebulous light to be absolutely unbroken by a stellar indication in the spot reserved for the future occupation of the nova1478 so far then the view that its relation to the nebula was a merely optical one might be justified but it became altogether untenable when it was found that what was taken to be a chance coincidence had repeated itself within living memory on the 21st of may 1860 m auwers perceived at knigsberg a seventh magnitude star shining close to the centre of a nebula in scorpio numbered 80 in messiers catalogue1479 three days earlier it certainly was not there and three weeks later it had vanished the effect to mr pogson who independently discovered the change may 281480 was as if the nebula had been replaced by a star so entirely were its dim rays overpowered by the concentrated blaze in their midst now it is simply incredible that two outbursts of so uncommon a character should have accidentally occurred just on the line of sight between us and the central portions of two nebul we must then conclude that they showed on these objects because they took place in them the most favoured explanation is that they were what might be called effects of overcrowdingthat some of the numerous small bodies presumably composing the nebul jostled together in their intricate circlings and obtained compensation in heat for their sacrifice of motion but this is scarcely more than a plausible makeshift of perplexed thought mr w h s monck on the other hand has suggested that new stars appear when dark bodies are rendered luminous by rushing through the gaseous fields of space1481 just as meteors kindle in our atmosphere the idea which has been revived and elaborated by dr seeliger of munich1482 is ingenious but was not designed to apply to our present case neither of the objects distinguished by the striking variations just described is of gaseous constitution that in scorpio appears under high magnifying powers as a compressed cluster that in andromeda is perhaps as sir j herschel suggested optically nebulous through the smallness of its constituent stars1483if stars they deserve to be called on the 8th of december 1891 dr max wolf took a photograph of the region about chi aurig no stranger so bright as the eighth magnitude was among the stars depicted upon it on the 10th nevertheless a stellar object of the fifth magnitude situated a couple of degrees to the northeast of beta tauri and previously unrecorded where eleventh magnitude stars appeared imprinted itself upon a harvard negative subsequent photographs taken at the same place showed it to have gained about half a magnitude by the 20th but the plates were not then examined and the discovery was left to be modestly appropriated by an amateur the rev dr anderson of edinburgh by whom it was announced february 1 1892 through the medium of an anonymous postcard to dr copeland the astronomer royal for scotland1484 by him and others the engines of modern research were promptly set to work and to good purpose nova aurig was the first star of its kind studied by the universal chemical method it is the first accordingly of which authentic records can be handed down to posterity they are of a most remarkable character the spectrum of the new object was photographed at stonyhurst and south kensington on february 3 a few days later at harvard and lick in america at potsdam and hrny on the continent of europe but by far the most complete impression was secured february 22 with an exposure of an hour and threequarters by sir william and lady huggins through whose kindness it is reproduced in plate v fig 1 the range of bright lines displayed in it is of astonishing vividness and extent it includes all the hydrogen rays dark in the spectrum of sirius separately printed for comparison besides many others still more refrangible as yet unidentified very significant too is the marked character of the great prominence lines h and k the visual spectrum of the nova was splendidly effective a quartette of brilliant green rays two of them due to helium caught the eye and they had companions too numerous to be easily counted the hydrogen lines were broad and bright c blazed as mr espin said like a dangersignal on a dark night the sodium pair were identified at tulse hill and the yellow helium ray was suspected to lurk close beside them fig 2 in the same plate shows the spectrum as it was seen and mapped by lady huggins february 2 to 6 together with the spectra employed to test the nature of the emissions dispersed in it one striking feature will be at once remarked it is that of the pairing of bright with dark lines both in the visible and the photographic regions this singular peculiarity was unmistakable and since the two series plainly owned the same chemical origin their separate visibility implied large displacement otherwise they would have been superposed not juxtaposed measurements of the bright rays accordingly showed them to be considerably pushed down towards the red while their dark companions were still more pushed up towards the blue end thus the spectrum of nova aurig like that of beta lyr with which it had many points in common appeared to be really double it was supposed to combine the light of two distinct bodies one of a gaseous nature moving rapidly away from the earth the other giving a more sunlike spectrum approaching it with even higher speed the relative velocity determined at potsdam for these oppositely flying masses amounted to 550 miles a second1485 and this prodigious rate of separation was fully maintained during six weeks it did not then represent a mere periastral rushpast1486 to the bodies exhibiting its effects and parting company for ever under its stress it must have belonged with slight diminution in perpetuity the luminous outburst by which they became visible was explained by sir william huggins in a lecture delivered at the royal institution may 13 1892 on the tidal theory of klinkerfues and wilsing disturbances and deformations due to the mutual attraction of two bulky globes at a close approach would he considered give rise to enormous eruptions of the hotter matters from within immensely greater but similar in kind to solar eruptions and accompanied probably by large electrical disturbances the multiple aspect and somewhat variable character of both bright and dark lines were plausibly referred to processes of reversal such as are nearly always in progress above sunspots but the long duration of the stars suddenly acquired lustre did not easily fit in with the adopted rationale a direct collision on the other hand was out of the question since there had obviously been little if any sacrifice of motion and the substitution of a nebula for one of the stars1487 compelled recourse to scarcely conceivable modes of action for an explanation of the perplexing peculiarities of the compound spectrum plate v illustration photographic and visual spectrum of nova aurig fig 1from a photograph taken by sir william and lady huggins feb 22 1892 fig 2from a drawing made by lady huggins feb 2 to 6 1892 an unexpected dnouement however threw all speculations off the track the nova contained most of its brightness fluctuations notwithstanding until march 9 after which date it ran swiftly and uniformly down towards what was apprehended to be total extinction no marked change of spectrum attended its decline when last examined at tulse hill march 24 all the more essential features of its prismatic light were still faintly recognisable1488 the object was steadily sinking on april 26 when a supposed final glimpse of it was caught with the lick 36inch1489 it was then of about the sixteenth magnitude but on august 17 it had sprung up to the tenth as professors holden schaeberle and campbell perceived with amazement on turning the same instrument upon its place and to professor barnard it appeared two nights later not only revived but transformed into the nucleus of a planetary nebula 3 across1490 the reality of this seeming distension however at once disputed was eventually disproved it unquestionably arose from the imperfect focussing power of the telescope for rays of unusual quality1491 the rekindled nova was detected in this country by mr h corder on whose notification mr espin on august 21 examined its nearly monochromatic spectrum1492 the metamorphosis of nova cygni seemed repeated1493 the light of the new object like that of its predecessor was mainly concentrated in a vivid green band identified with the chief nebular line by copeland1494 von gothard1495 and campbell1496 the second nebular line was also represented indeed the lastnamed observer recognised nearly all the eighteen lines measured by him in the nova as characteristic of planetary nebul1497 of particular interest is the emergence in the starspectrum photographed by von gothard of an ultraviolet line originally discovered at tulse hill in the orion nebula which is also very strong in the lyra annular nebula obviously then the physical constitution of nova aurig became profoundly modified during the four months of its invisibility the spectrum of february was or appeared compound that of august was simple it could be reasonably associated only with a single lightsource many of the former brilliant lines too had vanished and been replaced by others at first inconspicuous or absent as a result the solarprominence type to which the earlier spectrum had seemed to conform was completely effaced in the later the cause of these alterations remains mysterious yet its effects continue the chromatic behaviour of the semiextinct nova when scrutinised with great refractors shows its waning light to be distinctly nebular1498 like nearly all its congeners the star is situated in the full stream of the milky way and we learn without surprise that micrometrical measures by burnham and barnard1499 failed to elicit from it any sign of parallactic shifting it is hence certain that the development of light of which the news reached the earth in december 1891 must have been on a vast scale and of ancient date nova aurig at its maximum assuredly exceeded the sun many times in brightness and its conflagration can scarcely have occurred less and may have occurred much more than a hundred years ago by means of the photographic surveys of the skies carried on in both hemispheres under professor pickerings superintendence such amazing events have been proved to be of not infrequent occurrence within six years five new stars were detected from draper memorial or chartplates by mrs fleming besides the retrospective discovery of a sixth which had rapidly burnt itself out eight years previously in perseus1500 nova norm was the immediate successor of nova aurig nova carin and nova centauri lit up in 1895 the latter in a preexistent nebula nova sagittarii and nova aquil attained brief maxima in 1898 and 1899 respectively now three out of these five stars reproduced with singular fidelity the spectrum of nova aurig they displayed the same brilliant rays shadowed invariably on their blue sides by dark ones palpably then the arrangement was systematic and significant it could not result merely from the casually directed opposite velocities of bodies meeting in space the hypothesis of stellar encounters accordingly fell to the ground and has been provided with no entire satisfactory substitute most speculators now fully recognise that motiondisplacements cannot be made to account for the doubled spectra of nov and seek recourse instead to some kind of physical agency for producing the observed effect1501 and since this is also visible in certain permanent though peculiar objectsnotably in p cygni beta lyr and eta carinthe acting cause must also evidently be permanent and inherent the new star of the new century1502 was a visual discovery dr anderson duplicated with added clat his performance of nine years back in the early morning of february 22 1901 he perceived that algol had a neighbour of nearly its own brightness which a photograph taken by mr stanley williams at brighton proved to have risen from below the twelfth magnitude within the preceding 28 hours and it was still swiftly ascending on the 23rd it outshone capella for a brief space it took rank as the premier star of the northern hemisphere a decline set in promptly but was pursued hesitatingly the light fluctuated continually over a range of a couple of magnitudes and with a close approach during some weeks to a threeday periodicity a year after the original outburst the star was still conspicuous with an operaglass the spectrum underwent amazing changes at first continuous save for fine dark lines of hydrogen and helium it unfolded within fortyeight hours a composite range of brilliant and dusky bands disposed in the usual fashion of nov these lasted until far on in march when hydrogen certainly and probably other substances as well ceased to exert any appreciable absorptive action blue emissions of the wolfrayet type then became occasionally prominent in remarkable correspondence with the varying lustre of the star1503 finally a band at lambda 3969 found by wright at lick to characterise nebular spectra1504 assumed abnormal importance and in july the nebular transformation might be said to be complete striking alterations of colour attended these spectral vicissitudes white to begin with the star soon turned deep red and its redness was visibly intensified at each of its recurring minima of light blanching however ensued upon the development of its nebulous proclivities and its surviving rays are of a steely hue all the more important investigations of nova persei were conducted by photographic means libraries of spectral plates were collected at the yerkes and lick observatories at south kensington stonyhurst and potsdam and await the more exhaustive interpretation of the future meanwhile extraordinary revelations have been supplied by immediate photographic delineation on august 22 and 23 1901 professor max wolf by long exposures with the 16inch bruce twin objectives of the knigstuhl observatory heidelberg obtained indications of a large nebula finely ramified extending southeast of the nova1505 and the entire formation came out in four hours with the yerkes 2foot reflector directed to it by mr ritchey on september 201506 it proved to be a great spiral encircling and apparently emanating from the star but if so tumultuously and under stress of catastrophic impulsions a picture obtained by mr perrine with the crossley refractor in 7h 19m on november 7 and 8 disclosed the progress of a startling change1507 comparison with the yerkes photograph showed that during the intervening 48 days four clearly identifiable condensations had become displaced all to the same extent of about 90 seconds of arc and in fairly concordant directions suggesting motion round the nova as well as away from it the velocity implied however is so prodigious as virtually to exclude the supposition of a bodily transport of matter it should be at the rate of no less than twenty thousand miles a second admitting the object to be at a distance from us corresponding to an annual parallax of onetenth of a second and actual measurements show it to be indefinitely more remote the fact of rapid variations in the nebula was reaffirmed though with less precision from yerkes photographs of november 9 and 13 mr ritchey inferring a general expansion of its southern portions1508 much further evidence must be at hand before a sane judgment can be formed as to the nature of the strange events taking place in that secluded corner of the galaxy1509 and it is highly probable that the illumination of the nebulous wreaths round the star will prove no less evanescent than the blazing of the star itself we have been compelled somewhat to anticipate our narrative as regards inquiries into the nature of nebul the excursions of opinion on the point were abruptly restricted and defined by the application to them of the spectroscope on august 29 1864 sir william huggins sifted through his prisms the rays of a bright planetary nebula in draco1510 to his infinite surprise they proved to be mainly of one colour in other words they avowed their origin from a mass of glowing vapour as to what kind of vapour it might be by which herschels conjecture of a shining fluid diffused at large throughout the cosmos was thus unexpectedly verified an answer only partially satisfactory could be afforded the conspicuous bright line of the draco nebula seemed to agree in position with one emitted by nitrogen but has since proved to be distinct from it of its two fainter companions one was unmistakably the f line of hydrogen while the other in position intermediate between the two still remains unidentified by 1868 huggins had satisfactorily examined the spectra of about seventy nebul of which onethird displayed a gaseous character1511 all of these gave the green ray fundamental to the nebular spectrum and emanating from an unknown form of matter named by sir william huggins nebulum it is associated with seven or eight hydrogen lines with three of yellow helium and with a good many of undetermined origin the absence of the crimson radiation of hydrogenperceived with difficulty only in some highly condensed objectsis an anomaly very imperfectly explained as a physiological effect connected with the extreme faintness of nebular light1512 an approximate coincidence between the chief nebular line and a fluting of magnesium having been alleged by lockyer in support of his meteoritic hypothesis of nebular constitution it became of interest to ascertain its reality the task was accomplished by sir william and lady huggins in 1889 and 18901513 and by professor keeler with the advantages of the mount hamilton apparatus and atmosphere in 1890911514 the upshot was to show a slight but sure discrepancy as to place and a marked diversity as to character between the two qualities of light the nebular ray wavelength 5007 millionths of a millimetre is slightly more refrangible than the magnesium flutingedge and it is sharp and fine with no trace of the unilateral haze necessarily clinging even to the last remnant of a banded formation planetary and annular nebul are without exception gaseous as well as those termed irregular which frequent the region of the milky way their constitution usually betrays itself to the eye by their blue or greenish colour while those yielding a continuous spectrum are of a dull white among the more remarkable of these are the wellknown nebula in andromeda and the great spiral in canes venatici and as a general rule the emissions of all such nebul as present the appearance of starclusters grown misty through excessive distance are of the same kind it would however be eminently rash to conclude thence that they are really aggregations of sunlike bodies the improbability of such an inference has been greatly enhanced by the occurrence at an interval of a quarter of a century of stellar outbursts in the midst of two of them for it is practically certain that the temporary stars were equally remote with the hazy formations they illuminated hence if the constituent particles of the latter be suns the incomparably vaster orbs by which their feeble light was wellnigh obliterated must as was argued by mr proctor have been on a scale of magnitude such as the imagination recoils from contemplating nevertheless dr scheiner not without much difficulty obtained in january 1899 spectrographic prints of the andromeda nebula indicative he thought of its being a cluster of solar stars1515 sir william and lady huggins on the other hand saw in 1897 bright intermixed with dark bands in the spectrum of the same object1516 and mr maunder conjectures all white nebul to be made up of sunlets in which the coronal element predominates while chromospheric materials assert their presence in nebul of the green variety1517 among the ascertained analogies between the stellar and nebular systems is that of variability of light on october 11 1852 mr hind discovered a small nebula in taurus chacornac observed it at marseilles in 1854 but was confounded four years later to find it vanished darrest missed it october 3 and redetected it december 29 1861 it was easily seen in 186566 but invisible in the most powerful instruments from 1877 to 18801518 barnard however made out an almost evanescent trace of it october 15 1890 with the great lick telescope1519 and saw it easily in the spring of 1895 while six months later it evaded his most diligent search1520 then again on september 28 1897 the yerkes 40inch disclosed it to him as a mere shimmer at the last limit of visibility and it came out in three diffuse patches on plates to which on december 6 and 27 1899 keeler gave prolonged exposures with the crossley reflector1521 moreover a fairly bright adjacent nebula perceived by o struve in 1868 and observed shortly afterwards by darrest has totally vanished and was most likely only a temporary apparition these are the most authentic instances of nebular variability many others have been more or less plausibly alleged1522 but professor holdens persuasion acquired from an exhaustive study of the records since 17581523 that the various parts of the orion nebula fluctuate continually in relative lustre has not been ratified by photographic evidence the case of the trifid nebula in sagittarius investigated by holden in 18771524 is less easily disposed of what is certain is that a remarkable triple star centrally situated according to the observations of both the herschels 17841833 in a dark space between the three great lobes of the nebula is now and has been since 1839 densely involved in one of them and since the hypothesis of relative motion is on many grounds inadmissible the change that has apparently taken place must be in the distribution of light one no less conspicuous was adduced by mr h c russell director of the sydney observatory1525 a particularly bright part of the great argo nebula as drawn by sir john herschel has it would seem almost totally disappeared he noticed its absence in 1871 using a 7inch telescope failed equally later on to find it with an 1112inch and his longexposure photographs show no vestige of it the same structure is missing from or scarcely traceable in a splendid picture of the nebula taken by sir david gill in twelve hours distributed over four nights in march 18921526 an immense gaseous expanse has it would seem sunk out of sight materially it is no doubt there but the radiance has left it nebul have no ascertained proper motions no genuine change of place in the heavens has yet been recorded for any one of them all equally hold aloof so far as telescopic observation shows from the busy journeyings of the stars this seeming immobility is partly an effect of vast distance nebular parallax has up to the present proved evanescent and nebular parallactic drift in response to the suns advance through space remains likewise imperceptible1527 it may hence be presumed that no nebul occur within the sphere occupied by the nearer stars but the difficulty of accurately measuring such objects must also be taken into account displacements which would be conspicuous in stars might easily escape detection in illdefined hazy masses thus the measures executed by darrest in 18571528 have not yet proved effective for their designed purpose of contributing to the future detection of proper motions some determinations made by mr burnham with the lick refractor in 18911529 will ultimately afford a more critical test he found that nearly all planetary nebul include a sharp stellar nucleus the position of which with reference to neighbouring stars could be fixed no less precisely than if it were devoid of nebulous surroundings hence the objects located by him cannot henceforward shift were it only to the extent of a small fraction of a second without the fact coming to the knowledge of astronomers the spectroscope however here as elsewhere can supplement the telescope and what it has to tell it tells at once without the necessity of waiting on time to ripen results sir william huggins made in 18741530 the earliest experiments on the radial movements of nebul but with only a negative upshot none of the six objects examined gave signs of spectral alteration and it was estimated that they must have done so had they been in course of recession from or approach towards the earth by as much as twentyfive miles a second with far more powerful appliances professor keeler renewed the attempt at lick in 189091 his success was unequivocal ten planetary nebul yielded perfectly satisfactory evidence of lineofsight motion1531 the swiftest traveller being the wellknown greenish globe in draco1532 found to be hurrying towards the earth at the rate of forty miles a second for the orion nebula a recession of about eleven miles was determined1533 the whole of which may however very well belong to the solar system itself which by its translation towards the constellation lyra is certainly leaving the great nebula pretty rapidly behind the anomaly of seeming nebular fixity has nevertheless been removed and the problem of nebular motion has begun to be solved through the demonstrated possibility of its spectroscopic investigation keelers were the first trustworthy determinations of radial motion obtained visually that the similar work on the stars begun at greenwich in 1874 and carried on for thirteen years remained comparatively unfruitful was only what might have been expected the instruments available there being altogether inadequate for the attainment of a high degree of accuracy the various obstacles in the way of securing it were overcome by the substitution of the sensitive plate for the eye airtremors are thus rendered comparatively innocuous and measurements of stellar lines displaced by motion with reference to fiducial lines from terrestrial sources photographed on the same plates can be depended upon within vastly reduced limits of error studies for the realisation of the spectrographic method were begun by dr vogel and his able assistant dr scheiner at potsdam in 1887 their preliminary results communicated to the berlin academy of sciences march 15 1888 already showed that the requirements for effective research in this important branch were at last about to be complied with an improved instrument was erected in the autumn of the same year and the fiftyone stars bright enough for determination with a refractor of 11 inches aperture were promptly taken in hand a list of their motions in the line of sight published in 18921534 was of high value both in itself and for what it promised one noteworthy inference from the data it collected was that the eye tends under unfavourable circumstances to exaggerate the linedisplacements it attempts to estimate the velocities photographically arrived at were of much smaller amounts than those visually assigned the average speed of the potsdam stars came out only 104 miles a second the quickest among them being aldebaran with a recession of thirty miles a second more lately however deslandres and campbell have determined for zeta herculis and eta cephei respectively approaching rates of fortyfour and fiftyfour miles a second the installation in 1900 of a photographic refractor 3112 inches in aperture coupled with a 20inch guiding telescope will enable dr vogel to investigate spectrographically some hundreds of stars fainter than the second magnitude and the materials thus accumulated should largely help to provide means for a definite and complete solution of the more than secular problem of the suns advance through space the solution should be complete because including a genuine determination of the suns velocity apart from assumptions of any kind m homanns attempt in 18851535 to extract some provisional information on the subject from the radial movements of visually determined stars gave a fair earnest of what might be done with materials of a better quality he arrived at a goal for the suns way shifted eastward to the constellation cygnusa result congruous with the marked tendency of recently determined apexes to collect in or near lyra and the most probable corresponding velocity seemed to be about nineteen miles a second or just that of the earth in its orbit a more elaborate investigation of the same kind based by professor campbell in 19001536 upon the motions of 280 stars determined with extreme precision suffered in completeness through lack of available data from the southern hemisphere the outcome accordingly was an apex most likely correctly placed as regards right ascension but displaced southward by some fifteen degrees the speed of twelve miles a second assigned to the solar translation approximates doubtless very closely to the truth a successful beginning was made in nebular spectrography by sir william huggins march 7 18821537 five lines in all stamped themselves upon the plate during fortyfive minutes of exposure to the rays of the strange object in orion of these four were the known visible lines and a fifth high up in the ultraviolet at wavelength 3727 has evidently peculiar relationships as yet imperfectly apprehended it is strong in the spectra of many planetaries it helped to characterise the nebular metamorphosis of nova aurig yet failed to appear in nova persei two additional hydrogen lines making six in all were photographed at tulse hill from the orion nebula in 18901538 and dr copelands detection in 18861539 of the yellow ray d3 gave the first hint of the presence of helium in this prodigious formation nor are there wanting spectroscopic indications of its physical connection with the stars visually involved in it sir william and lady huggins found a plate exposed february 5 1888 impressed with four groups of fine bright lines originating in the continuous light of two of the trapeziumstars but extending some way into the surrounding nebula1540 and dr scheiner1541 argued a wider relationship from the common possession by the nebula and the chief stars in the constellation orion of a blue line bright in the one case dark in the others since identified as a member of one of the helium series the structural unity of the stellar and nebular orders in this extensive region of the sky has also by direct photographic means been unmistakably affirmed the first promising autographic picture of the orion nebula was obtained by draper september 30 18801542 the marked approach towards a still more perfectly satisfactory result shown by his plates of march 1881 and 1882 was unhappily cut short by his death meanwhile m janssen was at work in the same field from 1881 with his accustomed success1543 but dr a ainslie common left all competitors far behind with a splendid picture taken january 30 1883 by means of an exposure of thirtyseven minutes in the focus of his 3foot silveronglass mirror1544 photography may thereby be said to have definitely assumed the office of historiographer to the nebul since this one impression embodies a mass of facts hardly to be compassed by months of labour with the pencil and affords a record of shape and relative brightness in the various parts of the stupendous object it delineates which must prove invaluable to the students of its future condition its beauty and merit were officially recognised by the award of the astronomical societys gold medal in 1884 a second picture of equal merit obtained by the same means february 28 1883 with an exposure of one hour is reproduced in the frontispiece the vignette includes two specimens of planetary photography the jupiter with the great red spot conspicuous in the southern hemisphere is by dr common it dates from september 3 1879 and was accordingly one of the earliest results with his 36inch the direct image in which imprinted itself in a fraction of a second and was subsequently enlarged on paper about twelve times the exquisite little picture of saturn was taken at paris by mm paul and prosper henry december 21 1885 with their 13inch photographic refractor the telescopic image was in this case magnified eleven times previous to being photographed an exposure of about five seconds being allowed and the total enlargement as it now appears is nineteen times a trace of the dusky ring perceptible on the original negative is lost in the print a photograph of the orion nebula taken by dr roberts in 67 minutes november 30 1886 made a striking disclosure of the extent of that prodigious object more than six times the nebulous area depicted on dr commons plates is covered by it and it plainly shows an adjacent nebula separately catalogued by messier to belong to the same vast formation this disposition to annex and appropriate has come out more strongly with every increase of photographic power plates exposed at harvard college in march 1888 with an 8inch portraitlens the same used in the preparation of the draper catalogue showed the oldestablished fishmouth nebula not only to involve the stars of the swordhandle but to be in tolerably evident connection with the most easterly of the three beltstars from which a remarkable nebulous appendage was found to proceed1545 a still more curious discovery was made by w h pickering in 18891546 photographs taken in three hours from the summit of wilsons peak in california revealed the existence of an enormous though faint spiral structure enclosing in its span of nearly seventeen degrees the entire stellar and nebulous group of the belt and sword from which it most likely although not quite traceably issues as if from a nucleus a startling glimpse is thus afforded of the cosmical importance of that strange hiatus in the heavens which excited the wonder of huygens in 1656 the inconceivable attenuation of the gaseous stuff composing it was virtually demonstrated by mr ranyard1547 in march 1885 sir howard grubb mounted for dr isaac roberts at maghull near liverpool his observatory has since been transferred to crowborough in sussex a silveronglass reflector of twenty inches aperture constructed expressly for use in celestial photography a series of nebulapictures obtained with this fine instrument have proved highly instructive both as to the structure and extent of these wonderful objects above all one of the great andromeda nebula to which an exposure of three hours was given on october 1 18881548 in it a convoluted structure replaced and rendered intelligible the anomalously rifted mass seen by bond in 18471549 the effects of annular condensation appeared to have stamped themselves upon the plate and two attendant nebul presented the aspect of satellites already separated from the parent body and presumably revolving round it the ringnebula in lyra was photographed at paris in 1886 and shortly afterwards by von gothard with a 10inch reflector1550 and he similarly depicted in 1888 the two chief spiral and other nebul1551 photographs of the lyra nebula taken at algiers in 18901552 and at the vatican observatory in 18921553 were remarkable for the strong development of a central star difficult of telescopic discernment but evidently of primary importance to the annular structure around the uses of photography in celestial investigations become every year more manifold and more apparent the earliest chemical starpictures were those of castor and vega obtained with the cambridge refractor in 1850 by whipple of boston under the direction of w c bond doublestar photography was inaugurated under the auspices of g p bond april 27 1857 with an impression obtained in eight seconds of mizar the middle star in the handle of the plough a series of measures from sixtytwo similar images gave the distance and positionangle of its companion with about the same accuracy attainable by ordinary micrometrical operations and the method and upshot of these novel experiments were described in three papers remarkably forecasting the purposes to be served by stellar photography1554 the matter next fell into the able hands of rutherfurd who completed in 1864 a fine object glass of 1112 inches corrected for the ultraviolet rays consequently useless for visual purposes the sacrifice was recompensed by conspicuous success a set of measurements from his photographs of nearly fifty stars in the pleiades and their comparison with bessels places enabled dr gould to announce in 1866 that during the intervening third of a century no changes of importance had occurred in their relative positions1555 and mr harold jacoby1556 similarly ascertained the fixity of seventyfive of rutherfurds atlantids between the epoch 1873 and that of dr elkins heliometric triangulation of the cluster in 18861557 extending the interval to twentyseven years by subsequent comparisons with plates taken at lick september 27 19001558 positive however as well as negative results have ensued from the application of modern methods to that antique group on october 19 1859 wilhelm tempel a saxon peasant by origin later a skilled engraver discovered with a small telescope bought out of his scanty savings an elliptical nebulosity stretching far to the southward from the star merope it attracted the attention of many observers but was so often missed owing to its extreme susceptibility to adverse atmospheric influences as to rouse unfounded suspicions of its variability the detection of this evasive object gave a hint barely intelligible at the time of further revelations of the same kind by more cogent means a splendid photograph of 1421 stars in the pleiades taken by the mm henry with three hours exposure november 16 1885 showed one of the brightest of them to have a small spiral nebula somewhat resembling a stronglycurved comets tail attached to it the reappearance of this strange appurtenance on three subsequent plates left no doubt of its real existence visually attested at pulkowa february 5 1886 by one of the first observations made with the 30inch equatoreal1559 much smaller apertures however sufficed to disclose the maia nebula once it was known to be there not only did it appear greatly extended in the vienna 27inch1560 but mm perrotin and thollon saw it with the nice 15inch and m kammermann of geneva employing special precautions with a refractor of only ten inches aperture1561 the advantage derived by him for bringing it into view from the insertion into the eyepiece of a uranium film gives with its photographic intensity valid proof that a large proportion of the light of this remarkable object is of the ultraviolet kind the beginning thus made was quickly followed up a picture of the pleiades procured at maghull in eightynine minutes october 23 1886 revealed nebulous surroundings to no less than four leading stars of the group namely alcyone electra merope and maia and a second impression taken in three hours on the following night showed further that the nebulosity extends in streamers and fleecy masses till it seems almost to fill the spaces between the stars and to extend far beyond them1562 the coherence of the entire mixed structure was moreover placed beyond doubt by the visibly close relationship of the stars to the nebulous formations surrounding them in dr robertss striking pictures thus goldschmidts notion that all the clustered pleiades constitute as it were a second orion trapezium in the midst of a huge formation of which tempels nebula is but a fragment1563 has been to some extent verified yet it seemed fantastic enough in 1863 then in 1888 the mm henry gave exposures of four hours each to several plates which exhibited on development some new features of the entangled nebul the most curious of these was the linking together of stars by nebulous chains in one case seven aligned stars appeared strung on a silvery filament like beads on a rosary1564 the rows of stars so often noticed in the sky may then be concluded to have more than an imaginary existence of the 2326 stars recorded in these pictures a couple of hundred among the brightest can at the outside be reckoned as genuine pleiades the great majority were relegated by pickerings1565 and stratonoffs1566 counts of the stellar populace in and near the cluster to the position of outsiders from it they are undistinguished denizens of the abysmal background upon which it is projected investigations of its condition were carried a stage further by barnard on november 14 18901567 he discovered visually with the lick refractor a close nebulous satellite to merope photographs of which were obtained by keeler in 18981568 it appears in them of a rudely pentagonal shape a prominent angle being directed towards the adjacent star finally an exposure of ten hours made by barnard with the willard lens indicated the singular fact that the entire group is embedded in a nebulous matrix streaky outliers of which blur a wide surface of the celestial vault1569 the artists conviction of the reality of what his picture showed was confirmed by negatives obtained by bailey at arequipa in 1897 and by h c wilson at northfield minnesota in 18981570 with the ealing 3foot reflector sold by dr common to mr crossley and by him presented to the lick observatory professor keeler took in 1899 a series of beautiful and instructive nebula1571 photographs one of the trifid may be singled out as of particular excellence an astonishing multitude of new nebul were revealed by trialexposures with this instrument a conservative estimate gave 120000 as the number coming within its scope moreover the majority of those actually recorded were of an unmistakable spiral character and they included most of sir john herschels double nebul previously supposed to exemplify the primitive history of binary stellar systems1572 dr max wolfs explorations with a 6inch voigtlnder lens in 1901 emphatically reaffirmed the inexhaustible wealth of the nebular heavens in one restricted region midway between prsepe and the milky way he located 135 nebul where only three had until then been catalogued and he counted 108 such objects clustering round the star 31 com berenices1573 and so closely that all might be occulted together by the moon the general photographic catalogue of nebul which dr wolf has begun to prepare1574 will thus be a most voluminous work the history of celestial photography at the cape of good hope began with the appearance of the great comet of 1882 no special apparatus was at hand so sir david gill called in the services of a local artist mr allis of mowbray with whose camera strapped to the observatory equatoreal pictures of conspicuous merit were obtained but their particular distinction lay in the multitude of stars begemming the background see plate iii the sight of them at once opened to the royal astronomer a new prospect he had already formed the project of extending argelanders durchmusterung from the point where it was left by schnfeld to the southern pole and his ideas regarding the means of carrying it into execution crystallised at the needle touch of the cometary experiments he resolved to employ photography for the purpose the exposure of plates was accordingly begun under the care of mr ray woods in 1885 and in less than six years the sky from 19 of south latitude to the pole had been covered in duplicate their measurement and the preparation of a catalogue of the stars imprinted upon them were generously undertaken by professor kapteyn and his laborious task has at length been successfully completed the publication in 1900 of the third and concluding volume of the cape photographic durchmusterung1575 placed at the disposal of astronomers a photographic census of the heavens fuller and surer than the corresponding visual enumeration executed at bonn it includes 454875 stars nearly to the tenth magnitude and their positions are reliable to about one second of arc the production of this important work was thus a result of the cape cometpictures yet not the most momentous one they turned the scale in favour of recourse to the camera when the mm henry encountered in their continuation of chacornacs halffinished enterprise of ecliptical charting sections of the milky way defying the enumerating efforts of eye and hand the perfect success of some preliminary experiments made with an instrument constructed by them expressly for the purpose was announced to the academy of sciences at paris may 2 1885 by its means stars estimated as of the sixteenth magnitude clearly recorded their presence and their places and the enormous increase of knowledge involved may be judged of from the fact that in a space of the milky way in cygnus 2 15 by 3 where 170 stars had been mapped by the old laborious method about five thousand stamped their images on a single henry plate these results suggested the grand undertaking of a general photographic survey of the heavens and gills proposal june 4 1886 of an international congress for the purpose of setting it on foot was received with acclamation and promptly acted upon fiftysix delegates of seventeen different nationalities met in paris april 16 1887 under the presidentship of admiral mouchez to discuss measures and organise action they resolved upon the construction of a photographic chart of the whole heavens comprising stars of a fourteenth magnitude to the surmised number of twenty millions to be supplemented by a catalogue framed from plates of comparatively short exposure giving start to the eleventh magnitude these will probably amount to about one million and a quarter for procuring both sets of plates instruments were constructed precisely similar to that of the mm henry which is a photographic refractor thirteen inches in aperture and eleven feet focus attached to a guiding telescope of eleven inches aperture corrected of course for the visual rays each place covers an area of four square degrees and since the series must be duplicated to prevent mistakes about 22000 plates will be needed for the chart alone the task of preparing them was apportioned among eighteen observatories scattered over the globe from mexico to melbourne but three in south america having become disabled or inert were replaced in 1900 by those at cordoba montevideo and perth western australia meanwhile the publication of results has begun and is likely to continue for at least a quarter of a century the first volume of measures from the potsdam catalogueplates was issued in 1899 and its successors if on the same scale must number nearly 400 moreover ninetysix heliogravure enlargements from the paris chartplates distributed in the same year supplied a basis for the calculation that the entire atlas of the sky composed of similar sheets will form a pile thirty feet high and two tons in weight1576 it will however possess an incalculable scientific value for millions of stars can be determined by its means from their imprinted images with an accuracy comparable to that attainable by direct meridian observations one of the most ardent promoters of the scheme it may be expected to realise was admiral mouchez the successor of leverrier in the direction of the paris observatory but it was not granted to him to see the fruition of his efforts he died suddenly june 25 18921577 although not an astronomer by profession he had been singularly successful in pushing forward the cause of the science he loved while his genial and open nature won for him wide personal regard he was replaced by m tisserand whose mathematical eminence fitted him to continue the traditions of delaunay and leverrier but his career too was unhappily cut short by an unforeseen death on october 20 1896 and the more eminent among the many qualifications of his successor m maurice loewy are of the practical kind the sublime problem of the construction of the heavens has not been neglected amid the multiplicity of tasks imposed upon the cultivators of astronomy by its rapid development but data of a far higher order of precision and indefinitely greater in amount than those at the disposal of herschel or struve must be accumulated before any definite conclusions on the subject are possible the first organised effort towards realising this desideratum was made by the german astronomical society in 1865 two years after its foundation at heidelberg the original programme consisted in the exact determination of the places of all argelanders stars to the ninth magnitude exclusive of the polar zone from the reobservation of which say in the year 1950 astronomers of two generations hence may gather a vast store of knowledgedirectly of the apparent motions indirectly of the mutual relations binding together the suns and systems of space thirteen observatories in europe and america joined in the work now virtually terminated its scope was after its inception widened to include southern zones as far as the tropic of capricorn this having been rendered feasible by schnfelds extension 18751885 of argelanders survey thirty thousand additional stars thus taken in were allotted in zones to five observatories another important undertaking of the same class is the reobservation of the 47300 stars in lalandes histoire cleste begun under arago in 1855 its upshot has been the publication of the great paris catalogue issued in eight volumes between 1887 and 1902 from a careful study of their secular changes in position m bossert has already derived the proper motions of a couple of thousand out of nearly fifty thousand stars enumerated in it through dr goulds unceasing labours during his fifteen years residence at cordoba a detailed acquaintance with southern stars was brought about his uranometria argentina 1879 enumerates the magnitudes of 8198 out of 10649 stars visible to the naked eye under those transparent skies 33160 down to 912 magnitude are embraced in his zones and the argentine general catalogue of 32468 southern stars was published in 1886 valuable work of the same kind has been done at the leander mccormick observatory virginia by professor o stone while the late redcliffe observers cape catalogue for 1880 affords inestimable aid to the practical astronomer south of the line which has been reinforced with several publications issued by the present astronomer royal at the cape moreover the gigantic task entered upon in 1860 by dr c h f peters director of the litchfield observatory clinton ny and of which a large instalment was finished in 1882 deserves honourable mention it was nothing less than to map all stars down to and even below the fourteenth magnitude situated within 30 on either side of the ecliptic and so to afford a sure basis for drawing conclusions with respect to the changes going on in the starry heavens1578 it is tolerably safe to predict that no work of its kind and for its purpose will ever again be undertaken in a small part of one night stars can now be got to register themselves more numerously and more accurately than by the eye and hand of the most skilled observer in the course of a year fundamental catalogues constructed by the old timehonoured method will continue to furnish indispensable startingpoints for measurement and one of especial excellence was published by professor newcomb in 18991579 but the relative places of the small crowded starsthe sidereal greek hoi pholloiwill henceforth be derived from their autographic statements on the sensitive plate even the secondary purposethat of asteroidal discoveryserved by detailed stellar enumeration is more surely attained by photography than by laborious visual comparison for planetary movement betrays itself in a comparatively short time by turning the imprinted image of the object affected by it from a dot into a trail in the arduous matter of determining star distances progress has been steady and bids fair to become rapidly accelerated together yet independently gill and elkin carried out at the cape observatory in 188283 an investigation of remarkable accuracy into the parallaxes of nine southern stars one of these was the famous alpha centauri the distance of which from the earth was ascertained to be just onethird greater than henderson had made it the parallax of sirius on the other hand was doubled or its distance halved while canopus proved to be quite immeasurably remotea circumstance which considering that among all the stellar multitude it is outshone only by the radiant dogstar gives a stupendous idea of its real splendour and dimensions inquiries of this kind were for some years successfully pursued at the observatory of dunsink near dublin annual perspective displacements were by dr brnnow detected in several stars and in others remeasured with a care which inspired just confidence his parallax for alpha lyr 013 was authentic though slightly too large elkins final results gave pi 0082 and the received value for the parallax of the swiftly travelling star groombridge 1830 scarcely differs from that arrived at by him in 1871 pi 009 his successor as astronomerroyal for ireland sir robert stawell ball now lowndean professor of astronomy in the university of cambridge has done good service in the same department for besides verifying approximately struves parallax of half a second of arc for 61 cygni he refuted in 1811 by a sweeping search for socalled large parallaxes certain baseless conjectures of comparative nearness to the earth in the case of red and temporary stars1580 of 450 objects thus cursorily examined only one star of the seventh magnitude numbered 1618 in groombridges circumpolar catalogue gave signs of measurable vicinity similarly a reconnaissance among rapidly moving stars lately made by dr chase with the yale heliometer1581 yielded no really large and only eight appreciable parallaxes among the 92 subjects of his experiments a second campaign in stellar parallax was undertaken by gill and elkin in 1887 but this time the two observers were in opposite hemispheres both used heliometers dr elkin had charge of the fine instrument then recently erected in yale college observatory sir david gill employed one of seven inches just constructed under his directions in firstrate style by the repsolds of hamburg dr elkin completed in 1888 his share of the more immediate joint programme which consisted in the determination by direct measurement of the average parallax of stars of the first magnitude it came out for the ten northern luminaries after several revisions 0098 equivalent to a lightjourney of thirtythree years the deviations from this average were indeed exceedingly wide two of the stars betelgeux and alpha cygni gave no certain sign of any perspective shifting of the rest procyon with a parallax of 0334 proved the nearest to our system at the mean distance concluded for these ten brilliant stars the sun would show as of only fifth magnitude hence it claims a very subordinate rank among the suns of space sir david gills definitive results were published in 19001582 as the average parallax of the eleven brightest stars in the southern hemisphere they gave 013 a value enhanced by the exceptional proximity of alpha centauri yet four of these conspicuous objectscanopus rigel spica and beta crucisgave no sign of perspective response to the annual change in our point of view the list included eleven fainter stars with notable proper motions and most of these proved to have fairly large parallaxes among other valuable contributions to this difficult branch may be instanced bruno peters measurements of eleven stars with the leipzig heliometer 1887921583 kapteyns application of the method by differences in right ascension to fifteen stars observed on the meridian 1885891584 and flints more recent similar determinations at madison wisconsin1585 the great merit of having rendered photography available for the sounding of the celestial depths belongs to professor pritchard the subject of his initial experiment was 61 cygni from measurements of 200 negatives taken in 1886 he derived for that classic star a parallax of 0438 in satisfactory agreement with balls of 0468 a detailed examination convinced the astronomerroyal of its superior accuracy to bessels result with the heliometer the savilian professor carried out his project of determining all second magnitude stars to the number of about thirty1586 conveniently observable at oxford obtaining as the general outcome of the research an average parallax of 0056 for objects of that rank but this value though in itself probable cannot be accepted as authoritative in view of certain inaccuracies in the work adverted to by jacoby1587 hermann davis and gill the method has nevertheless very large capabilities professor kapteyn showed in 18891588 the practicability of deriving parallaxes wholesale from plates exposed at due intervals and applied his system in 1900 with encouraging success to a group of 248 stars1589 the apparent absence of spurious shiftings justified the proposal to follow up the completion of the astrographic chart with the initiation of a photographic parallax durchmusterung observers of double stars are among the most meritorious and need to be among the most patient and painstaking workers in sidereal astronomy they are scarcely as numerous as could be wished dr doberck distinguished as a computer of stellar orbits complained in 18821590 that data sufficient for the purpose had not been collected for above 30 or 40 binaries out of between five and six hundred certainly or probably within reach the progress since made is illustrated by mr gores useful catalogue of computed binaries including fiftynine entries presented to the royal irish academy june 9 18901591 few have done more towards supplying the deficiency of materials than the late baron ercole dembowski of milan he devoted the last thirty years of his life which came to an end january 19 1881 to the revision of the dorpat catalogue and left behind him a store of micrometrical measures as numerous as they are precise of living observers in this branch mr s w burnham is beyond question the foremost while pursuing legal avocations at chicago he diverted his scanty leisure by exploring the skies with a 6inch telescope mounted in his backyard and had discovered in may 1882 one thousand close and mostly very difficult double stars1592 summoned as chief assistant to the new lick observatory in 1888 he resumed the work of his predilection with the 36inch and 12inch refractors of that establishment but although devoting most of his attention to muchneeded remeasurements of known pairs he incidentally divided no less than 274 stars the majority of which lay beyond the resolving power of less keen and effectually aided eyesight one of his many interesting discoveries was that of a minute companion to alpha urs majoris the first pointer which already gives unmistakable signs of orbital movement round the shining orb it is attached to another pair kappa pegasi detected in 1880 was found in 1892 to have more than completed a circuit in the interim1593 its period of a little over eleven years is the shortest attributable to a visible binary system except that of delta equulei provisionally determined by professor hussey in 1900 at 57 years1594 and indicated by spectroscopic evidence to be of uncommon brevity1595 burnhams catalogue of 1290 double stars discovered by him from 1871 to 18991596 is a record of unprecedented interest nearly all the 690 pairs included in it 2 or less than 2 apart must be physically connected and they offer a practically unlimited field for investigation while the notes diagrams and orbits appended profusely to the various entries are eminently helpful to students and computers the author is continuing his researches at the yerkes observatory having quitted the lick establishment in 1892 the first complete enrolment of southern double stars was made by mr r t a innes in 18991597 the couples enumerated twentyone per cent of which are separated by less than one second of arc are 2140 in number they include 305 discovered by himself dr see gathered a rich harvest of nearly 500 new southern pairs with the lowell 24inch refractor in 18971598 professor houghs discoveries in more northerly zones amount to 6231599 husseys at lick to 350 and aitkens already to over 300 there is as yet no certainty that the stars of 61 cygni form a true binary combination mr burnham indeed holds them to be in course of definitive separation and professor halls observations at washington 1879 to 1891 although favouring their physical connection are far from decisive on the point1600 dr wilsing from certain anomalous displacements of their photographed images concluded in 18931601 the presence of an invisible third member of the system revolving in a period of twentytwo months but the effects noticed by him were probably illusory important series of doublestar observations were made by perrotin at nice in 188341602 by hall with the 26inch washington equatoreal 1874 to 18911603 by schiaparelli from 1875 onward by glasenapp o stone leavenworth seabroke and many besides finally professor husseys revision of the pulkowa catalogue1604 is a work of the teres atque rotundus kind which leaves little or nothing to be desired the methods employed in doublestar determinations remain at the beginning of the twentieth century essentially unchanged the camera has scarcely encroached upon this part of the micrometers domain1605 a research of striking merit into the origin of binary stars was published in 1892 by dr t j j see in the form of an inaugural dissertation for his doctors degree in the university of berlin the main result was to show the powerful effects of tidal friction in prescribing the course of their development from double nebul revolving almost in contact to double suns far apart yet inseparable the high eccentricities of their eventual orbits were shown to result necessarily from this mode of action which must operate with enormous strength on closely conjoined nearly equal masses such as the rapidly revolving pairs disclosed by the spectroscope that these are still in an early stage of their lifehistory is probable in itself and is reaffirmed by the exceedingly small density indicated for eclipsing stars by the ratio of phaseduration to period stellar photometry initiated by the elder herschel and provided with exact methods by his son at the cape by steinheil and seidel at munich has of late years assumed the importance of a separate department of astronomical research two monumental works on the subject compiled on opposite sides of the atlantic were thus appropriately coupled in the bestowal of the royal astronomical societys gold medal in 1886 harvard college observatory led the way under the able direction of professor e c pickering his photometric catalogue of 4260 stars1606 constructed from nearly 95000 observations of lightintensity during the years 187982 constitutes a record of incalculable value for the detection and estimation of stellar variability it was succeeded in 1885 by professor pritchards uranometria nova oxoniensis including photometric determinations of the magnitude of all nakedeye stars from the pole to ten degrees south of the equator to the number of 2784 the instrument employed was the wedge photometer which measures brightness by resistance to extinction a wedge of neutraltint glass accurately divided to scale is placed in the path of the stellar rays when the thickness of it they have power to traverse furnishes a criterion of their intensity professor pickerings meridian photometer on the other hand is based upon zllners principle of equalization effected by a polarising apparatus after all however as professor pritchard observed the eye is the real photometer and its judgment can only be valid over a limited range1607 absolute uniformity then in estimates made by various means under varying conditions and by different observers is not to be looked for and it is satisfactory to find substantial agreement attainable and attained only in an insignificant fraction of the stars common to the harvard and oxford catalogues discordances are found exceeding onethird of a magnitude a large proportion 71 per cent agree within onefourth a considerable minority 31 per cent within onetenth of a magnitude1608 the harvard photometry was extended on the same scale to the opposite pole in a catalogue of the magnitudes of 7922 southern stars1609 founded on professor baileys observations in peru 188991 measurements still more comprehensive were subsequently executed at the primary establishment with a meridian photometer of augmented power the surprising number of 473216 settings were made during the years 189198 nearly all by the indefatigable director himself and they afforded materials for a photometric durchmusterung published in 1901 including all stars to 75 magnitude north of declination 401610 a photometric zone 20 wide has for some time been in course of observation at potsdam by mm mller and kempf the instrument employed by them is constructed on the polarising principle as adapted by zllner photographic photometry has meanwhile risen to an importance if anything exceeding that of visual photometry for the usefulness of the great international starchart now being prepared would be gravely compromised by systematic mistakes regarding the magnitudes of the stars registered upon it no entirely trustworthy means of determining them have however yet been found there is no certainty as to the relative times of exposure needed to get images of stars representative of successive photometric ranks all that can be done is to measure the proportionate diameters of such images and to infer by the application of a law learned from experience the varied intensities of light to which they correspond the law is indeed neither simple nor constant different investigators have arrived at different formul which being purely empirical vary their nature with the conditions of experiment probably the best expedient for overcoming the difficulty is that devised by pickering of simultaneously photographing a star and its secondary image reduced in brightness by a known amount1611 the results of its use will be exhibited in a catalogue of 40000 stars to the tenth magnitude one for each square degree of the heavens a photographic photometry of all the lucid stars modelled on the visual photometry of 1884 is promised from the same copious source of novelties the magnitudes of the stars in the draper catalogue were determined so to speak spectrographically the quantity measured in all cases was the intensity of the hydrogen line near g by the employment of this definite and uniform test results were obtained of special value indeed but in strong disaccord with those given by less exclusive determinations thought meantime cannot be held aloof from the great subject upon the future illustration of which so much patient industry is being expended nor are partial glimpses denied to us of relations fully discoverable perhaps only through centuries of toil some important points in cosmical economy have indeed become quite clear within the last fifty years and scarcely any longer admit of a difference of opinion one of these is that of the true status of nebul this was virtually settled by sir j herschels description in 1847 of the structure of the magellanic clouds but it was not until whewell in 1853 and herbert spencer in 18581612 enforced the conclusions necessarily to be derived therefrom that the conception of the nebul as remote galaxies which lord rosses resolution of many into stellar points had appeared to support began to withdraw into the region of discarded and halfforgotten speculations in the nubecul as whewell insisted1613 there coexist in a limited compass and in indiscriminate position stars clusters of stars nebul regular and irregular and nebulous streaks and patches these then are different kinds of things in themselves not merely different to us there are such things as nebul side by side with stars and with clusters of stars nebulous matter resolvable occurs close to nebulous matter irresolvable this argument from coexistence in nearly the same region of space reiterated and reinforced with others by mr spencer was urged with his accustomed force and freshness by mr proctor it is unanswerable there is no maintaining nebul to be simply remote worlds of stars in the face of an agglomeration like the nubecula major containing in its certainly capacious bosom both stars and nebul add the facts that a considerable proportion of these perplexing objects are gaseous and that an intimate relation obviously subsists between the mode of their scattering and the lie of the milky way and it becomes impossible to resist the conclusion that both nebular and stellar systems are parts of a single scheme1614 as to the stars themselves the presumption of their approximate uniformity in size and brightness has been effectually dissipated differences of distance can no longer be invoked to account for dissimilarity in lustre minute orbs altogether invisible without optical aid are found to be indefinitely nearer to us than such radiant objects as canopus betelgeux or rigel moreover intensity of light is perceived to be a very imperfect index to real magnitude brilliant suns are swayed from their course by the attractive power of massive yet faintly luminous companions and suffer eclipse from obscure interpositions besides effective lustre is now known to depend no less upon the qualities of the investing atmosphere than upon the extent and radiative power of the stellar surface red stars must be far larger in proportion to the light diffused by them than white or yellow stars1615 there can be no doubt that our sun would at least double its brightness were the absorption suffered by its rays to be reduced to the sirian standard and on the other hand that it would lose half its present efficiency as a lightsource if the atmosphere partially veiling its splendours were rendered as dense as that of aldebaran thus variety of all kinds is seen to abound in the heavens and it must be admitted that the consequent insecurity of all hypotheses as to the relative distances of individual stars singularly complicates the question of their allocation in space nevertheless something has been learnt even on that point and the tendency of modern research is on the whole strongly confirmatory of the views expressed by herschel in 1802 he then no longer regarded the milky way as the mere visual effect of an enormously extended stratum of stars but as an actual aggregation highly irregular in structure made up of stellar clouds and groups and nodosities all the facts since ascertained fit in with this conception to which proctor added arguments favouring the view since adopted by barnard1616 and easton1617 that the stars forming the galactic stream are not only situated more closely together but are also really as well as apparently of smaller dimensions than the lucid orbs studding our skies by the laborious process of isographically charting the whole of argelanders 324000 stars he brought out in 18711618 signs of relationship between the distribution of the brighter stars and the complex branchings of the milky way which has been stamped as authentic by newcombs recent statistical inquiries1619 there is besides a marked condensation of stars especially in the southern hemisphere towards a great circle inclined some twenty degrees to the galactic plane and these were supposed by gould to form with the sun a subordinate cluster of which the components are seen projected upon the sky as a zone of stellar brilliants1620 the zone has however galactic rather than solar affinities and represents perhaps not a group but a stream the idea is gaining ground that the milky way is designed in its main outlines on a spiral pattern and that its various branches and sections are consequently situated at very different distances from ourselves proctor gave a preliminarily interpretation of their complexities on this principle and easton of rotterdam1621 has renewed the attempt with better success a most suggestive delineation of the milky way completed in 1889 after five years of labour by dr otto boedicker lord rosses astronomer at parsonstown was published by lithography in 1892 it showed a curiously intricate structure composed of dimly luminous streams and shreds and patches intermixed with dark gaps and channels ramifications from the main trunk ran out towards the andromeda nebula and the beehive cluster in cancer involved the pleiades and hyades and winding round the constellation of orion just attained the swordhandle nebula the last delicate touches had scarcely been put to the picture when the laborious eyeandhand method was in this quarter as already in so many others superseded by a more expeditious process professor barnard took the first photographs ever secured of the true milky way july 28 august 1 and 2 1889 at the lick observatory special conditions were required for success above all a wide field and a strong lightgrasp both complied with through the use of a 6inch portraitlens even thus the sensitive plate needed some hours to pick out the exceedingly faint stars collected in the galactic clouds these cannot be photographed under the nebulous aspect they wear to the eye the camera takes note of their real nature and registers their constituent stars rank by rank hence the difficulty of disclosing them in the photographs made with the 6inch portraitlens professor barnard wrote besides myriads of stars there are shown for the first time the vast and wonderful cloudforms with all their remarkable structure of lanes holes and black gaps and sprays of stars they present to us these forms in all their delicacy and beauty as no eye or telescope can ever hope to see them1622 in plate vi one of these strange galactic landscapes is reproduced it occurs in the bow of sagittarius not far from the trifid nebula where the aggregations of the milky way are more than usually varied and characteristic one of their distinctive features comes out with particular prominence it will be noticed that the bright mass near the centre of the plate is tunnelled with dark holes and furrowed by dusky lanes such interruptions recur perpetually in the milky way they are exemplified on the largest scale in the great rift dividing it into two branches all the way from cygnus to crux and they are reproduced in miniature in many clusters plate vi illustration region of the milky way in sagittariusshowing a double black aperture photographed by professor e e barnard mr h c russell at sydney in 1890 successfully imitated professor barnards example1623 his photographs of the southern milky way have many points of interest they show the great rift black to the eye yet densely starstrewn to the perception of the chemical retina while the coalsack appears absolutely dark only in its northern portion his most remarkable discovery however was that of the spiral character of the two nubecul with an effective exposure of four and a half hours the greater cloud came out as a complex spiral with two centres while the similar conformation of its minor companion developed only after eight hours of persistent actinic action the revelation is full of significance scarcely less so although after a different fashion is the disclosure on plates exposed by dr max wolf with a 5inch lens in june 1891 of a vastly extended nebula bringing some of the leading stars in cygnus into apparently organic connection with the piles of galactic stardust likewise involved by it1624 barnard has similarly found great tracts of the milky way to be photographically nebulous and the conclusion seems inevitable that we see in it a prodigious mixed system resembling that of the pleiades in point of composition though differing widely from it in plan of structure of corroborative testimony moreover is the discovery independently resulting from gills and pickerings photographic reviews that stars of the first type of spectrum largely prevail in the galactic zone of the heavens1625 with approach to that zone kapteyn noticed a steady growth of actinic intensity relative to visual brightness in the stars depicted on the cape durchmusterung plates1626 in other words stellar light is in the milky way bluer than elsewhere and the reality of the primitive character hence to be inferred for the entire structure was in a manner certified by mr mccleans observation that helium starsthe supposed immediate products of nebulous mattercrowd towards its medial plane the first step towards the unravelment of the tangled web of stellar movements was taken when herschel established the reality and indicated the direction of the suns journey but the gradual shifting backward of the whole of the celestial scenery amid which we advance accounts for only a part of the observed displacements the stars have motions of their own besides those reflected upon them from ours all attempts however to grasp the general scheme of these motions have hitherto failed yet they have not remained wholly fruitless the community of slow movement in taurus upon which mdler based his famous theory has proved to be a fact and one of very extended significance in 1870 mr proctor undertook to chart down the directions and proportionate amounts of about 1600 proper motions as determined by messrs stone and main with the result of bringing to light the remarkable phenomenon termed by him stardrift1627 quite unmistakably large groups of stars otherwise apparently disconnected were seen to be in progress together in the same direction and at the same rate across the sky an example of this kind of unanimity was alleged by him in the five intermediate stars of the plough and that the agreement in thwartwise motion is no casual one is practically demonstrated by the concordant radial velocities determined at potsdam for four out of the five objects in question all of these approach the earth at the rate of about eighteen miles a second and the fifth and faintest delta urs though not yet measured may be held to share their advance one of them moreover zeta urs alias mizar carries with it three other starsalcor the arab rider of the horse visible to the naked eye besides a telescopic and a spectroscopic attendant so that the group may be

to the marching squadron a total extent of at least fourteen times the distance from the sun to alpha centauri while implying for its brightest membereta urs majoristhe lustre of six hundred suns the organising principle of this grand scheme must long remain mysterious it is no solitary example particular association indeedas was surmised by michell far back in the eighteenth centuryappears to be the rule rather than an exception in the sidereal system stars are bound together by twos by threes by dozens by hundreds our own sun is perhaps not exempt from this gregarious tendency yet the search for its companions has up to the present been unavailing goulds cluster1629 seems remote and intangible kapteyns collection of solar stars proved to have been a creation of erroneous data and was abolished by his unrelenting industry rather we appear to have secured a compartment to ourselves for our long journey through space a practical certainty has at any rate been gained that whatever aggregation holds the sun as a constituent is of a far looser build than the pleiades or prsepe of all such majestic communities the laws and revolutions remain as yet inaccessible to inquiry centuries may elapse before even a rudimentary acquaintance with them begins to develop while the economy of the higher order of association which we must reasonably believe that they unite to compose

of research comparing the methods now available for astronomical inquiries with those in use forty years ago we are at once struck with the fact that they have multiplied the telescope has been supplemented by the spectroscope and the photographic camera now this really involves a whole world of change it means that astronomy has left the place where she dwelt apart in rapt union with mathematics indifferent to all things on earth save only to those mechanical improvements which should aid her to penetrate further into the heavens and has descended into the forum of human knowledge at once a suppliant and a patron alternately invoking help from and promising it to each of the sciences and patiently waiting upon the advances of all the science of the heavenly bodies has in a word become a branch of terrestrial physics or rather a higher kind of integration of all their results it has however this leading peculiarity that the materials for the whole of its inquiries are telescopically furnished they are such as come very imperfectly or not at all within the cognisance of the unarmed eye spectroscopic and photographic apparatus are simply additions to the telescope they do not supersede or render it of less importance on the contrary the efficacy of their action depends primarily upon the optical qualities of the instruments they are attached to hence the development to their fullest extent of the powers of the telescope is of vital moment to the progress of modern physical astronomy while the older mathematical astronomy could afford to remain comparatively indifferent to it the colossal rosse reflector still marks as to size the ne plus ultra of performance in that line a mirror four feet in diameter was however sent out to melbourne by the late thomas grubb of dublin in 1870 this is mounted in the cassegrainian manner so that the observer looks straight through it towards the object viewed of which he really sees a twicereflected image the dustladen atmosphere of melbourne is said to impede very seriously the usefulness of this originally fine instrument it may be doubted whether so large a spectrum will ever again be constructed a new material for the mirrors of reflecting telescopes proposed by steinheil in 1856 and independently by foucault in 18571630 has in a great measure superseded the use of a metallic alloy this is glass upon which a thin film of silver has been deposited by a chemical process originally invented by liebig it gives a peculiarly brilliant reflective surface throwing back more light than a metallic mirror of the same area in the proportion of about sixteen to nine resilvering too involves much less risk and trouble than repolishing a speculum the first use of this plan on a large scale was in an instrument of thirtysix inches aperture finished by calver for dr common in 1879 to its excellent qualities turned to account with rare skill his triumphs in celestial photography are mainly due a more daring experiment was the construction and mounting by dr common himself of a 5foot reflector but the first glass disc ordered from france for the purpose proved radically defective when figured polished and silvered towards the close of 1888 it gave elliptical instead of circular starimages1631 a new one had to be procured and was ready for astronomical use in 1891 the satisfactory nature of its performance is vouched for by the observations made with it upon jupiters new satellite in december 1892 this instrument to which a newtonian form has been given had no rival in respect of lightconcentration at the time when it was built it has now twothe paris 50inch refractor and the yerkes 5foot reflector it is however in the construction of refracting telescopes that the most conspicuous advances have recently been made the harvard college 15inch achromatic was mounted and ready for work in june 1847 a similar instrument had already for some years been in its place at pulkowa it was long before the possibility of surpassing these masterpieces of german skill presented itself to any optician for fifteen years it seemed as if a line had been drawn just there it was first transgressed in america a portraitpainter of cambridgeport massachusetts named alvan clark had for some time amused his leisure with grinding lenses the singular excellence of which was discovered in england by mr dawes in 18531632 seven years passed and then an order came from the university of mississippi for an objectglass of the unexampled size of eighteen inches an experimental glance through it to test its definition resulted as we have seen in the detection of the companion of sirius january 31 1862 it never reached its destination in the south war troubles supervened and it was eventually sent to chicago where it served professor hough in his investigations of jupiter and mr burnham in his scrutiny of double stars the next step was an even longer one and it was again taken by a selftaught optician thomas cooke the son of a shoemaker at allerthorpe in the east riding of yorkshire mr newall of gateshead ordered from him in 1863 a 25inch objectglass it was finished early in 1868 but at the cost of shortening the life of its maker who died october 19 1868 before the giant refractor he had toiled at for five years was completely mounted this instrument the fine qualities of which had long been neutralized by an unfavourable situation was presented by mr newall to the university of cambridge a few weeks before his death april 21 1889 under the care of his son mr frank newall it has proved highly efficient in the delicate work of measuring stellar radial motions close upon its construction followed that of the washington 26inch for which twenty thousand dollars were paid to alvan clark the most illustrious point in its career entered upon in 1873 has been the discovery of the satellites of mars once known to be there these were indeed found to be perceptible with very moderate optical means mr wentworth erck saw deimos with a 7inch clark but the first detection of such minute objects is a feat of a very different order from their subsequent observation dr sees perception with this instrument in 1899 of neptunes cloudbelts and his refined series of micrometrical measures of the various planets attest the unimpaired excellence of its optical qualities it held the primacy for more than eight years then in december 1880 the place of honour had to be yielded to a 27inch achromatic built by howard grubb son and successor of thomas grubb for the vienna observatory this in its turn was surpassed by two of respectively 2912 and 30 inches sent by gautier of paris to nice and by alvan clark to pulkowa and an objectglass three feet in diameter was in 1886 successfully turned out by the latter firm for the lick observatory in california the difficulties however encountered in procuring discs of glass of the size and purity required for this last venture seemed to indicate that a term to progress in this direction was not far off the flint was indeed cast with comparative ease in the workshops of m feil at paris the flawless mass weighed 170 kilogrammes was over 38 inches across and cost 10000 dollars but with the crown part of the designed achromatic combination things went less smoothly the production of a perfect disc was only achieved after nineteen failures involving a delay of more than two years and the glass for a third lens designed to render the telescope available at pleasure for photographic purposes proved to be strained and consequently went to pieces in the process of grinding it has been replaced by one of 33 inches with which a series of admirable lunar and other photographs have been taken nor is the difficulty in obtaining suitable material the only obstacle to increasing the size of refractors the secondary spectrum as it is called also interposes a barrier troublesome to surmount true achromatism cannot be obtained with ordinary flint and crownglass and although in lenses of jena glass outstanding colour is reduced to about onesixth its usual amount their term of service is fatally abridged by rapid deterioration nevertheless a 13inch objective of the new variety was mounted at knigsberg in 1898 and discs of jena crown and flint 23 inches across were purchased by brashear at the chicago exhibition of 1893 an achromatic combination of three kinds of glass devised by mr a taylor1633 for messrs cooke of york has less serious drawbacks but has not yet come into extensive use meanwhile in giant telescopes affected to the full extent by chromatic aberration such as the lick and yerkes refractors the differences of focal length for the various colours are counted by inches1634 and this not through any lack of skill in the makers but by the necessity of the case embarrassing consequences follow only a small part of the spectrum of a heavenly body for instance can be distinctly seen at one time and a focal adjustment of half an inch is required in passing from the observation of a planetary nebula to that of its stellar nucleus a refracting telescope loses besides one of its chief advantages over a reflector when its size is increased beyond a certain limit that advantage is the greater luminosity of the images given by it considerably more light is transmitted through a glass lens than is reflected from an equal metallic surface but only so long as both are of moderate dimensions for the glass necessarily grows in thickness as its area augments and consequently stops a larger percentage of the rays it refracts so that a point at length arrivesfixed by the late dr robinson at a diameter a little short of 3 feet1635where the glass and the metal are in this respect on an equality while above it the metal has the advantage and since silvered glass gives back considerably more light than speculum metal the stage of equalisation with lenses is reached proportionately sooner where this material is employed1636 the most distinctive faculty of reflectors however is that of bringing rays of all refrangibilities to a focus together they are naturally achromatic none of the beams they collect are thrown away in colourfringes obnoxious both in themselves and as a waste of the chief object of astrophysicists greedlight reflectors then are in this respect specially adapted to photographic and spectrographic use but they have a countervailing drawback the penalties imposed by bigness are for them peculiarly heavy perfect definition becomes with increasing size more and more difficult to attain once attained it becomes more and more difficult to keep for the huge masses of material employed to form great objectglasses or mirrors tend with every movement to become deformed by their own weight now the slightest bending of a mirror is fatal to its performance the effect being doubled by reflection while in a lens alteration of figure is compensated by the equal and contrary flexures of the opposing surfaces so that the emergent beams pursue much the same paths as if the curves of the refracting medium had remained theoretically perfect for this reason work of precision must remain the province of refracting telescopes although great reflectors retain the primacy in the portraiture of the heavenly bodies as well as in certain branches of spectroscopy professor hale accordingly summarised a valuable discussion on the subject by asserting1637 that the astrophysicist may properly consider the reflector to be an even more important part of his instrumental equipment than the refractor a new era in its employment west of the atlantic opened with the transfer from halifax to mount hamilton of the crossley reflector its prerogatives in nebular photography were splendidly indicated in 1899 by professor keelers exquisite and searching portrayals of the cloudworlds of space and those obtained two years later with a similar though smaller instrument by professor ritchey of the yerkes observatory were fully comparable with them the performances of the yerkes 5foot reflector still belong to the future ambition as regards telescopic power is by no means yet satisfied nor ought it to be the advance of astrophysical researches of all kinds depends largely upon lightgrasp for the spectroscopic examination of stars for the measurement of their motions in the line of sight for the discovery and study of nebul for stellar and nebular photography the cry continually is more light there is no enterprising head of an observatory but must feel cramped in his designs if he can command no more than 14 or 15 inches of aperture and he aspires to greater instrumental capacity not merely with a view to the chances of discovery but for the steady prosecution of some legitimate line of inquiry thus projects of telescopebuilding on a large scale are rife and some obtain realisation year by year sir howard grubb finished in 1893 a 28inch achromatic for the royal observatory greenwich the thompson equatoreal mounted at the same establishment in 1897 carries on a single axis a 26inch photographic refractor and a 30inch silveredglass reflector the victoria telescope inaugurated at the cape in 1901 comprises a powerful spectrographic apparatus together with a chemically corrected 24inch refractor the whole being the munificent gift of mr frank mcclean at potsdam at meudon at paris at alleghany engines for lightconcentration have been or shortly will be erected of dimensions which two generations back would have seemed extravagant and impossible perhaps the finest though not absolutely the greatest among them marked the summit and end of the performances of alvan g clark the last survivor of the cambridgeport firm in october 1892 mr yerkes of chicago offered an unlimited sum for the provision of the university of that city with a superlative telescope and it happened fortunately that a pair of glass discs nearly 42 inches in diameter and of perfect quality were ready at hand they had been cast by mantois for the university of southern california when the erection of a great observatory on wilsons peak was under consideration in the clark workshop they were combined into a superb objective brought to perfection by trials and delicate touches extending over nearly five years then the maker accompanied it to its destination by the shore of a far western lake geneva and died immediately after his return june 9 1897 nor has the implement of celestial research he just lived to complete been allowed to rust unburnished manipulated by hale burnham and barnard it has done work that would have been impracticable with less efficient optical aid its construction thus marks a noticeable enlargement of astronomical possibilities exemplifiedto cite one among many performancesby barnards success in keeping track of clustervariables when below the common limit of visual perception with the lick telescope results have also been achieved testifying to its unsurpassed excellence holdens and schaeberles views of planetary nebul burnhams and husseys hairsbreadth starsplitting operations keelers measurements of nebular radial motion barnards detections and prolonged pursuit of faint comets his discovery of jupiters tiny moon campbells spectroscopic determinationsall this could only have been accomplished even by an exceptionally able and energetic staff with the aid of an instrument of high power and quality but there was another condition which should not be overlooked the best telescope may be crippled by a bad situation the larger it is indeed the more helpless is it to cope with atmospheric troubles these are the worst plagues of all those that afflict the astronomer no mechanical skill avails to neutralise or alleviate them they augment with each increase of aperture they grow with the magnifying powers applied the rays from the heavenly bodies when they can penetrate the cloudveils that too often bar their path reach us in an enfeebled scattered and disturbed condition hence the twinkling of stars the boiling effects at the edges of sun moon and planets hence distortions of bright effacements of feeble telescopic images hence too the paucity of the results obtained with many powerful lightgathering machines no sooner had the parsonstown telescope been built than it became obvious that the limit of profitable augmentation of size had under climatic conditions at all nearly resembling those prevailing there been reached if not overpassed and lord rosse himself was foremost to discern the need of pausing to look round the world for a clearer and stiller air than was to be found within the bounds of the united kingdom with this express object mr lassell transported his 2foot newtonian to malta in 1852 and mounted there in 1860 a similar instrument of fourfold capacity with which in the course of about two years 600 new nebul were discovered professor piazzi smyths experiences during a trip to the peak of teneriffe in 1856 in search of astronomical opportunities1638 gave countenance to the most sanguine hopes of deliverance at suitable elevated stations from some of the oppressive conditions of lowlevel stargazing yet for a number of years nothing effectual was done for their realisation now at last however mountain observatories are not only an admitted necessity but an accomplished fact and newtons long forecast of a time when astronomers would be compelled by the developed powers of their telescopes to mount high above the grosser clouds in order to use them1639 had been justified by the event james lick the millionaire of san francisco had already chosen when he died october 1 1876 a site for the new observatory to the building and endowment of which he had devoted a part of his large fortune the situation of the establishment is exceptional and splendid planted on one of the three peaks of mount hamilton a crowning summit of the californian coast range at an elevation of 4200 feet above the sea in a climate scarce rivalled throughout the world it commands views both celestial and terrestrial which the lover of nature and astronomy may alike rejoice in impediments to observation are there found to be most materially reduced professor holden who was appointed in 1885 president of the university of california and director of the new observatory affiliated to it stated that during six or seven months of the year an unbroken serenity prevails and that half the remaining nights are clear1640 the power of continuous work thus afforded is of itself an inestimable advantage and the high visual excellences testified to by mr burnhams discovery during a two months trip to mount hamilton in the autumn of 1879 of fortytwo new double stars with a 6inch achromatic gave hopes since fully realised of a brilliant future for the lick establishment its advantages are shared as professor holden desired them to be by the whole astronomical world1641 a sort of appellate jurisdiction was at once accorded to the great equatoreal and more than one disputed point has been satisfactorily settled by recourse to it its performances considered both as to quality and kind are unlikely to be improved upon by merely outbidding it in size unless the care expended upon the selection of its site be imitated professor pickering thus showed his customary prudence in reserving his efforts to procure a great telescope until harvard college owned a dependent observatory where it could be employed to advantage this was found by mr w h pickering after many experiments in colorado california and peru at arequipa on a slope of the andes 8000 feet above the sealevel here the post provided for by the boyden fund was established in 1891 under ideal meteorological conditions temperature preserves a golden mean the barometer is almost absolutely steady the yearly rainfall amounts to no more than three or four inches no wonder then that the seeing there is of the extraordinary excellence attested by mr pickerings observations in the absence of bright moonlight he tells us1642 eleven pleiades can always be counted the andromeda nebula appears to the naked eye conspicuously bright and larger than the full moon third magnitude stars have been followed to their disappearance at the true horizon the zodiacal light spans the heavens as a complete arch the gegenschein forming a regular part of the scenery of the heavens corresponding telescopic facilities are enjoyed the chief instrument at the station a 13inch equatoreal by clark shows the fainter parts of the orion nebula photographed at harvard college in 1887 by which the dimensions given to it in bonds drawing are doubled stars are at times seen encircled by half a dozen immovable diffraction rings up to twelve of which have been counted round alpha centauri while on many occasions no available increase of magnifying power availed to bring out any wavering in the limbs of the planets moreover the series of fine nights is nearly unbroken from march to november the facilities thus offered for continuous photographic research rendered feasible professor baileys amazing discovery of variable starclusters they belong exclusively to the globular class and the peculiarity is most strikingly apparent in the groups known as omega centauri and messier 3 5 and 15 a large number of their minute components run through perfectly definite cycles of change in periods usually of a few hours1643 altogether about 500 clustervariables have been recorded since 1895 it should be mentioned that mr david packer and dr common discerned about 1890 some premonitory symptoms of lightfluctuation among the crowded stars of messier 51644 with the bruce telescope a photographic doublet 24 inches in diameter a store of 5686 negatives was collected at arequipa between 1896 and 1901 some were exposed directly others with the intervention of a prism and all are available for important purposes of detection or investigation vapours and aircurrents do not alone embarrass the use of giant telescopes mechanical difficulties also oppose a formidable barrier to much further growth in size but what seems a barrier often proves to be only a fresh startingpoint and signs are not wanting that it may be found so in this case it is possible that the monumental domes and huge movable tubes of our present observatories will in a few decades be as much things of the past as huygenss aerial telescopes it is certain that the thin edge of the wedge of innovation has been driven into the old plan of equatoreal mounting m loewy the present director of the paris observatory proposed to delaunay in 1871 the direction of a telescope on a novel system the design seemed feasible and was adopted but the death of delaunay and the other untoward circumstances of the time interrupted its execution its resumption after some years was rendered possible by m bischoffsheims gift of 25000 francs for expenses and the coud or bent equatoreal has been since 1882 one of the leading instruments at the paris establishment its principle is briefly this the telescope is as it were its own polar axis the anterior part of the tube is supported at both ends and is thus fixed in a direction pointing towards the pole with only the power of twisting axially the posterior section is joined on to it at right angles and presents the objectglass accordingly to the celestial equator in the plane of which it revolves stars in any other part of the heavens have their beams reflected upon the objectglass by means of a plane rotating mirror placed in front of it the observer meanwhile is looking steadfastly down the bent tube towards the invisible southern pole he would naturally see nothing whatever were it not that a second plane mirror is fixed at the elbow of the instrument so as to send the rays which have traversed the objectglass to his eye he never needs to move from his place he watches the stars seated in an armchair in a warm room with as perfect convenience as if he were examining the seeds of a fungus with a microscope nor is this a mere gain of personal ease the abolition of hardship includes a vast accession of power1645 among other advantages of this method of construction are first that of added stability the motion given to the ordinary equatoreal being transferred in part to an auxiliary mirror next that of increased focal length the fixed part of the tube can be made almost indefinitely long without inconvenience and with enormous advantage to the optical qualities of a large instrument finally the costly and unmanageable cupola is got rid of a mere shed serving all purposes of protection required for the coud the desirability of some such change as that which m loewy has realised has been felt by others professor pickering sketched in 1881 a plan for fixing large refractors in a permanently horizontal position and reflecting into them by means of a shifting mirror the objects desired to be observed1646 the observations for his photometric catalogues are in fact made with a broken transit in which the line of sight remains permanently horizontal whatever the altitude of the star examined sir howard grubb moreover set up in 1882 a kind of siderostat at the crawford observatory cork in a paper read before the royal society january 21 1884 he proposed to carry out the principle on a more extended scale1647 and shortly afterwards undertook its application to a telescope 18 inches in aperture for the armagh observatory1648 the chief honours however remain to the paris inventor none of the prognosticated causes of failure have proved effective the loss of light from the double reflection is insignificant the menaced deformation of images is through the exquisite skill of the mm henry in producing plane mirrors of all but absolute perfection quite imperceptible the definition was admitted to be singularly good sir david gill stated in 1884 that he had never measured a double star so easily as he did gamma leonis by its means1649 sir norman lockyer pronounced it to be one of the instruments of the future and the principle of its construction was immediately adopted by the directors of the besanon and algiers observatories as well as for a 17inch telescope destined for a new observatory at buenos ayres at paris it has since been carried out on a larger scale a coud of 2312 inches aperture and 62 feet focal length was in 1890 installed at the national observatory and has served m loewy for his ingenious studies on refraction and aberrationabove all for taking the magnificent plates of his lunar atlas the bent form is capable of being but has not yet been adapted to reflectors1650 the coelostat in the form given to it by professor turner has proved an invaluable adjunct to eclipseequipments it consists essentially of a mirror rotating in fortyeight hours on an axis in its own plane and parallel to the earths axis in the field of a telescope kept rigidly pointed towards such a mirror stars appear immovably fixed the employment of longfocus lenses for coronal photography is thus facilitated and the size of the image is proportional to the length of the focus professor barnard accordingly depicted the totality of 1900 with a horizontal telescope 6112 feet long fed by a mirror 18 inches across the diameter of the moon on his plates being 7 inches the largest siderostat in the world is the paris 50inch refractor which formed the chief attraction of the palais doptique at the exhibition of 1900 it has a focal length of nearly 200 feet and can be used either for photographic or for visual purposes celestial photography has not reached its grand climacteric yet its earliest beginnings already seem centuries behind its present performances the details of its gradual yet rapid improvement are of too technical a nature to find a place in these pages suffice it to say that the dryplate process with which such wonderful results have been obtained appears to have been first made available by sir william huggins in photographing the spectrum of vega in 1876 and was then successively adopted by common draper and janssen nor should captain abneys remarkable extension of the powers of the camera be left unnoticed he began his experiments on the chemical action of red and infrared rays in 1874 and at length succeeded in obtaining a substancethe blue bromide of silverhighly sensitive to these slower vibrations of light with its aid he explored a vast unknown and for ever invisible region of the solar spectrum presenting to the royal society december 5 18791651 a detailed map of its infrared portion wavelengths 7600 to 10750 from which valuable inferences may yet be derived as to the condition of the various kinds of matter ignited in the solar atmosphere upon plates rendered orthochromatic by staining with alizarine or other dyestuffs the whole visible spectrum can now be photographed but those with their maximum of sensitiveness near g are found preferable except where the results of lightanalysis are sought to be completely recorded and since photographic refractors are corrected for the blue rays exposures with them of orthochromatic surfaces would be entirely futile the chemical plate has two advantages over the human retina1652 first it is sensitive to rays which are utterly powerless to produce any visual effect next it can accumulate impression almost indefinitely while from the retina they fade after onetenth part of a second leaving it a continually renewed tabula rasa it is accordingly quite possible to photograph objects so faint as to be altogether beyond the power of any telescope to revealwitness the chemical disclosure of the invisible nebula encircling nova perseiand we may thus eventually learn whether a blank space in the sky truly represents the end of the stellar universe in that direction or whether farther and farther worlds roll and shine beyond veiled in the obscurity of immeasurable distance of many ingenious improvements in spectroscopic appliances the most fundamentally important relate to what are known as gratings these are very finely striated surfaces by which lightwaves are brought to interfere and are thus sifted out strictly according to their different lengths into normal spectra since no universally valid measures can be made in any others their production is quite indispensable to spectroscopic science fraunhofer who initiated the study of the diffraction spectrum used a real grating of very fine wires but rulings on glass were adopted by his successors and were by nobert executed with such consummate skill that a single square inch of surface was made to contain 100000 handdrawn lines such rare and costly triumphs of art however found their way into very few hands and practical availability was first given to this kind of instrument by the inventiveness and mechanical dexterity of two american investigators both rutherfurds and rowlands gratings are machineruled and reflect instead of transmitting the rays they analyse but rowlands present to them a very much larger diffractive surface and consequently possess a higher resolving power the first preliminary to his improvements was the production in 1882 of a faultless screw those previously in use having been the inevitable source of periodical errors in striation giving in their turn ghostlines as subjects of spectroscopic study1653 their abolition was not one of rowlands least achievements with his perfected machine a metallic area of 614 by 414 inches can be ruled with exquisite accuracy to almost any degree of fineness he considered however 43000 lines to the inch to be the limit of usefulness1654 the ruled surface is moreover concave and hence brings the spectrum to a focus without a telescope a slit and an eyepiece are alone needed to view it and absorption of light by glass lenses is obviatedan advantage especially sensible in dealing with the ultra or infravisible rays the high qualities of rowlands great photographic map of the solar spectrum were thus based upon his previous improvement of the instrumental means used in its execution the amount of detail shown in it is illustrated by the appearance on the negatives of 150 lines between h and k and many lines depict themselves as double which until examined with a concave grating had passed for one and indivisible a corresponding handdrawing for which m thollon received in 1886 the lalande prize exhibits not the diffractive but the prismatic spectrum as obtained with bisulphide of carbon prisms of large dispersive power about onethird of the visible gamut of the solar radiations a to b is covered by it it includes 3200 lines and is over ten metres long1655 the grating is an expensive tool in the way of light where there is none to spare its advantages must be foregone they could not accordingly be turned to account in stellar spectroscopy until the lick telescope was at hand to supply more abundant material for research by the use thus made possible of rowlands gratings professor keeler was able to apply enormous dispersion to the rays of stars and nebul and so to attain a previously unheardof degree of accuracy in their measurement his memorable detection of nebular movement in line of sight ensued as a consequence professor campbell his successor has since obtained by the same means the first satisfactory photographs of stellar diffractionspectra the means at the disposal of astronomers have not multiplied faster than the tasks imposed upon them looking back to the year 1800 we cannot fail to be astonished at the change the comparatively simple and serene science of the heavenly bodies known to our predecessors almost perfect so far as it went incurious of what lay beyond its grasp has developed into a body of manifold powers and parts each with its separate mode and means of growth full of strong vitality but animated by a restless and unsatisfied spirit haunted by the sense of problems unsolved and tormented by conscious impotence to sound the immensities it perpetually confronts knowledge might be said when the mcanique cleste issued from the press to be bounded by the solar system but even the solar system presented itself under an aspect strangely different from what it now wears it consisted of the sun seven planets and twice as many satellites all circling harmoniously in obedience to a universal law by the compensating action of which the indefinite stability of their mutual relations was secured the occasional incursion of a comet or the periodical presence of a single such wanderer chained down from escape to outer space by planetary attraction availed nothing to impair the symmetry of the majestic spectacle now not alone the ascertained limits of the system have been widened by a thousand millions of miles with the addition of one more giant planet and seven satellites to the ancient classes of its members but a complexity has been given to its constitution baffling description or thought five hundred circulating planetary bodies bridge the gap between jupiter and mars the complete investigation of the movements of any one of which would overtask the energies of a lifetime meteorites strangers apparently to the fundamental ordering of the solar household swarm nevertheless by millions in every cranny of its space returning at regular intervals like the comets so singularly associated with them or sweeping across it with hyperbolic velocities brought perhaps from some distant star and each of these cosmical grains of dust has a theory far more complex than that of jupiter it bears within it the secret of its origin and fulfils a function in the universe the sun itself is no longer a semifabulous firegirt globe but the vast scene of the play of forces as yet imperfectly known to us offering a boundless field for the most arduous and inspiring researches among the planets the widest variety in physical habitudes is seen to prevail and each is recognised as a world apart inviting inquiries which to be effective must necessarily be special and detailed even our own moon threatens to break loose from the trammels of calculation and commits errors which sap the very foundations of the lunar theory and suggest the formidable necessity for its complete revision nay the steadfast earth has forfeited the implicit confidence placed in it as a timekeeper and questions relating to the stability of the earths axis and the constancy of the earths rate of rotation are among those which it behoves the future to answer everywhere there is multiformity and change stimulating a curiosity which the rapid development of methods of research offers the possibility of at least partially gratifying outside the solar system the problems which demand a practical solution are virtually infinite in number and extent and these have all arisen and crowded upon our thoughts within less than a hundred years for sidereal science became a recognised branch of astronomy only through herschels discovery of the revolutions of double stars in 1802 yet already it may be and has been called the astronomy of the future so rapidly has the development of a keen and universal interest attended and stimulated the growth of power to investigate this sublime subject what has been done is littleis scarcely a beginning yet it is much in comparison with the total blank of a century past and our knowledge will we are easily persuaded appear in turn the merest ignorance to those who come after us yet it is not to be despised since by it we reach up groping fingers to touch the hem of the garment of the most high footnotes
