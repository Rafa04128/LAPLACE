philadelphia lindsay and blakiston 1857 printed by c sherman son 19 st james street preface by universal consent the physical faculties of man have been divided into five sensesseeing hearing touching tasting and smelling it is of matter pertaining to the faculty of smelling that this book mainly treats of the five senses that of smelling is the least valued and as a consequence is the least tutored but we must not conclude from this our own act that it is of insignificant importance to our welfare and happiness by neglecting to tutor the olfactory nerve we are constantly led to breathe impure air and thus poison the body by neglecting the warning given at the gate of the lungs persons who use perfumes are more sensitive to the presence of a vitiated atmosphere than those who consider the faculty of smelling as an almost useless gift in the early ages of the world the use of perfumes was in constant practice and it had the high sanction of scriptural authority the patrons of perfumery have always been considered the most civilized and refined people of the earth if refinement consists in knowing how to enjoy the faculties which we possess then must we learn not only how to distinguish the harmony of color and form in order to please the sight the melody of sweet sounds to delight the ear the comfort of appropriate fabrics to cover the body and to please the touch but the smelling faculty must be shown how to gratify itself with the odoriferous products of the garden and the forest pathologically considered the use of perfumes is in the highest degree prophylactic the refreshing qualities of the citrine odors to an invalid is well known health has often been restored when life and death trembled in the balance by the mere sprinkling of essence of cedrat in a sick chamber the commercial value of flowers is of no mean importance to the wealth of nations but vast as is the consumption of perfumes by the people under the rule of the british empire little has been done in england towards the establishment of flowerfarms or the production of the raw odorous substances in demand by the manufacturing perfumers of britain consequently nearly the whole are the produce of foreign countries however i have every hope that ere long the subject will attract the attention of the society of arts and favorable results will doubtless follow much of the waste land in england and especially in ireland could be very profitably employed if cultivated with odorbearing plants the climate of some of the british colonies especially fits them for the production of odors from flowers that require elevated temperature to bring them to perfection but for the lamented death of mr charles piessea colonial secretary for western australia i have every reason to believe that flowerfarms would have been established in that colony long ere the publication of this work though thus personally frustrated in adapting a new and useful description of labor to british enterprise i am no less sanguine of the final result in other hands mr kemble of jamaica has recently sent to england some fine samples of oil of behn the moringa from which it is produced has been successfully cultivated by him the oil of behn being a perfectly inodorous fat oil is a valuable agent for extracting the odors of flowers by the maceration process at no distant period i hope to see either at the crystal palace sydenham at the royal botanical gardens kew or elsewhere a place to illustrate the commercial use of flowerseyelectures on the methods of obtaining the odors of plants and their various uses the horticulturists of england being generally unacquainted with the methods of economizing the scents from the flowers they cultivate entirely lose what would be a very profitable source of income for many ages copper ore was thrown over the cliffs into the sea by the cornish miners working the tin streams how much wealth was thus cast away by ignorance we know not but there is a perfect parallel between the old miners and the modern gardeners many readers of the gardeners chronicle and of the annals of pharmacy and chemistry will recognize in the following pages much matter that has already passed under their eyes to be of the service intended such matter must however have a book form i have therefore collected from the abovementioned periodicals all that i considered might be useful to the reader to sir wm hooker dr lindley mr w dickinson and mr w bastick i respectfully tender my thanks for the assistance they have so freely given whenever i have

working hand the garden glows and fills the liberal air with lavish odors there let me draw ethereal soul there drink reviving gales profusely breathing from the spicy groves and vales of fragrancethomson among the numerous gratifications derived from the cultivation of flowers that of rearing them for the sake of their perfumes stands preeminent it is proved from the oldest records that perfumes have been in use from the earliest periods the origin of this like that of many other arts is lost in the depth of its antiquity though it had its rise no doubt in religious observances among the nations of antiquity an offering of perfumes was regarded as a token of the most profound respect and homage incense or frankincense which exudes by incision and dries as a gum from arborthurifera was formerly burnt in the temples of all religions in honor of the divinities that were there adored many of the primitive christians were put to death because they would not offer incense to idols of the use of these luxuries by the greeks and afterwards by the romans pliny and seneca gives much information respecting perfume drugs the method of collecting them and the prices at which they sold oils and powder perfumery were most lavishly used for even three times a day did some of the luxurious people anoint and scent themselves carrying their precious perfumes with them to the baths in costly and elegant boxes called narthecia in the romish church incense is used in many ceremonies and particularly at the solemn funerals of the hierarchy and other personages of exalted rank pliny makes a note of the tree from which frankincense is procured and certain passages in his works indicate that dried flowers were used in his time by way of perfume and that they were as now mixed with spices a compound which the modern perfumer calls potpourri used for scenting apartments and generally placed in some ornamental vase it was not uncommon among the egyptian ladies to carry about the person a little pouch of odoriferous gums as is the case to the present day among the chinese and to wear beads made of scented wood the bdellium mentioned by moses in genesis is a perfuming gum resembling frankincense if not identical with it several passages in exodus prove the use of perfumes at a very early period among the hebrews in the thirtieth chapter of exodus the lord said unto moses 1 and thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon of shittim wood shalt thou make it 7 and aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning when he dresseth the lamps he shall burn incense upon it 34 take unto thee sweet spices stacte and onycha and galbanum these sweet spices with pure frankincense of each shall there be a like weight 35 and thou shalt make it a perfume a confection after the art of the apothecary tempered together pure and holy 36 and thou shalt beat some of it very small and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation where i will meet with thee it shall be unto you most holy 37 and as for the perfume which thou shalt make ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof it shall be unto thee holy for the lord 38 whosoever shall make like unto that to smell thereto shall even be cut off from his people it was from this religious custom of employing incense in the ancient temples that the royal prophet drew that beautiful simile of his when he petitioned that his prayers might ascend before the lord like incense luke 110 it was while all the multitude was praying without at the hour of incense that there appeared to zachary an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense that the nations attached a meaning not only of personal reverence but also of religious homage to an offering of incense is demonstrable from the instance of the magi who having fallen down to adore the newborn jesus and recognized his divinity presented him with gold myrrh and frankincense the primitive christians imitated the example of the jews and adopted the use of incense at the celebration of the liturgy st ephrm a father of the syriac church directed in his will that no aromatic perfumes should be bestowed upon him at his funeral but that the spices should rather be given to the sanctuary the use of incense in all the oriental churches is perpetual and almost daily nor do any of them ever celebrate their liturgy without it unless compelled by necessity the coptic as well as other eastern christians observe the same ceremonial as the latin church in incensing their altar the sacred vessels and ecclesiastical personagesdr rocks hierurgia perfumes were used in the church service not only under the form of incense but also mixed in the oil and wax for the lamps and lights commanded to be burned in the house of the lord the brilliancy and fragrance which were often shed around a martyrs sepulchre at the celebration of his festival by multitudes of lamps and tapers fed with aromatics have been noticed by st paulinus with crowded lamps are these bright altars crowned and waxen tapers shedding perfume round from fragrant wicks beam calm a scented ray to gladden night and joy een radiant day dr rocks hierurgia constantine the great provided fragrant oils to be burned at the altars of the greater churches in rome and st paulinus of nola a writer of the end of the fourth and beginning of the fifth century tells us how in his times wax tapers were made for church use so as to shed fragrance as they burned lumina cerates adolentur odora papyris a perfume in common use even to this day was the invention of one of the earliest of the roman nobles named frangipani and still bears his name it is a powder or sachet composed of every known spice in equal proportions to which is added ground iris or orris root in weight equal to the whole with one per cent of musk or civet a liquid of the same name invented by his grandson mercutio frangipani is also in common use prepared by digesting the frangipane powder in rectified spirits which dissolves out the fragrant principles this has the merit of being the most lasting perfume made the trade for the east in perfumedrugs caused many a vessel to spread its sails to the red sea and many a camel to plod over that tract which gave to greece and syria their importance as markets and vitality to the rocky city of petra southern italy was not long ere it occupied itself in ministering to the luxury of the wealthy by manufacturing scented unguents and perfumes so numerous were the unguentarii or perfumers that they are said to have filled the great street of ancient capuahofmann as an art in england perfumery has attained little or no distinction this has arisen from those who follow it as a trade maintaining a mysterious secrecy about their processes no manufacture can ever become great or important to the community that is carried on under a veil of mystery on the subject of trade mystery i will only observe that i am convinced that it would be far more to the interest of manufacturers if they were more willing to profit by the experience of others and less fearful and jealous of the supposed secrets of their craft it is a great mistake to think that a successful manufacturer is one who has carefully preserved the secrets of his trade or that peculiar modes of effecting simple things processes unknown in other factories and mysteries beyond the comprehension of the vulgar are in any way essential to skill as a manufacturer or to success as a traderprofessor solly if the horticulturists of england were instructed how to collect the odors of flowers a new branch of manufacture would spring up to vie with our neighbors skill in it across the channel of our five senses that of smelling has been treated with comparative indifference however as knowledge progresses the various faculties with which the creator has thought proper in his wisdom to endow man will become developed and the faculty of smelling will meet with its share of tuition as well as sight hearing touch and taste flowers yield perfumes in all climates but those growing in the warmer latitudes are most prolific in their odor while those from the colder are the sweetest hooker in his travels in iceland speaks of the delightful fragrance of the flowers in the valley of skardsheidi we know that wintergreen violets and primroses are found here and the wild thyme in great abundance mr louis piesse in company with captain sturt exploring the wild regions of south australia writes the rains have clothed the earth with a green as beautiful as a shropshire meadow in may and with flowers too as sweet as an english violet the pure white anemone resembles it in scent the yellow wattle when in flower is splendid and emits a most fragrant odor though many of the finest perfumes come from the east indies ceylon mexico and peru the south of europe is the only real garden of utility to the perfumer grasse and nice are the principal seats of the art from their geographical position the grower within comparatively short distances has at command that change of climate best fitted to bring to perfection the plants required for his trade on the seacoast his cassi grows without fear of frost one night of which would destroy all the plants for a season while nearer the alps his violets are found sweeter than if grown in the warmer situations where the orange tree and mignionette bloom to perfection england can claim the superiority in the growth of lavender and peppermint the essential oils extracted from these plants grown at mitcham in surrey realize eight times the price in the market of those produced in france or elsewhere and are fully worth the difference for delicacy of odor the odors of plants reside in different parts of them sometimes in the roots as in the iris and vitivert the stem or wood in cedar and sandal the leaves in mint patchouly and thyme the flower in the roses and violets the seeds in the tonquin bean and caraway the bark in cinnamon c some plants yield more than one odor which are quite distinct and characteristic the orange tree for instance gives threefrom the leaves one called petit grain from the flowers we procure neroli and from the rind of the fruit essential oil of orange essence of portugal on this account perhaps this tree is the most valuable of all to the operative perfumer the fragrance or odor of plants is owing in nearly all cases to a perfectly volatile oil either contained in small vessels or sacs within them or generated from time to time during their life as when in blossom some few exude by incision odoriferous gums as benzoin olibanum myrrh c others give by the same act what are called balsams which appear to be mixtures of an odorous oil and an inodorous gum some of these balsams are procured in the country to which the plant is indigenous by boiling it in water for a time straining and then boiling again or evaporating it down till it assumes the consistency of treacle in this latter way is balsam of peru procured from the myroxylon peruiferum and the balsam of tolu from the myroxylon toluiferum though their odors are agreeable they are not much applied in perfumery for handkerchief use but by some they are mixed with soap and in england they are valued more for their medicinal properties than for their fragrance section ii were not summers distillations left a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass beautys effect with beauty were bereft nor it nor no remembrance what it was but flowers distilled though they with winter meet leese but their show their substance still lives sweet shakspeare the extensive flower farms in the neighborhood of nice grasse montpellier and cannes in france at adrianople turkey in asia at broussa and uslak turkey in asia and at mitcham in england in a measure indicate the commercial importance of that branch of chemistry called perfumery british india and europe consume annually at the very lowest estimate 150000 gallons of perfumed spirits under various titles such as eau de cologne essence of lavender esprit de rose c the art of perfumery does not however confine itself to the production of scents for the handkerchief and bath but extends to imparting odor to inodorous bodies such as soap oil starch and grease which are consumed at the toilette of fashion some idea of the commercial importance of this art may be formed when we state that one of the large perfumers of grasse and paris employs annually 80000 lbs of orange flowers 60000 lbs of cassia flowers 54000 lbs of roseleaves 32000 lbs of jasmine blossoms 32000 lbs of violets 20000 lbs of tubereuse 16000 lbs of lilac besides rosemary mint lemon citron thyme and other odorous plants in large proportion in fact the quantity of odoriferous substances used in this way is far beyond the conception of those even used to abstract statistics to the chemical philosopher the study of perfumery opens a book as yet unread for the practical perfumer on his laboratory shelves exhibits many rare essential oils such as essential oil of the flower of the acacia farnesiana essential oil of violets tubereuse jasmine and others the compositions of which have yet to be determined the exquisite pleasure derived from smelling fragrant flowers would almost instinctively induce man to attempt to separate the odoriferous principle from them so as to have the perfume when the season denies the flowers thus we find the alchemists of old torturing the plants in every way their invention could devise for this end and it is on their experiments that the whole art of perfumery has been reared without recapitulating those facts which may be found diffused through nearly all the old authors on medical botany chemistry pharmacy and works of this character from the time of paracelsus to celnart we may state at once the mode of operation adopted by the practical perfumer of the present day for preparing the various extracts or essences waters oils pomades c used in his calling the processes are divided into four distinct operations viz 1 expression 2 distillation 3 maceration 4 absorption 1 expression is only adopted where the plant is very prolific in its volatile or essential oilie its odor such for instance as is found in the pellicle or outer peel of the orange lemon and citron and a few others in these cases the parts of the plant containing the odoriferous principle are put sometimes in a cloth bag and at others by themselves into a press and by mere mechanical force it is squeezed out the press is an iron vessel of immense strength varying in size from six inches in diameter and twelve deep and upwards to contain one hundred weight or more it has a small aperture at the bottom to allow the expressed material to run for collection in the interior is placed a perforated false bottom and on this the substance to be squeezed is placed covered with an iron plate fitting the interior this is connected with a powerful screw which being turned forces the substance so closely together that the little vessels containing the essential oils are burst and it thus escapes the common tincture press is indeed a model of such an instrument the oils which are thus collected are contaminated with watery extracts which exudes at the same time and from which it has to be separated this it does by itself in a measure by standing in a quiet place and it is then poured off and strained illustration pipette to draw off small portions of otto from water 2 distillationthe plant or part of it which contains the odoriferous principle is placed in an iron copper or glass pan varying in size from that capable of holding from one to twenty gallons and covered with water to the pan a domeshaped lid is fitted terminating with a pipe which is twisted corkscrew fashion and fixed in a bucket with the end peeping out like a tap in a barrel the water in the stillfor such is the name of the apparatusis made to boil and having no other exit the steam must pass through the coiled pipe which being surrounded with cold water in the bucket condenses the vapor before it can arrive at the tap with the steam the volatile oilsie perfumerises and is liquefied at the same time the liquids which thus run over on standing for a time separate into two portions and are finally divided with a funnel having a stopcock in the narrow part of it by this process the majority of the volatile or essential oils are procured in some few instances alcoholie rectified spirit of wineis placed upon the odorous materials in lieu of water which on being distilled comes away with the perfuming substance dissolved in it but this process is now nearly obsolete as it is found more beneficial to draw the oil or essence first with water and afterwards to dissolve it in the spirit the low temperature at which spirit boils compared with water causes a great loss of essential oil the heat not being sufficient to disengage it from the plant especially where seeds such as cloves or caraway are employed it so happens however that the finest odors the recherch as the parisians say cannot be procured by this method then recourse is had to the next process illustration tap funnel for separating ottos from water and spirits from oil 3 macerationof all the processes for procuring the perfumes of flowers this is the most important to the perfumer and is the least understood in england as this operation yields not only the most exquisite essences indirectly but also nearly all those fine pomades known here as french pomatums so much admired for the strength of fragrance together with french oils equally perfumed the operation is conducted thusfor what is called pomade a certain quantity of purified mutton or deer suet is put into a clean metal or porcelain pan this being melted by a steam heat the kind of flowers required for the odor wanted are carefully picked and put into the liquid fat and allowed to remain from twelve to fortyeight hours the fat has a particular affinity or attraction for the oil of flowers and thus as it were draws it out of them and becomes itself by their aid highly perfumed the fat is strained from the spent flowers and fresh are added four or five times over till the pomade is of the required strength these various strengths of pomatums are noted by the french makers as nos 6 12 18 and 24 the higher numerals indicating the amount of fragrance in them for perfumed oils the same operation is followed but in lieu of suet fine olive oil or oil of ben derived from the ben nuts of the levant is used and the same results are obtained these oils are called huile antique of such and such a flower when neither of the foregoing processes gives satisfactory results the method of procedure adopted is by 4 absorption or enfleuragethe odors of some flowers are so delicate and volatile that the heat required in the previously named processes would greatly modify if not entirely spoil them this process is therefore conducted cold thussquare frames about three inches deep with a glass bottom say two feet wide and three feet long are procured over the glass a layer of fat is spread about half an inch thick with a kind of plaster knife or spatula into this the flower buds are stuck cup downwards and ranged completely over it and there left from twelve to seventytwo hours some houses such as that of messrs pilar and sons pascal brothers h herman and a few others have 3000 such frames at work during the season as they are filled they are piled one over the other the flowers are changed so long as the plants continue to bloom which now and then exceeds two or three months for oils of the same plants coarse linen cloths are imbued with the finest olive oil or oil of ben and stretched upon a frame made of iron on these the flowers are laid and suffered to remain a few days this operation is repeated several times after which the cloths are subjected to great pressure to remove the now perfumed oil as we cannot give any general rule for working without misleading the reader we prefer explaining the process required for each when we come to speak of the individual flower or plant section iii whenever a still is named or an article is said to be distilled or drawn it must be understood to be done so by steam apparatus as this is the only mode which can be adopted for obtaining anything like a delicate odor the old plan of having the fire immediately under the still conveying an empyreumatic or burnt smell to the result has become obsolete in every wellregulated perfumatory the steamstill differs from the one described only in the lower part or pan which is made double so as to allow steam from a boiler to circulate round the pan for the purpose of boiling the contents instead of the direct fire in macerating the heat is applied in the same way or by a contrivance like the common gluepot as made use of nowadays this description of apparatus will be found very useful for experiments which we will suggest byandby the perfumes for the handkerchief as found in the shops of paris and london are either simple or compound the former are called extracts extraits esprits or essences and the latter bouquets and nosegays which are mixtures of the extracts so compounded in quantity that no one flower or odor can be discovered as predominating over another and when made of the delicatescented flowers carefully blended they produce an exquisite sensation on the olfactory nerve and are therefore much prized by all who can afford to purchase them we shall first explain the mode for obtaining the simple extracts of flowers this will be followed by the process for preparing ambergris musk and civet substances which though of animal origin are of the utmost importance as forming a large part in the most approved bouquets and we shall conclude this department of the art with recipes for all the fashionable bouquets and nosegays the value of which we doubt not will be estimated according to the labor bestowed upon their analysis in order to render the work more easy of consultation we have adopted the alphabetical arrangement in preference to a more scientific classification among the collection of ottos of the east india company at the exhibition of 1851 were several hitherto unknown in this country and possessing much interest it is to be regretted that no person having any practical knowledge of perfumery was placed on the jury of class iv or xxix had such been the case the desires of the exhibitors would probably have been realized and european perfumers benefited by the introduction of new odors from the east some of the ottos sent by a native perfumer of benares were deemed worthy of honorable mention such as chumeylee beyla begla moteya and many others from the moluccas but without any information respecting them we are not going to speak of perhaps more than a tithe of the plants that have a perfumeonly those will be mentioned that are used by the operative perfumer and such as are imitated by him in consequence of there being a demand for the article which circumstances prevent him from obtaining in its genuine state the first that comes under our notice is allspicethe odoriferous principle of allspice commonly called pimento is obtained by distilling the dried fruit before it is quite ripe of the eugenia pimenta and myrtus pimenta with water it is thus procured as an essential oil it is but little used in perfumery and when so only in combination with other spice oils for scenting soap it is however very agreeable and much resembles the smell of cloves and deserves more attention than it has hitherto received mixed in the proportion of two ounces of oil of allspice with one gallon of rectified spirit of wine it forms what may be termed extract of allspice which extract will be found very useful in the manufacture of lowpriced bouquets almonds mark well the flowring almonds in the wood if odrous blooms the bearing branches load the glebe will answer to the sylvan reign great heats will follow and large crops of grain virgil this perfume has been much esteemed for many ages it may be procured by distilling the leaves of any of the laurel tribe and the kernels of stone fruit for trade purposes it is obtained from the bitter almonds and exists in the skin or pellicle that covers the seed after it is shelled in the ordinary way the almonds are put into the press for the purpose of obtaining the mild or fat oil from the nut the cake which is left after this process is then mixed with salt and water and allowed to remain together for about twentyfour hours prior to distillation the reason for moistening the cake is well understood to the practical chemist and although we are not treating the subject of perfumery in a chemical sense but only in a practical way it may not be inappropriate here to observe that the essential oil of almonds does not exist ready formed to any extent in the nut but that it is produced by a species of fermentation from the amygdalin and emulsine contained in the almonds together with the water that is added analogous substances exist in laurel leaves and hence the same course is to be pursued when they are distilled some manufacturers put the moistened cake into a bag of coarse cloth or spread it upon a sieve and then force the stream through it in either case the essential oil of the almond rises with the watery vapor and is condensed in the stillworm in this concentrated form the odor of almonds is far from agreeable but when diluted with spirit in the proportion of about one and a half ounce of the oil to a gallon of spirit or alcohol it is very pleasant illustration almond the essential oil of almonds enters into combination with soap cold cream and many other materials prepared by the perfumer for which see their respective titles fourteen pounds of the cake yield about one ounce of essential oil in experiments with this substance it must be carefully remembered that it is exceedingly poisonous and therefore great caution is necessary in its admixture with substances used as a cosmetic otherwise dangerous results may ensue artificial otto of almondsfive or six years ago mr mansfield of weybridge took out a patent for the manufacture of otto of almonds from benzole benzole is obtained from tar oil his apparatus according to the report of the juries of the 1851 exhibition consists of a large glass tube in the form of a coil which at the upper end divides into two tubes each of which is provided with a funnel a stream of nitric acid flows slowly into one of the funnels and benzole into the other the two substances meet at the point of union of the tubes and a combination ensues with the evolution of heat as the newly formed compound flows down through the coil it becomes cool and is collected at the lower extremity it then requires to be washed with water and lastly with a dilute solution of carbonate of soda to render it fit for use nitrobenzole which is the chemical name for this artificial otto of almonds has a different odor to the true otto of almonds but it can nevertheless be used for perfuming soap mr mansfield writes to me under date of january 3d 1855in 1851 messrs gosnell of three king court began to make this perfume under my license latterly i withdrew the license from them by their consent and since then it is not made that i am aware of it is however quite common in paris anisethe odorous principle is procured by distilling the seeds of the plant pimpinella anisum the product is the oil of aniseed of commerce as it congeals at a temperature of about 50 fahr it is frequently adulterated with a little spermaceti to give a certain solidity to it whereby other cheaper essential oils can be added to it with less chance of detection as the oil of aniseed is quite soluble in spirit and the spermaceti insoluble the fraud is easily detected this perfume is exceedingly strong and is therefore well adapted for mixing with soap and for scenting pomatums but does not do nicely in compounds for handkerchief use balm oil of balm called also oil of melissa is obtained by distilling the leaves of the melissa officinalis with water it comes from the still tap with the condensed steam or water from which it is separated with the tap funnel but it is very little used in perfumery if we except its combination in aqua di argento balsamunder this title there are two or three substances used in perfumery such as balsam of peru balsam of tolu and balsam of storax also called liquid amber the firstnamed is procured from the myroxylon peruiferum it exudes from the tree when wounded and is also obtained by boiling down the bark and branches in water the latter is the most common method for procuring it it has a strong odor like benzoin balsam of tolu flows from the toluifera balsammum it resembles common resin rosin with the least warmth however it runs to a liquid like brown treacle the smell of it is particularly agreeable and being soluble in alcohol makes a good basis for a bouquet giving in this respect a permanence of odor to a perfume which the simple solution of an oil would not possess for this purpose all these balsams are very useful though not so much used as they might be ulex has found that balsam of tolu is frequently adulterated with common resin to detect this adulteration he pours sulphuric acid on the balsam and heats the mixture when the balsam dissolves to a cherryred fluid without evolving sulphurous acid but with the escape of benzoic or cinnamic acid if no common resin is present on the contrary the balsam foams blackens and much sulphurous acid is set free if it is adulterated with common resinarchives der pharmacie balsam of storax commonly called gum styrax is obtained in the same manner and possessing similar properties with a slight variation of odor is applicable in the same manner as the above they are all imported from south america chili and mexico where the trees that produce them are indigenous bay oil of sweet bay also termed essential oil of laurelberries is a very fragrant substance procured by distillation from the berries of the bay laurel though very pleasant it is not much used bergamotthis most useful perfume is procured from the citrus bergamia by expression from the peel of the fruit it has a soft sweet odor too well known to need description here when new and good it has a greenishyellow tint but loses its greenness by age especially if kept in imperfectly corked bottles it then becomes cloudy from the deposit of resinous matter produced by the contact of the air and acquires a turpentine smell it is best preserved in wellstoppered bottles kept in a cool cellar and in the dark light especially the direct sunshine quickly deteriorates its odor this observation may be applied indeed to all perfumes except rose which is not so spoiled when bergamot is mixed with other essential oils it greatly adds to their richness and gives a sweetness to spice oils attainable by no other means and such compounds are much used in the most highly scented soaps mixed with rectified spirit in the proportions of about four ounces of bergamot to a gallon it forms what is called extract of bergamot and in this state is used for the handkerchief though well covered with extract of orris and other matters it is the leading ingredient in bayley and blews ess bouquet see bouquets illustration styrax benzoin benzoin also called benjaminthis is a very useful substance to perfumers it exudes from the styrax benzoin by wounding the tree and drying becomes a hard gumresin it is principally imported from borneo java sumatra and siam the best kind comes from the latter place and used to be called amygdaloides because of its being interspersed with several white spots which resemble broken almonds when heated these white specks rise as a smoke which is easily condensed upon paper the material thus separated from the benzoin is called flowers of benzoin in commerce and by chemists is termed benzoic acid it has all or nearly all the odor of the resin from which it is derived the extract or tincture of benzoin forms a good basis for a bouquetb like balsam of tolu it gives permanence and body to a perfume made with an essential oil in spirit the principal consumption of benzoin is in the manufacture of pastilles see pastilles and for the preparation of fictitious vanilla pomade see pomatums carawaythis odoriferous principle is drawn by distillation from the seeds of the carum carui it has a very pleasant smell quite familiar enough without description it is well adapted to perfume soap for which it is much used in england though rarely if ever on the continent when dissolved in spirit it may be used in combination with oil of lavender and bergamot for the manufacture of cheap essences in a similar way to cloves see cloves if caraway seeds are ground they are well adapted for mixing to form sachet powder see sachets cascarillathe bark is used in the formation of pastilles and also enters into the composition known as eau bruler for perfuming apartments to which we refer the bark alone of this plant is used by the manufacturing perfumer and that only in the fabrication of pastilles the cascarilla gratissimus is however so fragrant that according to burnett its leaves are gathered by the koras of the cape of good hope as a perfume and both the c fragrans and c fragilis are odoriferous it behooves perfumers therefore who are on the look out for novelties to obtain these leaves and ascertain the result of their distillation messrs herring and co some years ago drew the oil of cascarilla but it was only offered to the trade as a curiosity cassiathe essential oil of cassia is procured by distilling the outer bark of the cinnamomum cassia 1 cwt of bark yields rather more than three quarters of a pound of oil it has a pale yellow color in smell it much resembles cinnamon although very inferior to it it is principally used for perfuming soap especially what is called military soap as it is more aromatic or spicy than flowery in odor it therefore finds no place for handkerchief use cassie the short narcissus and fair daffodil pansies to please the sight and cassie sweet to swell drydens virgil this is one of those fine odors which enters into the composition of the best handkerchief bouquets illustration flowerbuds of the acacia farnesiana when smelled at alone it has an intense violet odor and is rather sickly sweet it is procured by maceration from the acacia farnesiana the purified fat is melted into which the flowers are thrown and left to digest for several hours the spent flowers are removed and fresh are added eight or ten times until sufficient richness of perfume is obtained as many flowers are used as the grease will cover when they are put into it in a liquid state after being strained and the pomade has been kept at a heat sufficient only to retain its liquidity all impurities will subside by standing for a few days finally cooled it is the cassie pomade of commerce the huile de cassie or fat oil of cassie is prepared in a similar manner substituting the oil of egyptian ben nut olive oil or almond oil in place of suet both these preparations are obviously only a solution of the true essential oil of cassie flowers in the neutral fatty body europe may shortly be expecting to import a similar scented pomade from south australia derived from the wattle a plant that belongs to the same genus as the a farnesiana and which grows most luxuriantly in australia mutton fat being cheap and the wattle plentiful a profitable trade may be anticipated in curing the flowers c to prepare the extract of cassie take six pounds of no 24 best quality cassie pomade and place upon it one gallon of the best rectified spirit as sent out by bowerbank of bishopsgate after it has digested for three weeks or a month at a summer heat it is fit to draw from the pomatum and if good has a beautiful green color and rich flowery smell of the cassie blossom all extracts made by this processmaceration or as it may be called cold infusion give a more natural smell of the flowers to the result than by merely dissolving the essential oil procured by distillation in the spirit moreover where the odor of the flower exists in only very minute quantities as in the present instance and with violet jasmine c it is the only practical mode of proceeding in this and all other similar cases the pomatum must be cut up into very small pieces after the domestic manner of chopping suet prior to its being infused in the alcohol the action of the mixture is simply a change of place in the odoriferous matter which leaves the fat body by the superior attraction or affinity as the chemists say of the spirits of wine in which it freely dissolves the major part of the extract can be poured or drawn off the pomatum without trouble but it still retains a portion in the interstices which requires time to drain away and this must be assisted by placing the pomatum in a large funnel supported by a bottle in order to collect the remainder finally all the pomatum which is now called washed pomatum is to be put into a tin which tin must be set into hot water for the purpose of melting its contents when the pomatum thus becomes liquefied any extract that is still in it rises to the surface and can be skimmed off or when the pomatum becomes cold it can be poured from it the washed pomatum is preserved for use in the manufacture of dressing for the hair for which purpose it is exceedingly well adapted on account of the purity of the grease from which it was originally prepared but more particularly on account of a certain portion of odor which it still retains and were it not used up in this way it would be advisable to put it for a second infusion in spirit and thus a weaker extract could be made serviceable for lower priced articles i cannot leave cassie without recommending it more especially to the notice of perfumers and druggists as an article well adapted for the purpose of the manufacture of essences for the handkerchief and pomades for the hair when diluted with other odors it imparts to the whole such a true flowery fragrance that it is the admiration of all who smell it and has not a little contributed to the great sale which certain proprietary articles have attained we caution the inexperienced not to confound cassie with cassia which has a totally different odor see acacia pomade cedar wood now and then finds a place in a perfumers warehouse when ground it does well to form a body for sachet powder slips of cedar wood are sold as

oil is procured which is a species of neroli and is principally consumed by the manufacturers of eau de cologne citronellaunder this name there is an oil in the market chiefly derived from ceylon and the east indies its true origin we are unable to decide in odor it somewhat resembles citron fruit but is very inferior probably it is procured from one of the grasses of the andropogon genus being cheap it is extensively used for perfuming soap what is now extensively sold as honey soap is a fine yellow soap slightly perfumed with this oil some few use it for scenting grease but it is not much admired in that way clovesevery part of the clove plant caryophyllus aromaticus abounds with aromatic oil but it is most fragrant and plentiful in the unexpanded flowerbud which are the cloves of commerce cloves have been brought into the european market for more than 2000 years the plant is a native of the moluccas and other islands in the china seas the average annual crop of cloves says burnett is from each tree 2 or 212 lbs but a fine tree has been known to yield 125 lbs of this spice in a single season and as 5000 cloves only weigh one pound there must have been at least 625000 flowers upon this single tree illustration clove the oil of cloves may be obtained by expression from the fresh flowerbuds but the usual method of procuring it is by distillation which is carried on to a very great extent in this country few essential oils have a more extensive use in perfumery than that of cloves it combines well with grease soap and spirit and as will be seen in the recipes for the various bouquets given hereafter it forms a leading feature in some of the most popular handkerchief essences rondeletia the guards bouquet c and will be found where least expected for essence of cloves dissolve oil of cloves in the proportion of two ounces of oil to one gallon of spirit dillperfumers are now and then asked for dill water it is however more a druggists article than a perfumers as it is more used for its medicinal qualities than for its odor which by the way is rather pleasant than otherwise some ladies use a mixture of half dill water and half rose water as a simple cosmetic to clear the complexion the oil of dill is procured by submitting the crushed fruit of dill anethum graveolens with water to distillation the oil floats on the surface of the distillate from which it is separated by the funnel in the usual manner after the separation of the oil the water is fit for sale oil of dill may be used with advantage if in small proportions and mixed with other oils for perfuming soap eglantine or sweet briar notwithstanding what the poet robert noyes says in fragrance yields surpassing citron groves or spicy fields does not find a place in the perfumers scentroom except in name this like many other sweetscented plants does not repay the labor of collecting its odor the fragrant part of this plant is destroyed more or less under every treatment that it is put to and hence it is discarded as however the article is in demand by the public a species of fraud is practised upon them by imitating it thus imitation eglantine or essence of sweet briar

plant for its odorous quality used by the perfumer is elderflower water to prepare it take nine pounds of elderflowers free from stalk and introduce it to the still with four gallons of water the first three gallons that come over is all that need be preserved for use one ounce of rectified spirit should be added to each gallon of water distilled and when bottled it is ready for sale other preparations of elder flowers are made such as milk of elder extract of elder c which will be found in their proper place under cosmetics two or three new materials made from this flower will also be given hereafter which are likely to meet with a very large sale on account of the reputed cooling qualities of the ingredients of these we would call attention more particularly to cold cream of elderflowers and to elder oil for the hair the preparations of elderflowers if made according to the pharmacopoeias are perfectly useless as the forms therein given show an utter want of knowledge of the properties of the materials employed fennel foeniculum vulgaredried fennel herb when ground enters into the composition of some sachet powders the oil of fennel in conjunction with other aromatic oils may be used for perfuming soap it is procurable by distillation flag sweet acorus calamusthe roots or rhizome of the sweet flag yield by distillation a pleasantsmelling oil 1 cwt of the rhizome will thus yield one pound of oil it can be used according to the pleasure of the manufacturer in scenting grease soap or for extracts but requires other sweet oils with it to hide its origin geranium pelargonium odoratissimum roseleaf geraniumthe leaves of this plant yield by distillation a very agreeable rosysmelling oil so much resembling real otto of rose that it is used very extensively for the adulteration of that valuable oil and is grown very largely for that express purpose it is principally cultivated in the south of france and in turkey by the rosegrowers in the department of seineetoise at montfortlamaury in france hundreds of acres of it may be seen growing 1 cwt of leaves will yield about two ounces of essential oil used to adulterate otto of rose it is in its turn itself adulterated with ginger grass oil andropogon and thus formerly was very difficult to procure genuine on account of the increased cultivation of the plant it is now however easily procured pure some samples are greenishcolored others nearly white but we prefer that of a brownish tint when dissolved in rectified spirit in the proportion of about six ounces to the gallon it forms the extract of roseleaf geranium of the shops a word or two is necessary about the oil of geranium as much confusion is created respecting it in consequence of there being an oil under the name of geranium but which in reality is derived from the andropogon nardus cultivated in the moluccas this said andropogon geranium oil can be used to adulterate the true geranium and hence we suppose its nomenclature in the drug markets the genuine roseleaf geranium oil fetches about 6s per ounce while the andropogon oil is not worth more than that sum per pound and we may observe here that the perfuming essential oils are best purchased through the wholesale perfumers as from the nature of their trade they have a better knowledge and means of obtaining the real article than the drugbroker on account of the pleasing odor of the true oil of roseleaf geranium it is a valuable article for perfuming many materials and appears to give the public great satisfaction heliotropeeither by maceration or enfleurage with clarified fat we may obtain this fine odor from the flowers of the heliotrope peruvianum or h grandiflorum exquisite as the odor of this plant is at present it is not applied to use by the manufacturing perfumer this we think rather a singular fact especially as the perfume is powerful and the flowers abundant we should like to hear of some experiments being tried with this plant for procuring its odor in this country and for that purpose now suggest the mode of operation which would most likely lead to successful results for a small trial in the first instance which can be managed by any person having the run of a garden we will say procure an ordinary gluepot now in common use which melts the material by the boiling of water it is in fact a waterbath in chemical parlanceone capable of holding a pound or more of melted fat at the season when the flowers are in bloom obtain half a pound of fine mutton suet melt the suet and strain it through a close hairsieve allow the liquefied fat as it falls from the sieve to drop into cold spring water this operation granulates and washes the blood and membrane from it in order to start with a perfectly inodorous grease the melting and granulation process may be repeated three or four times finally remelt the fat and cast it into a pan to free it from adhering water now put the clarified suet into the macerating pot and place it in such a position near the fire of the greenhouse or elsewhere that will keep it warm enough to be liquid into the fat throw as many flowers as you can and there let them remain for twentyfour hours at this time strain the fat from the spent flowers and add fresh ones repeat this operation for a week we expect at the last straining the fat will have become very highly perfumed and when cold may be justly termed pomade la heliotrope the cold pomade being chopped up like suet for a pudding is now to be put into a widemouthed bottle and covered with spirits as highly rectified as can be obtained and left to digest for a week or more the spirit then strained off will be highly perfumed in reality it will be extract of heliotrope a delightful perfume for the handkerchief the rationale of the operation is simple enough the fat body has a strong affinity or attraction for the odorous body or essential oil of the flowers and it therefore absorbs it by contact and becomes itself perfumed in the second operation the spirit has a much greater attraction for the fragrant principle than the fatty matter the former therefore becomes perfumed at the expense of the latter the same experiment may be repeated with almond oil substituted for the fat the experiment here hinted at may be varied with any flowers that there are to spare indeed by having the macerating bath larger than was mentioned above an excellent millefleur pomade and essence might be produced from every conservatory in the kingdom and thus we may receive another enjoyment from the cultivation of flowers beyond their beauty of form and color we hope that those of our readers who feel inclined to try experiments of this nature will not be deterred by saying they are not worth the trouble it must be remembered that very fine essences realize in the london perfumery warehouses 16s per pint of 16 ounces and that fine floweryscented pomades fetch the same sum per pound if the experiments are successful they should be published as then we may hope to establish a new and important manufacture in this country but we are digressing the odor of heliotrope resembles a mixture of almonds and vanilla and is well imitated thus extract of heliotrope spirituous extract of vanilla 12 pint french rose pomatum 14 orangeflower pomatum 2 oz ambergris 1 oz essential oil of almonds 5 drops a preparation made in this manner under the name of extract de heliotrope is that which is sold in the shops of paris and london and is really a very nice perfume passing well with the public for a genuine extract of heliotrope honeysuckle or woodbine copious of flower the woodbine pale and wan but well compensating her sickly looks with nevercloying odors what the poet cowper here says is quite true nevertheless it is a flower that is not used in practical perfumery though there is no reason for abandoning it the experiments suggested for obtaining the odor of heliotrope and millefleur thousand flowers are also applicable to this as also to hawthorn a good imitation of honeysuckle is made thus spirituous extract of rose pomatum 1 pint violet 1 tubereuse 1 extract of vanilla 14 tolu 14 otto neroli 10 drops almonds 5 the prime cost of a perfume made in this manner would probably be too high to meet the demand of a retail druggist in such cases it may be diluted with rectified spirit to the extent to make it pay and will yet be a nice perfume the formula generally given herein for odors is in anticipation that when bottled they will retail for at least eighteenpence the fluid ounce which is the average price put on the finest perfumery by the manufacturers of london and paris hoveniaa perfume under this name is sold to a limited extent but if it did not smell better than the plant hovenia dulcis or h inequalis a native of japan it would not sell at all the article in the market is made thus rectified spirit 1 quart rosewater 12 pint otto lemons 12 oz otto of rose 1 drachm cloves 12 neroli 10 drops first dissolve the ottos in the spirit then add the rosewater after filtration it is ready for sale when compounds of this kind do not become bright by passing through blottingpaper the addition of a little carbonate of magnesia prior to filtering effectually clears them the water in the above recipe is only added in order that the article produced may be retailed at a moderate price and would of course be better without that universal friend jasmine luxuriant above all the jasmine throwing wide her elegant sweets this flower is one of the most prized by the perfumer its odor is delicate and sweet and so peculiar that it is without comparison and as such cannot be imitated when the flowers of the jasminum odoratissimum are distilled repeatedly using the water of distillation over fresh flowers the essential oil of jasmine may be procured it is however exceedingly rare on account of the enormous cost of production there was a fine sample of six ounces exhibited in the tunisian department of the crystal palace the price of which was 9l the fluid ounce the plant is the yasmyn of the arabs from which our name is derived in the perfumers laboratory the method of obtaining the odor is by absorption or as the french term it enfleurage that is by spreading a mixture of pure lard and suet on a glass tray and sticking the freshgathered flowers all over it leaving them to stand a day or so and repeating the operation with fresh flowersthe grease absorbs the odor finally the pomade is scraped off the glass or slate melted at as low a temperature as possible and strained oils strongly impregnated with the fragrance are also prepared much in the same way layers of cotton wool previously steeped in oil of ben obtained by pressure from the blanched nuts of the moringa oleifera are covered with jasmine flowers which is repeated several times finally the cotton or linen cloths which some perfumers use are squeezed under a press the jasmine oil thus produced is the huile antique au jasmin of the french houses the extract of jasmine is prepared by pouring rectified spirit on the jasmine pomade or oil and allowing them to remain together for a fortnight at a summer heat the best quality extract requires two pounds of pomatum to every quart of spirit the same can be done with the oil of jasmine if the pomade is used it must be cut up fine previously to being put into the spirit if the oil is used it must be shaken well together every two or more hours otherwise on account of its specific gravity the oil separates and but little surface is exposed to the spirit after the extract is strained off the washed pomatum or oil is still useful if remelted in the composition of pomatum for the hair and gives more satisfaction to a customer than any of the creams and balms c c made up and scented with essential oils the one smells of the flower the other a nondescript illustration jasmine the extract of jasmine enters into the composition of a great many of the most approved handkerchief perfumes sold by the english and french perfumers extract of jasmine is sold for the handkerchief often pure but is one of those scents which though very gratifying at first becomes what people call sickly after exposure to the oxidizing influence of the air but if judiciously mixed with other perfumes of an opposite character is sure to please the most fastidious customer jonquilthe scent of the jonquil is very beautiful for perfumery purposes it is however but little cultivated in comparison with jasmine and tubereuse it is prepared exactly as jasmine the parisian perfumers sell a mixture which they call extract of jonquil the plant however only plays the part of a godfather to the offspring giving it its name the socalled jonquil is made thus spirituous extract of jasmine pomade 1 pint tubereuse 1 fleur dorange 12 extract of vanilla 2 fluid ounces laurelby distillation from the berries of the laurus nobilis and from the leaves of the laurus cerasus an oil and perfumed water are procurable of a very beautiful and fragrant character commercially however it is disregarded as from the similarity of odor to the oil distilled from the bitter almond it is rarely if ever used by the perfumer the latter being more economical lavenderthe climate of england appears to be better adapted for the perfect development of this fine old favorite perfume than any other on the globe the ancients says burnett employed the flowers and the leaves to aromatize their baths and to give a sweet scent to water in which they washed hence the generic name of the plant lavandula lavender is grown to an enormous extent at mitcham in surrey which is the seat of its production in a commercial point of view very large quantities are also grown in france but the fine odor of the british produce realizes in the market four times the price of that of continental growth burnett says that the oil of lavandula spica is more pleasant than that derived from the other species but this statement must not mislead the purchaser to buy the french spike lavender as it is not worth a tenth of that derived from the lavandul ver halfahundred weight of good lavender flowers yield by distillation from 14 to 16 oz of essential oil all the inferior descriptions of oil of lavender are used for perfuming soaps and greases but the best that obtained from the mitcham lavender is entirely used in the manufacture of what is called lavender water but which more properly should be called essence or extract of lavender to be in keeping with the nomenclature of other essences prepared with spirit the number of formul published for making a liquid perfume of lavender is almost endless but the whole of them may be resolved into essence of lavender simple essence of lavender compound and lavender water there are two methods of making essence of lavender1 by distilling a mixture of essential oil of lavender and rectified spirit and the other2 by merely mixing the oil and the spirit together the first process yields the finest quality it is that which is adopted by the firm of smyth and nephew whose reputation for this article is such that it gives a good character in foreign markets especially india to all products of lavender of english manufacture lavender essence that which is made by the still is quite white while that by mixture only always has a yellowish tint which by age becomes darker and resinous smyths lavender to produce a very fine distillate take otto of english lavender 4 oz rectified spirit 60 over proof 5 pints rosewater 1 pint mix and distil five pints for sale such essence of lavender is expensive but at 10s a pint of 14 oz there is a margin for profit it not being convenient to the general dealer to sell distilled lavender essence the following form by mixture will produce a firstrate article and nearly as white as the above essence of lavender otto of lavender 312 oz rectified spirit 2 quarts the perfumers retail price for such quality is 8s per pint of 14 oz many perfumers and druggists in making lavender water or essence use a small portion of bergamot with an idea of improving its qualitya very erroneous opinion moreover such lavender quickly discolors lavender watertake english oil of lavender 4 oz spirit 3 quarts rosewater 1 pint filter as above and it is ready for sale common lavender watersame form as the above substituting french lavender for the british recipes for rondeletia lavender bouquet and other lavender compounds will be given when we come to speak of compound perfumes which will be reserved until we have finished explaining the method of making the simple essences lemonthis fine perfume is abstracted from the citrus limonum by expression from the rind of the fruit the otto of lemons in the market is principally from messina where there are hundreds of acres of lemon groves otto of lemons like all the ottos of the citrus family is rapidly prone to oxidation when in contact with air and exposure to light a high temperature is also detrimental and as such is the case it should be preserved in a cool cellar most of the samples from the gasheated shelves of the druggists shops are as much like essence of turpentine to the smell as that of lemons rancid oil of lemons may in a great measure be purified by agitation with warm water and final decantation when new and good lemon otto may be freely used in combination with rosemary cloves and caraway for perfuming powders for the nursery from its rapid oxidation it should not be used for perfuming grease as it assists rather than otherwise all fats to turn rancid hence pomatums so perfumed will not keep well in the manufacture of other compound perfumes it should be dissolved in spirit in the proportion of six to eight ounces of oil to one gallon of spirit there is a large consumption of otto of lemons in the manufacture of eau de cologne that farina uses it is easily discovered by adding a few drops of liq ammoni fort to half an ounce of his eau de cologne the smell of the lemon is thereby brought out in a remarkable manner perhaps it is not out of place here to remark that in attempts to discover the composition of certain perfumes we are greatly assisted by the use of strong liq ammoni certain of the essential oils combining with the ammonia allow those which do not do so if present in the compound to be smelt lemon grassaccording to pereira the otto in the market under this name is derived from the andropogon schoenanthus a species of grass which grows abundantly in india it is cultivated to a large extent in ceylon and in the moluccas purposely for the otto which from the plant is easily procured by distillation lemon grass otto or as it is sometimes called oil of verbena on account of its similarity of odor to that favorite plant is imported into this country in old english porter and stout bottles it is very powerful well adapted for perfuming soaps and greases but its principal consumption is in the manufacture of artificial essence of verbena from its comparatively low price great strength and fine perfume when diluted the lemon grass otto may be much more used than at present with considerable advantage to the retail shopkeeper lilacthe fragrance of the flowers of this ornamental shrub is well known the essence of lilac is obtained either by the process of maceration or enfleurage with grease and afterwards treating the pomatum thus formed with rectified spirit in the same manner as previously described for cassie the odor so much resembles tubereuse as to be frequently used to adulterate the latter the demand for tubereuse being at all times greater than the supply a beautiful imitation of essence of white lilac may be compounded thus spirituous extract from tubereuse pomade 1 pint of orangeflower pomade 14 otto of almonds 3 drops extract of civet 12 oz the civet is only used to give permanence to the perfume of the handkerchief lilythe manufacturing perfumer rejects the advice of the inspired writer to consider the lilies of the field rich as they are in odor they are not cultivated for their perfume if lilies are thrown into oil of sweet almonds or ben oil they impart to it their sweet smell but to obtain anything like fragrance the infusion must be repeated a dozen times with the same oil using fresh flowers for each infusion after standing a day or so the oil being shaken with an equal quantity of spirit for a week gives up its odor to the alcohol and thus extract of lilies may be made but how it is made is thus imitation lily of the valley extract of tubereuse 12 pint jasmine 1 oz fleur dorange 2 oz vanilla 3 oz cassie 14 pint rose 14 otto of

called sachets a strongsmelling essential oil may be procured from it by distillation but it is rarely used magnoliathe perfume of this flower is superb practically however it is of little use to the manufacturer the large size of the blossoms and their comparative scarcity prevents their being used but a very excellent imitation of its odor is made as under and is that which is found in the

ottos from the different species of thyme of which the marjoram is one one hundred weight of the dry herb yields about ten ounces of the otto oringeat oil is extensively used for perfuming soap but more in france than in england it is the chief ingredient used by gelle frres of paris for scenting their tablet monstre soap so common in the london shops meadow sweeta sweetsmelling otto can be produced by distilling the spira ulmaria but it is not used by perfumers melissa see balm mignonettebut for the exquisite odor of this little flower it would scarcely be known otherwise than as a weed sweet as it is in its natural state and prolific in odor we are not able to maintain its characteristic smell as an essence like many others during separation from the plant the fragrance is more or less modified though not perfect it still reminds the sense of the odor of the flowers to give it that sweetness which it appears to want a certain quantity of violet is added to bring it up to the market odor as this plant is so very prolific in odor we think something might be done with it in england especially as it flourishes as well in this country as in france and we desire to see flower farms and organized perfumatories established in the british isles for the extraction of essences and the manufacture of pomade and oils of such flowers as are indigenous or that thrive in the open fields of our country besides opening up a new field of enterprise and good investment for capital it would give healthy employment to many women and children open air employment for the young is of no little consideration to maintain the stamina of the future generation for it cannot be denied that our factory system and confined cities are prejudicial to the physical condition of the human family to return from our digression the essence of mignonette or as it is more often sold under the name of extrait de rzda is prepared by infusing the rzda pomade in rectified spirit in the proportion of one pound of pomade to one pint of spirit allowing them to digest together for a fortnight when the essence is filtered off the pomade one ounce of extrait dambr is added to every pint this is done to give permanence to the odor upon the handkerchief and does not in any way alter its odor miribanethe french name for artificial essence of almond see almond mintall the menthid yield fragrant ottos by distillation the otto of the spearmint m viridis is exceedingly powerful and very valuable for perfuming soap in conjunction with other perfumes perfumers use the ottos of the mint

wood 1 pint myrrh 1 oz oil of peppermint 12 dr spear mint 14 dr cloves 10 drops roses 10 modifications of this formula can be readily suggested but the main object is to retain the mint ottos as they have more power than any other aromatic to overcome the smell of tobacco mouthwashes it must be remembered are as much used for rinsing the mouth after smoking as for a dentifrice myrtlea very fragrant otto may be procured by distilling both flowers and leaves of the common myrtle one hundredweight will yield about five ounces of the volatile oil the demand for essence of myrtle being very limited the odor as found in the perfumers shops is very rarely a genuine article but it is imitated thus imitation essence of myrtle extract of vanilla 12 pint roses 1 extract of fleur dorange 12 pint tubereuse 12 jasmine 2 oz mix and allow to stand for a fortnight it is then fit for bottling and is a perfume that gives a great deal of satisfaction myrtleflower water is sold in france under the name of eau dange and may be prepared like rose elder or other flower waters neroli or orangeflowertwo distinct odors are procurable from the orangeblossom varying according to the methods adopted for procuring them this difference of perfume from the same flower is a great advantage to the manufacturer this curious fact is worthy of inquiry by the chemical philosopher it is not peculiar to the orangeflower but applies to many others especially roseprobably to all flowers when orangeflowers are treated by the maceration process that is by infusion in a fatty body we procure orangeflower pomatum its strength and quality being regulated by the number of infusions of the flower made in the same grease by digesting this orangeflower pomatum in rectified spirits in the proportions of from six pounds to eight pounds of pomade to a gallon of spirit for about a fortnight at a summer heat we obtain the extrait de fleur dorange or extract of orangeflowers a handkerchief perfume surpassed by none in this state its odor resembles the original so much that with closed eyes the best judge could not distinguish the scent of the extract from that of the flower the peculiar flowery odor of this extract renders it valuable to perfumers not only to sell in a pure state but slightly modified with other extraits passes for sweet pea magnolia c which it slightly resembles in fragrance illustration orange now when orangeflowers are distilled with water we procure the otto of the blossom which is known commercially as oil of neroli the neroli procured from the flowers of the citrus aurantium is considered to be the finest quality and is called neroli petale the next quality neroli bigarade is derived from the blossoms of the citrus bigaradia or seville orange another quality which is considered inferior to the preceding is the neroli petit grain obtained by distilling the leaves and the young unripe fruit of the different species of the citrus the petale and bigarade neroli are used to an enormous extent in the manufacture of eau de cologne and other handkerchief perfumes the petit grain is mainly consumed for scenting soap to form the esprit de neroli dissolve 112 oz of neroli petale in one gallon of rectified spirits although very agreeable and extensively used in the manufacture of bouquets it has no relation to the flowery odor of the extrait de fleur dorange as derived from the same flowers by maceration in fact it has as different an odor as though obtained from another plant yet in theory both these extraits are but alcoholic solutions of the otto of the flower the water used for distillation in procuring the neroli when well freed from the oil is imported into this country under the name of eau de fleur dorange and may be used like elderflower and rosewater for the skin and as an eye lotion it is remarkable for its fine fragrance and it is astonishing that it is not more used being moderate in price see syringa nutmegthe beautiful odor of the nutmeg is familiar to all though an otto can be drawn from them of a very fragrant character it is rarely used in perfumery the ground nuts are however used advantageously in the combinations of scented powders used for scent bagssee sachets powders olibanum is a gum resin used to a limited extent in this country in the manufacture of incense and pastilles it is chiefly interesting as being one of those odoriferous bodies of which frequent mention is made in the holy volumec it is believed says burnett to have been one of the ingredients in the sweet incense of the jews and it is still burnt as incense in the greek and romish churches where the diffusion of such odors round the altar forms a part of the prescribed religious service olibanum is partially soluble in alcohol and like most of the balsams probably owes its perfume to a peculiar odoriferous body associated with the benzoic acid it contains for making the tincture or extract of olibanum take 1 pound of the gum to 1 gallon of the spirit orangeunder the title neroli we have already spoken of the odoriferous principle of the orangeblossom we have now to speak of what is known in the market as essence of orange or as it is more frequently termed essence of portugala name however which we cannot admit in a classified list of the odors of plants the otto of orangepeel or odoriferous principle of the orange fruit is procured by expression and by distillation the peel is rasped in order to crush the little vessels or sacs that imprison the otto its abundance in the peel is shown by pinching a piece near the flame of a candle the otto that spirts out ignites with a brilliant illumination it has many uses in perfumery and from its refreshing fragrance finds many admirers it is the leading ingredient in what is sold as lisbon water and eau de portugal the following is a very useful form for preparing lisbon water rectified spirit not less than 60 over proof 1 gallon otto of orange peel 3 oz lemon peel 3 oz rose 14 oz this is a form for eau de portugal rectified spirit 60 over proof 1 gallon essential oil of orange peel 6 oz lemon peel 1 oz lemon grass 14 oz bergamot 1 oz otto of rose 14 oz it should be noted that these perfumes are never to be filled into wet bottles for if in any way damp from water a minute portion of the ottos are separated which gives an opalescent appearance to the mixture indeed all bottles should be spirit rinsed prior to being filled with any perfume but especially with those containing essences of orange or lemon peel orris properly iristhe dried rhizome of iris florentina has a very pleasant odor which for the want of a better comparison is said to resemble the smell of violets it is however exceedingly derogatory to the charming aroma of that modest flower when such invidious comparisons are made nevertheless the perfume of iris root is good and well worthy of the place it has obtained as a perfuming substance the powder of orris root is very extensively used in the manufacture of sachet powders toothpowder c it fathers that celebrated oriental herb known as odonto for tincture of orris or as the perfumers call it extract of orris take orris root crushed 7 lbs rectified spirits 1 gallon after standing together for about a fortnight the extract is fit to take off it requires considerable time to drain away and to prevent loss the remainder of the orris should be placed in the tincture press this extract enters into the composition of many of the most celebrated bouquets such as jockey club and others but is never sold alone because its odor although grateful is not sufficiently good to stand public opinion upon its own merits but in combination its value is very great possessing little aroma itself yet it has the power of strengthening the odor of other fragrant bodies like the flint and steel which though comparatively incombustible readily fire inflammable bodies palmthe odor of palm oilthe fat oil of commerceis due to a fragrant principle which it contains by infusion in alcohol the odoriferous body is dissolved and resembles to a certain extent the tincture of orris or of extract of violet but is very indifferent and is not likely to be brought into use though several attempts have been made to render it of service when the cultivation of the violets have failed from bad seasons patchoulypogostemon patchouly lindley plectranthus crassifolius burnett is an herb that grows extensively in india and china it somewhat resembles our garden sage in its growth and form but the leaves are not so fleshy illustration patchouly the odor of patchouly is due to an otto contained in the leaves and stems and is readily procured by distillation 1 cwt of good herb will yield about 28 oz of the essential oil which is of a dark brown color and of a density about the same as that of oil of sandal wood which it resembles in its physical character its odor is the most powerful of any derived from the botanic kingdom hence if mixed in the proportion of measure for measure it completely covers the smell of all other bodies extract of patchouly rectified spirit 1 gallon otto of patchouly 114 oz rose 14 oz the essence of patchouly thus made is that which is found in the perfumers shops of paris and london although few perfumes have had such a fashionable run yet when smelled at in its pure state it is far from agreeable having a kind of mossy or musty odor analogous to lycopodium or as some say it smells of old coats the characteristic smell of chinese or indian ink is due to some admixture of this herb the origin of the use of patchouly as a perfume in europe is curious a few years ago real indian shawls bore an extravagant price and purchasers could always distinguish them by their odor in fact they were perfumed with patchouly the french manufacturers had for some time successfully imitated the indian fabric but could not impart the odor at length they discovered the secret and began to import the plant to perfume articles of their make and thus palm off homespun shawls as real indian from this origin the perfumers have brought it into use patchouly herb is extensively used for scenting drawers in which linen is kept for this purpose it is best to powder the leaves and put them into muslin sacks covered with silk after the manner of the oldfashioned lavenderbag in this state it is very efficacious in preventing the clothes from being attacked by moths several combinations of patchouly will be given in the recipes for bouquets and nosegays pea sweeta very fine odor may be abstracted from the flowers of the chickvetch by maceration in any fatty body and then digesting the pomade produced in spirit it is however rarely manufactured because a very close imitation of the essence of sweet pea can be prepared thus extract of tuberose 12 pint fleur dorange 12 rose from pomatum 12 vanilla 1 oz scents like sounds appear to influence the olfactory nerve in certain definite degrees there is as it were an octave of odors like an octave in music certain odors coincide like the keys of an instrument such as almond heliotrope vanilla and orangeblossoms blend together each producing different degrees of a nearly similar impression again we have citron lemon orangepeel and verbena forming a higher octave of smells which blend in a similar manner the metaphor is completed by what we are pleased to call semiodors such as rose and rose geranium for the half note petty grain neroli a black key followed by fleur dorange then we have patchouli sandalwood and vitivert and many others running into each other from the odors already known we may produce by uniting them in proper proportion the smell of almost any flower except jasmine the odor of some flowers resembles others so nearly that we are almost induced to believe them to be the same thing or at least if not evolved from the plant as such to become so by the action of the airoxidation it is known that some actually are identical in composition although produced from totally different plants such as camphor turpentine rosemary hence we may presume that chemistry will sooner or later produce one from the other for with many it is merely an atom of water or an atom of oxygen that causes the difference it would be a grand thing to produce otto of roses from oil of rosemary or from the rose geranium oil and theory indicates its possibility the essential oil of almonds in a bottle that contains a good deal of airoxygen and but a very little of the oil spontaneously passes into another odoriferous body benzoic acid which is seen in crystals to form over the dry parts of the flask this is a natural illustration of this idea in giving the recipe for sweet pea as above we form it with the impression that its odor resembles the orangeblossom which similarity is approached nearer by the addition of the rose and tuberose the vanilla is used merely to give permanence to the scent on the handkerchief and this latter body is chosen in preference to extract of musk or ambergris which would answer the same purpose of giving permanence to the more volatile ingredients because the vanilla strikes the same key of the olfactory nerve as the orangeblossom and thus no new idea of a different scent is brought about as the perfume dies off from the handkerchief when perfumes are not mixed upon this principle then we hear that such and such a perfume becomes sickly or faint after they have been on the handkerchief a short time pineappleboth dr hoffman and dr lyon playfair have fallen into some error in their inferences with regard to the application of this odor in perfumery after various practical experiments conducted in a large perfumatory we have come to the conclusion that it cannot be so applied simply because when the essence of pineapple is smelled at the vapor produces an involuntary action of the larynx producing cough when exceedingly dilute even in the infinitesimal portions it still produces disagreeable irritation of the airpipes which if prolonged such as is expected if used upon a handkerchief is followed by intense headache it is obvious therefore that the legitimate use of the essence of pineapple butyric ether cannot be adapted with benefit to the manufacturing perfumer although invaluable to the confectioner as a flavoring material what we have here said refers to the artificial essence of pineapple or butyrate of ethyloxide which if very much diluted with alcohol resembles the smell of pineapple and hence its name but how far the same observations are applicable to the true essential oil from the fruit or epidermis of the pineapple remains to be seen when we procure it as the west indian pineapples are now coming freely into the market the day is probably not distant when demonstrative experiments can be tried but hitherto it must be remembered our experiments have only been performed with a body resembling in smell the true essential oil of the fruit the physical action of all ethers upon the human body is quite sufficient to prevent their application in perfumery however useful in confectionary which it is understood has to deal with another of the sensesnot of smell but of taste the commercial essence of pineapple or pineapple oil and jargonelle pearoil are admitted only to be labelled such but really are certain organic acid ethers for the present then perfumers must only look on these bodies as so many lines in the poetry of science which for the present are without practical application in his art pinkdianthus caryophyllusthe clove pink emits a most fragrant odor especially at night says darwin the lavish pink that scents the garden round is

oil is procured resembling in some slight degree the fragrance of the rose and hence its name at one time that is prior to the cultivation of the roseleaf geranium the distillates from rosewood and from the root of the genista canariensis canaryrosewood were principally drawn for the adulteration of real otto of roses but as the geranium oil answers so much better the oil of rhodium has fallen into disuse hence its comparative scarcity in the market at the present day though our grandfathers knew it well one cwt of wood yields about three ounces of oil ground rosewood is valuable as a basis in the manufacture of sachet powders for perfuming the wardrobe the french have given the name jacaranda to rosewood under the idea that the plant called jacaranda by the brazilians yields it which is

ogilvie this queen of the garden loses not its diadem in the perfuming world the oil of roses or as it is commonly called the otto or attar of roses is procured contrary to so many opposite statements simply by distilling the roses with water the otto or attar of rose of commerce is derived from the rosa centifolia provincialis very extensive rose farms exist at adrianople turkey in europe at broussa now famous as the residence of abdelkader and at uslak turkey in asia also at ghazepore in india the cultivators in turkey are principally the christian inhabitants of the low countries of the balkan between selimno and carloya as far as philippopolis in bulgaria about 200 miles from constantinople in good seasons this district yields 75000 ounces but in bad seasons only 20000 to 30000 ounces of attar are obtained it is estimated that it requires at least 2000 rose blooms to yield one drachm of otto the otto slightly varies in odor from different districts many places furnish an otto which solidifies more readily than others and therefore this is not a sure guide of purity though many consider it such that which was exhibited in the crystal palace of 1851 as from ghazepore in india obtained the prize attar of roses made in cashmere is considered superior to any other a circumstance not surprising as according to hugel the flower is here produced of surpassing fragrance as well as beauty a large quantity of rosewater twice distilled is allowed to run off into an open vessel placed over night in a cool running stream and in the morning the oil is found floating on the surface in minute specks which are taken off very carefully by means of a blade of swordlily when cool it is of a dark green color and as hard as resin not becoming liquid at a temperature about that of boiling water between 500 and 600 pounds weight of leaves is required to produce one ounce of the attarindian encyclopdia pure otto of roses from its cloying sweetness has not many admirers when diluted however there is nothing to equal it in odor especially if mixed in soap to form rose soap or in pure spirit to form the esprit de rose the soap not allowing the perfume to evaporate very fast we cannot be surfeited with the smell of the otto the finest preparation of rose as an odor is made at grasse in france here the flowers are not treated for the otto but are subjected to the process of maceration in fat or in oil as described under jasmine heliotrope c the rose pomade thus made if digested in alcohol say 8 lbs of no 24 pomade to one gallon of spirit yields an esprit de rose of the first order very superior to that which is made by the addition of otto to spirit it is difficult to account for this difference but it is sufficiently characteristic to form a distinct odor see the article on fleur dorange and neroli pp 77 78 which have similar qualities previously described the esprit de rose made from the french rose pomade is never sold retail by the perfumer he reserves this to form part of his recherche bouquets some wholesale druggists have however been selling it now for some time to country practitioners for them to form extemporaneous rosewater which it does to great perfection roses are cultivated to a large extent in england near mitcham in surrey for perfumers use to make rosewater in the season when successive crops can be got which is about the end of june or the early part of july they are gathered as soon as the dew is off and sent to town in sacks when they arrive they are immediately spread out upon a cool floor otherwise if left in a heap they heat to such an extent in two or three hours as to be quite spoiled there is no organic matter which so rapidly absorbs oxygen and becomes heated spontaneously as a mass of freshly gathered roses to preserve these roses the london perfumers immediately pickle them for this purpose the leaves are separated from the stalks and to every bushel of flowers equal to about six pounds weight one pound of common salt is thoroughly rubbed in the salt absorbs the water existing in the petals and rapidly becomes brine reducing the whole to a pasty mass which is finally stowed away in casks in this way they will keep almost any length of time without the fragrance being seriously injured a good rosewater can be prepared by distilling 12 lbs of pickled roses and 212 gallons of water draw off two gallons the product will be the doubledistilled rosewater of the shops the rosewater that is imported from the south of france is however very superior in odor to any that can be produced here as it is a residuary product of the distillation of roses for procuring the attar it has a richness of aroma which appears to be inimitable with englishgrown roses there are four modifications of essence of

with other ottos for scenting soap eau de cologne cannot be made without it and in the once famous hungary water it is the leading ingredient the following is the composition of hungary water

clergymen and orators while speaking for any time would derive great benefit from perfuming their handkerchief with hungary water or eau de cologne as the rosemary they contain excites the mind to vigorous action sufficient of the stimulant being inhaled by occasionally wiping the face with the handkerchief wetted with these waters shakspeare giving us the key we can understand how it is that

valuable in combination for scenting soap dried sageleaves ground will compound well for sachets santalsantalum album the santal tree perfumes when riven the axe that laid it low cameron this is an old favorite with the lovers of scent it is the wood that possesses the odor the finest santalwood grows in the island of timor and the santalwood islands where it is extensively cultivated for the chinese market in the religious ceremonies of the brahmins hindoos and chinese santalwood is burned by way of incense to an extent almost beyond belief the santala grew plentifully in china but the continued offerings to the buddahs have almost exterminated the plant from the celestial empire and such is the demand that it is about to be cultivated in western australia in the expectation of a profitable return which we doubt not will be realized england alone would consume tenfold the quantity it does were its price within the range of other perfuming substances the otto which exists in the santalwood is readily procured by distillation 1 cwt of good wood will yield about 30 ounces of otto illustration santalwood the white ant which is so common in india and china eating into every organic matter that it comes across appears to have no relish for santalwood hence it is frequently made into caskets jewelboxes deedcases c this quality together with its fragrance renders it a valuable article to the cabinetmakers of the east the otto of santal is remarkably dense and is above all others oleaginous in its appearance and when good is of a dark straw color when dissolved in spirit it enters into the composition of a great many of the oldfashioned bouquets such as marechale and others the formul of which will be given hereafter perfumers thus make what is called extrait de bois de santal rectified spirits 7 pints esprit de rose 1 pint essential oil ie otto of santal 3 oz all those extracts made by dissolving the otto in alcohol are nearly white or at least only slightly tinted by the color of the oil used when a perfumer has to impart a delicate odeur to a ladys mouchoir which in some instances costs no end of money and is an object at any cost to retain unsullied it behooves his reputation to sell an article that will not stain a delicate white fabric now when a perfume is made in a direct manner from any wood or herb as tinctures are made that is by infusion in alcohol there is obtained besides the odoriferous substance a solution of coloring and extractive matter which is exceedingly detrimental to its fragrance besides seriously staining any cambric handkerchief that it may be used upon and for this reason this latter method should never be adopted except for use upon silk handkerchiefs the odor of santal assimilates well with rose and hence prior to the cultivation of roseleaf geranium it was used to adulterate otto of roses but is now but seldom used for that purpose by a phonetic error santal is often printed sandal and sandel sassafrassome of the perfumers of germany use a tincture of the wood of the laurus sassafras in the manufacture of hairwashes and other nostrums but as in our opinion it has rather a physicky smell than flowery we cannot recommend the german recipes the eau athenienne notwithstanding has some reputation as a hairwater but is little else than a weak tincture of sassafras spikefrench oil of lavender which is procured from the lavandula spica is generally called oil of spike see lavender storax and tolu are used in perfumery in the same way as benzoin namely by solution in spirit as a tincture an ounce of tincture of storax tolu or benzoin being added to a pound of any very volatile perfume gives a degree of permanence to it and makes it last longer on the handkerchief than it otherwise would thus when any perfume is made by the solution of an otto in spirit it is usual to add to it a small portion of a substance which is less volatile such as extract of musk extract of vanilla ambergris storax tolu orris vitivert or benzoin the manufacturer using his judgment and discretion as to which of these materials are to be employed choosing of course those which are most compatible with the odor he is making the power which these bodies have of fixing a volatile substance renders them valuable to the perfumer independent of their aroma which is due in many cases to benzoic acid slightly modified by an esential oil peculiar to each substance and which is taken up by the alcohol together with a portion of resin when the perfume is put upon a handkerchief the most volatile bodies disappear first thus after the alcohol has evaporated the odor of the ottos appear stronger if it contains any resinous body the ottos are held in solution as it were by the resin and thus retained on the fabric supposing a perfume to be made of otto only without any fixing substance then as the perfume dies away the olfactory nerve if tutored will detect its composition for it spontaneously analyzes itself no two ottos having the same volatility thus make a mixture of rose jasmine and patchouly the jasmine predominates first then the rose and lastly the patchouly which will be found hours after the others have disappeared syringathe flowers of the philadelphus coronarius or common garden syringa have an intense odor resembling the orangeblossom so much so that in america the plant is often termed mock orange a great deal of the pomatum sold as pommade surfin la fleur dorange by the manufacturers of cannes is nothing more than fine suet perfumed with syringa blossoms by the maceration process fine syringa pomade could be made in england at a quarter the cost of what is paid for the socalled orange pomatum thymeall the different species of thyme but more particularly the lemon thyme the thymus serpyllum as well as the marjorams origanum c yield by distillation fragrant ottos that are extensively used by manufacturing perfumers for scenting soaps though well adapted for this purpose they do not answer at all in any other combinations both in grease and in spirit all these ottos impart an herby smell very naturally rather than a flowery one and as a consequence they are not considered recherch when any of these herbs are dried and ground they usefully enter into the composition of sachet powders tonquin or tonkathe seeds of the dipterix odorata are the tonquin or coumarouma beans of commerce when fresh they are exceedingly fragrant having an intense odor of newly made hay the anthoxanthum odoratum or sweetsmelling vernal grass to which new hay owes its odor probably yields identically the same fragrant principle and it is remarkable that both tonquin beans and vernal grass while actually growing are nearly scentless but become rapidly aromatic when severed from the parent stock chemically considered tonquin beans are very interesting containing when fresh a fragrant volatile otto to which their odor is principally due benzoic acid a fat oil and a neutral principalcoumarin in perfumery they are valuable as when ground they form with other bodies an excellent and permanent sachet and by infusion in spirit the tincture or extract of tonquin enters into a thousand of the compound essences but on account of its great strength it must be used with caution otherwise people say your perfume is snuffy owing to the predominance of the odor and its wellknown use in the boxes of those who indulge in the titillating dust illustration tonquin extract of tonquin tonquin beans 1 lb rectified spirit 1 gallon digest for a month at a summer heat even after this maceration they are still useful when dried and ground in those compounds known as pot pourri olla podria c the extract of tonquin like extract of orris and extract of vanilla is never sold pure but is only used in the manufacture of compound perfumes it is the leading ingredient in bouquet du champthe field bouquetthe great resemblance of which to the odor of the hayfield renders it a favorite to the lovers of the pastoral tuberoseone of the most exquisite odors with which we are acquainted is obtained by enfleurage from the tuberose flower it is as it were a nosegay in itself and reminds one of that delightful perfume observed in a wellstocked flowergarden at evening close consequently it is much in demand by the perfumers for compounding sweet essences extract of tuberose eight pounds of no 24 tuberose pomatum cut up very fine is to be placed into 1 gallon of the best rectified spirit after standing for three weeks or a month at summer heat and with frequent agitation it is fit to draw off and being strained through cotton wool is ready either for sale or use in the manufacture of bouquets this essence of tuberose like that of jasmine is exceedingly volatile and if sold in its pure state quickly flies off the handkerchief it is therefore necessary to add some fixing ingredient and for this purpose it is best to use one ounce of extract of orris or half an ounce of extract of vanilla to every pint of tuberose vanillathe pod or bean of the vanilla planifolia yields a perfume of rare excellence when good and if kept for some time it becomes covered with an efflorescence of needle crystals possessing properties similar to benzoic acid but differing from it in composition few objects are more beautiful to look upon

open the interior then cut them up in lengths of about a quarter of an inch macerate with occasional agitation for about a month the tincture thus formed will only require straining through cotton to be ready for any use that is required in this state it is rarely sold for a perfume but is consumed in the manufacture of compound odors bouquets or nosegays as they are called extract of vanilla is also used largely in the manufacture of hairwashes which are readily made by mixing the extract of vanilla with either rose orange elder or rosemary water and afterwards filtering we need scarcely mention that vanilla is greatly used by cooks and confectioners for flavoring verbena or vervainethe scented species of this plant the lemon verbena aloysia citriodora hooker gives one of the finest perfumes with which we are acquainted it is well known as yielding a delightful fragrance by merely drawing the hand over the plant some of the little vessels or sacks containing the otto must be crushed in this act as there is little or no odor by merely smelling at the plant the otto which can be extracted from the leaves by distillation with water on account of its high price is scarcely if ever used by the manufacturing perfumer but it is most successfully imitated by mixing the otto of lemon grass andropogon schoenanthus with rectified spirit the odor of which resembles the former to a nicety the following is a good form for making the extract of verbena rectified spirit 1 pint otto of lemon grass 3 drachms lemon peel 2 oz orange peel 12 oz after standing together for a few hours

verveine rectified spirit 1 pint otto of orange peel 1 oz lemon peel 2 oz citron 1 drachm lemon grass 212 drachms extrait de fleur dorange 7 oz tubereuse 7 oz esprit de rose 12 pint this mixture is exceedingly refreshing and is one of the most elegant perfumes that is made being white it does not stain the handkerchief it is best when sold fresh made as by age the citrine oils oxidize and the perfume acquires an ethereal odor and then customers say it is sour the vervaine thus prepared enters into the composition of a great many of the favorite bouquets that are sold under the title court bouquet and others which are mixtures of violet rose and jasmine with verbena or vervaine in different proportions in these preparations as also in eau de portugal and in fact where any of the citrine ottos are used a much finer product is obtained by using grape spirit or brandy in preference to the english corn spirit as a solvent for them nor do they deteriorate so quickly in french spirit as in english whether this be due to the oil of wine oeanthic ether or not we cannot say but think it is so violet the forward violet thus did i chide sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells if not from my loves breath the perfume exhaled by the viola odorata is so universally admired that to speak in its favor would be more than superfluous the demand for the essence of violets is far greater than the manufacturing perfumers are at present able to supply and as a consequence it is difficult to procure the genuine article through the ordinary sources of trade real violet is however sold by many of the retail perfumers of the west end of london but at a price that prohibits its use except by the affluent or extravagant votaries of fashion the violet farms from whence the flowers are procured to make this perfume are very extensive at nice and grasse also in the neighborhood of florence the true smelling principle or otto of violets has never yet been isolated a very concentrated solution in alcohol impresses the olfactory nerve with the idea of the presence of hydrocyanic acid which is probably a true impression burnett says that the plant viola tricolor hearts ease when bruised smells like peach kernels and doubtless therefore contains prussic acid the flowers of the hearts ease are scentless but the plant evidently contains a principle which in other species of the viola is eliminated as the sweet that smells so beautifully alluded to by shakspeare for commercial purposes the odor of the violet is procured in combination with spirit oil or suet precisely according to the methods previously described for obtaining the aroma of some other flowers before mentioned such as those for cassie jasmine orangeflower namely by maceration or by enfleurage the former method being principally adopted followed by when essence is required digesting the pomade in rectified alcohol good essence of violets thus made is of a beautiful green color and though of a rich deep tint has no power to stain a white fabric and its odor is perfectly natural the essence of violet as prepared for retail sale is thus made according to the quality and strength of the pomadetake from six to eight pounds of the violet pomade chop it up fine and place it into one gallon of perfectly clean free from fusel oil rectified spirit allow it to digest for three weeks or a month then strain off the essence and to every pint thereof add three ounces of tincture of orris root and three ounces of esprit de cassie it is then fit for sale we have often seen displayed for sale in druggists shops plain tincture of orris root done up in nice bottles with labels upon them inferring the contents to be extract of violet customers thus once taken in are not

becomes very much like the violet moreover it has a green color like the extract of violet and as the eye influences the judgment by the sense of taste so it does with the sense of smell extract of violet enters largely into the composition of several of the most popular bouquets such as extract of spring flowers and many others vitivert or kuskus is the rhizome of an indian grass in the neighborhood of calcutta and in the city this material has an extensive use by being manufactured into awnings blinds and sunshades called tatty during the hot seasons an attendant sprinkles water over them this operation cools the apartment by the evaporation of the water and at the same time perfumes the atmosphere in a very agreeable manner with the odoriferous principle of the vitivert it has a smell between the aromatic or spicy odor and that of flowersif such a distinction can be admitted we classify it with orris root not that it has any odor resembling it but because it has a like effect in use in perfumery and because it is prepared as a tincture for obtaining its odor about four pounds of the dried vitivert as it is imported being cut small and set to steep in a gallon of rectified spirits for a fortnight produces the essence of vitivert of the shops in this state it is rarely used as a perfume although it is occasionally asked for by those who perhaps have learnt to admire its odor by their previous residence in the eastern clime the extract essence or tincture of vitivert enters into the composition of several of the muchadmired and old bouquets manufactured in the early days of perfumery in england such as mousselaine des indies for which preparation m delcroix in the zenith of his fame created quite a furor in the fashionable world illustration vitivert essence of vitivert is also made by dissolving 2 oz of otto of vitivert in 1 gallon of spirit this preparation is stronger than the tincture as above marechale and bouquet du roi perfumes which have also had their day owe much of their peculiarity to the vitivert contained in them bundles of vitivert are sold for perfuming linen and preventing moth and when ground is used to manufacture certain sachet powders otto of vitivert is procurable by distillation a hundredweight of vitivert yields about 14 oz of otto which in appearance very much resembles otto of santal i have placed a sample of it in the museum at kew volkameriaan exquisite perfume is sold under this name presumed of course to be derived from the volkameria inermis lindley whether it has a smell resembling the flower of that plant or whether the plant blooms at all we are unable to say it is a native of india and seems to be little known even in the botanic gardens of this country however the plant has a name and thats

successfully too were the plant cultivated for that purpose to this flower we would direct particular attention as one well adapted for experiments to obtain its odoriferous principle in this country our climate being good for its production the mode for obtaining its odor has been indicated when we spoke of heliotrope page 60 and if it answers on the small scale there is little doubt of success in the large way and there is no fear but that the scent of the old english wallflower will meet with a demand an imitation essence of wallflower can be compounded thus extract fleur dorange 1 pint

the important odoriferous bodies which are used by the manufacturing perfumer as derived from the botanic kingdom it may be understood that where an odoriferous material is unnoticed it has no qualities peculiar enough to be remarked on and that the methods adopted for preparing its essence extract water or oil are analogous to those that have been already noticed that is by the processes of maceration absorption or enfleurage for flowers by tincturation for roots and by distillation for seeds modified under certain circumstances there are however three other important derivative odorsambergris civet and muskwhich being from the animal kingdom are treated separately from plant odors in order it is considered to render the whole matter less confused to manufacturers who may refer to them ammonia and acetic acid holding an indefinite position in the order we have laid down may also come in here without much criticism being considered as primitive odors on terminating our remarks relating to the simple preparations of the odors of plants and before we speak of perfumes of an animal origin or of those compound odors sold as bouquets nosegays c it may probably be interesting to give a few facts and statistics showing the consumption in england of the several substances previously named quantities of essential oils or ottos paying 1s per pound duty entered for home consumption in the year 1852 lbs otto of bergamot 28574 caraway 3602 cassia 6163 cloves 595 otto of lavender 12776 lemon 67348 peppermint 16059 roses 1268 spearmint 163 thyme 11418 lemon grass citronella 47380 and other ottos not otherwise described total essential oils or ottos imported in one year 195346 at the duty of 1s per pound yield a revenue annually of 9766l 16s it would appear by the above return that our consumption of otto of cloves was exceedingly small whereas it is probably ten times that amount the fact is several of the english wholesale druggists are very large distillers of this otto leaving little or no room for the sale and importation of foreign distilled otto of cloves again otto of caraway the english production of that article is quite equal to the foreign also otto of lavender which is drawn in this country probably to the extent of 6000 lbs annually there were also passed through the custom house for home consumption in 1852 pomatums procured by enfleurage maceration c commonly called french pomatums average value of 6s per pound and paying a duty of 1s per pound valued by the importers at 1306 perfumery not otherwise described value 1920 number of bottles of eau de cologne paying a duty of 1s eachd 19777 revenue from eau de cologne manufactured out of england say 20000 flacons at 8d 8000l annually the total revenue derived from various sources even upon this low scale of duties from the substances with which britannia perfumes her pocket handkerchief cannot be estimated at less than 40000l per annum this of course includes the duty upon the spirits used in the home manufacture of perfumery section iv perfumes of animal origin in the previous articles we have only spoken of the odors of plants we now enter upon those materials used in perfumery of an animal origin the first under our notice is ambergristhis substance is found in the sea floating near the islands of sumatra molucca and madagascar also on the coasts of america brazil china japan and the coromandel the western coast of ireland is often found to yield large pieces of this substance the shores of the counties of sligo mayo kerry and the isles of arran are the principal places where it has been found in the philosophical transactions there is an account of a lump found on the beach of the firstmentioned county in the year 1691 which weighed 52 oz and was bought on the spot for 20l but which afterwards was sold in london for more than 100l philos trans no 227 p 509 we are quite within limit in stating that many volumes concerning the origin of ambergris have been written but the question respecting it is still at issue it is found in the stomachs of the most voracious fishes these animals swallowing at particular times everything they happen to meet with it has been particularly found in the intestines of the spermaceti whale and most commonly in sickly fish whence it is supposed to be the cause or effect of the disease some authors and among them robert boyle consider it to be of vegetable production and analogous to amber hence its name ambergris gray gray amber it is not however within the province of this work to discuss upon the various theories about its production which could probably be satisfactorily explained if our modern appliances were brought to bear upon the subject the field is open to any scientific enthusiast all recent authors who mention it merely quoting the facts known more than a century ago a modern compiler speaking of ambergris says it smells like dried cowdung never having smelled this latter substance we cannot say whether the simile be correct but we certainly consider that its perfume is most incredibly overrated nor can we forget that homberg found that a vessel in which he had made a long digestion of the human fces had acquired a very strong and perfect smell of ambergris insomuch that any one would have thought that a great quantity of essence of ambergris had been made in it the perfume odor was so strong that the vessel was obliged to be moved out of the laboratory mem acad paris 1711 nevertheless as ambergris is extensively used as a perfume in deference to those who admire its odor we presume that it has to many an agreeable smell like bodies of this kind undergoing a slow decomposition and possessing little volatility it when mixed with other very fleeting scents gives permanence to them on the handkerchief and for this quality the perfumer esteems it much essence of ambergris is only kept for mixing when retailed it has to be sweetened up to the public nose it is then called after the parisian name extrait dambre esprit de rose triple 12 pint extract of ambergris 1 essence of musk 14 extract of vanilla 2 ounces this perfume has such a lasting odor that a handkerchief being well perfumed with it will still retain an odor even after it has been washed the fact is that both musk and ambergris contain a substance which clings pertinaciously to woven fabrics and not being soluble in weak alkaline lyes is still found upon the material after passing through the lavatory ordeal powdered ambergris is used in the manufacture of cassoletteslittle ivory or bone boxes perforatedwhich are made to contain a paste of strongsmelling substances to carry in the pocket or reticule also in the making of peau despagne or spanish skin used for perfuming writing paper and envelopes and which will be described hereafter illustration civet cat civetthis substance is secreted by the viverra civetta or civet cat it is formed in a large double glandular receptacle between the anus and the pudendum of the creature like many other substances of oriental origin it was first brought to this country by the dutch when the civet cats are kept in a state of confinement which at one time was common in amsterdam they are placed in strong cages so constructed as to prevent the animal from turning round and biting the person employed in collecting the secreted substance this operation is said to be performed twice a week and is done by scraping out the civet with a small spoon about a drachm at a time is thus obtained a good deal of the civet now brought to european markets is from calicut capital of the province of malabar and from bassora on the euphrates in its pure state civet has to nearly all persons a most disgusting odor but when diluted to an infinitesimal portion its perfume is agreeable it is difficult to ascertain the reason why the same substance modified only by the quantity of matter presented to the nose should produce an opposite effect on the olfactory nerve but such is the case with nearly all odorous bodies especially with ottos which if smelled at are far from nice and in some cases positively nastysuch as otto of neroli otto of thyme otto of patchouly but if diluted with a thousand times its volume of oil spirit c then their fragrance is delightful otto of rose to many has a sickly odor but when eliminated in the homeopathic quantities as it rises from a single rosebloom who is it that will not admit that the rose is sweet the odor of civet is best imparted not by actual contact but by being placed in the neighborhood of absorbent materials thus when spread upon leather which being covered with silk and placed in a writingdesk perfumes the paper and envelopes delightfully and so much so that they retain the odor after passing through the post extract of civet is prepared by rubbing in a mortar one ounce of civet with an ounce of orrisroot powder or any other similar material that will assist to break up or divide the civet and then placing the whole into a gallon of rectified spirits after macerating for a month it is fit to strain off it is principally used as a fixing ingredient in mixing essences of delicate odor the french perfumers use the extract of civet more than english manufacturers who seem to prefer extract of musk from a quarter of a pint to half a pint is the utmost that ought to be mixed with a gallon of any other perfume castor is a secretion of the castor fiber or beaver very similar to civet though we have often heard of its being used in perfumery we do not personally know that such is the case muskthis extraordinary substance like civet is an animal secretion it is contained in excretory follicles about the navel of the male animal in the perfumery trade these little bags are called pods and as imported it is called pod musk when the musk is separated from the skin or sack in which it is contained it is then called grain musk the musk deer moschus moschatus is an inhabitant of the great mountain range which belts the north of india and branches out into siberia thibet and china and it is also found in the altaic range near lake baikal and in some other mountain ranges but always on the borders of the line of perpetual snow it is from the male animal only that the musk is produced illustration musk pod actual size it formerly was held in high repute as a medicine and is still so among eastern nations the musk from boutan tonquin and thibet is most esteemed that from bengal is inferior and from russia is of still lower quality the strength and the quantity produced by a single animal varies with the season of the year and the age of the animal a single musk pod usually contains from two to three drachms of grain musk musk is imported into england from china in caddies of from 50 to 100 ounces each when adulterated with the animals blood which is often the case it forms into lumps or clots it is sometimes also mixed with a dark friable earth those pods in which little pieces of lead are discovered as a general rule yield the finest quality of musk upon this rule we presume that the best musk is the most worthy of adulteration musk is remarkable for the diffusiveness and subtlety of its scent everything in its vicinity soon becomes affected by it and long retains its odor although not in actual contact with it it is a fashion of the present day for people to say that they do not like musk but nevertheless from great experience in one of the largest manufacturing perfumatories in europe we are of opinion that the public taste for musk is as great as any perfumer desires those substances containing it always take the preference in ready saleso long as the vendor takes care to assure his customer that there is no musk in it illustration the musk deer the perfumer uses musk principally in the scenting of soap sachet powder and in mixing for liquid perfumery the just reputation of pariss original windsor soap is due in the main to its delightful odor the soap is doubtless of the finest quality but its perfume stamps it among the liteits fragrance it owes to musk the alkaline reaction of soap is favorable to the development of the odoriferous principle of musk if however a strong solution of potass be poured on to grain musk ammonia is developed instead of the true musk smell extract of musk grain musk 2 oz rectified spirit 1 gallon after standing for one month at a summer temperature it is fit to draw off such an extract is that which is used for mixing in other perfumes that extract of musk which is prepared for retail sale is prepared thus extrait de musc extract of musk as above 1 pint ambergris 12 rose triple 14 mix and filter it it is then fit for bottling this preparation is sweeter than pure extract of musk made according to our first formula and is also more profitable to the vendor it will be seen hereafter that the original extract of musk is principally used for a fixing ingredient in other perfumes to give permanence to a volatile odor customers requiring in a general way that which is incompatible namely that a perfume shall be strong to smell ie very volatile and that it shall remain upon the handkerchief for a long period ergo not volatile small portions of extract of musk mixed with esprit de rose violet tuberose and others do in a measure attain this object that is after the violet c has evaporated the handkerchief still retains an odor which although not that of the original smell yet gives satisfaction because it is pleasant to the nasal organ section v ammoniaunder the various titles of smelling salts preston salts inexhaustible salts eau de luce sal volatile ammonia mixed with other odoriferous bodies has been very extensively consumed as material for gratifying the olfactory nerve the perfumer uses liq amm fortis that is strong liquid ammonia and the sesquicarbonate of ammonia for preparing the various salts that he sells these materials he does not attempt to make in fact it is quite out of his province so to do but he procures them ready for his hand through some manufacturing chemist the best preparation for smellingbottles is what is termed inexhaustible salts which is prepared thus liquid ammonia 1 pint otto of rosemary 1 drachm english lavender 1 bergamot 12 cloves 12 mix the whole together with agitation in a very strong and wellstoppered bottle this mixture is used by filling the smellingbottles with any porous absorbent material such as asbestos or what is better sponge cuttings that have been well beaten washed and dried these cuttings can be procured at a nominal price from any of the spongedealers being the trimming or roots of the turkey sponge which are cut off before the merchants send it into the retail market after the bottles are filled with the sponge it is thoroughly saturated with the scented ammonia but no more is poured in than the sponge will retain when the bottles are inverted as if by any chance the ammonia runs out and is spilt over certain colored fabrics it causes a stain when such an accident happens the person who sold it is invariably blamed when the sponge is saturated properly it will retain the ammoniacal odor longer than any other material hence we presume bottles filled in this way are called inexhaustible which name however they do not sustain more than two or three months with any credit the warm hand soon dissipates the ammonia under any circumstances and they require to be refilled for transparent colored bottles instead of sponge the perfumers use what they call insoluble crystal salts sulphate of potass the bottles being filled with crystals are covered either with the liquid ammonia scented as above or with alcoholic ammonia the necks of the bottles are filled with a piece of white cotton otherwise when inverted from the nonabsorbent quality of the crystals the ammonia runs out and causes complaints to be made the crystals are prettier in colored bottles than the sponge but in plain bottles the sponge appears quite as handsome and as before observed it holds the ammonia better than any other material perfumers sell also what is called white smelling salts and preston salts the white smelling salt is the sesquicarbonate of ammonia in powder with which is mixed any perfuming otto that is thought fitlavender otto giving as a general rule the most satisfaction preston salts which is the cheapest of all the ammoniacal compounds is composed of some easily decomposable salt of ammonia and lime such as equal parts of muriate of ammonia or of sesquicarbonate of ammonia and of freshslaked lime when the bottles are filled with this compound rammed in very hard a drop or two of some cheap otto is poured on the top prior to corking for this purpose otto of french lavender or otto of bergamot answers very well we need scarcely mention that the corks are dipped into melted sealingwax or brushed over with liquid wax that is red or black wax dissolved in alcohol to which a small portion of ether is added the only other compound of ammonia that is sold in the perfumery trade is eau de luce though properly it belongs to the druggist when correctly madewhich is very rarely the caseit retains the remarkable odor of oil of amber which renders it characteristic eau de luce tincture of benzoin or balsam of peru 1 oz otto of lavender 10 drops oil of amber 5 liquor ammonia 2 oz if requisite strain through cotton wool but it must not be filtered as it should have the appearance of a milkwhite emulsion acetic acid and its use in perfumerythe pungency of the odor of vinegar naturally brought it into the earliest use in the art of perfumery the acetic acid evolved by distilling acetate of copper verdigris is the true aromatic vinegar of the old alchemists the modern aromatic vinegar is the concentrated acetic acid aromatized with various ottos camphor c thus aromatic vinegar concentrated acetic acid 8 oz otto of english lavender 2 drachms rosemary 1 drachm cloves 1 camphor 1 oz first dissolve the bruised camphor in the acetic acid then add the perfumes after remaining together for a few days with occasional agitation it is to be strained and is then ready for use several forms for the preparation of this substance have been published almost all of which however appear to complicate and mystify a process that is all simplicity the most popular article of this kind is henrys vinegar dried leaves of rosemary rue wormwood sage mint and lavender flowers each 12 oz bruised nutmeg cloves angelica root and camphor each 14 oz alcohol rectified 4 oz concentrated acetic acid 16 oz macerate the materials for a day in the spirit then add the acid and digest for a week longer at a temperature of about 14 c or 15 c finally press out the new aromatized acid and filter it as this mixture must not go into the ordinary metallic tincture press for the obvious reason of the chemical action that would ensue it is best to drain as much of the liquor away as we can by means of a common funnel and then to save the residue from the interstices of the herbs by tying them up in a linen cloth and subjecting them to pressure by means of an ordinary lemonsqueezer or similar device vinaigre a la rose concentrated acetic acid 1 oz otto of roses 12 drachm well shaken together it is obvious that vinegars differently perfumed may be made in a similar manner to the above by using other ottos in place of the otto of roses all these concentrated vinegars are used in the same way as perfumed ammonia that is by pouring three or four drachms into an ornamental smelling bottle previously filled with crystals of sulphate of potash which forms the sel de vinaigre of the shops or upon sponge into little silver boxes called vinaigrettes from their french origin the use of these vinegars had their origin in the presumption of keeping those who carried them from the effects of infectious disease doubtless springing out of the story of the four thieves vinegar which is thus rendered in lewiss dispensatory it is said that during the plague at marseilles four persons by the use of this preservative attended unhurt multitudes of those that were affected that under the color of these services they robbed both the sick and the dead and that being afterwards apprehended one of them saved himself from the gallows by disclosing the composition of the prophylactic a very likely story which was as follows vinaigre des quatre voleurs or four thieves vinegar take fresh tops of common wormwood roman wormwood rosemary sage mint and rue of each 34 oz lavender flowers 1 oz garlic calamus aromaticus cinnamon cloves and nutmeg each 1 drachm camphor 12 oz alcohol or brandy 1 oz strong vinegar 4 pints digest all the materials except the camphor and spirit in a closely covered vessel for a fortnight at a summer heat then express and filter the vinaigre produced and add the camphor previously dissolved in the brandy or spirit a very similar and quite as effective a preparation may be made by dissolving the odorous principle of the plants indicated in a mixture of alcohol and acetic acid such preparations however are more within the province of the druggist than perfumer there are however several preparations of vinegar which are sold to some extent for mixing with the water for lavatory purposes and the bath their vendors endeavoring to place them in competition with eau de cologne but with little avail among them may be enumerated hygienic or preventive vinegar brandy 1 pint otto of cloves 1 drachm lavender 1 marjoram 12 drachm gum benzoin 1 oz macerate these together for a few hours then add brown vinegar 2 pints and strain or filter if requisite to be bright toilet vinegar la violette extract of cassie 12 pint orris 14 esprit de rose triple 14 white wine vinegar 2 pints toilet vinegar la rose dried roseleaves 4 oz esprit de rose triple 12 pint white wine vinegar 2 pints macerate in a close vessel for a fortnight then filter and bottle for sale vinaigre de cologne to eau de cologne 1 pint add strong acetic acid 12 oz filter if necessary without unnecessarily repeating similar formul it will be obvious to the reader that vinegar of any flower may be prepared in a similar way to those above noticed thus for vinaigre la jasmine or for vinaigre la fleur dorange we have only to substitute the esprit de jasmine or the esprit de fleur dorange in place of the eau de cologne to produce orangeflower or jasmine vinegars however these latter articles are not in demand and our only reason for explaining how such preparations may be made is in order to suggest the methods of procedure to any one desirous of making them leading articles in their trade we perhaps may observe en passant that where economy in the production of any of the toilet vinegars is a matter of consideration they have only to be diluted with rosewater down to the profitable strength required any of the perfumed vinegars that are required to produce opalescence when mixed with water must contain some gumresin like the hygienic vinegar as above either myrrh benzoin storax or tolu answer equally well section vi bouquets and nosegays in the previous articles we have endeavored to explain the mode of preparing the primitive perfumesthe original odors of plants it will have been observed that while the majority can be obtained under the form of otto or essential oil there are others which hitherto have not been isolated but exist only in solution in alcohol or in a fatty body of the latter are included all that are most prized with the exception of otto of rosethat diamond among the odoriferous gems practically we have no essential oils or ottos of jasmine vanilla acacia tuberose cassie syringa violets and others what we know of these odors is derived from esprits obtained from oils or fats in which the several flowers have been repeatedly infused and afterwards infusing such fats or oils in alcohol undoubtedly these odors are the most generally pleasing while those made from the essential oils ie otto dissolved in spirit are of a secondary character the simple odors when isolated are called essential oils or ottos when dissolved or existing in solution in alcohol by the english they are termed essences and by the french extraits or esprits a few exceptions prove this rule essential oil of orangepeel and of lemonpeel are frequently termed in the trade essence of orange and essence of lemons instead of essential oil or otto of lemons c the sooner the correct nomenclature is used in perfumery as well as in the allied arts the better and the fewer blunders will be made in the dispensatory it appears to the writer that if the nomenclature of these substances were revised it would be serviceable and he would suggest that as a significant brief and comprehensive term otto be used as a prefix to denote that such and such a body is the odoriferous principle of the plant we should then have otto of lavender instead of essential oil of lavender c c in this work it will be seen that the writer has generally used the word otto in place of essential oil in accordance with his views where there exists a solution of an essential oil in a fat oil the necessity of some such significant distinction is rendered obvious for commercially such articles are still called oilsoil of jasmine oil of roses c it cannot be expected that the public will use the words fat oil and essential oil to distinguish these differences of composition there are several good reasons why the odoriferous principle of plants should not be denominated oils in the first place it is a bad principle to give any class of substances the same signification as those belonging to another surely there are enough distinguishing qualities in their composition their physical character and chemical reaction to warrant the application of a significant name to that large class of substances known as the aroma of plants when the chemical nomenclature was last revised the organic bodies were little dealt with we know that we owe this universal oil to the old alchemist much in the same way as spirit has been used but a little consideration quickly indicates the folly of its continued use we can no longer call otto of rosemary or otto of nutmegs essential oil of rosemary or nutmegs with any more propriety than we can term sulphuric acid oil of vitriol all the chemical works speak of the odoriferous bodies as essential or volatile oils and of the greasy bodies as fat or unctuous oils oils properly so called unite with salifiable bases and form soap whereas the essential or volatile oils ie what we would please to call the ottos do no such thing on the contrary they unite with acids in the majority of instances the word oil must hereafter be confined to those bodies to which its literal meaning refersfat unctuous inodorous when pure greasy substancesand can no longer be applied to those odoriferous materials which possess qualities diametrically opposite to oil we have grappled with spirit and fixed its meaning in a chemical sense we have no longer spirit of salt or spirit of hartshorn let us no longer have almond oil essential almond oil unctuous and the like it remains only for us to complete the branch of perfumery which relates to odors for the handkerchief by giving the formul for preparing the most favorite bouquets and nosegays these as before stated are but mixtures of the simple ottos in spirit which properly blended produce an agreeable and characteristic odoran effect upon the smelling nerve similar to that which music or the mixture of

cologne was originally introduced to the public as a sort of cureall a regular elixir of life it now takes its place not as a pharmaceutical product but among perfumery of its remedial qualities we can say nothing such matter being irrelevant to the purpose of this book considered however as a perfume with the public taste it ranks very high and although it is exceedingly volatile and evanescent yet it has that excellent quality which is called refreshing whether this be due to the rosemary or to the spirit we cannot say but think something may be attributed to both one important thing relating to eau de cologne must not however pass unnoticed and that is the quality of the spirit used in its manufacture the utter impossibility of making brandy with english spirit in any way to resemble the real cognac is well known it is equally impossible to make eau de cologne with english spirit to resemble the original article to speak of the purity of french spirit or of the impurity of english spirit is equally absurd the fact is that spirit derived from grapes and spirit obtained from corn have each so distinct and characteristic an aroma that the one cannot be mistaken for the other the odor of grape spirit is said to be due to the oeanthic ether which it contains the english spirit on the other hand owes its odor to fusel oil so powerful is the oeanthic ether in the french spirit that notwithstanding the addition to it of such intensely odoriferous substances as the ottos of neroli rosemary and others it still gives a characteristic perfume to the products made containing it and hence the difficulty of preparing eau de cologne with any spirit destitute of this substance although very fine eau de cologne is often made by merely mixing the ingredients as indicated in the recipe as above yet it is better first to mix all the citrine ottos with spirit and then to distil the mixture afterwards adding to the distillate the rosemary and nerolies such process being the one adopted by the most popular house at cologne a great many forms for the manufacture of eau de cologne have been published the authors of some of the recipes evidently having no knowledge in a practical sense of what they were putting by theory on paper other venturers to show their lore have searched out all the aromatics of lindleys botany and would persuade us to use absinthe hyssop anise juniper marjoram caraway fennel cumin cardamom cinnamon nutmeg serpolet angelica cloves lavender camphor balm peppermint galanga lemon thyme c c c all these however are but hum where it is a mere matter of profit and the formula that we have given is too expensive to produce the article required it is better to dilute the said cologne with a weak spirit or with rosewater rather than otherwise alter its form because although weak the true aroma of the original article is retained the recipe of the second quality of eau de cologne is given to show that a very decent

cassie 12 jasmine 14 extract of civet 3 oz independently of the materials employed being different to the original english recipe it must be remembered that all the french perfumes are made of brandy ie grape spirit whereas the english perfumes are made with corn spirit which alone modifies their odor though good for some mixtures yet for others the grape spirit is very objectionable on account of the predominance of its own aroma we have spoken of the difference in the odor between the english and french spirit the marked distinction of british and parisian perfumes made according to the same recipes is entirely due to the different spirits employed owing to the strong bouquet as the french say of their spirit in comparison with ours the continental perfumers claim a superiority in the quality of their perfumes now although we candidly admit that some odors are better when prepared with grape spirit than with that from corn spirit yet there are others which are undoubtedly the best when prepared with spirit derived from the latter source musk ambergris civet violet tubereuse and jasmine if we require to retain their true aroma when in solution in alcohol must be made with the british spirit all the citrine odors verveine vulnerary waters eau de cologne eau de portugal eau darquebuzade and lavender can alone be brought to perfection by using the french spirit in their manufacture if extract of jasmine or extract of violet c be made with the french or brandy spirit the true characteristic odor of the flower is lost to the olfactory nerveso completely does the oeanthic ether of the grape spirit hide the flowery aroma of the otto of violet in solution with it this solves the paradox that english extract of violet and its compounds spring flowers c is at all times in demand on the continent although the very flowers with which we make it are grown there on the contrary if an english perfumer attempts to make eau de portugal c to bear any comparison as a fine odor to that made by lubin of paris without using grape spirit his attempts will prove a failure true he makes eau de portugal even with english corn spirit but judges of the articleand they alone can stamp its meritdiscover instantly the same difference as the connoisseur finds out between patent british and foreign brandy perhaps it may not be out of place here to observe that what is sold in this country as british brandy is in truth grape spirit that is foreign brandy very largely diluted with english spirit by this scheme a real semblance to the foreign brandy flavor is maintained the difference in duty upon english and foreign spirit enables the makers of the capsuled article to undersell those who vend the unsophisticated cognac some chemists not being very deep in the tricks of trade have thought that some flavoring or that oeanthic ether was used to impart to british spirit the cognac aroma an article is even in the market called essence of cognac but which is nothing more than very badly made butyric ether on the continent a great deal of spirit is procured by the fermentation of the molasses from beetroot this of course finds its way into the market and is often mixed with the grape spirit so also in england we have spirit from potatoes which is mixed in the corn spirit these adulterations if we may so term it modify the relative odors of the

has ever been made its inventors messrs hannay and dietrichsen have probably taken the name of this odor from the rondeletia the chynlen of the chinese or from the r odorata of the west indies which has a sweet odor we have before observed that there is a similarity of effect upon the olfactory nerve produced by certain odors although derived from totally different sources that for instance otto of almonds may be mixed with extract of violet in such proportion that although the odor is increased yet the character peculiar to the violet is not destroyed again there are certain odors which on being mixed in due proportion produce a new aroma perfectly distinct and peculiar to itself this effect is exemplified by comparison with the influence of certain colors when mixed upon the nerve of vision such for instance as when yellow and blue are mixed the result we call green or when blue and red are united the compound color is known as puce or violet now when the odor of lavender and odor of cloves are mixed they produce a new fragrance ie rondeletia it is such combinations that constitute in reality a new perfume which though often advertised is very rarely attained jasmine and patchouly produce a novel aroma and many others in like manner proportion and relative strength when so mixed must of course be studied and the substances used accordingly if the same quantity of any given otto be dissolved in a like proportion of spirit and the solution be mixed in equal proportions the strongest odor is instantly indicated by covering or hiding the presence of the other in this way we discover that patchouly lavender neroli and verbena are the most potent of the vegetable odors and that violet tubereuse and jasmine are the most delicate many persons will at first consider that we are asking too much when we express a desire to have the same deference paid to the olfactory nerve as to the other nerves that influence our physical pleasures and pains by tutoring the olfactory nerve it is capable of perceiving matter in the atmosphere of the most subtle nature not only that which is pleasant but also such as are unhealthful if an unpleasant odor is a warning to seek a purer atmosphere surely it is worth while to cultivate that power which enables us to act up to that warning for the general benefit of health to return however to rondeletia it will be seen by the annexed formul that besides the main ingredients to which it owes its peculiar characterthat is cloves and lavenderit contains musk vanilla c these substances are used in these as in nearly all

acquainted with that at all resembles the odor of the esprit de rose as derived from macerating rose pomade in spirit to which and to the extract of violet nicely counterpoised so that neither odor predominates the peculiar character of spring flowers is due the little ambergris that is present gives permanence to the odor upon the handkerchief although from the very nature of the ingredients it may be said to be a fleeting odor spring flowers is an englishmans invention but there is scarcely a perfumer in europe that does not attempt an imitation tulip nosegay nearly all the tulip tribe

undoubtedly nothing more than the odoriferous gums which naturally exude from various trees and shrubs indigenous to the eastern hemisphere that they were very extensively used and much valued we have only to read the scriptures for proofswho is this that cometh perfumed with myrrh and frankincense with all the powders of the merchant song of solomon 36 abstaining from the use of perfume in eastern countries is considered as a sign of humiliationthe lord will take away the tablets and it shall come to pass that instead of a sweet smell there shall be a stink exod 3522 isaiah 320 24 the word tablets in this passage means perfume boxes curiously inlaid made of metal wood and ivory some of these boxes may have been made in the shape of buildings which would explain the word palaces in psalm 148all thy garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of the ivory palaces whereby they have made thee glad from what is said in matt 211 it would appear that perfumes were considered among the most valuable gifts which man could bestowand when they the wise men had opened their treasures they presented unto him christ gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh as far as we are able to learn all the perfumes used by the egyptians and persians during the early period of the world were dry perfumes consisting of spikenard nardostachys jatamansi myrrh olibanum and other gumresins nearly all of

before offering for sale there are many other sachets manufactured besides those already given but for actual trade purposes there is no advantage in keeping a greater variety than those named there are however many other substances used in a similar way the most popular is the peau despagne peau despagne or spanish skin is nothing more than highly perfumed leather good sound pieces of wash

a quarter of an ounce otto of cloves and cinnamon of each two drachms with any others thought fit in this mixture dissolve about two ounces of gum benzoin now place the skin to steep in it for a day or so then hang it over a line to dry a paste is now to be made by rubbing in a mortar one drachm of civet with one drachm of grain musk and enough solution of gum acacia or gum tragacantha to give it a spreading consistence a little of any of the ottos that may be left from the steep stirred in with the civet c greatly assists in making the whole of an equal body the skin being cut up into pieces of about four inches square are then to be spread over plaster fashion with the lastnamed compost two pieces being put together having the civet plaster inside them are then to be placed between sheets of paper weighed or pressed and left to dry thus for a week finally each double skin now called peau despagne is to be enveloped in some pretty silk or satin and finished off to the taste of the vender skin or leather thus prepared evolves a pleasant odor for years and hence they are frequently called the inexhaustible sachet being flat they are much used for perfuming writingpaper the lasting odor of russia leather is familiar to all and pleasing to many its perfume is due to the aromatic saunderswood with which it is tanned and to the empyreumatic oil of the bark of the birch tree with which it is curried the odor of russia leather is however not recherch enough to be considered as a perfume but nevertheless leather can be impregnated by steeping in the various ottos with any sweet scent and which it retains to a remarkable degree especially with otto of santal or lemongrass verbena in this manner the odor of the peau despagne can be greatly varied and gives great satisfaction on account of the permanence of its perfume perfumed letterpaper if a piece of peau despagne be placed in contact with paper the latter absorbs sufficient odor to be considered as perfumed it is obvious that paper for writing upon must not be touched with any of the odorous tinctures or ottos on account of such matters interfering with the fluidity of the ink and action of the pen therefore by the process of infection as it were alone can writing paper be perfumed to advantage besides the sachets mentioned there are many other substances applied as dry perfumes such as scented wadding used for quilting into all sorts of articles adapted for use in a ladys boudoir pincushions jewel cases and the like are lined with it cotton so perfumed is simply steeped in some strong essence of musk c perfumed bookmarkers we have seen that leather can be impregnated with odoriferous substances in the manufacture of peau despagne just so is cardboard treated prior to being made up into bookmarks in finishing them for sale taste alone dictates their design some are ornamented with beads others with embroidery cassolettes and printaniers cassolettes and printaniers are little ivory boxes of various designs perforated in order to allow the escape of the odors contained therein the paste used for filling these ivory palaces whereby we are made glad is composed of equal parts of grain musk ambergris seeds of the vanillapod otto of roses and orris powder with enough gum acacia or gum tragacantha to work the whole together into a paste these things are now principally used for perfuming the pocket or reticule much in the same way that ornamental silver and gold vinagrettes are used pastils there is no doubt whatever that the origin of the use of pastils or pastilles as they are more often called from the french has been derived from the use of incense at the altars of the temples during the religious servicesaccording to the custom of the priests office his lot zacharias was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord luke 19 and thou shalt make an altar to burn incense and aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning when he dresseth the lamps and at even when he lighteth the lamps he shall burn incense upon it exodus 30 an analogous practice is in use to the present day in the roman catholic churches but instead of being consumed upon an altar the incense is burned in a censer as doubtless many of our readers have seen as soon as the signal was given by the chief priest the incense was kindled the holy place was filled with perfume and the congregation without joined in prayers carpenters temple service of the hebrews the censer on the walls of every temple in egypt from mere to memphis the censer is depicted smoking before the presiding deity of the place on the walls of the tombs glow in bright colors the preparation of spices and perfumes in the british museum there is a vase no 2595 the body of which is intended to contain a lamp the sides being perforated to admit the heat from the flame to act upon the projecting tubes which are intended to contain ottos of flowers placed in the small vases at the end of the tubes the heat volatilizes the ottos and quickly perfumes an apartment this vase or censer is from an egyptian catacomb illustration the censer the censer as used in the holy places is made either of brass german silver or the precious metals its form somewhat resembles a saucer and an inverted cup which latter is perforated to allow the escape of the perfume in the outer saucer is placed an inner one of copper which can be taken out and filled with ignited charcoal when in use the ignited carbon is placed in the censer and is then covered with the incense the heat rapidly volatilizes it in visible fumes the effect is assisted by the incensebearer swinging the censer attached to three long chains in the air the manner of swinging the censer varies slightly in the churches in rome in france and in england some holding it above the head at la madeleine the method is always to give the censer a full swing at the greatest length of the chains with the right hand and to catch it up short with the left hand several samples of incense prepared for altar service as sent out by mr martin of liverpool appear to be nothing more than gum olibanum of indifferent quality and not at all like the composition as especially commanded by god the form for which is given in full in exodus the pastils of the moderns are really but a very slight modification of the incense of the ancients for many years they were called osselets of cyprus in the old books on pharmacy a certain mixture of the then known gumresins was called suffitus which being thrown upon hot ashes produced a vapor which was considered to be salutary in many diseases it is under the same impression that pastils are now used or at least to cover the mal odeur of the sickchamber there is not much variety in the formula of the pastils that are now in use we have first the indian or yellow pastils santalwood in powder 1 lb gum benzoin 112 lb tolu 14 lb otto of santal cassia each 3 drachms cloves nitrate of potass 112 oz mucilage of tragacantha qs to make the whole into a stiff paste the benzoin santalwood and tolu are to be powdered and mixed by sifting them adding the ottos the nitre

thus nitrated charcoal is quite dry pour over it the mixed ottos and stir in the flowers of benzoin when well mixed by sifting the sieve is a better tool for mixing powders than the pestle and mortar it is finally beaten up in a mortar with enough mucilage to bind the whole together and the less that is used the better a great variety of formul have been published for the manufacture of pastils ninetenths of them contain some woods or bark or aromatic seeds now when such substances are burned the chemist knows that if the ligneous fibre contained in them undergoes combustionthe slow combustionmaterials are produced which have far from a pleasant odor in fact the smell of burning wood predominates over the volatilized aromatic ingredients it is for this reason alone that charcoal is used in lieu of other substances the use of charcoal in a pastil is merely for burning producing during its combustion the heat required to quickly volatilize the perfuming material with which it is surrounded the product of the combustion of charcoal is inodorous and therefore does not in any way interfere with the fragrance of the pastil such is however not the case with any ingredients that may be used that are not in themselves perfectly volatile by the aid of a small increment of heat if combustion takes place which is always the case with all the aromatic woods that are introduced into pastils we have besides the volatilized otto which the wood contains all the compounds naturally produced by the slow burning of ligneous matter spoiling the true odor of the other ingredients volatilized there are it is true certain kinds of fumigation adopted occasionally where these products are the materials sought by such fumigation as when brown paper is allowed to smoulder undergo slow combustion in a room for the purpose of covering bad smells by the quick combustion of tobacco that is combustion with flame there is no odor developed but by its slow combustion according to the method adopted by those who indulge in the weed the familiar aroma the cloud is generated and did not exist ready formed in the tobacco now a wellmade pastil should not develope any odor of its own but simply volatilize that fragrant matter whatever it be used in its manufacture we think that the fourth formula given above carries out that object it does not follow that the formul that are here given produce at all times the odor that is most approved it is evident that in pastils as with other perfumes a great deal depends upon taste many persons very much object to the aroma of benzoin while they greatly admire the fumes of cascarilla the perfume lamp shortly after the discovery of the peculiar property of spongy platinum remaining incandescent in the vapor of alcohol the late mr i deck of cambridge made a very ingenious application of it for the purpose of perfuming apartments an ordinary spirit lamp is filled with eau de cologne and trimmed with a wick in the usual manner over the centre of the wick and standing about the eighth of an inch above it a small ball of spongy platinum is placed maintained in its position by being fixed to a thin glass rod which is inserted into the wick illustration perfume lamp thus arranged the lamp is to be lighted and allowed to burn until the platinum becomes red hot the flame may then be blown out nevertheless the platinum remains incandescent for an indefinite period the proximity of a redhot ball to a material of the physical quality of eau de cologne diffused over a surface of cotton wick as a matter of course causes its rapid evaporation and as a consequence the diffusion of odor instead of the lamp being charged with eau de cologne we may use eau de portugal vervaine or any other spirituous essence several perfumers make a particular mixture for this purpose which is called eau a bruler eau de cologne 1 pint tincture of benzoin 2 oz vanilla 1 oz otto of thyme mint of each 12 drachm nutmeg another form called eau pour bruler rectified spirit 1 pint benzoic acid 12 oz otto of thyme of each 1 drachm caraway bergamot 2 oz persons who are in the habit of using the perfume lamps will however frequently observe that whatever difference there may be in the composition of the fluid introduced into the lamp there is a degree of similarity in the odor of the result when the platinum is in action this arises from the fact that so long as there is the vapor of alcohol mixed with oxygenair passing over redhot platinum certain definite products always result namely acetic acid aldehyde and acetal which are formed more or less and impart a peculiar and rather agreeable fragrance to the vapor but which overpowers any other odor that is present fumigating paper there are two modes of preparing this article 1 take sheets of light cartridge paper and dip them into a solution of alumsay alum one ounce water one pint after they are thoroughly moistened let them be well dried upon one side of this paper spread a mixture of equal parts of gum benzoin olibanum and either balm of tolu or peruvian balsam or the benzoin may be used alone to spread the gum c it is necessary that they be melted in an earthenware vessel and poured thinly over the paper finally smoothing the surface with a hot spatula when required for use slips of this paper are held over a candle or lamp in order to evaporate the odorous matter but not to ignite it the alum in the paper prevents it a to certain extent from burning 2 sheets of good light paper are to be steeped in a solution of saltpetre in the proportions of two ounces of the salt to one pint of water to be afterwards thoroughly dried any of the odoriferous gums as myrrh olibanum benzoin c are to be dissolved to saturation in rectified spirit and with a brush spread upon one side of the paper which being hung up rapidly dries slips of this paper are to be rolled up as spills to be ignited and then to be blown out the nitre in the paper causes a continuance of slow combustion diffusing during that time the agreeable perfume of the odoriferous gums if two of these sheets of paper be pressed together before the surface is dry they will join and become as one when cut into slips they form what are called odoriferous lighters or perfumed spills section viii perfumed soap the word soap or sope from the greek sapo first occurs in the works of pliny and galen pliny informs us that soap was first discovered by the gauls that it was composed of tallow and ashes and that the german soap was reckoned the best according to sismondi the french historian a soapmaker was included in the retinue of charlemagne at pompeii overwhelmed by an eruption of vesuvius ad 79 a soapboilers shop with soap in it was discovered during some excavations made there not many years ago starkes letters from italy from these statements it is evident that the manufacture of soap is of very ancient origin indeed jeremiah figuratively mentions itfor though thou wash thee with natron and take thee much soap yet thine iniquity is marked before me jer 222 mr wilson says that the earliest record of the soap trade in england is to be found in a pamphlet in the british museum printed in 1641 entitled a short account of the soap business it speaks more particularly about the duty which was then levied for the first time and concerning certain patents which were granted to persons chiefly popish recusants for some pretended new invention of white soap which in truth was not so sufficient is said here to prove that at that time soapmaking was no inconsiderable art it would be out of place here to enter into the details of soapmaking because perfumers do not manufacture that substance but are merely remelters to use a trade term the dyer purchases his dyestuffs from the drysalters already fabricated and these are merely modified under his hands to the various purposes he requires so with the perfumer he purchases the various soaps in their raw state from the soapmakers these he mixes by remelting scents and colors according to the article to be produced the primary soaps are divided into hard and soft soaps the hard soaps contain soda as the base those which are soft are prepared with potash these are again divisible into varieties according to the fatty matter employed in their manufacture also according to the proportion of alkali the most important of these to the perfumer is what is termed curd soap as it forms the basis of all the highlyscented soaps curd soap is a nearly neutral soap of pure soda and fine tallow oil soap as made in england is an uncolored combination of olive oil and soda hard close grain and contains but little water in combination castile soap as imported from spain is a similar combination but is colored by protosulphate of iron the solution of the salt being added to the soap after it is manufactured from the presence of alkali decomposition of the salt takes place and protoxide of iron is diffused through the soap of its wellknown black color giving the familiar marbled appearance to it when the soap is cut up into bars and exposed to the air the protoxide passes by absorption of oxygen into peroxide hence a section of a bar of castile soap shows the outer edge redmarbled while the interior is blackmarbled some castile soap is not artificially colored but a similar appearance is produced by the use of a barilla or soda containing sulphuret of the alkaline base and at other times from the presence of an iron salt marine soap is a cocoanutoil soap of soda containing a great excess of alkali and much water combination yellow soap is a soda soap of tallow resin of lard c c palm soap is a soda soap of palm oil retaining the peculiar odor and color of the oil unchanged the odoriferous principle of palm oil resembling that from orrisroot can be dissolved out of it by tincturation with alcohol like ottos generally it remains intact in the presence of an alkali hence soap made of palm oil retains the odor of the oil the public require a soap that will not shrink and change shape after they purchase it it must make a profuse lather during the act of washing it must not leave the skin rough after using it it must be either quite inodorous or have a pleasant aroma none of the above soaps possess all these qualities in union and therefore to produce such an article is the object of the perfumer in his remelting process prior to the removal of the excise duty upon soap in 1853 it was a commercial impossibility for a perfumer to manufacture soap because the law did not allow less than one ton of soap to be made at a time this law which with certain modifications had been in force since the reign of charles i confined the actual manufacture of that article to the hands of a few capitalists such law however was but of little importance to the perfumer as a soapboiling plant and apparatus is not very compatible with a laboratory of flowers yet in some exceptional instances these excise regulations interfered with him such for instance as that in making soft soap of lard and potash known when perfumed as crme damande or unscented as a saponaceous cream which has in consequence of that law been entirely thrown into the hands of our continental neighbors fig soft soap is a combination of oils principally olive oil of the commonest kind with potash naples soft soap is a fish oil mixed with lucca oil and potash colored brown for the london shavers retaining when pure its unsophisticated fishy odor the above soaps constitute the real body or base of all the fancy scented soaps as made by the perfumers which are mixed and remelted according to the following formula the remelting process is exceedingly simple the bar soap is first cut up into thin slabs by pressing them against a wire fixed upon the working bench this cutting wire piano wire is the kind is made taut upon the bench by being attached to two screws these screws regulate the height of the wire from the bench and hence the thickness of the slabs from the bars the soap is cut up into thin slabs because it would be next to impossible to melt a bar whole on account of soap being one of the worst conductors of heat the melting pan is an iron vessel of various sizes capable of holding from 28 lbs to 3 cwt heated by a steam jacket or by a waterbath the soap is put into the pan by degrees or what is in the vernacular called rounds that is the thin slabs are placed perpendicularly all round the side of the pan a few ounces of water are at the same time introduced the steam of which assists the melting the pan being covered up in about half an hour the soap will have run down another round is then introduced and so continued every half hour until the whole melting is finished the more water a soap contains the easier is it melted hence a round of marine soap or of new yellow soap will run down in half the time that it requires for old soap when different soaps are being remelted to form one kind when finished the various sorts are to be inserted into the pan in alternate rounds but each round must consist only of one kind to insure uniformity of condition as the soap melts in order to mix it and to break up lumps c it is from time to time crutched the crutch is an instrument or tool for stirring up the soap its name is indicative of its form a long handle with a short crossan inverted t curved to fit the curve of the pan when the soaps are all melted it is then colored if so required and then the perfume is added the whole being thoroughly incorporated with the crutch illustration frame and slab gauge the soap is then turned into the frame the frame is a box made in sections in order that it can be taken to pieces so that the soap can be cut up when cold the sections or lifts are frequently made of the width of the intended bar of soap illustration barring gauge two or three days after the soap has been in the frame it is cool enough to cut into slabs of the size of the lifts or sections of the frame these slabs are set up edgeways to cool for a day or two more it is then barred by means of a wire the lifts of the frame regulate the widths of the bars the gauge regulates their breadth the density of the soap being pretty well known the gauges are made so that the soapcutter can cut up the bars either into fours sixes or eights that is either into squares of four six or eight to the pound weight latterly various mechanical arrangements have been introduced for soapcutting which in very large establishments such as those at marseilles in france are great economisers of labor but in england the wire is still used illustration squaring gauge illustration soap scoop for making tablet shapes the soap is first cut into squares and is then put into a mould and finally under a pressa modification of an ordinary die or coin press balls are cut by hand with the aid of a little tool called a scoop made of brass or ivory being in fact a ringshaped knife balls are also made in the press with a mould of appropriate form the grotesque form and fruit shape are also obtained by the press and appropriate moulds the fruitshaped soaps after leaving the mould are dipped into melted wax and are then colored according to artificial fruitmakers rules illustration soap press illustration moulds the variegated colored soaps are produced by adding the various colors such as smalt and vermilion previously mixed with water to the soap in a melted state these colors are but slightly crutched in hence the streaky appearance or party color of the soap this kind is also termed marbled soap almond soap this soap by some persons supposed to be made of sweet almond oil and by others to be a mystic combination of sweet and bitter almonds is in reality constituted thus finest curd soap 1 cwt oil soap 14 lbs marine 14 lbs otto of almonds 112 lb cloves 14 lb caraway 12 lb by the time that half the curd soap is melted the marine soap is to be added when this is well crutched then add the oil soap and finish with the remaining curd when the whole is well melted and just before turning it into the frame crutch in the mixed perfume some of the soap houses endeavored to use mirabane or artificial essence of almonds see almond for perfuming soap it being far cheaper than the true otto of almonds

hot or melted all the very highly scented soaps are however perfumed cold in order to avoid the loss of scent 20 per cent of perfume being evaporated by the hot process the variously named soaps from the sublime sultana to the ridiculous turtles marrow we cannot of course be expected to notice the reader may however rest assured that he has lost nothing by their omission the receipts given produce only the finest quality of the article named where cheap soaps are required not much acumen is necessary to discern that by omitting the expensive perfumes or lessening the quantity the object desired is attained still lower qualities of scented soap are made by using greater proportions of yellow soap and employing a very common curd omitting the oil soap altogether scenting soaps hot in the previous remarks the methods explained of scenting soap involved the necessity of melting it the high temperature of the soap under these circumstances involves the obvious loss of a great deal of perfume by evaporation with very highly scented soaps and with perfume of an expensive character the loss of ottos is too great to be borne in a commercial sense hence the adoption of the plan of scenting soaps cold this method is exceedingly convenient and economical for scenting small batches involving merely mechanical labor the tools required being simply an ordinary carpenters plane and a good marble mortar and lignum vit pestle the woodwork of the plane must be fashioned at each end so that when placed over the mortar it remains firm and not easily moved by the parallel pressure of the soap against its projecting blade to commence operations we take first 7 lbs 14 lbs or 21 lbs of the bars of the soap that it is intended to perfume the plane is now laid upside down across the top of the mortar things being thus arranged the whole of the soap is to be pushed across the plane until it is all reduced into fine shavings like the french charbonnier who does not saw the wood but woods the saw so it will be perceived that in this process we do not plane the soap but that we soap the plane the shavings of which fall lightly into the mortar as quickly as produced illustration soaping the plane soap as generally received from the maker is the proper condition for thus working but if it has been in stock any time it becomes too hard and must have from one to three ounces of distilled water sprinkled in the shaving for every pound of soap employed and must lay for at least twentyfour hours to be absorbed before the perfume is added when it is determined what size the cakes of soap are to be what they are to sell for and what it is intended they should cost then the maker can measure out his perfume in a general way soaps scented in this way retail from 4s to 10s per pound bearing about 100 per cent profit which is not too much considering their limited sale the soap being in a proper physical condition with regard to moisture c is now to have the perfume well stirred into it the pestle is then set to work for the process of incorporation after a couple of hours of warm exercise the soap is generally expected to be free from streaks and to be of one uniform consistency for perfuming soap in large portions by the cold process instead of using the pestle and mortar as an incorporator it is more convenient and economical to employ a mill similar in construction to a cake chocolatemill or a flake cocoamill any mechanical apparatus that answers for mixing paste and crushing lumps will serve pretty well for blending soap together before going into the mill the soap is to be reduced to shavings and have the scent and color stirred in after leaving it the flakes or ribands of soap are to be finally bound together by the pestle and mortar into one solid mass it is then weighed out in quantities for the tablets required and moulded by the hand into eggshaped masses each piece being left in this condition separately laid in rows on a sheet of white paper dries sufficiently in a day or so to be fit for the press which is the same as that previously mentioned it is usual before placing the cakes of soap in the press to dust them over with a little starchpowder or else to very slightly oil the mould either of these plans prevents the soap from adhering to the letters or embossed work of the moulda condition essential for turning out a clean wellstruck tablet the body of all the fine soaps mentioned below should consist of the finest and whitest curd soap or of a soap previously melted and colored to the required shade thus

duty we cannot compete with our neighbors in this article juniper tar soap this soap is made from the tar of the wood of the juniperus communis by dissolving it in a fixed vegetable oil such as almond or olive oil or in fine tallow and forming a soap by means of a weak soda lye after the customary manner this yields a moderately firm and clear soap which may be readily used by application to parts affected with eruptions at night mixed with a little water and carefully washed off the following morning this soap has lately been much used for eruptive disorders particularly on the continent and with varying degrees of success it is thought that the efficient element in its composition is a rather less impure hydrocarburet than that known in paris under the name huile de cade on account of its ready miscibility with water it possesses great advantage over the common tar ointment medicated soaps six years ago i began making a series of medicated soaps such as sulphur soap iodine soap bromine soap creosote soap mercurial soap croton oil soap and many others these soaps are prepared by adding the medicant to curd soap and then making in a tablet form for use for sulphur soap the curd soap may be melted and flowers of sulphur added while the soap is in a soft condition for antimony soap and mercurial soap the low oxides of the metals employed may also be mixed in the curd soap in a melted state iodine bromine creosote soap and others containing very volatile substances are best prepared cold by shaving up the curd soap in a mortar and mixing the medicant with it by long beating in certain cutaneous diseases the author has reason to believe that they will prove of infinite service as auxiliaries to the general treatment it is obvious that the absorbent vessels of the skin are very active during the lavoratory process such soap must not therefore be used except by the special advice of a medical man probably these soaps will be found useful for internal application the precedent of the use of castile soap containing oxide of iron renders it likely that when prejudice has passed away such soaps will find a place in the pharmacopoeias the discovery of the solubility under certain conditions of the active alkaloids quinine morphia c in oil by mr w bastick greatly favors the supposition of analogous compounds in soap section ix emulsines from soaps proper we now pass to those compounds used as substitutes for soap which are classed together under one general title as above for the reason that all cosmetiques herein embraced have the property of forming emulsions with water chemically considered they are an exceedingly interesting class of compounds and are well worthy of study being prone to decomposition as might be expected from their composition they should be made only in small portions or at least only in quantities to meet a ready sale while in stock they should be kept as cool as possible and free from a damp atmosphere

mixture is homogeneous then rub in the oil by degrees the perfume having been previously mixed with the oil illustration oilrunner in emulsine process in the manufacture of amandine and olivine the difficulty is to get in the quantity of oil indicated without which it does not assume that transparent jelly appearance which good amandine should have to attain this end the oil is put into a runner that is a tin or glass vessel at the bottom of which is a small faucet and spigot or tap the oil being put into this vessel is allowed to run slowly into the mortar in which the amandine is being made just as fast as the maker finds that he can incorporate it with the paste of soap and syrup and so long as this takes place the result will always have a jelly texture to the hand if however the oil be put into the mortar quicker than the workman can blend it with the paste then the paste becomes oiled and may be considered as done for unless indeed the whole process be gone through again starting off with fresh syrup and soap using up the greasy mass as if it were pure oil this liability to go off increases as the amandine nears the finish hence extra caution and plenty of elbow grease must be used during the addition of the last two pounds of oil if the oil be not perfectly fresh or if the temperature of the atmosphere be above the average of summer heat it will be almost impossible to get the whole of the oil given in the formula into combination when the mass becomes bright and of a crystalline lustre it will be well to stop the further addition of oil to it this and similar compounds should be potted as quickly as made and the lids of the pots banded either with strips of tinfoil or paper to exclude air when the amandine is filled into the jars the top or face of it is marked or ornamented with a tool made to the size of half the diameter of the interior of the jar in a similar way to a saw a piece of lead or tortoiseshell being serrated with an angular file

quickly burn to the bottom of the pan and impart to the whole an empyreumatic odor the large quantity of otto of almonds which is volatilized during the process renders it essential that the operator should avoid the vapor as much as possible when the almonds are nearly cooked the remaining water is to be added finally the paste is put into a mortar and well rubbed with the pestle then the perfume and spirit are added before potting this paste as well as honey paste it should be passed through a medium fine sieve to insure uniformity of texture especially as almonds do not grind kindly other

these preparations are expensive but they are undoubtedly the most exquisite of cosmetiques section x milk or emulsions in the perfumery trade few articles meet with a more ready sale than that class of cosmetiques denominated milks it has long been known that nearly all the seeds of plants which are called nuts when decorticated and freed from their pellicle on being reduced to a pulpy mass and rubbed with about four times their weight of water produce fluid which has every analogy to cows milk the milky appearance of these emulsions is due to the minute mechanical division of the oil derived from the nuts being diffused through the water all these emulsions possess great chemical interest on account of their rapid decomposition and the products emanating from their fermentation especially that made with sweet almonds and pistachios pistachia vera in the manufacture of various milks for sale careful manipulation is of the utmost importance otherwise these emulsions will not keep hence more loss than profit transformation takes place in the elements of vegetable caseine existing in seeds from the very moment that sweet almonds are converted into almondmilkliebig this

or three ounces of rosewater when the soap is perfectly melted add the wax and spermaceti without dividing them more than is necessary to obtain the correct weight this insures their melting slowly and allows time for their partial saponification by the fluid soap occasional stirring is necessary while this is going on blanch the almonds carefully excluding every particle that is in the least way damaged now proceed to beat up the almonds in a scrupulously clean mortar allowing the rosewater to trickle into the mass by degrees the runner as used for the oil in the manufacture of olivine is very convenient for this purpose when the emulsion of almonds is thus finished it is to be strained without pressure through clean washed muslin new muslin often contains starch flour gum or dextrine the previouslyformed saponaceous mixture is now to be placed in the mortar and the readyformed emulsion in the runner the soapy compound and the emulsion is then carefully blended together as the last of the emulsion runs into the mortar the spirit in which the otto of roses has been dissolved is to take its place and to be gradually trickled into the other ingredients a too sudden addition of the spirit frequently coagulates the milk and causes it to be curdled as it is the temperature of the mixture rises and every means must be taken to keep it down the constant agitation and cold mortar effecting that object pretty well finally the now formed milk of roses is to be strained the almond residue may be washed with a few ounces of fresh rosewater in order to prevent any loss in bulk to the whole given quantity the newlyformed milk should be placed into a bottle having a tap in it about a quarter of an inch from the bottom after standing perfectly quiet for twentyfour hours it is fit

alexandria and rome about 1700 years ago was the inventor of that peculiar unguent a mixture of grease and water which is now distinguished as cold cream in perfumery and as ceratum galeni in pharmacy the modern formula for cold cream is however quite a different thing to that given in the works of galen in point of odor and quality although substantially the samegrease and water in perfumery there are several kinds of cold cream distinguished by their odor such as that of camphor almond violet roses c cold cream as made by english perfumers bears a high reputation not only at home but throughout europe the quantity exported and which can only be reckoned by jars in hundreds of dozens and the repeated announcements that may be seen in the shops on the continent in germany france and italy of cold crme anglaise is good proof of the estimation in which it is held rose cold cream almond oil 1 lb rosewater 1 lb white wax spermaceti each 1 oz otto of roses 12 drachm manipulationinto a wellglazed thick porcelain vessel which should be deep in preference to shallow and capable of holding twice the quantity of cream that is to be made place the wax and sperm now put the jar into a boiling bath of water when these materials are melted add the oil and again subject the whole to heat until the flocks of wax and sperm are liquefied now remove the jar and contents and set it under a runner containing the rosewater the runner may be a tin can with a small tap at the bottom the same as used for the manufacture of milk of roses a stirrer must be provided made of lancewood flat and perforated with holes the size of a sixpence resembling in form a large paletteknife as soon as the rosewater is set running the cream must be kept agitated until the whole of the water has passed into it now and then the flow of water must be stopped and the cream which sets at the sides of the jar scraped down and incorporated with that which remains fluid when the whole of the water has been incorporated the cream will be cool enough to pour into the jars for sale at that time the otto of rose is to be added the reason for the perfume being put in at the last moment is obviousthe heat and subsequent agitation would cause unnecessary loss by evaporation cold cream made in this way sets quite firmly in the jars into which it is poured and retains a face resembling pure wax although onehalf is water retained in the interstices of the cream when the pots are well glazed it will keep good for one or two years if desired for exportation to the east or west indies it should always be sent out in stoppered bottles cold cream of almonds is prepared precisely as the above but in place of otto of roses otto of almonds is used violet cold cream huile violette 1 lb rosewater 1 lb wax

economical preparation generally admired tubereuse jasmine and fleur dorange cold creams are prepared in similar manner to violet first form they are all very exquisite preparations but as they cost more than rose cold cream perfumers are not much inclined to introduce them in lieu of the latter camphor cold cream otherwise camphor ice almond oil 1 lb rosewater 1 lb wax and spermaceti 1 oz

of cucumber 1 lb wax and sperm each 1 oz otto of neroli 14 drachm the cucumber juice is readily obtained by subjecting the fruit to pressure in the ordinary tincture press it must be raised to a temperature high enough to coagulate the small portion of albumen which it contains and then strained through fine linen as the heat is detrimental to the odor on account of the great volatility of the otto of cucumber the following method may be adopted with advantageslice the fruit very fine with a cucumbercutter and place them in the oil after remaining together for twentyfour hours repeat the operation using fresh fruit in the strained oil no warmth is necessary or at most not more than a summer heat then proceed to make the cold cream in the usual manner using the almond oil thus odorized the rosewater and other ingredients in the regular way perfuming if necessary with a little neroli another and commoner preparation of cucumber is found among the parisians which is lard simply scented with the juice from the fruit thusthe lard is liquefied by heat in a vessel subject to a waterbath the cucumber juice is then stirred well into it the vessel containing the ingredients is now placed in a quiet situation to cool the lard will rise to the surface and when cold must be removed from the fluid juice the same manipulation being repeated as often as required according to the strength of odor of the fruit desired in the grease pivers pomade of cucumber benzoinated lard 6 lbs spermaceti 2 lbs essence of cucumbers 1 lb melt the stearine with the lard then keep it

spermaceti each 1 oz otto of almonds 12 drachm geranium 14 after lip salve is poured into the pots and got cold a redhot iron must be held over them for a minute or so in order that the heat radiated from the irons may melt the surface of the salve and give it an even face common lip salve is made simply of equal parts of lard and suet colored with alkanet root and perfumed with an ounce of bergamot to every pound of salve section xii pomades and oils the name of pomatum is derived from pomum an apple because it was originally made by macerating overripe apples in grease if an apple be stuck all over with spice such as cloves then exposed to the air for a few days and afterwards macerated in purified melted lard or any other fatty matter the grease will become perfumed repeating the operation with the same grease several times produces real pomatum according to a recipe published more than a century ago the form given iskids grease an orange sliced pippins a glass of rosewater and half a glass of white wine boiled and strained and at last sprinkled with oil of sweet almonds the author dr quincy observes that the apple is of no significance at all in the recipe and like many authors of the present day concludes that the reader is as well acquainted with the subject as the writer and therefore considers that the weights or bulk of the materials in his recipe are likewise of no significance according to ancient writers unguent pomatum ointment are synonymous titles for medicated and perfumed greases among biblical interpreters the significant word is mostly rendered ointment thus we have in prov 279 ointment and perfume rejoice the heart in eccles 98 let thy head lack no ointment perfumers acting upon their own or dr quincys advice pay no regard to the apples in the preparation of pomatum but make it by perfuming lard or suet or a mixture of wax spermaceti and oil or some of them or all blended to produce a particular result according to the name that it bears the most important thing to consider in the manufacture of pomatum c is to start off with a perfectly inodorous grease whatever that grease may be inodorous lard is obtained thustake say 28 lbs of perfectly fresh lard place it in a wellglazed vessel that can be submitted to the heat of a boiling saltwater bath or by steam under a slight pressure when the lard is melted add to it one ounce of powdered alum and two ounces of table salt maintain the heat for some time in fact till a scum rises consisting in a great measure of coagulated proteine compounds membrane c which must be skimmed off when the liquid grease appears of a uniform nature it is allowed to grow cold the lard is now to be washed this is done in small portions at a time and is a work of much labor which however is amply repaid by the result about a pound of the grease is now placed on a slate slab a little on the incline a supply of good water being set to trickle over it the surface of the grease is then constantly renewed by an operative working a muller over it precisely as a colormaker grinds paints in oil in this way the water removes any traces of alum or salt also the last traces of nitrogenous matter finally the grease when the whole is washed in this way is remelted the heat being maintained enough to drive off any adhering water when cold it is finished although purifying grease in this way is troublesome and takes a good deal of time yet unless done so it is totally unfit for perfuming with flowers because a bad grease will cost more in perfume to cover its mal odeur than the expense of thus deodorizing it moreover if lard be used that smells of the pig it is next to impossible to impart to it any delicate odor and if strongly perfumed by the addition of ottos the unpurified grease will not keep but quickly becomes rancid under any circumstances therefore grease that is not perfectly inodorous is a very expensive material to use in the manufacture of pomades in the south and flowergrowing countries where the fine pomades are made by enfleurage or by macerationg see pp 37 38 the purification of grease for the purpose of these manufactures is of sufficient importance to become a separate trade the purification of beef and mutton suet is in a great measure the same as that for lard the greater solidity of suets requires a mechanical arrangement for washing them of a more powerful nature than can be applied by hand labor mr ewen who is undoubtedly the best fatpurifier in london employs a stone roller rotating upon a circular slab motion is given to the roller by an axle which passes through the centre of the slab or rather stone bed upon which the suet is placed being higher in the centre than at the sides the stream of water flows away after it has once passed over the suet in other respects the treatment is the same as for lard these greases used by perfumers have a general title of body tantamount to the french nomenclature of corps thus we have pomades of hard corps suet pomades of soft corps lard for making extraits such as extrait de violette jasmin the pomades of hard corps are to be preferred but when scented pomade is to be used in fabrication of unguents for the hair pomades of soft corps are the most useful the method of perfuming grease by the direct process with flowers having already been described under the respective names of the flowers that impart the odor thereto it remains now only to describe those compounds that are made from them together with such incidental matter connected with this branch of perfumery as has not been previously mentioned acacia pomade commonly called cassie pomatum is made with a purified bodygrease by maceration with the little round yellow buds of the acacia farnesiana black currant leaves and which the french term cassie have an odor very much resembling cassie acacia and are used extensively for adulterating the true acacia pomades and oils the near similarity of name their analogous odor although the plants have no botanical connection together with the word cassia a familiar perfume in england has produced generally confused ideas in this country as to the true origin of the odor now under discussion cassie casse cassia it will be understood now are three distinct substances and in order to render the matter more perspicuous in future the materials will always be denominated acacia if prepared from the acacia farnesiana casse when from black currant and cassia if derived from the bark of the cinnamomum cassia benzoin pomade and oil benzoic acid is perfectly soluble in hot grease half an ounce of benzoic acid being dissolved in half a pint of hot olive or almond oil deposits on cooling beautiful acicular crystals similar to the crystals that effloresce from vanilla beans a portion of the acid however remains dissolved in the oil at the ordinary temperature and imparts to it the peculiar aroma of benzoin upon this idea is based the principle of perfuming grease with gum benzoin by the direct process that is by macerating powdered gum benzoin in melted suet or lard for a few hours at a temperature of about 80 c to 90 c nearly all the gumresins give up their odoriferous principle to fatty bodies when treated in the same way this fact becoming generally known will probably give rise to the preparation of some new remedial ointments such as unguentum myrrh unguentum assafoetida and the like tonquin pomade and tonquin oil are prepared by macerating the ground tonquin beans in either melted fat or warm oil from twelve to twentyeight hours in the proportion of tonquin beans 12 lb fat or oil 4 lbs strain through fine muslin when cold the grease will have a fine odor of the beans vanilla oil and pomade vanilla pods 14 lb fat or oil 4 lbs macerate at a temperature of 25 c for three or four days finally strain these pomatums and oils together with the french pomades and huiles already described constitute the foundation of the preparations of all the best hair greases sold by perfumers inferior scented pomatums and oils are prepared by perfuming lard suet wax oil c with various ottos the results however in many instances more expensive than the foregoing are actually inferior in their odor or bouquetfor grease however slightly perfumed by maceration or enfleurage with flowers is far more agreeable to the olfactory nerve than when scented by ottos the undermentioned greases have obtained great popularity mainly because their perfume is lasting and flowery pomade called bears grease the most popular and original bears grease is made thus huile de rose fleur dorange acacia of each 12 lb tubereuse and jasmin almond oil 10 lbs lard 12 lbs acacia pomade 2 lbs otto of bergamot 4 oz cloves 2 oz melt the solid greases and oils together by a waterbath then add the ottos bears grease thus prepared is just hard enough to set in the pots at a summer heat in very warm weather or if required for exportation

the grease cools minute vesicles of air are inclosed by the pomatum which not only increase the bulk of the mixtures but impart a peculiar mechanical aggregation rendering the pomatum light and spongy

all the cheap preparations for the hair the manufacturing perfumers used the washed french pomatums and the washed french oils for making their greases washed pomatums and washed oils are those

manufacture of essences for the handkerchief after the spirit has been on the pomatums c it is poured off the residue is then called washed pomatum and still retain an odor strong enough for the manufacture of most hair greases for pomatums of other odors it is only necessary to substitute rose jasmine tubereuse and others in place of the acacia pomatum in the above formul pomade double

xiii hair dyes and depilatory by way of personal adornment few practices are of more ancient origin than that of painting the face dyeing the hair and blackening the eyebrows and eyelashes it is a practice universal among the women of the higher and middle classes in egypt and very common among those of the lower orders to blacken the edge of the eyelids both above and below the eye with a black powder which they term kohhl the kohhl is applied with a small probe of wood ivory or silver tapering towards the end but blunt this is moistened sometimes with rosewater then dipped in the powder and drawn along the edges of the eyelids it is thought to give a very soft expression to the eye the size of which in appearance it enlarges to which circumstances probably jeremiah refers when he writes though thou rentest thy face or thine eyes with painting in vain shalt thou make thyself fairjer 430 see also lanes modern egyptians vol i p 41 et seq a singular custom is observable both among moorish and arab femalesthat of ornamenting the face between the eyes with clusters of bluish spots or other small devices and which being stained become permanent the chin is also spotted in a similar manner and a narrow blue line extends from the point of it and is continued down the throat the eyelashes eyebrows and also the tips and extremities of the eyelids are colored black the soles and sometimes other parts of the feet as high as the ankles the palms of the hands and the nails are dyed with a yellowishred with the leaves of a plant called henna lawsonia inermis the leaf of which somewhat resembles the myrtle and is dried for the purposes above mentioned the back of the hand is also often colored and ornamented in this way with different devices on holidays they paint their cheeks of a red brick color a narrow red line being also drawn down the temples in greece for coloring the lashes and sockets of the eye they throw incense or gum labdanum on some coals of fire intercept the smoke which ascends with a plate and collect the soot this i saw applied a girl sitting crosslegged as usual on a sofa and closing one of her eyes took the two lashes between the forefinger and thumb of her left hand pulled them forward and then thrusting in at the external corner a sort of bodkin or probe which had been immersed in the soot and withdrawing it the particles previously adhering to the probe remained within the eyelasheschandlers travels in greece dr shaw states that among other curiosities that were taken out of the tombs at sahara relating to egyptian women he saw a joint of the common reeds which contained one of these bodkins and an ounce or more of this powder in england the same practice is adopted by many persons that have gray hair but instead of using the black material in the form of a powder it is employed as a crayon the color being mixed with a greasy body such as the brown and black stick pomatums described in the previous article turkish hair dye in constantinople there are some persons particularly armenians who devote themselves to the preparation of cosmetics and obtain large sums of money from those desirous of learning this art amongst these cosmetics is a black dye for the hair which according to landerer is prepared in the following manner finely pulverized galls are kneaded with a little oil to a paste which is roasted in an iron pan until the oil vapors cease to evolve upon which the residue is triturated with water into a paste and heated again to dryness at the same time a metallic mixture which is brought from egypt to the commercial marts of the east and which is termed in turkish rastikopetra or rastikyuzi is employed for this purpose this metal which looks like dross is by some armenians intentionally fused and consists of iron and copper it obtains its name from its use for the coloration of the hair and particularly the eyebrowsfor rastik means eyebrows and yuzi stone the fine powder of this metal is as intimately mixed as possible with the moistened gallmass into a paste which is preserved in a damp place by which it acquires the blackening property in some cases this mass is mixed with the powder of odorous substances which are used in the seraglio as perfumes and called harsi that is pleasant odor and of these the principal ingredient is ambergris to blacken the hair a little of this dye is triturated in the hand or between the fingers with which the hair or beard is well rubbed after a few days the hair becomes very beautifully black and it is a real pleasure to see such fine black beards as are met with in the east among the turks who use this black dye another and important advantage in the use of this dye consists therein that the hair remains soft pliant and for a long time black when it has been once dyed with this substance that the coloring properties of this dye are to be chiefly ascribed to the pyrogallic acid which can be found by treating the mass with water may be with certainty assumed litharge hair dye powdered litharge 2 lbs quicklime 12 lb calcined magnesia 12 lb slake the lime using as little water as possible to make it disintegrate

of the neck to be detrimental to beauty those who are troubled with such physical indications of good health and vital stamina have long had recourse to rusma or depilatory for removing it this or analogous preparations were introduced into this country from the east rusma having been in use in the harems of asia for many ages best lime slaked 3 lb orpiment in powder 12 lbs mix the material by means of a drum sieve preserve the same for sale in wellcorked or stoppered bottles directions to be sold with the above mix the depilatory powder with enough water to render it of a creamy consistency lay it upon the hair for about five minutes or until its caustic action upon the skin renders it necessary to be removed a similar process to shaving is then to be gone through but instead of using a razor operate with an ivory or bone paperknife then wash the part with plenty of water and apply a little cold cream the precise time to leave depilatory upon the part to be depilated cannot be given because there is a physical difference in the nature of hair raven tresses require more time than flaxen locks the sensitiveness of the skin has also to be considered a small feather is a very good test for its action a few readers will perhaps be disappointed in finding that i have only given one formula for depilatory the receipts might easily have been increased in number but not in quality the use of arsenical compounds is objectionable but it undoubtedly increases the depilating action of the compounds a few compilers of receipt books supplements to pharmacopoeias and others add to the lime charcoal powder carbonate of potass starch c but what action have these materialschemicallyupon hair the simplest depilatory is moistened quicklime but it is less energetic than the mixture recommended above it answers very well for tanners and fellmongers with whom time is no object section xiv absorbent powders a ladys toilettable is incomplete without a box of some absorbent powder indeed from our earliest infancy powder is used for drying the skin with the greatest benefit no wonder that its use is continued in advanced years if by slight modifications in its composition it can be employed not only as an absorbent but as a means of personal adornment we are quite within limits in stating that many tonweights of such powders are used in this country annually they are principally composed of various starches prepared from wheat potatoes and various nuts mixed more or less with powdered talcof hay steatite soapstone french chalk oxide of bismuth

discolor from emanation of the skin or impure atmosphere liquid blanc for theatrical use the use of a white paint by actresses and dancers is absolutely necessary great exertion produces a florid complexion which is incompatible with certain scenic effects and requires a cosmetic to subdue it madame v during her stage career has probably consumed more than half a hundredweight of oxide of bismuth prepared thus rose or orangeflower water 1 pint oxide of bismuth 4 oz mixed by long trituration calcined talc is also extensively used as a toilet powder and is sold under various names it is not so unctuous as the ordinary kind rouge and red paints these preparations are in demand not only for theatrical use but by private individuals various shades of color are made to suit the complexions of the blonde and brunette one of the best kind is that termed bloom of roses strong liquid ammonia 12 oz finest carmine 14 oz rosewater 1 pint esprit de rose triple 12 oz place the carmine into a pint bottle and pour on it the ammonia allow them to remain together with occasional agitation for two days then add the rosewater and esprit and well mix place the bottle in a quiet situation for a week any precipitate of impurities from the carmine will subside the supernatant bloom of roses is then to be bottled for sale if the carmine was perfectly pure there would be no precipitate nearly all the carmine purchased from the makers is more or less sophisticated its enormous price being a premium to its adulteration carmine cannot be manufactured profitably on a small scale for commercial purposes four or five manufacturers supply the whole of europe m titard rue grenier st lazare paris produces without doubt the finest article singular enough however the principal operative in the establishment is an old englishman the preparation of the finest carmine is still a mystery because on the one hand its consumption being very limited few persons are engaged in its manufacture and upon the other the raw material being costly extensive experiments on it cannot be conveniently madedr ure in the encyclopdie roret will be found no less than a dozen recipes for preparing carmine the number of formul will convince the most superficial reader that the true form is yet withheld analysis has taught us its exact composition but a certain dexterity of manipulation and proper temperature are indispensable to complete success most of the recipes given by dr ure and others are from this source but as they possess no practical value we refrain from reprinting them toilet rouges are prepared of different shades by mixing fine carmine with talc powder in different proportions say one drachm of carmine to two ounces of talc or one of carmine to three of talc and so on these rouges are sold in powder and also in cake or china pots for the latter the rouge is mixed with a minute portion of solution of gum tragacanth m titard prepares a great variety of rouges in some instances the coloringmatter of the cochineal is spread upon thick paper and dried very gradually it then assumes a beautiful green tint this curious optical effect is also observed in pink saucers what is known as chinese book rouge is evidently made in the same way and has been imported into this country for many years when the bronze green cards are moistened with a piece of damp cotton wool and applied to the lips or cheeks the color assumes a beautiful rosy hue common sorts of rouge called theatre rouge are made from the brazilwood lake another kind is derived from the safflower carthamus tinctorius from this plant also is made pink saucers the safflower is washed in water until the yellow coloringmatter is removed the carthamine or color principle is then dissolved out by a weak solution of carbonate of soda the coloring is then precipitated into the saucers by the addition of sulphuric acid to the solution cotton wool and crape being colored in the same way are used for the same purpose the former being sold as spanish wool the latter as crpon rouge section xv tooth powders and mouth washes tooth powders regarded as a means merely of cleansing the teeth are most commonly placed among cosmetics but this should not be as they assist greatly in preserving a healthy and regular condition of the dental machinery and so aid in perfecting as much as possible the act of mastication in this manner they may be considered as most useful although it is true subordinate medicinal agents by a careful and prudent use of them some of the most frequent causes of early loss of the teeth may be prevented these are the deposition of tartar the swelling of the gums and an undue acidity of the saliva the effect resulting from accumulation of the tartar is well known to most persons and it has been distinctly shown that swelling of the substance of the gums will hasten the expulsion of the teeth from their sockets and the action of the saliva if unduly acid is known to be at least injurious if not destructive now the daily employment of a tooth powder sufficiently hard so as to exert a tolerable degree of friction upon the teeth without at the same time injuring the enamel of the teeth will in most cases almost always prevent the tartar accumulating in such a degree as to cause subsequent injury to the teeth and a flaccid spongy relaxed condition of the gums may be prevented or overcome by adding to such a tooth powder some tonic and astringent ingredient a tooth powder containing charcoal and cinchona bark will accomplish these results in most cases and therefore dentists generally recommend such still there are objections to the use of charcoal it is too hard and resisting its color is objectionable and it is perfectly insoluble by the saliva it is apt to become lodged between the teeth and there to collect decomposing animal and vegetable matter around such particles as may be fixed in this position cinchona bark too is often stringy and has a bitter disagreeable taste m mialhe highly recommends the following formula mialhes tooth powder sugar of milk one thousand parts lake ten parts pure tannin fifteen parts oil of mint

glycerine is generally made on the large scale on the one hand by directly saponifying oil with the oxide of lead or on the other from the waste liquor of soap manufacturers to obtain glycerine by means of the first of these methods is the reverse of simple and at the same time somewhat expensive and by means of the second process the difficulty of entirely separating the saline matters of the waste liquor renders it next to impossible to procure a perfectly pure result to meet both these difficulties and to meet the steadily increasing demand for glycerine dr campbell morfit recommends the following process which he asserts he has found by experience to combine the desirable advantages of economy as regards time trouble and expense one hundred pounds of oil tallow lard or stearin are to be placed in a clean ironbound barrel and melted by the direct application of a current of steam whilst still fluid and warm add to it fifteen pounds of lime previously slaked and made into a milky mixture with two and a half gallons of water then cover the vessel and continue the steaming for several hours or until the saponification shall be completed this may be known when a sample of the soap when cold gives a smooth and bright surface on being scraped with the fingernail and at the same time breaks with a crackling noise by this process the fat or oil is decomposed its acids uniting with the lime to form insoluble limesoap while the eliminated glycerine remains in solution in the water along with the excess of the lime after it has been sufficiently boiled it is allowed to cool and to settle and it is then to be strained the strained liquid contains only the glycerine and excess of lime and requires to be carefully concentrated by heated steam during evaporation a portion of the lime is deposited on account of its lesser solubility in hot than in cold water the residue is removed by treating the evaporated liquid with a current of carbonic acid gas boiling by heated steam to convert a soluble bicarbonate of lime that may have been formed into insoluble neutral carbonate decanting or straining off the clear supernatant liquid from the precipitated carbonate of lime and evaporating still further as before if necessary so as to drive off any excess of water as nothing fixed or injurious is employed in this process glycerine prepared in this manner may be depended upon for its almost absolute purity m jahns process is as follows take of finelypowdered litharge five pounds and olive oil nine pounds boil them together over a gentle fire constantly stirring with the addition occasionally of a small quantity of warm water until the compound has the consistence of plaster jahn boils this plaster for half an hour with an equal weight of water keeping it at the same time constantly stirred when cold he pours off the supernatant fluid and repeats the boiling three times at least with a fresh portion of water the sweet fluids which result are mixed and evaporated to six pounds and sulphuretted hydrogen conducted through them as long as sulphuret of lead is precipitated the liquid filtered from the sulphuret of lead is to be reduced to a thin syrupy consistence by evaporation to remove the brown coloring matter it must be treated with purified animal charcoal however this agent does not prevent the glycerine becoming slightly colored upon further evaporation it possesses also still a slight smell and taste of lead plaster which may be removed by diluting it with water and by digestion with animal charcoal and some fresh burntwood charcoal after filtration this liquid must be evaporated until it has acquired a specific gravity of 121 when it will be found to be free from smell and of a pale yellow color for the preparation of glycerine distilled water is necessary to prevent it being contaminated with the impurities of common water jahn obtained by this method from the above quantity of lead plaster upwards of seven ounces of glycerinearchives der pharmacie test for alcohol in essential oils jj bernoulli recommends for this purpose acetate of potash when to an ethereal oil contaminated with alcohol dry acetate of potash is added this salt dissolves in the alcohol and forms a solution from which the volatile oil separates if the oil be free from alcohol this salt remains dry therein wittstein who speaks highly of this test has suggested the following method of applying it as the bestin a dry testtube about half an inch in diameter and five or six inches long put no more than eight grains of powdered dry acetate of potash then fill the tube twothirds full with the essential oil to be examined the contents of the tube must be well stirred with a glass rod taking care not to allow the salt to rise above the oil afterwards set aside for a short time if the salt be found at the bottom of the tube dry it is evident that the oil contains no spirit oftentimes instead of the dry salt beneath the oil is found a clear syrupy fluid which is a solution of the salt in the spirit with which the oil was mixed when the oil contains only a little spirit a small portion of the solid salt will be found under the syrupy solution many essential oils frequently contain a trace of water which does not materially interfere with this test because although the acetate of potash becomes moist thereby it still retains its pulverent form a still more certain result may be obtained by distillation in a waterbath all the essential oils which have a higher boilingpoint than spirit remain in the retort whilst the spirit passes into the receiver with only a trace of the oil where the alcohol may be recognized by the smell and taste should however a doubt exist add to the distillate a little acetate of potash and strong sulphuric acid and heat the mixture in a testtube to the boilingpoint when the characteristic odor of acetic ether will be manifest if any alcohol be present detection of poppy and other drying oils in almond and olive oils it is known that the olein of the drying oils may be distinguished from the olein of those oils which remain greasy in the air by the first not being convertible into elaidic acid consequently it does not become solid professor wimmer has recently proposed a convenient method for the formation of elaidin which is applicable for the purpose of detecting the adulteration of almond and olive oils with drying oils he produces nitrous acid by treating iron filings in a glass bottle with nitric acid the vapor of nitrous acid is conducted through a glass tube into water upon which the oil to be tested is placed if the oil of almonds or olives contains only a small quantity of poppy oil when thus treated it is entirely converted into crystallized elaidin whilst the poppy oil swims on the top in drops coloring matter of volatile oils by ge sachsse it is well known that most ethereal oils are colorless however there are a great number colored some of which are blue some green and some yellow up to the present time the question has not been decided whether it is the necessary property of ethereal oils to have a color or whether their color is not due to the presence of some coloring matter which can be removed it is most probable that their color arises from the presence of a foreign substance as the colored ethereal oils can at first by careful distillation be obtained colorless whilst later the colored portion passes over subsequent appearances lead to the solution of the question and are certain evidence that ethereal oils when they are colored owe their color to peculiar substances which by certain conditions may be communicated from one oil to another when a mixture of oils of wormwood lemons and cloves is subjected to distillation the previously greencolored oil of wormwood passes over at the commencement colorless while towards the end of the distillation after the receiver has been frequently charged the oil of cloves distils over in very dense drops of a dark green color it therefore appears that the green coloring matter of the oil of wormwood has been transferred to the oil of cloveszeitschrift fr pharmacie artificial preparation of oil of cinnamon by a strecker some years since strecker has shown that styrone which is obtained when styracine is treated with potash is the alcohol of cinnamic acid wolff has converted this alcohol by oxidizing agents into cinnamic acid the author has now proved that under the same conditions by which ordinary alcohol affords aldehyde styrone affords the aldehyde of cinnamic acid that is oil of cinnamon it is only necessary to moisten platinum black with styrone and let it remain in the air some days when by means of the bisulphite of potash the aldehyde double compound may be obtained in crystals which should be washed in ether by the addition of diluted sulphuric acid the aldehyde of cinnamic acid is afterwards procured pure these crystals also dissolve in nitric acid and then form after a few moments crystals of the nitrate of the hyduret of cinnamyle the conversion of styrone into the hyduret of cinnamyle by the action of the platinum black is shown by the following equation c18h10o2 2 o c18h8o2 2 hocomptes rendus detection of spike oil and turpentine in lavender oil by dr j gastell there are two kinds of lavender oil known in commerce one which is very dear and is obtained from the flowers of the lavandula vera the other is much cheaper and is prepared from the flowers of the lavandula spica the latter is generally termed oil of spike in the south of france whether the oil be distilled from the flowers of the lavandula vera or lavandula spica it is named oil of lavender by the distillation of the whole plant or only the stalk and the leaves a small quantity of oil is obtained which is rich in camphor and is there called oil of spike pure oil of lavender should have a specific gravity from 876 to 880 and be completely soluble in five parts of alcohol of a specific gravity of 894 a greater specific gravity shows that it is mixed with oil of spike and a less solubility that it contains oil of turpentine different orangeflower waters found in commerce by m leguay there are three sorts of orangeflower waters found in commerce the first is distilled from the flowers the second is made with distilled water and neroli and the third is distilled from the leaves the stems and the young unripe fruit of the orange tree the first may be easily distinguished by the addition of a few drops of sulphuric acid to some of the water in a tube a fine rose color is almost immediately produced the second also gives the same color when it is freshly prepared but after a certain time two or three months at the farthest this color is no longer produced and the aroma disappears completely the third is not discolored by the addition of the sulphuric acid it has scarcely any odor and that rather an odor of the lemon plant than of orangeflowersbulletin de la socit pharmaceutique dindre et loire a formula for concentrated elderflower water krembs recommends the following process for making a concentrated elderflower water from which he states the ordinary water can be extemporaneously prepared of excellent quality and of uniform strength2 lbs of the flowers are to be distilled with water until that which passes into the receiver has lost nearly all perfume this will generally happen when from 15 to 18 pounds have passed over to the distillate 2 lbs of alcohol are to be added and the mixture distilled until about 5 lbs are collected this liquor contains all the odor of the flowers to make the ordinary water 2 ounces of the concentrated water are to be added to 10 ounces of distilled waterbuchners report practical remarks on spirit of wine by thomas arnall the strength of spirit of wine is by law regulated by proof spirit sp gr 920 as a standard and accordingly as it is either stronger or weaker than the above it is called so much per cent above or below proof the term per cent is used in this instance in a rather peculiar sense thus spirit of wine at 56 per cent overproof signifies that 100 gallons of it are equal to 156 gallons of proof spirit while a spirit at 20 per cent underproof signifies that 100 gallons are equal to 80 gallons at proof the rectified spirit of the pharmacopoeia is 56 per cent overproof and may be reduced to proof by strictly adhering to the directions there given viz to mix five measures with three of water the result however will not be eight measures of proof spirit in consequence of the contraction which ensues there will be a deficiency of about symbol oziv in each gallon this must be borne in mind in preparing tinctures during a long series of experiments on the preparation of ethers it appeared a desideratum to find a ready method of ascertaining how much spirit of any density would be equal to one chemical equivalent of absolute alcohol by a modification of a rule employed by the excise this question may be easily solved the excise rule is as follows to reduce from any given strength to any required strength add the overproof per centage to 100 or subtract the underproof per centage from 100 multiply the result by the quantity of spirit and divide the product by the number obtained by adding the required per centage overproof or subtracting the required per centage underproof to or from 100 as the case may be the result will give the measure of the spirit at the strength required thus suppose you wished to reduce 10 gallons of spirit at 54 overproof down to proof add 54 to 100 154 multiply by the quantity 10 gallons 154 10 1540 the required strength being proof of course there is nothing either to add to or take from 100 therefore 1540 divided by 100 154 gallons at proof showing that 10 gallons must be made to measure 15 gallons 3 pints 4 fl oz by the addition of water to ascertain what quantity of spirit of any given strength will contain one equivalent of absolute alcohol add the overproof per centage of the given spirit to 100 as before and with the number thus obtained divide 4062183 the result gives in gallons the quantity equal to four equivalents 46 4 examplehow much spirit at 54 per cent overproof is equal to 1 equivalent of absolute alcohol here 54 100 154 and 4062183 263778 galls or 26 galls 3 pts 154 which divided by 4 gives 6 gallons 4 pints 15 oz suppose the spirit to be 60 overproof 4062183 onefourth of which is equal then 25388 gallons to 6 gallons 2 pints 100 60 1512 oz this rule is founded on the following data as a gallon of water weighs 10 lbs it is obvious that the specific gravity of any liquid multiplied by 10 will give the weight of one gallon the specific gravity of absolute alcohol is 0793811 hence the weight of one gallon will be 793811 lbs and its strength is estimated at 7525 overproof 4 equivalents of alcohol 46 4 184 and 2317936 gallons 793811 lbs per gallon also 1840003094 hence it appears that 2317936 gallons of absolute alcohol are equal to 4 equivalents by adding the overproof per centage 7525 to 100 and multiplying by the quantity 2317936 gallons we get the constant number 4062183 the rule might have been calculated so as to show at once the equivalent without dividing by 4 but it would have required several more places of decimals it will give the required quantity to a fraction of a fluid drachm purification of spirits by filtration by mr w schaeffer instead of resorting to repeated distillations for effecting the purification of spirits mr schaeffer proposes the use of a filter in a suitable vessel the form of which is not material a filtering bed is constructed in the following manneron a false perforated bottom covered with woollen or other fabric a layer of about six inches of wellwashed and very clean river sand is placed next about twelve inches of granular charcoal preferring that made from birch on the charcoal is placed a layer of about one inch of wheat boiled to such an extent as to cause it to swell as large as possible and so that it will readily crush between the fingers above this is laid about ten inches of charcoal then about one inch of broken oyster shells and then about two inches more of charcoal over which is placed a layer of woollen or other fabric and over it a perforated partition on to which the spirit to be filtered is poured the filter is kept covered and in order that the spirit may flow freely into the compartment of the filter below the filtering materials a tube connects such lower compartment with the upper compartment of the filter so that the air may pass freely between the lower and upper compartments of the filter on each of the several strata above described it is desirable to place a layer of filtering paper the charcoal suitable for the above purpose is not such as is obtained in the ordinary mode of preparation it is placed in a retort or oven and heated to a red heat until the blue flame has passed off and the flame become red the charcoal is then cooled in water in which carbonate of potash has previously been dissolved in the proportion of two ounces of carbonate to fifty gallons of water the charcoal being deprived of the water is then reduced to a granular state in which condition it is ready for use on essential oil or otto of lemons by john s cobb read before the chemical discussion society i have recently made some experiments with oil of lemons of which the following is a short account being constantly annoyed by the deposit and alteration in my essence of lemons i have tried various methods of remedying the inconvenience i first tried redistilling it but besides the loss consequent on distilling small quantities the flavor is thereby impaired as the oil became brighter when heated i anticipated that all its precipitable matter would be thrown down at a low temperature and i applied a freezing mixture keeping the oil at zero for some hours no such change however took place the plan which i ultimately decided upon as the best which i had arrived at was to shake up the oil with a little boiling water and to leave the water in the bottle a mucilaginous preparation forms on the top of the water and acquires a certain tenacity so that the oil may be poured off to nearly the last without disturbing the deposit perhaps cold water would answer equally well were it carefully agitated with the oil and allowed some time to settle a consideration of its origin and constitution indeed strengthens this opinion for although lemon otto is obtained both by distillation and expression that which is usually found in commerce is prepared by removing the flavedo of lemons with a rasp and afterwards expressing it in a hair sack allowing the filtrate to stand that it may deposit some of its impurities decanting and filtering thus obtained it still contains a certain amount of mucilaginous matter which undergoes spontaneous decomposition and thus acting in short as a ferment accelerates a similar change in the oil itself if this view of its decomposition be a correct one we evidently in removing this matter by means of the water get rid of a great source of alteration and attain the same result as we should by distillation without its waste or deterioration in flavor i am however aware that some consider the deposit to be modified resinh some curious experiments of saussure have shown that volatile oils absorb oxygen immediately they have been drawn from the plant and are partially converted into a resin which remains dissolved in the remainder of the essence he remarked that this property of absorbing oxygen gradually increases until a maximum is attained and again diminishes after a certain lapse of time in the oil of lavender this maximum remained only seven days during each of which it absorbed seven times its volume of oxygen in the oil of lemons the maximum was not attained until at the end of a month it then lasted twentysix days during each of which it absorbed twice its volume of oxygen the oil of turpentine did not attain the maximum for five months it then remained for one month during which time it absorbed daily its own volume of oxygen it is the resin formed by the absorption of oxygen and remaining dissolved in the essence which destroys its original flavor the oil of lemons presents a very great analogy with that of oil of turpentine so far as regards its transformations and its power of rotating a ray of polarized light authorities differ as regards this latter property pereira states that the oil of turpentine obtained by distillation with water from american turpentine has a molecular power of righthanded rotation while the french oil of turpentine had a lefthanded rotation oil of lemons rotates a ray of light to the right but in france a distilled oil of lemons sold as scouring drops for removing spots of grease possesses quite the opposite power of rotation and has lost all the original peculiar flavor of the oil oil of lemons combines with hydrochloric acid to form an artificial camphor just in the same manner as does oil of turpentine but its atom is only one half that of the oil of turpentine the artificial camphor of oil of lemons is represented by the formula c10h8hcl the artificial camphor of oil of turpentine by c20h16hcl according to m biot the camphor formed by the oil of lemons does not exercise any action on polarized light whilst the oil of lemons itself rotates a ray to the right the camphor from oil of turpentine on the contrary does exercise on the polarized ray the same power as the oil possessed while in its isolated state of rotating to the left these molecular properties establish an essential difference between the oils of turpentine and lemons and may serve to detect adulteration and fraud it is also a curious fact that from the decomposition of these artificial camphors by lime volatile oils may be obtained by distillation isomeric with the original oils from which the camphors were formed but in neither case has the new product any action on polarized light in conclusion i would recommend that this oil as well as all other essential oils be kept in a cool dark place where no very great changes of temperature occur benzoic acid and tests for its purity by w bastick dr mohrs process for obtaining benzoic acid which is adopted by the prussian pharmacopoeia unquestionably has the reputation of being the best according to this process coarselypowdered gum benzoin is to be strewed on the flat bottom of a round iron pot which has a diameter of nine inches and a height of about two inches on the surface of the pot is spread a piece of filtering paper which is fastened to its rim by starch paste a cylinder of very thick paper is attached by means of a string to the top of the iron pot heat is then applied by placing the pot on a plate covered with sand over the mouth of a furnace it must remain exposed to a gentle fire from four to six hours mohr usually obtains about an ounce and a half of benzoic acid from twelve ounces of gum benzoin by the first sublimation as the gum is not exhausted by the first operation it may be bruised when cold and again submitted to the action of heat when a fresh portion of benzoic acid will sublime from it this acid thus obtained is not perfectly pure and white and mohr states that it is a question in a medicinal and perfumery point of view whether it is so valuable when perfectly pure as when it contains a small portion of a fragrant volatile oil which rises with it from the gum in the process of sublimation the london pharmacopoeia directs that it shall be prepared by sublimation and does not prescribe that it shall be free from this oil to which it principally owes its agreeable odor by the second sublimation the whole of the benzoic acid is not volatilized what remains in the resin may be separated by boiling it with caustic lime and precipitating the acid from the resulting benzoate of lime with hydrochloric acid benzoic acid can be obtained also in the wet way and the resin yields a greater product in this process than in the former yet it has a less perfumery value because it is free from the volatile oil which as above stated gives it its peculiar odor the wet method devised by scheele is as followsmake one ounce of freshlyburnt lime into a milk with from four to six ounces of hot water to the milk of lime four ounces of powdered benzoin and thirty ounces of water are to be added and the mixture boiled for half an hour and stirred during this operation and afterwards strained through linen the residue must be a second time boiled with twenty ounces of water and strained and a third time with ten ounces the fluid products must be mixed and evaporated to onefourth of their volume and sufficient hydrochloric acid added to render them slightly acid when quite cold the crystals are to be separated from the fluid by means of a linen strainer upon which they are to be washed with cold water and pressed and then dissolved in hot distilled water from which the crystals separate on cooling when hydrochloric acid is added to a cold concentrated solution of the salts of benzoic acid it is precipitated as a white powder if the solution of the salts of this acid is too dilute and warm none or only a portion of the benzoic acid will be separated however the weaker the solution is and the more slowly it is cooled the larger will be the crystals of this acid in the preparation of this acid in the wet way lime is to be preferred to every other base because it forms insoluble combinations with the resinous constituents of the benzoin and because it prevents the gumresin from conglomerating into an adhesive mass and also because an excess of this base is but slightly soluble stoltze has recommended a method by which all the acid can be removed from the benzointhe resin is to be dissolved in spirit to which is to be added a watery solution of carbonate of soda decomposed previously by alcohol the spirit is to be removed by distillation and the remaining watery solution from which the resin has been separated by filtration treated with dilute sulphuric acid to precipitate the benzoic acid this method gives the greatest quantity of acid but is attended with a sacrifice of time and alcohol which renders it in an economical point of view inferior to the above process of scheele it is so far valuable that the total acid contents of the resin can be determined by it dr gregory considers the following process for obtaining benzoic acid the most productive dissolve benzoin in strong alcohol by the aid of heat and add to the solution whilst hot hydrochloric acid in sufficient quantity to precipitate the resin when the mixture is distilled the benzoic acid passes over in the form of benzoic ether distillation must be continued as long as any ether passes over water added towards the end of the operation will facilitate the expulsion of the ether from the retort when the ether ceases to pass over the hot water in the retort is filtered which deposits benzoic acid on cooling the benzoic ether and all the distilled liquids are now treated with caustic potash until the ether is decomposed and the solution is heated to boiling and supersaturated with hydrochloric acid which afterwards on cooling deposits in crystals benzoic acid benzoic acid as it exists in the resin is the natural production of the plant from which the resin is derived it may also be produced artificially abel found that when cumole c18h12 was treated with nitric acid so dilute that no red vapors were evolved for several days this hydrocarbon was converted into benzoic acid guckelberger has by the oxidation of casein with peroxide of manganese and sulphuric acid obtained as one of the products benzoic acid albumen fibrin and gelatin yielded similar results when treated as above whler has detected benzoic acid in canadian castor along with salicin it is also formed by the oxidation of the volatile oil of bitter almonds benzoate of potash results when chloride of benzoyle is treated with caustic potash benzoic acid in the animal economy is converted into hippuric acid which may by the action of acids be reconverted into benzoic acid benzoic acid should be completely volatile without leaving any ash or being carbonized when heated when dissolved in warm water to which a little nitric acid has been added nitrate of silver and chloride of barium should produce no precipitates oxalate of potash should give no turbidity to an ammoniacal solution of this acid when heated with an excess of caustic potash it should evolve no smell of ammonia otherwise it has been adulterated with sal ammoniac in spirit benzoic acid is easily soluble and requires 200 parts of cold and 20 parts of boiling water to dissolve one part of it on the coloringmatters of flowers by fremy and cloez chemists possess only a very incomplete knowledge of the coloring matters of flowers their investigation involves difficulties which cannot be mistaken the matters which color flowers are uncrystallized they frequently change by the action of the reagents employed for their preparation and also very brilliantlycolored flowers owe their color to very small quantities of coloring matter on the nature of the coloring matters of flowers several opinions have been expressed some observers have assumed that flowers owe their color to only two coloring matters one of which is termed anthocyan and the other anthoxanthine others will find a relation between the green coloring of leaves the chlorophylle and the coloring matters of flowers they support their opinion generally on the results of the elementary analysis of those different bodies but all chemists know that chlorophylle has not yet been prepared in a pure condition probably it retains various quantities of fatty and albuminous bodies further the coloring matters of flowers are scarcely known so that it is impossible to establish relations supported by the necessarily uncertain composition of impure bodies some time since the blue color of flowers was ascribed to the presence of indigo but chevreul has shown in a certain way that the blue substance of flowers is always reddened by acids and that with indigo it is quite different which as is known retains its blue color even when the strongest acids are allowed to act on it it is thus seen that the coloring matters of flowers have heretofore only in a superficial manner been examined and that it is important to again undertake their complete examination as these bodies are interesting to the chemist because they are employed as reagents in the laboratory for the recognition of alkalies and by an improved knowledge of them the florist might find the way by which he could give to cultivated flowers various colors we have believed that before undertaking their elementary analysis methods must be carefully sought for which can be followed for the obtainment of the coloring matters of flowers and that it should be proved whether these substances are to be considered as independent bodies or whether they proceed from one and the same matter which is changed in various ways by the juices of the plant we now publish the results of our first investigations blue coloring matter of flowers cyaninethe blue coloring matter of flowers we propose to call cyanine to obtain this substance we treat the petals of centauria cyanus viola odorata or iris pseudacorus with boiling alcohol by which the flowers are decolorized and the liquid acquires immediately a fine blue color if the coloring matter is allowed to remain some time in contact with alcohol it is perceived that the blue of the liquid gradually disappears and soon a yellow brown coloration takes its place the coloring matter has in this case suffered an actual reduction by the prolonged action of the alcohol but it will again assume its original color when the alcohol is allowed to evaporate in the air nevertheless the alcohol must not be allowed to remain in contact too long with the coloring matter because the alcoholic extract will not then again assume its blue coloration by the action of oxygen the residue remaining from the evaporation of the alcohol is treated with water which separates a fatty and resinous substance the watery solution which contains the coloring matter is then precipitated by neutral acetate of lead the precipitate which possesses a beautiful green color can be washed with plenty of water and then decomposed with sulphuretted hydrogen the coloring matter passes into the watery solution which is carefully evaporated in a waterbath the residue is again dissolved in absolute alcohol and lastly the alcoholic solution is mixed with ether which precipitates the cyanine in the form of blue flocks cyanine is uncrystallizable soluble in water and alcohol insoluble in ether acids and acid salts color it immediately red by alkalies it is as known colored green cyanine appears to behave as an acid at least it forms with lime baryta strontia oxide of lead c green compounds insoluble in water bodies absorbing oxygen as sulphurous acid phosphorous acid and alcohols decolorize it under the influence of oxygen its color is restored we must here mention that moroz has prepared a beautiful blue substance from centauria cyanus by treatment with absolute alcohol rosered coloring matterwe have employed alcohol to extract the substance which colors rosered certain dahlias roses poeonias c for the procuration of this coloring matter the method pursued is exactly as that for the preparation of cyanine by an attentive comparison of the properties of this coloring matter with those of cyanine we have found that the rosered coloring matter is the same as the blue or at least results from a modification of the same independent principle it appears in the rosered modification when the juice of the plant with which it exists in contact possesses an acid reaction we have always observed this acid reaction in the juices of plants with red or rosered coloration while the blue juices of plants have always exhibited an alkaline reaction we have exposed most of the rosered or redcolored flowers which are cultivated in the paris museum to the influence of alkalies and have seen that they first become blue and then green by their action it is often perceived that certain rosered flowers as those of the mallow and in particular those of the hibiscus syriacus acquire by fading a blue and then a green coloration which change as we have found depends on the decomposition of an organic nitrogenous substance which is found very frequently in the petals this body generates as it decomposes ammonia which communicates to the flowers the blue or green color by action of weak acids the petals can be restored to their rosered color the alteration of color of certain rosered flowers can also be observed when the petals are very rapidly dried for example in vacuo by which it cannot be easily assumed that a nitrogenous body has undergone decomposition to the evolution of ammonia but before all things it must be mentioned that in this case the modification of color passes into violet and never arrives at green and further that it is always accompanied with the evolution of carbonic acid which we have detected by a direct experiment petals which were before rosered and have become violet by slight drying evolve carbonic acid and on that account it may be assumed that the rosered color is produced in the petals by this carbonic acid and that by its expulsion the petals assume the blue color by which the flowers with neutral juices are characterized we believe that we are able to speak with certainty that flowers with a rosered violet or blue color owe their coloration to one and the same substance but which is modified in various ways by the influence of the juices of plants scarletred flowers also contain cyanine reddened by an acid but in such cases this substance is mixed with a yellow coloring matter which we will now describe yellow coloring matterthe simplest experiments show that no analogy exists between the substance which colors flowers yellow and that of which we have already spoken the agents which generate so easily with cyanine the rosered violet or green coloration cannot in any case impart these colors to the yellow substance obtained from flowers by the examination of the various yellowcolored flowers we have ascertained that they owe their coloration to two substances which differ from one another in their properties and appear not to be derived from the same independent principle one is completely insoluble in water which we have termed xanthine a name which runge has given to a yellow matter from madder as this name has not been accepted in science we have employed it to denote one of the coloring matters of yellow flowers the other substance is very soluble in water and is by us termed xantheine xanthine or the yellow coloring matter insoluble in waterwe have prepared this coloring matter from many yellow flowers but chiefly from helianthus annuus to obtain it we treat the flowers with boiling absolute alcohol which dissolves the coloring matter in the heat and by cooling almost completely allows it again to precipitate the yellow deposit which is obtained in this way is not pure xanthine as it contains a rather considerable quantity of oil to separate this oil we have recourse to a moderate saponification thus we heat the yellow precipitate with a small quantity of alkali to saponify the fatty body mixed with the xanthine which even contains the xanthine dissolved as the coloring matter is soluble in the soap solution we do not treat the mass with water but decompose it with an acid which isolates the xanthine and the fatty acids resulting from the saponification this precipitate we treat with cold alcohol which leaves behind the fatty acids and dissolves the xanthine this substance is a fine yellow color insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol and ether which are thereby colored golden yellow it appears to be uncrystallizable and possesses the general properties of resins xanthine in combination with cyanine modified by the various juices of plants communicates in variable proportions orangeyellow scarletred and red colors to flowers xantheine or the coloring matter soluble in waterby the preparation of the substance which colors yellow certain dahlias it is at once perceived that it has no analogy to xanthine the latter is as known insoluble in water while the coloring matter under consideration is readily soluble in water to obtain the xanthine we treat the petals of yellow flowering dahlias with alcohol which quickly dissolves the yellow coloring matter besides the fat and resin the solution is evaporated to dryness and the residue treated with water whereby the fat and resin are separated the water is again evaporated to dryness and the residue treated with absolute alcohol the resulting solution diluted with water is mixed with neutral acetate of lead which precipitates the coloring matters the lead precipitate is then decomposed with sulphuric acid upon which the xantheine which remains dissolved in the water is purified by alcohol xantheine is soluble in water alcohol and ether but crystallizes from none of these solutions alkalies color it intensely brown its power of coloration is considerable it dyes various fabrics of a yellow tone which is without brilliancy acids again destroy the brown coloration produced by alkalies xantheine combines with most metallic bases and forms therewith yellow or brown insoluble lakes the facts here related agree with all which has been previously observed regarding the coloring matters of flowers it is known that blue flowers can become red and even white where their coloring matter is destroyed but never yellowand vice vers these three coloring matters can generate the colors either alone or by admixture which are seen in flowers but whether they are the only matters which color flowers we are at present unable to determinejournal de pharmacie improved process for bleaching beeswax and the fatty acids by mr gf wilson this improved process consists of two parts1st the application of highlyheated steam to heat the fatty matters under treatment by which means the requisite heat for melting these substances is obtained and at the same time the atmosphere is thereby excluded the heated steam so applied in its passage off carries with it the offensive smells given off by the fatty matters and being made to traverse a pipe or passage up or along which gaseous chlorine is allowed to flow a complete disinfection of the offensive products is thereby effected 2dly the treating of beeswax in a mixture of hard acid fat and beeswax with compounds of chlorine and oxygen preferring to employ that disengaged from chlorate of potash by treating it with sulphuric acid for this purpose mr wilson takes at the rate say of a ton of yellow beeswax and melts and boils it up with free steam for about half an hour it is then allowed to stand a short time and is then decanted into another vessel provided with a steampipe to emit free steam about 20 lbs of chlorate of potash is added and the steam turned on 80 lbs of sulphuric acid diluted with a like weight of water is then gradually added the matters are allowed to stand for a short time and are then decanted into another vessel and again boiled up with free steam and treated with a like quantity of diluted sulphuric acid the beeswax is then decanted into a receiver and is ready for use the beeswax may before undergoing these processes be combined and boiled up with a hard fatty acid and then treated as above described chemical examination of naples soap a faiszt has submitted this celebrated shaving soap to analysis he states that it is made by saponifying mutton fat with lime and then separating the fatty acids from the soap thus formed by means of a mineral acid these fatty acids are afterwards combined with ordinary caustic potash to produce the naples soap he found that 100 parts of this soap contained parts fatty acids 5714 potash combined with the fatty acids 1039 sulphate of potash chloride of potassium with a trace of carbonate of potash 422 silica c 046 water 2768 9989 gewerbeblatt aus wurttemberg manufacture of soap the removal of the duty from soap and the consequent emancipation of this branch of industry from the tender mercies of the excise has given a fresh impetus to the manufacture of this important article of daily use and enabled some processes to be practically carried out in england which previous to the removal of the duty could not be adopted in this part of her majestys dominions it will doubtless appear strange to those unacquainted with the circumstances that owing to the mode of levying the duty by admeasurement and not by actual weight the maker of a particular kind of soap was debarred the privilege of manufacturing in this country fortunately for him the manufacture of soap being free from all excise restrictions in ireland he was enabled to carry out his process in the sister kingdom whence it was exported to england and admitted here on payment of the customs duty which was the same as the excise duty on its manufacture here all this roundabout method of doing business is now done away with and no restriction now exists to mar the peace of the soap manufacturer amongst various new processes lately introduced is that of mr hc jennings which is practically carried out in the following manner combine 1000 lbs of stearic or margaric acid as free from elaine or oleine as possible or palmatine or any vegetable or animal stearine or margarine at the temperature of 212 fahr with a solution of bicarbonate of potash or soda specific gravity 1500 constantly stir or mix until an intimate combination is obtained and that the elements will not part when tried upon glass or any other similar substance when the mass is cooled down to about 60 fahr add one pound per cent of liquor ammoni specific gravity 880 and one pound per cent of strongest solution of caustic potash these are to be added gradually and fully mixed or stirred until perfectly combined dissolve 15 to 18 pounds per cent of common resin of commerce by boiling it with a solution of subcarbonate of potash and common soda of commerce in equal parts as much as will give the solution a specific gravity of about 1800 when boiling hot mix these perfectly with the abovementioned stearic or margaric acids and carbonated alkali then add a strong solution of caustic potash or soda until a perfect saponification is produced the dose of caustic alkali will much depend upon the purity of the stearine or margarine employed the separation is now effected by using common salt or sulphate of soda c as is known and practised by soap manufacturers if the soap intended to be produced is to be colorless no resin must be employed and a larger dose of liquor ammoni and caustic alkali must be used according to the dryness of the stearine matters to be operated upon a simple and certain method to determine the commercial value of soap by dr alexander mller in consequence of the ceremonious process by which the fatty acids are determined in one portion of the soap and the alkali by the incineration of another i consider the following method is not unworthy of publication because it appears to afford quicker and more correct results by reason of the greater simplicity of the manipulation it is available principally for soda soaps which are the most common but it may be also employed with corresponding alterations for soaps which have other bases a piece of soap weighing two or three grammes is dissolved in a tared beaker glass of about 160 cubic centimetres capacity with 80 to 100 cubic centimetres of water by heat in a waterbath and then three or four times the quantity of diluted sulphuric acid or as much as is necessary to decompose the soap added from a burette when after repeated agitation the fatty acids have separated in a transparent clear stratum from the aqueous solution it is allowed to cool and then the contents of the beaker glass are placed in a moistened filter which has been previously dried at 212 fahr and weighed the contents of the filter are washed until their acid reaction disappears in the meanwhile the beaker glass is placed in a steambath so that it being already dry may support the washed and partly dry filter which is laid on the mouth of the glass as if it were in the funnel the fatty acids soon pass through the paper and for the most part flow ultimately to the bottom of the beaker glass the increase of weight of which after cooling and the subtraction of the weight of the filter gives the quantity of fatty acids present in the soap a second drying and weighing is not necessary if on the cold sides of the interior of the glass no damp is to be observed which is occasioned by a trace of water still present if the quantity of oxide of iron added to marble the soap is considerable it may be easily found by incinerating the filter and determining the weight of the residue the fluid runs from the fatty acids on the filter which with the washings has been preserved in a sufficiently large beaker glass is colored with tincture of litmus and decomposed with a test alkaline solution until the blue color appears the difference of the quantity of alkali required to neutralize the sulphuric acid and the quantity of sulphuric acid used in the first instance allows a calculation to be made as to the quantity of effective alkali in the soap for example 2386 grms of soap partly cocoanut oil soap 1795 fatty acids with filter 0444 filter 1351 grms of hydrates of fatty acids 5662 per cent 2800 cub cent of the diluted sulphuric acid applied for the decomposition of the soap of which 100 cub cent represent 2982 grms of carbonate of soda 1755 cub cent of alkaline fluid which were used for the saturation of the above acid and of which 100 cub cent saturate an equal quantity of that acid 1045 cub cent of the sulphuric necessary for the alkali contained in the soap representing 01823 grms of soda 764 per cent a determination of the alkali as a sulphate afforded in another portion of soap 957 per cent of soda because the sulphate of soda and chloride of sodium present in the soap gave up their alkali the alkaline fluid applied by me was a saccharine solution of lime which can be naturally replaced by a solution of soda and must be if the chloride of sodium and sulphate of soda mixed with the soap shall be determined in the following way the fluid again exactly neutralized with alkali is evaporated to dryness and the residue gently heated to redness as in the above manipulation the fluid was not heated to the boiling point the original chloride of sodium and sulphate of soda are contained in the weighed residue besides the soda of the soap and that which has been added with the sulphuric acid forming sulphate of soda a second exposure to a red heat with sulphuric acid converts the whole residue into sulphate of soda and from the increase of weight by a comparison of the equivalents of nacl and nao so3 the quantity of the former may be decided according to the equivalents which kopp furnished in 1850 the increase of weight to the chloride of sodium is as 1468 the original sulphate of soda must be lastly found by the subtraction of the same salt formed plus the calculated chloride of sodium from the first heated residue in practice it is seldom necessary to proceed with the determination of the chloride of sodium and sulphate of soda except with stirred and cocoanut oil soaps certainly less of the truth is seen if after the above determination of the fatty acids and the effective alkali the absent per centage of water is introduced in the calculation than if the water is reckoned which is never completely evolved from soap even technically prepared at 302 fahr and another determination made of the fatty acids or alkali en bloc the fatty acids or even the alkaline contents the method here given partakes of the usual imperfections that the fatty acids as well as the unsaponified soap are equally estimated and the mixed hydrate or carbonate of the alkali as well as the combined alkali the presence of the carbonate can be easily recognized by the foaming of the soap solution upon the addition of the sulphuric acid these imperfections however are of little importance it must be granted that the minutely correct determination of the constitution of soap must be always yielded up to those who are technically conversant with this department of chemistry the estimation of free alkali and unchanged fat excluded in at least by certain ages of the soap further a considerable excess of one or another ingredient soon betrays itself by a corresponding departure in the soap of the characteristic properties of a good product and a small excess can be judged sufficiently exact from the proportion of the alkali which supposing soda present should not amount to more than 13 per cent with a pure cocoanut oil soap not less than 115 per cent with a tallow soap but with palm oil and mixed soaps the one or the other limit approximatesjournal fr praktische chemie on the natural fats by dr charles lwig the fats which exist in nature can be divided into the general and the special the former exist in almost all plants and parts of plants the latter includes only some vegetable substances as laurostearine myristicine and palmatine the consistence of fats of the general kind depend upon the proportions of margarine stearine and oleine contained in them the former preponderate in the solid fats butter lard and tallow and the latter in the fluid ones or oils according as an oil contains oleic acid or olinic acid it is termed a fatty or drying oil to the class of fatty oils belong olive almond hazelnut beech rape oils c to that of drying oils linseed nut hemp poppy grapeseed oils c which are used for varnishes in the vegetable kingdom the fats are chiefly in the seeds and in their coverings seldom in the perispemium poppy and in the fleshy substance surrounding the seed olive the fat in the seed is mostly enclosed in cells with a proteine compound in the animal kingdom certain parts of the body are quite filled with fatcells particularly under the skin paniculus adiposus in the cavities of the abdomen in the socalled omentum in the kidneys and the tubulated canals of the bones fat is also enclosed in cells fatty globules in milk it is established without a doubt that a greater portion of the fat which exists in the animal kingdom originates from the vegetable kingdom for it is introduced into the body cotemporaneously with the proteine compounds of that kingdom a portion of the fat as well as wax is formed in the animal organismus as shown by a number of observations and in most cases it is unquestionable that the nonnitrogenous nutriments as starch serve for the formation of fat by a process of deoxidation nevertheless the formation of fat in the animal body appears only to take place when the substances containing starch enter the body simultaneously with fat if the fat existing in the animal body is contained in cellular tissue its separation may be simply effected by placing the incised tissue in hot water the cells burst and the fat collects itself on the surface of the water if vegetable substances contain fat in large quantity as for example seeds it may be obtained by expression the dried seeds are bruised and expressed between either cold or hot metallic plates olives are laid in heaps before expression when they begin to ferment they can be completely expressed if animal and vegetable substances contain only a little fat it must be extracted by ether in the pure condition the fats are mostly odorless and tasteless when they possess an odor it arises mostly from the presence of small quantities of volatile fatty acids as butyric acid capric acid c which becomes free through the decomposition of their oxide of glycyl combinations this ensues by the presence of water and air through a kind of fermentation and as it appears by the presence of a nitrogenous substance the fats are insoluble in water and with the exception of castor oil are taken up by cold alcohol in very small quantities however more in proportion as they contain oleine in boiling alcohol they are dissolved but are for the most part again separated on cooling particularly those rich in stearine all fats are taken up by ether but those containing stearine in the smallest quantity their specific gravities fluctuate between 91 and 93 when heated fats assume a dark color and boil between 482 and 572 fahr but the boilingpoint continuously rises while an uninterrupted decomposition proceeds from oxide of glycyl ensues acroline oleic acid affords a fatty acid and among the decomposition products of fats containing stearine and margarine are found pure margaric acid and at the same time some hydrocarbons are formed when exposed quickly to a high temperature fats are completely decomposed oil gas in closed vessels the pure fats undergo no change but placed in thin layers in the air the fats containing oleine and oline rapidly absorb oxygen under the strong evolution of heat which will inflame porous bodies as cotton wool the purer the fats are the more quickly their oxidation results when the fats contain slimy materials these latter can be destroyed with a little oxide of lead and water preparation for the application of varnishes the action of nitric acid nitrous acid chlorine sulphuric acid c on fats is the same as that of these bodies on the fatty acids the fatty oils dissolve sulphur in the heat which is again partly precipitated on cooling when sulphur is heated with fatty oils namely with linseed oil it dissolves by degrees and a thick dark mass is formed the socalled balsam of sulphur by raising the heat a violent reaction ensues under the evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen and at the same time an oil resembling oil of garlic volatilizes this oil begins to boil at 160 fahr but its boilingpoint rises continually perfumes as preventives of mouldiness an interesting paper on this subject has been published by dr macculloch we presume our readers are aware that mouldiness is occasioned by the growth of minute vegetables ink paste leather and seeds are the substances that most frequently suffer from it the effect of cloves in preserving ink is well known any of the essential oils answer equally well leather may be kept free from mould by the same substances thus russian leather which is perfumed with the tar of birch never becomes mouldy indeed it prevents it from occurring in other bodies a few drops of any essential oil are sufficient also to keep books entirely free from it for harness oil of turpentine is recommended bookbinders in general employ alum for preserving their paste but mould frequently forms on it shoemakers resin is sometimes also used for the same purpose but it is less effectual than oil of turpentine the best preventives however are the essential oils even in small quantity as those of peppermint anise or cassia by which paste may be kept almost any length of time indeed it has in this way been preserved for years the paste recommended by dr macculloch is made in the usual way with flour some brown sugar and a little corrosive sublimate the sugar keeping it flexible when dry and the sublimate preventing it from fermenting and from being attacked by insects after it is made a few drops of any of the essential oils are added paste made in this way dries when exposed to the air and may be used merely by wetting it if required to be kept always ready for use it ought to be put into covered pots seeds may also be preserved by the essential oils and this is of great consequence when they are to be sent to a distance of course moisture must be excluded as much as possible as the oils or ottos prevent only the bad effects of mould fusel oil by w bastick this organic compound was first discovered by scheele as one of the distillation products of the wort obtained from the fermentation of potatoes it has been subsequently examined by pelletier dumas cahours and others it is generally now termed the hydrate of the oxide of amyl from amyl being supposed to be its base or radical as cyanogen is regarded to be the radical of another series of compounds it passes over towards the termination of the distillation process in a white turbid fluid which consists of a watery and alcoholic solution of the fusel oil the crude oil consisting of about onehalf of its weight of alcohol and water may be purified being shaken with water and redistilled with the previous addition of chloride of calcium when the temperature of the contents of retort reaches 296 fahr pure fusel oil distils over fusel oil is a colorless oily fluid which possesses at first not an unagreeable odor but at last is very disgusting producing oppression at the chest and exciting cough it has a sharp hot taste and burns with a white blue flame it boils at 296 fahr and at temperature of 4 fahr it becomes solid and forms crystals its specific gravity at 59 fahr is 08124 and its formula c10h12o2 on paper it produces a greasy stain which disappears by heat and when exposed to the action of the air it acquires an acid reaction fusel oil is slightly soluble in water to which it imparts its odor and soluble in all proportions in alcohol ether volatile and fixed oils and acetic acid it dissolves phosphorus sulphur and iodine without any noticeable change and also mixes with caustic soda and potash it rapidly absorbs hydrochloric acid with the disengagement of heat when mixed with concentrated sulphuric acid the mixture becomes of a violetred color and bisulphate of amyloxide is formed nitric acid and chlorine decompose it by its distillation with anhydrous phosphoric acid a fluid oily combination of hydrogen and carbon results by oxidation with bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid fusel oil yields valerianic acid which is used in medicine and appleoil employed as a flavoring ingredient in confectionery essence of pineapple by w bastick the above essence is as already known butyric ether more or less diluted with alcohol to obtain which pure on the large scale and economically the following process is recommended dissolve 6 lbs of sugar and half an ounce of tartaric acid in 26 lbs of boiling water let the solution stand for several days then add 8 ounces of putrid cheese broken up with 3 lbs of skimmed and curdled sour milk and 3 lbs of levigated chalk the mixture should be kept and stirred daily in a warm place at the temperature of about 92 fahr as long as gas is evolved which is generally the case for five or six weeks the liquid thus obtained is mixed with an equal volume of cold water and 8 lbs of crystallized carbonate of soda previously dissolved in water added it is then filtered from the precipitated carbonate of lime the filtrate is to be evaporated down to 10 lbs when 512 lbs of sulphuric acid previously diluted with an equal weight of water are to be carefully added the butyric acid which separates on the surface of the liquid as a darkcolored oil is to be removed and the rest of the liquid distilled the distillate is now neutralized with carbonate of soda and the butyric acid separated as before with sulphuric acid the whole of the crude acid is to be rectified with the addition of an ounce of sulphuric acid to every pound the distillate is then saturated with fused chloride of calcium and redistilled the product will be about 28 ounces of pure butyric acid to prepare the butyric acid or essence of pineapple from this acid proceed as followsmix by weight three parts of butyric acid with six parts of alcohol and two parts of sulphuric acid in a retort and submit the whole with a sufficient heat to a gentle distillation until the fluid which passes over ceases to emit a fruity odor by treating the distillate with chloride of calcium and by its redistillation the pure ether may be obtained the boilingpoint of butyric ether is 238 fahr its specific gravity 0904 and its formula c12h12o4 or c4h5o c8h7o3 benschs process above described for the production of butyric acid affords a remarkable exemplification of the extraordinary transformations that organic bodies undergo in contact with ferment or by catalytic action when cane sugar is treated with tartaric acid especially under the influence of heat it is converted into grape sugar this grape sugar in the presence of decomposing nitrogenous substances such as cheese is transformed in the first instance into lactic acid which combines with the lime of the chalk the acid of the lactate of lime thus produced is by the further influence of the ferment changed into butyric acid hence butyrate of lime is the final result of the catalytic action in the process we have here recommended preparation of crude pelargonate of ethyloxide essence of quince by dr r wagner it has been believed until the most recent period that the peel of quinces contains oenanthylate of ethyloxide new researches however have led to the supposition that the odorous principle of quinces is derived from the ether of pelargonic acid in my last research on the action of nitric acid on oil of rue i found that besides the fatty acids which gerhardt had already discovered pelargonic acid is formed this process may be advantageously employed for the preparation of crude pelargonate of ethyloxide which on account of its extremely agreeable odor may be applied as a fruit essence equally with those prepared by dobereiner hofmann and fehling for the preparation of the liquid which can be named the essence of quince oil of rue is treated with double its quantity of very diluted nitric acid and the mixture heated until it begins to boil after some time two layers are to be observed in the liquid the upper one is brownish and the lower one consists of the products of the oxidation of oil of rue and the excess of nitric acid the lower layer is freed from the greater part of its nitric acid by evaporation in a chloride of zinc bath the white flocks frequently found in the acid liquid which are probably fatty acids are separated by filtration the filtrate is mixed with spirit and long digested in a gentle heat by which a fluid is formed which has the agreeable odor of quince in the highest degree and may be purified by distillation the spirituous solution of pelargonic ether may also be profitably prepared from oleic acid according to gottliebs methodjournal fr praktische chemie

one part of butyric ether in eight or ten parts of alcohol for the preparation of this ether pure butyric acid must be first obtained by the fermentation of sugar according to the method of bensch one pound of this acid is dissolved in one pound of strong alcohol and mixed with from a quarter to half an ounce of sulphuric acid the mixture is heated for some minutes whereby the butyric ether separates as a light stratum the whole is mixed with half its volume of water and the upper stratum then removed the heavy fluid is distilled by which more butyric ether is obtained the distillate and the removed oily liquid are shaken with a little water the lighter portion of the liquid removed which at last by being shaken with water and a little soda is freed from adhering acid for the preparation of the essence of pineapple one pound of this ether is dissolved in 8 or 10 pounds of alcohol 20 or 25 drops of this solution is sufficient to give to one pound of sugar a strong taste of pineapple if a little citric or tartaric acid has been added pearoilthis is an alcoholic solution of acetate of amyloxide and acetate of ethyloxide for its preparation one pound of glacial acetic acid is added to an equal weight of fuseloil which has been prepared by being washed with soda and water and then distilled at a temperature between 254 and 284 fahr and mixed with half a pound of sulphuric acid the mixture is digested for some hours at a temperature of 254 by which means acetate of amyloxide separates particularly on the addition of some water the crude acetate of amyloxide obtained by separation and by the distillation of the liquid to which the water has been added is finally purified by being washed with soda and water fifteen parts of acetate of amyloxide are dissolved with half a part of acetic ether in 100 or 120 parts of alcohol this is the essence of pear which when employed to flavor sugar or syrup to which a little citric or tartaric acid has been added affords the flavor of bergamot pears and a fruity refreshing taste appleoil is an alcoholic solution of valerianate of amyloxide it is obtained impure as a by product when for the preparation of valerianic acid fuseloil is distilled with bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid it is better prepared in the following mannerfor the preparation of valerianic acid 1 part of fuseloil is mixed gradually with 3 parts of sulphuric acid and 2 parts of water added a solution of 214 parts of bichromate of potash with 412 parts of water is heated in a tubulated retort and into this fluid the former mixture is gradually poured so that the ebullition is not too rapid the distillate is saturated with carbonate of soda and warmed when a solution of 3 parts of crystallized carbonate of soda 2 parts of strong sulphuric acid diluted with an equal quantity of water are added the valerianic acid separates as an oily stratum one part by weight of pure fuseloil is carefully mixed with an equal weight of sulphuric acid the cold solution is added to 114 parts of the above valerianic acid the mixture is warmed for some minutes not too long or too much in a waterbath and then mixed with a little water by which means the impure valerianate of amyloxide separates which is washed with water and carbonate of soda for use as an essence of apples one part of this valerianate of amyloxide is dissolved in 6 or 8 parts of alcohol volatile oil of gaultheria procumbens by w bastick the chemical history of this oil is one of great importance and interest affording as it does one of the examples where the progress of modern chemistry has succeeded in producing artificially a complex organic body previously only known as the result of vital force this volatile oil is obtained from the wintergreen an american shrub of the heath family by distillation when this plant is distilled at first an oil passes over which consists of c10h8 but when the temperature reaches 464 fahr a pure oil distils into the receiver therefore the essential oil of this plant like many others consists of two portionsone a hydrocarbon and the other an oxygenated compound this latter is the chief constituent of the oil and that which is of so much chemical interest from the fact that it has been artificially prepared it is termed when thus prepared the spiroylate of the oxide of methyl and is obtained when two parts of wood spirit one and a half parts of spiroylic acid and one part of sulphuric acid are distilled together it is a colorless liquid of an agreeable aromatic odor and taste it dissolves slightly in water but in all proportions in ether and alcohol it boils between 411 and 435 fahr and has a specific gravity of 1173 this compound expels carbonic acid from its combinations and forms a series of salts which contain one atom of base and one atom of spiroylate of the oxide of methyl it behaves therefore as a conjugate acid its formula is c14h5o5 c2h3o the spiroylic acid may be separated from the natural oil by treating it with a concentrated solution of caustic potash at a temperature of 113 fahr when wood spirit is formed and evaporates and the solution contains the spiroylate of potash from which when decomposed with sulphuric acid the spiroylic acid separates and subsides in the fluid spiroylic acid is also formed by the oxidation of spiroyligenic acid and when saligenin salicin courmacin or indigo is heated with caustic potash on the application of organic chemistry to perfumery by dr aw hofmann professor to the royal college of chemistry london cahours excellent researches concerning the essential oil of gaultheria procumbens a north american plant of the natural order of the ericin of jussieu which admits of so many applications in perfumeryi have opened a new field in this branch of industry the introduction of this oil among compound ethers must necessarily direct the attention of perfumersj towards this important branch of compounds the number of which is daily increasing by the labors of those who apply themselves to organic chemistry the striking similarity of the smell of these ethers to that of fruit had not escaped the observation of chemistry however it was reserved to practical men to discover by which choice and combinations it might be possible to imitate the scent of peculiar fruits to such a nicety that makes it probable that the scent of the fruit is owing to a natural combination identical to that produced by art so much so as to enable the chemist to produce from fruits the said combinations provided he could have at his disposal a sufficient quantity to operate upon the manufacture of artificial aromatic oils for the purpose of perfumeryk is of course a recent branch of industry nevertheless it has already fallen into the hands of several distillers who produce sufficient quantity to supply the trade a fact which has not escaped the observation of the jury at the london exhibition in visiting the stalls of english and french perfumers at the crystal palace we found a great variety of these chemical perfumes the applications of which were at the same time practically illustrated by confectionery flavored by them however as most of the samples of the oils sent to the exhibition were but small i was prevented in many cases from making an accurate analysis of them the largest samples were those of a compound labelled pearoil which by analysis i discovered to be an alcoholic solution of pure acetate of amyloxide not having sufficient quantity to purify it for combustion i dissolved it with potash by which free fuseloil was separated and determined the acetic acid in the form of a silver salt 03080 gram of silver salt 01997 gram of silver the per centage of silver in acetate of silver is according to theory 6468 experiment 6455 the acetate of amyloxide which according to the usual way of preparing it represents one part sulphuric acid one part fuseloil and two parts of acetate of potash had a striking smell of fruit but it acquired the pleasant flavor of the jargonelle pear only after having been diluted with six times its volume of spirit of wine upon further inquiry i learned that considerable quantities of this oil are manufactured by some distillersfrom fifteen to twenty pounds weeklyand sold to confectioners who employ it chiefly in flavoring peardrops which are nothing else but barleysugar flavored with this oil i found besides the pearoil also an appleoil which according to my analysis is nothing but valerianate of amyloxide every one must recollect the insupportable smell of rotten apples which fills the laboratory whilst making valerianic acid by operating upon this raw distillate produced with diluted potash valerianic acid is removed and an ether remains behind which diluted in five or six times its volume of spirits of wine is possessed of the most pleasant flavor of apples the essential oill most abundant in the exhibition was the pineapple oil which as you well know is nothing else but the butyrate of ethyloxide even in this combination like in the former the pleasant flavor or scent is only attained by diluting the ether with alcohol the butyric ether which is employed in germany to flavor bad rum is employed in england to flavor an acidulated drink called pineapple ale for this purpose they generally do not employ pure butyric acid but a product obtained by saponification of butter and subsequent distillation of the soap with concentrated sulphuric acid and alcohol which product contains besides the butyric ether other ethers but nevertheless can be used for flavoring spirits the sample i analyzed was purer and appeared to have been made with pure butyric ether decomposed with potash and changed into silver salt it gave 04404 gram of silver salt 02437 gram of silver the per centage of silver in the butyrate of silver is according to theory 5538 experiment 5533 both english and french exhibitors have also sent samples of cognacoil and grapeoil which are employed to flavor the common sorts of brandy as these samples were very small i was prevented from making an accurate analysis however i am certain that the grapeoil is a combination of amyl diluted with much alcohol since when acted upon with concentrated sulphuric acid and the oil freed from alcohol by washing it with water it gave amylsulphuric acid which was identified by the analysis of the salt of barytes 12690 gram of amylsulphate of barytes gave 05825 gram of sulphate of barytes this corresponds to 4582 per cent of sulphate of barytes amylsulphate of barytes crystallized with two equivalents of water contains according to the analysis of cahours and kekule 4595 per cent of sulphate of barytes it is curious to find here a body which on account of its noxious smell is removed with great care from spirituous liquors to be applied under a different form for the purpose of imparting to them a pleasant flavor i must needs here also mention the artificial oil of bitter almonds when mitscherlich in the year 1834 discovered the nitrobenzol he would not have dreamed that this product would be manufactured for the purpose of perfumery and after twenty years appear in fine labelled samples at the london exhibition it is true that even at the time of the discovery of nitrobenzol he pointed out the striking similarity of its smell to that of the oil of bitter almonds however at that time the only known sources for obtaining this body were the compressed gases and the distillation of benzoic acid consequently the enormity of its price banished any idea of employing benzol as a substitute for oil of bitter almonds however in the year 1845 i succeeded by means of the anilinreaction in ascertaining the existence of benzol in common coaltar oil and in the year 1849 cb mansfield proved by careful experiments that benzol can be won without difficulty in great quantity from coaltar oil in his essay which contains many interesting details about the practical use of benzol he speaks likewise of the possibility of soon obtaining the sweetscented nitrobenzol in great quantity the exhibition has proved that his observation has not been left unnoticed by the perfumers among french perfumeries we have found under the name of artificial oil of bitter almonds and under the still more poetical name of essence de mirbane several samples of essential oils which are no more nor less than nitrobenzol i was not able to obtain accurate details about the extent of this branch of manufacture which seems to be of some importance in london this article is manufactured with success the apparatus employed is that of mansfield which is very simple it consists of a large glass worm the upper extremity of which divides in two branches or tubes which are provided with funnels through one of these funnels passes a stream of concentrated nitric acid the other is destined as a receiver of benzol which for this purpose requires not to be quite pure at the angle from where the two tubes branch out the two bodies meet together and instantly the chemical combination takes place which cools sufficiently by passing through the glass worm the product is afterwards washed with water and some diluted solution of carbonate of soda it is then ready for use notwithstanding the great physical similarity between nitrobenzol and oil of bitter almonds there is yet a slight difference in smell which can be detected by an experienced nosem however nitrobenzol is very useful in scenting soap and might be employed with great advantage by confectioners and cooks particularly on account of its safety being entirely free from prussic acid there were besides the above several other artificial oils they all however were more or less complicated and in so small quantities that it was impossible to ascertain their exact nature and it was doubtful whether they had the same origin as the former the application of organic chemistry to perfumery is quite new it is probable that the study of all the ethers or ethereal combinations already known and of those which the ingenuity of the chemist is daily discovering will enlarge the sphere of their practical applications the caprylethers lately discovered by bouis are remarkable for their aromatic smells the acetate of capryloxide is possessed of the most intense and pleasant smell and they promise a large harvest to the manufacturers of perfumesannalen der chemie correspondence from the journal of the society of artsn chemistry and perfumery sir when such periodicals as household words and the family herald contain scientific matters treated in a manner to popularize science all real lovers of philosophy must feel gratified a little fiction a little metaphor is expected and is accepted with the good intention with which it is given in such popular prints but when the journal of the society of arts reprints quotations from such sources without modifying or correcting their expressions it conveys to its readers a tissue of fiction rather too flimsy to bear a truthful analysiso in the article on chemistry and perfumery in no 47 you quote that some of the most delicate perfumes are now made by chemical artifice and not as of old by distilling them from flowers now sir this statement conveys to the public a very erroneous idea because the substances afterwards spoken of are named essences of fruit and not essences of flowers and the essences of fruits named in your article never are and never can be used in perfumery this assertion is based on practical experience the artificial essences of fruits are ethers when poured upon a handkerchief and held up to the nose they act as is well known like chloroform dare a perfumer sell a bottle of such a preparation to an unprotected female again you quote that the drainings of cowhouses are the main source to which the manufacturer applies for the production of his most delicate and admired perfumes shade of munchausen must i refute this by calling your attention to the fact that in the south of france more than 80000 persons are employed directly and indirectly in the cultivation of flowers and in the extraction of their odors for the use of perfumers that italy cultivates flowers for the same purpose to an extent employing land as extensive as the whole of some english counties that tracts of flowerfarms exist in the balkan in turkey more extensive than the whole of yorkshire our own flowerfarms at mitcham in surrey need not be mentioned in comparison although important these sir are the main sources of perfumes there are other sources at thibet tonquin and in the west indies but enough has been said i hope to refute the cowhouse story this story is founded on the fact that benzoic acid can be obtained from the draining of stables and that benzoic acid has rather a pleasant odor some of the largest wholesale perfumers use five or six pounds of gum benzoin per annum but none use the benzoic acid the lozengemakers consume the most of this article when prepared for commercial purposes as also the fruit essences those of your readers interested in what really is used in perfumery are referred to the last six numbers of the annals of pharmacy and practical chemistry article perfumery your obedient servant septimus piesse chemistry and perfumeryp sir the discussion about chemistry and perfumery in reality amounts to this mr septimus piesse confines the term perfumery to such things as eau de cologne c perfumed soaps groceries c he does not appear to class as perfumery now the artificial scents are as yet chiefly used for the latter substances which in common language and i should say in a perfumers nomenclature also would be included in perfumery the authority for cows urine being used for perfumery is to be found in a little french work called i believe la chimie de lodorat in which a full description is given of the collection of fresh urine and its application to this purpose i need scarcely say that it is the benzoic acid of the urine which is the odoriferous principle your obedient servant a perfumer when benzoic acid is prepared by any of the wet processes it is free from the fragrant volatile oil which accompanies it when prepared by sublimation from the resin and to which oil the acid of commerce owes its peculiar odor this fact completely nullifies the above assertionseptimus piesse chemistry and perfumeryq sir if the author of the letter on chemistry and perfumery published in no 50 of your journal and intended as a reply to minethough none was neededwhich appeared in no 49 really be a perfumer as his signature implies he would know that i could not though ever so inclined confine the term perfumery to various odoriferous substances and exclude scented soaps because he would be aware that onethird of the returns of every manufacturing perfumer is derived from perfumed soap i do however emphatically exclude from the term perfumery groceries c the et ctera meaning i presume confectionery because perfumery has to do with one of the senses smelling while groceries c are distinguishable by another taste and had not our physical faculties clearly made the distinction commerce and manufactures would have defined them i therefore repeat that the artificial essences of fruits are not used in perfumery as stated in no 47 from the quoted authorities if any man can deny this assertion let him now do so or forever after hold his peace at least upon this subject the journal of the society of arts is not a medium of mere controversy if a statement be made in error let truth correct it which if gainsayed it should be done not under the veil of an anonymous correspondent but with a name to support the assertion science has to deal with tangible facts and figures to the political alone belongs the anonymous inkspiller i am sir yours faithfully septimus piesse 42 chapel street edgware road if the word flavor had been used by the various authors who have written upon this subject in place of the word perfume the dissemination of an erroneous idea would have been prevented the word perfume applied to pearoil pineapple oil c implies and the general tenor of the remarks of the writers leads the reader to infer that these substances are used by perfumers who not only do not but cannot use them in their trade but for flavoring nectar lozenges sweetmeats c these ethers or oils as the writers term them are extensively used and quite
