folklore traditions of the tinguian a study in philippine folklore by faycooper cole assistant curator of malayan ethnology 1915 contents preface 3 introduction 5 tales of the mythical period 33 ritualistic and explanatory tales 171 fables 195 abstracts 202 preface the following myths were collected by the writer in 19078 during a stay of sixteen months with the tinguian a pagan tribe of northwestern luzon in the philippines the material for the most part gathered in texts was partially translated in the islands while the balance was worked over during a brief visit to america in 1909 in this task i was assisted by dumagat a full blood tinguian who accompanied me while not in all cases giving a literal rendering i have endeavored to follow closely the language of the storytellers rather than to offer a polished translation in some cases where it was impossible to record the tales when heard only the substance was noted a fact which will account for the meagerness of detail evident in a few of the stories the tinguian tribe numbers about twenty thousand individuals most of whom are found in the subprovince of abra and in the mountains of ilocos sur and norte their material culture beliefs and ceremonials are quite uniform and exceedingly complex it is my intention to publish a study of this people in the near future but realizing that it will be quite impossible for readers unacquainted with tinguian life to understand many references in the tales i have added such foot notes as will enable them to grasp the meaning of certain obscure passages in the introduction an attempt has been made to bring together the culture of the people as it appears in the myths and to contrast it with present day conditions and beliefs in this way we may hope to gain a clearer insight into their mental life and to secure a better idea of the values they attach to certain of their activities than is afforded us by actual observation or by direct inquiry it is also possible that the tales may give us a glimpse of the early conditions under which this people developed of their life and culture before the advent of the european it should be noted at the outset that no attempt is here made to reconstruct an actual historical period as will appear later a part of the material is evidently very old later introductionsto which approximate dates may be assignedhave assumed places of great importance while the stories doubtless owe much to the creative imaginations of successive storytellers a comparison of these tales with the folklore of neighboring tribes would be of greatest value but unfortunately very little material for such a study is available under the circumstances it has seemed best to defer the attempt and to call attention in the footnotes to striking similarities with other fields in the main these tales are so closely associated with the religious beliefs of the present day that it is unlikely they will be found in anything approaching their present form outside the districts dominated by this tribe nevertheless isolated incidents corresponding to those of neighboring peoples or even of distant lands occur several times observation has led me to the belief that the religious organization and ceremonies of the tinguian have reached a higher development than is found among the neighboring tribes and that this complexity decreases as we penetrate toward the interior or to the south if this be true it seems evident that the tales based on or associated with them must likewise grow weaker as we go from abra i wish here to acknowledge my indebtedness to dr franz boas and dr berthold laufer whose interest and suggestions have been of greatest value in the preparation of the material for publication also to express my gratitude to the late robert f cummings under whose liberal endowment the field work was carried on his constant interest made possible the gathering of the extensive philippine collections now in the museum and it is a matter of deep regret that he did not live to see all the results of his generosity made available to the reading public faycooper cole assistant curator of malayan ethnology chicago january 1915 traditions of the tinguian a study in philippine folklore introduction for the purposes of our study the tales have been roughly divided into three parts the first which deals with the mythical period contains thirtyone tales of similar type in which the characters are for the most part the same although the last five tales do not properly fit into the cycle and the concluding story of indayo is evidently a recent account told in the form of the older relations in the second division are the ritualistic and explanatory myths the object of which seems to be to account for the origin of or way of conducting various ceremonies for the belief in certain spirits and sacred objects for the existence of the sun moon and other natural phenomena for the attainment of fire food plants birds and domestic animals as well as of magical jars and beads here it should be noted that some of the most common and important beliefs and ceremonies are so far as is known unaccompanied by any tales yet are known to all the population and are preserved almost without change from generation to generation division three contains the ordinary stories with which parents amuse their children or with which men and women while away the midday hours as they lounge in the field houses or when they stop on the trail to rest and smoke none of the folktales are considered as the property of the tellers but only those of the third division are well known to the people in general those of the first section are seldom heard except during the dry season when the people gather around bonfires in various parts of the village to these go the men and women the latter to spin cotton the former to make fish nets or to repair their tools and weapons in such a gathering there are generally one or more persons who entertain their fellows with these tales such a person is not paid for his services but the fact that he knows the stories of the first times makes him a welcome addition to the company and gives him an enviable position in the estimation of his fellows the purely ritualistic tales called diams are learned word by word by the mediums 1 as a part of their training for their positions and are only recited while an animal is being stroked with oil preparatory to its being sacrificed or when some other gift is about to be presented to the superior beings the writer has recorded these diams from various mediums in widely separated towns and has found them quite uniform in text and content the explanatory tales were likewise secured from the mediums or from old men and women who know the customs the stories of the last division are the most frequently heard and as already indicated are told by all it is evident even to the casual reader that these show much more evidence of outside influence than do the others some indeed appear to have been recently borrowed from the neighboring christianized ilocano 2 tales of the mythical period reconstruction of the culturein the first division certain actors occur with great frequency while others always take the leading parts these latter appear under a variety of names two or more titles often being used for the same individual in a single tale to avoid confusion a list of the fourteen principal actors and their relationships are given in the accompanying table it will appear that there are some conflicts in the use of names but when it is realized that the first twentysix myths which make up the cycle proper were secured from six story tellers coming from four different towns the agreement rather than the disagreement is surprising as a matter of fact there is quite as much variation between the accounts of the same narrator as between those gathered from different towns table of leading characters 3 i aponitolau son of pagatipnan male 4 and langaan female of kadalayapan is the husband of aponibolinayen appears under the following names a ligi b albaga of dalaga c dagdagalisit d ingiwan or kagkagkag e iniinit f linggiwan g kadayadawan h wadagan i awig ii aponigawani sister of aponitolau and wife of aponibalagen iii aponibolinayen daughter of pagboksan 5 male and ebang female of kaodanan wife of aponitolau appears as a ayo b dolimman iv aponibalagen brother of aponibolinayen and husband of aponigawani also appears as awig v kanag son of aponitolau and aponibolinayen appears as a kanag kabagbagowan b balokanag c dumanau d ilwisan e also at times is identified with dumalawi his brother vi dapilsan wife of kanag vii dagolyan son of aponibalagen and aponigawani also appears as dondonyn of bagonanthe blood clot child viii alokotn an old woman who acts as a medium her home is at nagbotobotn where the rivers empty their waters into the hole at the edge of the world ix gawigawen male a giant who owns the orange trees of adasin x giambolan male a tenheaded giant xi gaygayma a star maiden who marries aponitolau the daughter of bagbagak male a big starand sinag female the moon xii tabyayen son of aponitolau and gaygayma half brother of kanag xiii kabkabagaan a powerful female spirit who falls in love with aponitolau xiv asibowan the maiden of gegenwan who is related to the spirit kaboniyan the mistress of aponitolau in consequence of modern rationalism there is a tendency on the part of a considerable number of the tinguian to consider these tales purely as stories and the characters as fictitious but the mass of the people hold them to be true and speak of the actors as the people who lived in the first times for the present we shall take their point of view and shall try to reconstruct the life in the first times as it appears in the tales the principal actors live in kadalayapan and kaodanan 6 towns which our chief story tellerwhen trying to explain the desire of kanag to go down and get fruitassures us were somewhere in the air above the earth p 141 7 at other times these places are referred to as sudipanthe term by which spirits are supposed to call the present earthwhile the actors are referred to as ipogauthe spirit name for tinguian whatever its location it was a place much like the present home of this people the sky the chief abode of spirits and celestial bodies was above the land and the heroes of the tales are pictured as ascending to visit the upper realms the trees plants and animals were for the most part those known today the ocean appears to have been well known while mention is made of some places in luzon such as dagopan and san fernando in pangasinan with which the people of today are not at all familiar p 89 168 we learn that each village is situated near to a river or waterway by the banks of which shallow wells are dug and there we find the women gathering under the shade of the trees dipping up water to be carried to their homes washing and combing their hair and taking their baths p 48 they seldom go singly for enemies are apt to be near and unless several are in the company it will be impossible to spread the alarm and secure help in case of attack p 43 leading up from the spring to the village are bamboo poles on which the heads of enemies are displayed p 43 in cases where the warriors have been especially successful these trophies may surround the whole settlement p 76 about the town is a defensive wall generally of bamboo but in some cases made up entirely of gigantic snakes p 43 within this inclosure are many houses the bamboo floors are raised high above the ground while the thatching is of grass ladders lead up to little porches from which doors open into the dwellings at least part of the houses have a cooking room in addition to that used by the family while structures containing a ninth room are several times mentioned pp 43 52 85 in one corner of the living room is a box containing blankets above which are pillows and mats used by members of the household and guests an iron caldron lies on the floor while numerous chinese jars stand about a hearth made up of a bed of ashes in which stones are sunk is used for cooking above it is a bamboo food hanger while near by stand jars of water and various cooking pots food baskets coconut shell cups and dishes and a quantity of chinese plates appear when the meal is served while the use of glass is not unknown cups of gold wonderful jars and plates appear at times but seem to be so rare as to excite comment pp 33 98 102 105 scattered through the village are numerous small buildings known as balaua p 43 which are erected for the spirits during the greatest of the ceremonies and still inside the enclosure are the rice drying plots and granaries the latter raised high above the ground so as to protect their contents from moisture p 150 about the town pigs and chickens roam at will while halfstarved hunting dogs prowl about below the kitchens and fight for morsels which drop from above p 99 carabao are kept and used as food p 101 but in the cycle proper no mention is made of using them as work animals 8 game especially deer and wild chickens and fish are added to the domestic supply of food p 80 but the staple appears to be mountain rice beans coconuts oranges sugar cane betelnuts and tobacco are also cultivated pp 33 107 121 138 clothing is scanty but nevertheless receives much attention the poorest of the men wear clouts of banana leaf and the women when in danger of capture don skirts of bark but on most occasions we find the man wearing a colored cotton clout above which is a bright belt of the same material while for ceremonies he may add a short coat or jacket a headband sometimes of gold keeps his long hair in place and for very special events he may adorn each hair with a golden bead pp 74 76 81 the cotton skirts of the women reach from the waist to the knees the arms are covered with strands above strands of beads while strings of agate beads surround the neck or help to hold the hair in place to the real hair is often added a switch which appears to be valued highly p 89 ornaments of gold adorn the ears and finger rings of the same metal are several times mentioned pp 39 43 124 the tales afford us a glimpse of the daily life in the early morning the chilly mountain air drives the people from their mats to the yard where they squat about the fires p 132 as it becomes light part of the women begin pounding out the rice from its straw and husks p 144 while others depart for the springs to secure water p 101 in planting time husband and wife trudge together to the fields where the man plants the seeds or cuttings and his wife assists by pouring on water p 107 in midday unless it is the busy season the village activities are practically suspended and we see the balaua filled with men asleep or lounging while children may be playing about with tops or disklike lipi seeds p 139 as it becomes cooler the town again takes on life in the houses the women weave blankets or prepare food the older women feed the chickens and pigs p 93 while the workers from the fields or hunters with their dogs and game add to the general din and excitement p 80 when night comes on if it be in the dry season bonfires spring up in different parts of the village and about them the girls and women gather to spin here also come the men and boys to lounge and talk p 117 a considerable portion of the mans time is taken up in preparation for or actual participation in warfare p 74 we have already seen that the constant danger of enemies makes it advisable for the women to go in parties even to the village spring one tale informs us of a girl who is left alone to guard the rice field and is promptly killed by the alzado 9 another states that all the tattooed igorot are enemies pp 43 155 161 revenge for the loss of relations or townspeople is a potent cause of hostile raids old feuds may be revived by taunts but the chief incentive appears to be the desire for renown to be known as a man who goes to fight in the enemies towns pp 90 59 warriors sometimes go in parties sometimes alone but generally in couples p 67 at times they lie in ambush and kill young girls who go for water or old men and women who pass their hiding place p 97 again they go out boldly armed with shield spear and headaxe they strike their shields as they go and announce their presence to the enemy p 103 in five of the tales the heroes challenge their opponents and then refuse to be the first to use their weapons it is only when their foes have tried in vain to injure them that they enter the conflict in such cases whole towns are wiped out of existence and a great number of heads and a quantity of jars and other booty is sent back to the towns of the victors p 104 peace is restored in one instance by the payment of a number of valuable jars p 91 upon the return of a successful war party the relatives meet them at the gate of the town and compel them to climb the sangap 10 then invitations are sent out to friends and relatives in neighboring towns to come and aid in the celebration of the victory p 140 when they arrive at the entrance of the village they are met by the townspeople who offer them liquor and then conduct them to the houses where they feast and dance to the music of gansas p 126 11 finally the captured heads are stuck on the sagang 12 and are placed by the gate the spring and if sufficient in number surround the town p 140 taking the heads of ones neighbors does not appear to be common yet cases are mentioned where visitors are treacherously killed at a dance pp 78 83 the use of poison 13 is twice mentioned in one case the victims are killed by drinking liquor furnished by the father of the girl about whose head they are dancing pp 148 156 bamboo spears appear to be used but we are explicitly told that they fought with steel weapons and there are frequent references to headaxes spears and knives pp 65 76 120 marriage appears generally to be negotiated by the mother of the youth at his suggestion p 128 at times both his parents go to the girls home and after many preliminaries broach the subject of their mission p 128 the girls people discuss the proposition and if they are favorable they set a day for the paklona celebration at which the price to be paid for the bride is decided upon p 49 the parents of the groom then return home after having left some small present such as a jar or an agate bead as a sign of engagement p 128 14 the paklon is held a few days later at the girls home and for this event her people prepare a quantity of food p 72 on the agreed day the close friends and relatives of both families will assemble those who accompany the groom carry jars and pigs either in part payment for the bride or to serve as food for the company pp 72 128 the first hours are spent in bargaining over the price the girl should bring but when this is settled a feast is prepared and then all indulge in dancing the tadek p 59 15 when the payment is made a portion is distributed among the girls relatives pp 72 74 but her parents retain the greater part for themselves 16 the groom cannot yet claim his bride although in one case he is allowed to take her immediately after the paklon by making a special payment for the privilege p 74 a few nights later the groom goes to the girls home carrying with him an empty jar with which he makes the final payment p 73 the customary rice ceremony 17 follows and he is then entitled to his bride p 73 should the house or anything in it break at this time it foretells misfortune for the couple hence precautions are taken lest such a sign should by accident be given p 60 in all but two cases mentioned the girl and her husband go to live with his people in the first instance their failure to do so raises a protest in the second the girls parents are of much more importance than those of the groom and this may explain their ability to retain their daughter pp 138 159 when the bride reaches her future home she sits on the bamboo floor with her legs stretched out in front of her the slats which she covers are counted and a string of agate beads equal in length to the combined width of the slats is given to her she now becomes a full member of the family and seems to be under the orders of her motherinlaw p 60 the tales give constant sanction for the marriage of near relatives dumanau we are told marries his cousin 18 while we frequently meet with such statements as we are relatives and it is good for us to be married or they saw that they were related and that both possessed magical power so they were married p 35 it appears that a man may live with his sweetheart and have children by her yet leave her and without reproach marry another better fitted to be his wife p 54 he may also accept payment for a wife who has deserted him apparently without loss of prestige p 64 no objection seems to be raised to a man having two wives so long as one of these is an inhabitant of the upper world p 111 but we find kanag telling his former sweetheart that he cannot marry her since he is now married to another p 138 again when two women lay claim to aponitolau as their husband they undergo a test and the loser returns to her former home p 94 however this rule does not prevent a man from having several concubines p 120 gawigawen we are told is accompanied to a paklon by eighteen young girls who are his concubines p 59 divorce is twice mentioned but it seems to call out protest only from the cast off wife pp 63 149 closely associated with the celebration of a marriage seems to be a ceremony known as sayang during the progress of which a number of small structuresthe largest known as balauaare built judging by their names and descriptions we are justified in considering them spirit houses as they are today the details of the extended sayang ceremony are nowhere given but so much is made plainat its beginning many people pound rice for use in the offerings and for food and daeng 19 is danced p 40 after the libon 20 invitations are sent out by means of betelnuts covered with gold to those whose presence is especially desired p 62 when the guests arrive at the village spring or gate they are offered food or drink and then while they dance they are sprinkled with water or rice after which all go up to the town p 41 note 2 a medium who knows the customs and desires of the spirits constructs a bamboo mat which is known as talapitap and on it offers food to call their attention she frequently strikes the ground with the dakidaksplit sticks of bamboo and lono 21 p 40 the guests are not neglected so far as regards food for feasting and dancing occupy a considerable portion of their time the ceremonial dance daeng is mentioned but the tadek 22 seems to be the one in special favor pp 41 59 one tale tells us that the sayang was held immediately following a head hunt and another that aponitolau went out to get the head of an old man before he started this ceremony pp 69 76 however the evidence is by no means conclusive that it is related to warfare on page 105 we are told that kanags half sister is a medium and the description of her method of summoning the spirits tallies with that of today at the sayang ceremony she is called to perform the dawak 23 with the assistance of the old woman alokotn p 106 the dawak is also held in order to stop the flow of blood from aponitolaus finger p 113 the only other ceremony mentioned is that made in order to find a lost switch p 91 certain wellknown customs are strongly brought out in our material the first and apparently most important is the necessity of offering liquor and food both to strangers and to guests p 58 refusal is so keenly resented that in one instance a couple decline to allow their daughter to marry a man whose emissaries reject this gift p 73 old quarrels are closed by the tender of food or drink and friendships are cemented by the drinking of basi 24 p 134 people meeting for the first time and even friends who have been separated for a while chew betelnut together and tell their names and places of residence we are repeatedly told that it is necessary to chew the nut and make known their names for we cannot tell our names unless we chew and it is bad for us if we do not know each others names when we talk a certain etiquette is followed at this time old men precede the younger people of the home town the visitors and men always are before the women pp 45 133 the conduct of awig when he serves liquor to the alzados 25 is that of today ie the person who serves always drinks before passing it to others p 156 certain other rules of etiquette or restrictions on conduct come out in the tales we learn that it is not considered proper for a man to eat with the wife of another during his absence nor should they start the meal before he comes in p 52 the master of a dance is deeply chagrined and chides his wife severely because she insists on dancing before he has invited all the others to take their turns p 70 greediness is reproved in children and aponitolau causes the death of his concubines whose false tales had led him to maltreat his wife p 116 unfaithfulness seems to be sufficient justification for a man to abandon his wife and kill her admirer p 78 but kanag appears as a hero when he refuses to attack his father who has sought his life p 121 of the ceremonies connected with death we learn very little except that the women discard their arm beads the mourners don old clothing and all wail for the dead pp 44 90 three times we are told that the deceased is placed on a tabalang or raft on which a live rooster is fastened before it is set adrift on the river in the tales the raft and fowl are of gold but this is surprising even to the old woman alokotn past whose home in nagbotobotn all these rafts must go p 131 up to this time in our reconstruction of the life of the first times we have mentioned nothing impossible or improbable to the present day tinguian although as we shall see later there are some striking differences in customs and ideas we have purposely left the description of the people and their practice of magic to the last although their magical practices invade every activity of their lives for it is here that the greatest variations from present conditions apparently occur these people had intimate relations with some of the lesser spirits especially with the liblibayan 26 who appear to be little more than their servants with the evil spirits known as banbanyo and with the alan p 123 the alan just mentioned are today considered as deformed spirits who live in the forests they are as large as people but have wings and can fly their toes are at the back of their feet and their fingers point backwards from their wrists the several references to them in the tales such as you alan girls whose toes on your feet turn out indicate they were so considered in the first times p 161 some of them are addressed as you alan of the springs and in one instance a man dives down into the water where the alan live p 148 but in general their homes seem to be similar to but much finer than those of the people of kadalayapan and kaodanan these spirits appear time after time as the foster mothers of the leading characters generally they secure a drop of menstrual blood a miscarriage or the afterbirth and all unknown to the real parents change them into children and raise them p 83 these foster children are pictured as living in houses of gold situated near springs the pebbles of which are of gold or beads 27 the places where the women set the pots while dipping water are big plates or dishes while similar dishes form the stepping stones leading up to the house articles of gold are found in the dwellings and valuable jars are numerous when the true relationships of these children are established they always go to their blood parents carrying with them these riches which are a source of wonder and comment pp 43 64 the people of kadalayapan and kaodanan have many dealings with the celestial bodies the big star bagbagak appears as the husband of sinagthe moonand father of the star maiden gaygayma who aponitolau assures his wife is a spirit when this girl comes down to steal sugarcane she takes off her star dress and appears as a beautiful maiden 28 she becomes enamored with aponitolau and takes him to the sky where he lives with her they have a child who later marries in kadalayapan and thereafter stays below upon the occasion when aponitolau visits his first wife and fails to return to the sky at the appointed time a great company of stars are sent to fetch him with orders to devour him if he refuses to obey p 109 ff in the first tale aponitolau himself appears as the sun the man who makes the sun as a round stone which rolls but when it is established that he is the son of a couple in kadalayapan he apparently relinquishes his duties in the sky and goes to live in the village of his people with him goes his wife aponibolinayen who had been carried above by a vine while at his post in the heavens aponitolau is closely associated with the big star whose duty it is to follow him in the sky again we are told that aponitolau is taken up by the spirit kabkabagaan whom he marries and by whom he has a son p 114 in some instances this hero and his son kanag converse with thunder and lightning which appear at times not unlike human beings p 100 but in the eighth relation the two kinds of lightning are pictured as dogs who guard the town of dona these people enjoy unusual relations with inanimate things and we find them conversing with spears and with jars 29 in one case the latter appear to be pastured like animals and surround aponitolau when he goes to feed them with lawed 30 leaves and salt p 51 weapons weep blood and oil when taken down for the purpose of injuring certain persons p 43 a nose flute when played by a youth tells him of his mothers plight p 152 while a bamboo jews harp summons the brothers of its owner p 162 animals and birds are frequently in communication with them the hawk flies away and spreads the news of the fight at adasin 31 p 90 at the bidding of dalongan a spider spins a web about the town p 124 and aponitolau is enabled to fulfill the labors assigned him by the tenheaded giant only through the aid of spiders ants and flies p 101 32 during certain dances the water from the river flows over the town and fish come up and bite the feet of the dancers p 59 crocodiles are left to guard the sister of aponibalagen and when they fail to explain their negligence they are whipped and sent away by their master p 87 a great bird is pleased with aponitolau and carries him away 33 to its home where it forces him to marry a woman it had previously captured p 92 in one instance an animal gives birth to a human child a frog laps up the spittle of aponitolau and as a result becomes pregnant 34 and gives birth to a maiden who is taken away by the spirits p 105 another account states that the three sons of aponitolau and aponibolinayen are born as pigs but later assume human form p 116 kanag becomes a snake when he tries to secure the perfume of baliwn but is restored to human form when he bathes in a magic well p 137 these and other mysterious happenings many of which are not explained as being due to their own volition befall them thus ingiwan while walking is confronted by an impassable hill and is compelled to cross the ocean where he finds his future wife but upon his return the hill has vanished p 86 in other instances the finger rings of people meeting for the first time exchange themselves p 92 the headband of ligi flies away without his knowledge and alights on the skirt of a girl who is bathing in the river as a result she becomes pregnant and when the facts become known ligi is recognized as the childs father p 144 it seems probable that the superior powers are responsible for these occurrences for in at least one instance the great spirit kaboniyan steals a maiden and turns her into a flock of birds who talk with and assist the owner of a rice field p 151 while they thus appear to be to a certain extent under the control of the spirits and to be surrounded by animals and inanimate things with human intelligence and speech the people of these first times possess great power over nature time and space are annihilated for at their will daylight comes at once p 150 or they are transported to a place in an instant p 92 at their command people appear kanag creates betelnut trees then cuts the fruit into bits which he sows on the ground from these come many people who are his neighbors and one of whom he marries p 121 the course of nature is changed a field is planted in an instant the crops mature in a few days and the grain and fruits take themselves to the storehouse p 150 a strikealight turns into a hill which impedes pursuers 35 p 75 while a belt or headaxe serves as a ferry across a body of water p 84 a storm is called upon to carry a person or a building to a distance p 121 and a spring is created by killing an old man p 60 36 prepared food appears at a word a stick when cooked becomes a fish and though it is repeatedly broken and served it always appears ready for service at meal time p 33 a small jar containing a single grain of rice supplies an abundance of food another jar no larger than a fist furnishes drink for a company and still remains a third full while a single earring fills a pot with gold 37 pp 47 119 123 quite as easy as the creation of beings is the causing of sleep or death all the people of a village are put to sleep at the will of a single person p 145 and albagawhile still at a distancecauses the death of aponibolinayen p 44 at a word of command the spears and headaxes of the people of kadalayapan and kaodanan go out and kill great numbers of the enemy and the heads and booty take themselves in orderly fashion to towns of their new owners pp 66 75 many methods of restoring the dead to life are employed spittle is applied to the wounds or the victim is placed in a magic well but the common method is for the hero to whip his perfume 38 whereupon the dead follow his commands pp 152 157 the birth of a child to a woman of these times is generally preceded by an intense itching between the third and last fingers and when this spot is pricked the child pops out like popped rice 39 its growth is always magical for at each bath its stature increases by a span p 102 within a few days the baby is a large child and then begins deeds of valor worthy of the most renowned warriors pp 95 96 the power of assuming animal forms appears to be a common possession and we find the different characters changing themselves into fireflies ants centipedes omen birds and in one case into oil 40 pp 85 99 one of the most peculiar yet constantly used powers of these people is their ability to send betelnuts on various missions whenever an invitation to a ceremony or celebration is to be extended nuts covered with gold are oiled and sent out they go to the intended guest state their errand and if refused forthwith proceed to grow on his knee forehead or pet pig until pain or pity compels him to accept p 146 in some cases it appears that the nuts themselves possess the magic properties for we find aponitolau demanding that his conquered foes give him their betelnuts with magic power p 91 relationships can be readily ascertained by the chewing of these nuts for when the quids are laid down they are transformed into agate and golden beads and lie in such a manner that the associations are fully established pp 35 36 41 enough has been mentioned to show how important a part magic and magical practices play in the life of this people but one further reference should be made since it is found in nearly every tale when the marriage price is settled upon the mother of the groom exercises her power and at once fills the spirit house with valuable jars and the like this is repeated until enough are gathered to meet the demands of the girls people p 133 even when the agreed sum has been delivered we often find the girls mother herself practicing magic to secure additional payment and by raising her elbows or eyebrows causing a part of the jars to vanish pp 133 143 despite their great gifts we find that these people are not allpowerful and that they deem it wise to consult the omens before starting on a task or a journey the gall sack and liver of a pig are eagerly examined 41 while the calls of birds actions of animals or signs received from the thunder and lightning regulate their conduct in cases where these warnings are disregarded misfortune or death always overtakes the individual pp 48 49 100 ff death comes to them but apparently is only a temporary state the deceased are often revived by some magical process p 152 but if not the corpse is placed on a raft and is set adrift on the river 42 the streams and rivers we are told all flow past nagbotobotn before they empty into the hole where all streams go in this place lives the old woman alokotn who is related to the people of kadalayapan and kaodanan her duty it is to watch for dead relatives to secure them and make them alive again p 132 she is the owner of a magic pool the waters of which revive the dead and renew youth comparison of the reconstructed culture with present day conditionsbefore passing to a consideration of the tales in the last two divisions of our material it may be well to compare the life and beliefs of these people of the first times with those of the living tinguian kadalayapan and kaodanan appear in a vague way to have been located in abra for we learn that the ilocano don carlos went up the river from baygan vigan 43 to kadalayapan that the alzados 44 lived near by while the tattooed igorot occupied the land to the south pp 77 155 the villages were surrounded by defensive walls such as were to be found about all tinguian villages until recent times and which are still to be seen about abang and other settlements within the walls were many houses the descriptions of most of which would fit the dwellings of to day the one thing which seems foreign to present conditions is the socalled ninth room which receives rather frequent mention there is nothing in the tales referring to buildings or house construction which lends support to the contention of those who seek to class the tinguian as a modified subgroup of igorot 45 the bontoc type of dwelling with its ground floor sleeping box and its elevated one room kitchen and storage room is nowhere mentioned neither is there any indication that in past or present times the tinguian had separate sleeping houses for the unmarried men and boys and for the girls as do their neighbors to the south the other structures such as the spirit houses rice drying frames and granaries were similar to those seen today in all the villages likewise the house furnishings the musical instruments and even the games of the children were such as are to be found at present while our picture of the village life given on page 9 still fits nearly any tinguian settlement in abra the animals mentioned are all familiar to the present people but it is worthy of note that in the first twentysix tales which make up the cycle proper the horse is not mentioned nor does the carabao appear to be used as a work animal still more important is the fact that the terraced fields and the rice culture accompanying them which today occupy a predominant place in the economic life of the people are nowhere mentioned on the other hand the langpdan or mountain rice assumes a place of great importance references to the cultivation of the land all seem to indicate that the hoe culture which is still practiced to a limited extent took the place of agriculture the clothing hair dressing and ornaments worn by these people agree closely with those of today beads seems to have been of prime importance but could scarcely have been more prized or more used than at present unless she be in mourning the hair and neck of each woman are now ornamented with strings of beads many of them of evident antiquity while strands above strands cover the arms from the wrist to the elbow or even reach to the shoulder 46 the wealth of a person seems to have been to a large extent determined by the number of old jars in his possession as at the present time they formed the basis of settlement for feuds as payment for a bride and even figured in the marriage ceremony itself the jars as judged from their names were evidently of ancient chinese manufacture and possessed power of speech and motion similar to that of human beings but in a lesser measure the same type of jars have similar powers today 47 the use of gold and jewels seems to have been common in the old times the latter are seldom seen in the district today but the use of bits of gold in the various ceremonies is still common while earrings of gold or copper are among the most prized possessions of the women 48 placer mining is well known to the igorot of the south who melt and cast the metal into various ornaments so far as i am aware this is not practiced by the present tinguian but may point back to a time when the industry was known in this region or when trade relations with the south were much freer than in recent years the weapons of the warriors which we are specifically told were of metal are identical with those seen at the present time while the methods of warfare agree with the accounts still told by the old men of their youthful exploits a survey of the tales brings out boldly the fact that a headhunt was one of the most important events in tinguian life today stress of circumstances has caused the custom to suffer a rapid decline but even now heads are occasionally taken while most of the old men have vivid recollections of the days when they fought in the towns of their enemies a spirited account of a head celebration seen in the village of lagangilangfrom which ten of these tales were collectedwill be found in the writings of la gironiere already referred to 49 it is important to note that this account as well as those secured from many warriors of the present generation offers some striking differences to the procedure in the olden days particularly as regards the disposal of the skulls the tales tell of the heads being placed on the sagang 50 at the spring at the gate or about the town after the celebration certain of the present villages make use of the sagang but the more common type of head holder is the saloko 51 which still figures in many ceremonies however the heads only remain in these receptacles until the day set for the festival they are then carried to the centre of the village and there amid great rejoicing are cut open the brains are removed and to them are added the lobes of the ears and joints of the little fingers and the whole is then placed in the liquor which is served to the dancers before the guests depart the skulls are broken into small pieces and a fragment is presented to each male guest who carries it home and is thus often reminded of the valor of the takers 52 a study of tinguian beliefs furnishes an additional religious motive for the taking of heads but with the people of kadalayapan and kaodanan revenge and the desire for renown were the prime incentives every tale emphasizes the importance of the sayang ceremony and the spirit structure known as balaua 53 the ceremony is nowhere described in full but the many details which are supplied show that it was almost identical with that of today the same is true of the dawak 54 which we find mentioned on three different occasions and of the ceremony made to aid in locating lost or stolen articles the most noticeable fact to the person familiar with tinguian life is that these are the only ceremonies mentioned among the many known and practiced at present more than a score of different rites are now well known to this people and occupy a very considerable portion of their time and attention during the first four months of the year the failure to make mention of these very important events is explained it seems to me not by their absence but by the fact that these rites vary in importance and that the privilege of celebrating them is hereditary in a family should one not entitled to hold such a ceremony desire to do so he must first give in order all the lesser events a costly procedure extending over a period of several years the people of kadalayapan and kaodanan always appear as being closely related to the spirit kaboniyan 55 and exceedingly powerful it seems probable that the story teller takes it for granted that all of them are entitled to hold the most important ceremony known to the tinguian a prominent figure in these rites is the medium through whom the ancient people generally conversed with the spirits but in exceptional cases we found the heroes talking direct with the superior beings however this gift is not confined to the men of old for in such tales as 55 and 59 people who are believed to have lived recently have conversed with the spirits and have even been joined to them in marriage the procedure in choosing a bride the engagement the paklon 56 and the marriage proper are all those of the present day but the rules governing the marriage of relatives differ radically as already noted one of the chief qualifications for marriage among the people of the tales was relationship and even cousins became husband and wife such a thing is unthinkable among the tinguian of today first cousins are absolutely barred from marrying while even the union of second cousins would cause a scandal and it is very doubtful if such a wife would be allowed to share in her deceased husbands property 57 it appears that only one real 58 wife is recognized as legitimate but that from the first times to the present a man might have as many concubines as he could secure so far as mythology and present day conditions can inform us the bride has always gone to the home of her husband and for a time at least has been subject to the dictations of her motherinlaw although the couple are generally soon established in a home of their own in the town of the groom there is nothing in tinguian life or tradition to indicate that they have ever had a clan system or a matriarchal form of government the few references to the procedure immediately after a death indicate that in part the people of today follow the old custom but here again an important departure occurs we are thrice told that the corpse was placed on a little raft called tabalang and set adrift on the river and in one case the afterbirth was treated in the same manner nothing of the sort is done today nor does it seem at all likely that such has been the case in recent generations the body is now buried beneath the house and certain set rules govern the movements of all persons related to the deceased as well as the disposal of the corpse this procedure is so complex and so uniform throughout the whole tinguian belt that it seems improbable that it has grown up except through a long period of time at this point it is interesting to note that at many ceremonies it is necessary to construct a small raft called taltalababong or talabong to place offerings in it and set it adrift on the stream in order that any spirits who have been prevented from attending the ceremony may still secure their share 59 the festivals the dances the observances of the proprieties required by good breeding or custom of today follow closely those given in the tales the greatest divergence is in the offering of betelnuts and the telling of names which occupies such an important place in the narratives the use of betelnut for chewing is less common among the tinguian people than with most other philippine tribes a fact which may be accounted for by their constant use of tobacco however betelnuts still occupy a most important place in the various ceremonies and many offerings intended for the spirits must be accompanied with the prepared nut in nearly every instance when invitations were sent out for a ceremony the people of the tales intrusted an oiled betelnut covered with gold with this duty this has its counterpart today in the small gifts of gold which are often carried to some friend in another town whose presence is particularly desired it seems not improbable that the golden colored husks of the ripe betelnuts may have suggested the substitution magic was practiced extensively in the first time but it is by no means unknown to the people of the present day they cannot now bring a dead person to life or create human beings out of bits of betelnut but they can and do cause sickness and death to their foes by performing certain rites or directing actions against garments or other objects recently in their possession even the name of an enemy can be applied to an animal or inanimate object and action against it be transferred to the owner like the tinguian the people of kadalayapan and kaodanan are warned or encouraged by omens received through the medium of birds thunder lightning or the condition of the gall and liver of a slaughtered pig 60 and like them they suffer for failure to heed these warnings or for the infraction of a taboo the myths of the first division make it plain that to the people of those times the sun moon and stars were animateeither spirits or human beings in some cases a similar conception was held for thunder and lightning while in others they appear as animals it will appear that such ideas are not foreign to the second division of the tales which represent present day beliefs thus in the mountain village of baay the sky is considered as a male spiritthe husband of the earth and father of sun and moon again in lagangilang and abang the thunderbolt is identified as kadaklanthe most powerful of all spiritswho often eats the ground and releases his wife agemem this brings us to a most interesting question namely are the chief actors in our tales to be considered as celestial beings and spirits or as human heroes we have already made note of the fact that in the first tale aponitolau is identified with iniinit whom we are told was the sun the man who makes the sun a round stone which rolls in this tale he marries aponibolinayen a maiden whose name may possibly be construed to mean the woman in the moon 61 however we find aponitolau abandoning his place in the sky and going to reside in kadalayapan this tale comes from the town of langangilang where as we have already seen the celestial beings are regarded as spirits tale fifteen coming from the same town shows us this same aponitolau going up to the sky where he marries the spirit kabkabagaan but as before he returns to his home below a further indication of his celestial character is perhaps afforded us in tale fourteen which was recorded in patok a valley town in which the sun moon and stars are now regarded as lights belonging to the spirit kadaklan here we find that aponitolau marries the star maid gaygayma who is the daughter of the big star bagbagak and sinagthe moon in this same tale aponibolinayen appears as the first wife of aponitolau and it is clear that in the mind of the story teller she is not identified with sinag aponitolau appears in the other tales without any hint of celestial qualities aside from her name and the fact that she is once pictured as visiting the sky there is nothing to indicate that his wife aponibolinayen is to be considered as the moon a careful study of the other characters who reside in kadalayapan and kaodanan fails to yield any evidence that they are considered as celestial beings during the sayang ceremony held in san juan a certain man and woman who are then called iwaginn and gimbagon 62 represent the good spirits and are defended by the people when evil spirits try to dispossess them of their property this is the only instance i have observed in which the names of any of these characters of the tales appear in the ceremonies while a list of more than one hundred and fifty spirits known to the tinguian fails to reveal more while in the practice of magic and in their communication with nature celestial bodies and spirits these people of the first times far excelled the present tinguian they had a material culture and ceremonial life much like that still found in abra it seems then that these people about whom the stories cluster are not to be identified as celestial beings or spirits 63 they appear rather as generalized heroes whose life and deeds represent that of an earlier period magnified and extolled by succeeding generations ritualistic and explanatory myths the second division of the tales now assumes a position of importance to us for in it we find present day ideas and beliefs of the people strongly brought out and are thus in a position to contrast them with the tenets of the people in the first times the influence of custom is exceedingly strong among the tinguian of today the fact that the ancestors did so and so is sufficient justification for performing any act for which they have no definite explanation nowhere is this influence greater than in the ceremonies these which accompany all the important happenings in their daily life are conducted by mediums who are fitted for office by long training and each one of whom is a check on the others if they wilfully or through carelessness deviate from the old forms the ritual of these ceremonies is very complex and the reason for doing many acts now seems to be entirely lost yet the one explanation kadayancustomis sufficient to satisfy any tinguian other acts as well as the possession of certain things are explained by myths such as we are considering it seems certain that we are here dealing not with present day beliefs alone but with at least relatively old customs and tales which while enabling us to understand present day conceptions also give us a glimpse into the past the myths 3240 which are known to the people as diams are now inseparable parts of the various ceremonies thus when a pig is to be offered in the sayang ceremony the medium sits down beside it and strokes it with oiled fingers while she talks to the spirits the translation of her talk shows that this is in no sense a prayer but is rather an account of how the greatest of the spirits taught the tinguian people to perform this ceremony correctly likewise when she offers food in the dawak 64 ceremony she relates how the spirit kaboniyan taught the tinguian to do this in the same manner that he performs it in the palaan 65 diam she relates in story form the cause of the sickness but in this case ends with a direct invocation to the spirits in dadya to make them well again if you please the balance of the diams 3540 are in story form and seem intended more as an explanation to the people as to the causes of their troubles than to be directed toward the spirits however the medium seldom has an audience and rarely ever a single listener as she recites the diams she has learned verbatim from her instructors when preparing for the duties of her office myths 4154 are of quite a different type they are generally told by the mediums or wise old people during the ceremonies but always to a crowd of eager listeners they are not learned word for word as are the diams but their content is constant and they are thoroughly believed that they exert a great influence on the beliefs and conduct of both old and young is undoubted the evil which befalls a person who molests the guardian stones is thus made known even to the children who generally keep at a distance from the grove in which they stand again these tales give sharp warning as to what befalls a person who even ignorantly breaks the taboos following a death but at the same time advance means of thwarting the wrath of the enraged or evil spirits myths 55 to 62 at first glance to not appear to be explanatory at all but seem rather to be a series of stories dealing with the relations between certain persons and the natural spirits or those of the dead however it is the intent and use rather than the form of these stories which has caused them to be included in this division for they give the people authority for certain beliefs and conceptions which they hold tale 56 gives us a glimpse of the prevalent idea of the abode of the dead where the spirits lead much the same sort of life as they did while alive but we secure quite a different picture of this realm from the baluga 66 tale in which the home of the deceased is said to be in the ground while the life of the dead woman is kept in a bamboo cup this last account was heard in manabo a town near to the igorot settlements of the upit river and may be influenced by the beliefs held in that section 67 certain individuals appear to have intimate dealings with the natural spirits in some instances even being joined to them in marriage the afterbirth child sayen is believed to have lived not very long ago yet we find his life and actions quite similar to those of the heroes in the first times while his foster motherthe alan 68takes the same part as did the alan of old relations 63 to 74 appear as pure explanatory tales accounting for the existence and appearance of celestial bodies and animals in their present state they also account for the possession of fire and of many prized objects such as jars and agate beads incidentally many essential traits and old customs come out such for instance as those of war and mourning which appear in connection with the origin of the kalau 69 with few exceptions the myths of this division correspond to present beliefs the spirits are those known today the towns mentioned are now existing or their former locations are well known they have thus the appearance of being of more recent origin than those of the first division yet it is worthy of note that there is little in them which seems foreign to or out of keeping with the older tales fables the last division may be said to be made up of fables for the story tellers without hesitation label them as fictions the last of these appears to be only a worked over incident of myth 56 in which the big bird banog carries the hero to its nest from which he escapes by holding to the wings of the young birds it is possible that more of these fables are likewise incidents in tales prevalent among the tinguian but not heard by the writer whether or no this be true it is certain that most of these stories are well known to the ilocano of the coast and the other christianized natives throughout the archipelago comparison with the folklore from other regions shows that these stories are by no means confined to the philippines the chief incidents in the narrative of the turtle and the monkey have been recorded from the kenyah of borneo 70 and from the northern peninsula of celebes 71 the race between the shell and the carabao is told in british north borneo 72 in regard to the plandok and crab while it is known to european children as the race between the turtle and the hare the threat of the mosquito in 84 is almost identical with that recorded by evans in borneo 73 while many incidents in the fable of dogidog 74 are found in the iban story of simpang impang 75 when comparing the tinguian versions of these fables with those of the ilocano one is impressed with the fact that while the incidents upon which they are founded are often identical the stories themselves have frequently been moulded and changed by the tellers who have introduced bits of old customs and beliefs until they reflect in a way the prevalent ideas of the people thus in the story of the magic poncho 76 which is evidently of spanish introduction the owner is identified as the banbantaya wellknown minor spirit again the first part of tale 85 is identical with that of the ilocano but ends with the parents of the groom preparing the things used in the paklona very necessary part of the tinguian marriage ceremony the footnotes have called attention to the many incidents which have their parallels in other districts reference to these shows that a large percentage are found in the islands toward the south while recognizing that similarity of incidents does not necessarily mean identity of origin we must still give full credit to the effects of borrowing even over great distances the easy communication along the coast during the past four hundred years and the contact with spanish and christianized officials and traders will readily explain the likeness of the tales in division iii to those held in distant islands or even in europe but as just noted these are now undergoing change doubtless a similar inflow had been taking place although at a slower rate long before the spaniards reached the islands and tinguian mythology has grown up as the result of blending of native tales with those of other areas the whole being worked over and reshaped until it fitted the social setting previous writersamong them ratzel and graebner 77have sought to account for certain resemblances in culture between malaysia polynesia and america by historical connection a part of our materialsuch as that of the bloodclot child p 125 78 the rape of the maiden by the vine which carries her to the sky p 33 the magic flight p 75 and magic growth p 38 79may seem to lend support to such a theory these similarities are assuredly suggestive and interesting but it appears to the writer that the material is too scanty and the folklore of intervening lands too little known to justify us in considering them as convincing proof of borrowing over such immense distances 80 general results our study has brought out certain general results we have seen that tinguian folklore has much in common with that of other tribes and lands while a part of this similarity is doubtless due to borrowinga process which can still be seen at worka considerable portion of the tales is probably of local and fairly recent origin while the balance appears to be very old these older tales are so intimately interwoven with the ceremonies beliefs and culture of this people that they may safely be considered as having been developed by them they are doubtless much influenced by present day conditions for each story teller must even unconsciously read into them some of his own experiences and the current beliefs of the tribe at the same time these traditional accounts doubtless exercise a potent influence on the thoughts beliefs and actions of the people in tinguian society where custom still holds undisputed sway these wellknown tales of past times must tend to cast into the same mould any new facts or experiences which come to them we believe that we are justified when we take the viewpoint of the tinguian and consider the stories of the first times as essentially very old how old it is impossible to state definitely but a careful analysis of our material justifies us in believing that they reflect a time before the people possessed terraced rice fields when domestic work animals were still unknown and the horse had not yet been introduced into their land that these are not recent events is attested by the great part they all now play in the ceremonial and economic life it is evident that outside influences of great importance were introduced at a period later than the time when the chinese first began to trade along the coasts of the philippines for the prized jars which play such an important rle in the mythology are not to be identified as those of native make but are ancient chinese vessels dating back at least to the fourteenth and perhaps even to the tenth century 81 it is probable that the glass porcelain and agate beads which are second only to the jars in importance are exceedingly old many ancient specimens are still in use and are held for as fabulous prices as are those found among the interior tribes of borneo nieuwenhuis has shown that the manufacture of beads had become a great industry in the middle ages and had extended even to china and japan whence the products may have spread contemporaneously with the pottery 82 we have seen that for the most part the life customs and beliefs which appear in our reconstruction of the first times agrees closely with present conditions certain things which seem formerly to have been of prime importancesuch as the sending of a betelnut covered with gold to invite guests to a festival or ceremonyappear to have their echo in present conditions the betelnut which played such a momentous part in the old times still holds its place in the rituals of the many ceremonies although it is not now much used in daily life the magic of today is less powerful than formerly but is still a tremendous force the communication of the ancient people with other members of the animate world as well as with the inanimate and spiritual and their metamorphosis into animals and the like offers nothing strange or inconsistent to the people of today they even now talk to jars they converse with spirits who come to them through the bodies of their mediums and people only recently deceased are known to have had the power of changing themselves at will into other forms in short there is no sharp break between the mode of thought of today and that exhibited in the folklore it is true that the tales give sanction to some things not in agreement with tinguian usagesuch for instance as the marriage of relatives or the method of disposing of the deadand it may be that we have here a remembrance of customs which long ago fell into disuse in a previous paper 83 the writer showed that there have been many migrations into abra from the north south and west a part of the emigrants have become thoroughly amalgamated with the tinguian people and have doubtless introduced some part of their material culture and beliefs this helps us to understand such conflicts as we have already noted in regard to the place held by thunder and lightning in the spirit world as to the future abode of the spirits of the departed as well as other discrepancies which the limits of this paper have prevented us from discussing it is not impossible that those customs of the first times which are at variance with those of today may represent older ideas which have been swamped or on the other hand the memory of the strange customs once practiced by the emigrants may have caused them to be attributed to the people of the tales finally we believe that a study of tinguian mythology has shown us that we can gain a real knowledge of the past of a people through their folklore that we can secure an insight into their mental life and can learn something of the valuation they attach to certain of their activities and beliefs which to us may seem at the surface trite and trivial tales of the mythical period 1 we go to take greens sisterinlaw dinay perhaps the siksiklat 84 will taste good i have heard that the siksiklat is good said aponibolinayen they went to get her siksiklat when they arrived at the place of small trees which they thought was the place of the siksiklat they looked aponibolinayen was the first who looked as soon as she began to break off the siksiklat which she saw she did not break any more but the siksiklat encircled and carried her up when they reached the sky literally the up the siksiklat placed her below the alosip 85 tree she sat for a long time soon she heard the crowing of the rooster she stood up and went to see the rooster which crowed she saw a spring she saw it was pretty because its sands were oday 86 and its gravel pagapat 87 and the top of the betelnut tree was gold and the place where the people step was a large chinese plate which was gold she was surprised for she saw that the house was small she was afraid and soon began to climb the betelnut tree and she hid herself the man who owned the house which she saw near the well 88 was iniinitthe sun but he was not in the place of his house because he went out and went above to make the sun because that was his work in the daytime and the next day aponibolinayen saw him who went out of his house because he went again to make the sun and aponibolinayen went after him to his house because she saw the man who owned the house who left when she arrived in the house she quickly cooked because she was very hungry when she finished cooking she took the stick used in roasting fish and cooked it and the fishstick which she cooked became cutup fish because she used her magic power 89 when she finished to cook the fish she took out rice from the pot and when she had finished to take out the rice from the pot she took off the meat from the fish when she finished taking the fish from the pot she ate when she finished eating she washed when she finished washing she kept those things which she used to eat the coconut shell cup and plate and she laid down to sleep when afternoon came iniinit went home to his house after he finished fishing he saw his house which appeared as if it was burning not slowly he went home because it appeared as if his house was burning when he arrived at his house it was not burning and he was surprised because it appeared as if there was a flame at the place of his bed when he was in his house he saw that which was like the flame of the fire at the place of his bed was a very pretty lady soon he cooked and when he had finished to cook he scaled the fish and when he had finished scaling he cut it into many pieces and he made a noise on the bamboo floor when he cut the fish the woman awoke who was asleep on his bed she saw that the man who cut the fish was a handsome man and that he dragged his hair 90 the pot she had used to cook in looked like the egg of a rooster 91 and he was surprised because it looked like the egg of a rooster and the rice which she cooked was one grain of broken rice 92 because of all this iniinit was surprised for the pot was very small with which she cooked after iniinit cooked the woman vanished and she went to the leaves of the betelnut where she went to hide after iniinit finished cooking the fish he saw the bed the place where the woman was sleeping was empty he was looking continually but he did not find her when he could not find her he ate alone and when he finished eating he washed and when he finished washing the dishes he put away and when he had finished putting away he went to the yard to get a fresh breath not long afterwards he went to take a walk in the place of his betelnuts when he had finished to take a walk in the place of his betelnuts he went to sleep when it began to be early morning he left his house he who went up because it was his business to make the sun and aponibolinayen went again into the house when it became afternoon iniinit went to his home and aponibolinayen had cooked after which she went out to the betelnut trees when iniinit arrived he was surprised because his food was cooked for there was no person in his house as soon as he saw the cooked rice and cooked fish in the dish he took the fish and the rice and began to eat when he had finished eating he went to his yard to take a fresh breath and he was troubled in his mind when he thought of what had happened he said perhaps the woman which i saw came to cook and has left the house sometime i shall try to hide and watch so that i may catch her he went to sleep and when it became early morning he went to cook his food when he had finished eating he went again to make the sun and aponibolinayen went again to his house when the sun had nearly sunk he sent the big star who was next to follow him in the sky and he went home to spy on the woman when he had nearly reached his home he saw the house appeared as if it was burning 93 he walked softly when he went up the ladder he slammed shut the door he reached truly the woman who was cooking in the house he went quickly and the woman said to him you cut me only once so that i only cure one time if you are the old enemy if i were the old enemy i should have cut before said iniinit and he sat near her who cooked he took out the betelnut and he arranged it so that they began to chew the betelnut and he said ala young lady we are going to chew because it is bad for us to talk who do not know each others names aponibolinayen answered no for if the rich man who practices magic is able to give to the rich woman who has magical power soon there will be a sign iniinit said no hurry up even though we are related for you come here if we are not related 94 he begged her and he cut the betelnut which was to be chewed which was covered with gold and he gave it to the woman who had magical power and they chewed when she laid down the quid it looked like the agate bead which has no hole for the thread and the quid of iniinit looked like a square bead my name is iniinit who often goes to travel over the world i always stop in the afternoon what can i do it is my business he said aponibolinayen was next to tell her name my name is aponibolinayen who lives in kaodanan who am the sister of awig she said and when they had finished telling their names both their quids looked like the agate bead which is pinoglan which has no hole iniinit said we are relatives and it is good for us to be married do not be afraid even though you did not come here of your own accord i go to kaodanan he said then they married and the sun went to shine on the world because it was his business and the big star also had business when it became night aponibolinayen staid alone in the house and in the afternoon the sun again went home but first he went to fish in the river he went home when he had caught the big fish for them to eatboth those married and when he arrived in their house he found aponibolinayen who was cooking and he saw that she still broke up the fishstick which she cooked iniinit asked her what are you doing with that stick which you are breaking which you put in the jar and aponibolinayen replied i cook for us both to eat and the sun laughed because she cooked the stick you throw away that stick which you are cooking this fish which i caught with the net is what you are to cook it is not eatable that fishstick which you cook he said aponibolinayen said you shall see by and by when we eat what it will become you hang up the fish which you caught which we shall eat tomorrow hurry up you throw away that stick which you cook it has no use even though you cook for one month it will not become soft and i do not think it will become good said iniinit aponibolinayen said no you hurry and hang that fish which you caught with the net because it is nearly cookedthe rice and the fish not long after she took out the rice from the jar and she uncovered her cooked fish which was a stick when the sun saw that the fish came from the stick which she cooked he was surprised and he asked her how she made the stick which she cooked turn to fish aponibolinayen said you hurry come and eat for i have finished taking out the rice and fish 95 not long after that the sun went truly in front of her to the place of the rice and cooked fish and they ate not long after they finished and aponibolinayen washed and when she had finished washing she put away those things which they ate and iniinit made trouble because of the stick which became a fish he again asked aponibolinayen how she made the stick into fish and aponibolinayen said do not trouble yourself perhaps you know about the rich woman who practices magic in kaodanan and iniinit said yes i know the rich woman who practices magic in kaodanan who sometimes has much power who changes who has no equal aponibolinayen said why do you still ask if you know i ask because i want to be sure even though i know you have much power said iniinit if that is true do not ask again she said not long after while they were talking they went to sleep and when it began to be early morning iniinit went to make the sun on all the world when they had finished to eat he went to shine aponibolinayen staid in the house when it came afternoon the sun went down and he went directly to fish in the river for the fish which they atethe two who were married not long after he caught again a big fish and he went home when he arrived aponibolinayen had finished cooking and he asked where she got the fish which she had cooked and she said why do you ask again you know it is the stick which i cook which is fish which we ate before you arrived again with fish throw away the fish which you caught for this stick is many fish which i cook after that iniinit said why do you order to throw away that which serves the purpose to which we put it even though you cook many sticks if you value it hang it on the hanger and you come and eat not long after they ate and when they had finished eating they washed and when they had finished washing those things which they used to eat on they talked and they went to sleep when it became the middle of the night aponibolinayen woke up i go up with you when you go up in the early morning she said iniinit said to her do not come for it is very hot up above you cannot endure the heat and you will repent when we are there no if it is too hot we shall take many blankets and pillows which i shall go under she said again and again until it became early morning then iniinit agreed they ate first and then they arranged those pillows and blankets which they took with them not long after they went east and when they arrived there the sun shone and aponibolinayen became oil because it was so hot and iniinit put her in a bottle and he corked it and covered it with blankets and pillows which sheltered her and he dropped it down she fell by the well in kaodanan and indipan who was still dipping water turned her face at the sound of the falling at her side she saw many good blankets and pillows and she unwrapped that which was wrapped and when she had finished to unwrap she saw it was a pretty ladynone equal to herand she was frightened she went quickly to go up to the town where they lived and when she arrived there she said to the people we have been searching a long time for aponibolinayen and you killed and used many cows as food for the searchers and you spent much for her she is at the spring i was frightened when she fell by me who was dipping water from the well i saw many pretty blankets and pillows and i unwrapped that which was wrapped and it was aponibolinayen whom we are seeking said indipan they went quicklyher father and motherand the other men went to see her and when they arrived at the place of the well they saw aponibolinayen whom they sought where did you come from aponibolinayen for whom we have been seeking we have invited many and have fed many to search for you among the towns there is not one we did not search for you and now you are here said her father and mother she said i came from pindayan i nearly did not come because the alzados 96 closed the way and i escaped while they slept not long after they went up to the town and not long after they went to wash their hair and bathe in the river and when they had finished washing their hair they went home ebang said ala husband pagatipnan let us make balaua 97 and invite our relatives who are sorrowing for aponibolinayen and pagatipnan said we shall make balaua when next month comes but now aponibolinayen feels ill perhaps she is tired not long after that aponibolinayen commanded them to prick her little finger which itched and when her mother pricked it out popped a pretty baby 98 her mother asked where did you get this baby aponibolinayen but aponibolinayen did not tell i do not know where i got it and i did not feel she said when they could not compel her to tell where she secured the baby ala we make balaua tomorrow said the father and mother they made balaua and not long after ebang used magic so that many people went to pound rice for them and when they had finished to pound rice they built balaua and they went to get the betelnut which is covered with gold for chewing when these arrived ebang oiled them when it began to get dark you betelnuts go to all the people in the whole world and invite them if any of them do not come you grow on their knees said ebang and those betelnuts went to invite all the people in the whole world every time they bathed the child they used magic so that it grew as often as they washed it until it walked the betelnuts arrived in the towns where they went to invite the one that went to nagbotobotnthe place where lived the old woman alokotnsaid good morning i do not tarry the reason of my coming is that ebang and pagatipnan commanded me because aponibolinayen is there yes you go first i will come i will follow you i go first to wash my hair and bathe she said the betelnut which is covered with gold said i wait for you for if you do not come i shall grow on your knee the old woman alokotn started when she finished washing her hair and bathing the betelnut which was covered with gold took her and not long after they arrived and they met those whom the other betelnuts went to summon in the other towns no one wanted the baby to go to them 99 and when none wished it to approach the old woman alokotn summoned the spirits what town did they not yet invite this question was added by the storyteller not part of tale the old woman alokotn said you invited all the people except iniinit who is above you did not send the prepared betelnut covered with gold to summon him perhaps he made aponibolinayen pregnant because the siksiklat took her up when they went to gather greensshe and her sisterinlaw who is dinay they commanded the betelnuts and they oiled them and sent them not long after the betelnut whom they sent arrived above who went to call iniinit and the betelnut said when he arrived good morning sun i do not tarry the reason of my visit is that ebang and pagatipnan who make balaua send me if you do not wish to come i will grow on your head the sun said grow on my head i do not wish to go the betelnut jumped up and went on his head and it grew not long after the betelnut became tall and the sun was not able to carry it because it became big and he was in pain you go to my pig that is what you grow on he said not long after the betelnut jumped on the head of his pig and the pig began to squeal because it could not carry the betelnut which began to grow on its head and iniinit said ala get off my big pig and i come the betelnut got off the pig not long after they went and pagatipnan carried the baby near to the gate when iniinit and the betelnut approached the baby was happy and he went to be carried by iniinit when they arrived at the festival place the people saw that he who carried the baby rolled because he was round and they saw he was not a man but a stone and ebang and pagatipnan said ala aponibolinayen you start and take off your arm beads and you dress in rags you wrap your wrists with strings in place of the arm beads so that you can go with the stone when he takes you to his home when our balaua is finished not long after aponibolinayen started she took off her beads and her dresses and exchanged them for rags and strings when she changed her dresses she went down the ladder and she saw that he who carried the baby was a stone which was round after that pagatipnan said ala now our balaua is finished you go home to the town of the stone aponibolinayen said yes if that is what you say those people who were invited bade them goodby and when they went away they went home alsothose whom they invited not long after they arrived at their home and the sun became a man he who had been a stone before when next month comes we shall build balaua aponibolinayen so that we can invite our relatives and i will pay the marriage price because i marry you 100 said iniinit to her soon the month arrived in which they said they would build balaua and they summoned the old woman alokotn to start the balaua not long after they sent to get bolo and lono 101 with which to make the dakidak and talapitap 102 when it became afternoon the old woman alokotn began to sing daeng 103 and the next night they sang daeng again not long after they commanded to pound rice and aponibolinayen used magic so that many women went to pound with them 104 and iniinit practiced magic so that they had many neighbors and many who went to pound rice with them soon they commanded to get the timbers for the balaua and they prepared everything which they needed when it became morning they built balaua and not long after they went to get the prepared betelnut which is covered with gold which they sent to invite their relatives 105 when they arrivedthose prepared betelnuts which were covered with goldthey oiled them at the beginning of the night and sent them to invite aponibolinayen said i will use magic so that you betelnut may reach the town of our relatives so that you invite all of them when there is one who will not come you grow on their knees as long as they do not come not long after they made libon 106 in the beginning of the night those betelnuts whom they sent to invite arrived those which they sent to invite their relatives they did not wish to go to make balaua the betelnuts who went to invite them said if you do not wish to come i will grow on your knee pagatipnan said you grow and the betelnut grew on his knee and it became high and he was in pain ala you get off my knee and you go on my pig he said and the betelnut went truly on his pig and it squealed you get off my pig and we will come he said and the betelnut truly got off the pig ala you who live in the same town you go and wash your hair and bathe and wash your clothes so that we can go to make sayang 107 with the stone and aponibolinayen here is a betelnut covered with gold which they send said pagatipnan and the people who lived in the same town washed their hair and bathed and they went to wash their clothes not long after it became afternoon and pagatipnan used magic so that cake and singed pig appeared which they were to take to those who make sayang which they exchanged with those who make sayang 108 not long after they arrived at the place of the gathering and aponibolinayen and iniinit went to make alawig 109 and when they had finished they brought them up to the town pagatipnan said i did not think that the stone which rolled could change when he came to make balaua with us ala now all you who have arrived rich men you divide the prepared betelnut which is covered with gold said iniinit not long after pagatipnan cut the betelnut and chewed and the quid of iniinit went to the quid of pagboksan and the quid of aponibolinayen went to the quid of pagatipnan 110 ala now that we have finished chewing i will give the payment for aponibolinayen and now that you have found out that i am your sonfather and motherlet us give the payment 111 said iniinit his father and mother said if that is what you say my child we will give and they gave him the name of aponitolau 112 and aponitolau said ala you play the gansa 113 so that we can dance when they played the gansa iwaginan took the alap and kinamayan 114 and he gave them to aponibolinayen and agyokan when aponibolinayen and agyokan had finished dancing they made aponitolau and asindamyan dance when aponitolau and asindamyan finished dancing he made to dance dinay of kabisilan who was the daughter of dalongan and also they made to dance kanag 115 who was the son of aponibolinayen and aponitolau when they finished to dance datalan and dalongan of kabisilan danced and when they finished to dance iwaginan made dagapan and indipan dance when they had finished dancing ginteban and agyokan were next and the beads of ginteban were jars which struck together while they danced next were iwaginan and kindiian who was the wife of ilwisan of dagapan and when they had all danced they stopped playing the gansa aponitolau gave the payment for aponibolinayen and it was the balaua nine times filled with jarsmalayo tadogan and ginlasan 116 and when he had given all the payment they played again on the gansas for one month and they danced when one month passed they went hometheir relatives whom they had invited they said ala now aponitolau and aponibolinayen since the day has arrived on which we go home do not detain us for we have been here for a month we go home to our town not long after they all went home and the father and mother of aponitolau took them home with them to kadalayapan and they took all their possessions from up above when they arrived in kadalayapan those who lived in the same town were surprised for aponitolau and aponibolinayen were there they went to see them and baloknag ie kanagtheir son was large it is said told by magwati a man of lagangilang abra 2 i am anxious to eat the mango fruit which belongs to algaba of dagla said aponibolinayen when she said this she was almost dying and she repeated it ala cousin dalongan you go and take cousin dinaogan and go and secure the mango fruit of algaba of dagla said aponibalagen why does aponibolinayen want the mango fruit of algaba of dagla does she not know that anyone who goes there cannot return asked dalongan ala you go and be careful and he will not hurt you said aponibalagen and dalongan went truly and started and aponibalagen gave dalongan a belt and earrings which he was to trade for the mango fruit and dalongan went to get dinaogan and he took an egg not long after they went and they held the egg all the time as they walked when they were in the middle of the way the egg hatched when they had almost arrived in dagla the chicken had become a rooster which could crow not long after they arrived at the spring of algaba of dagla and the people who dipped water from the spring were there you people who are dipping water from the spring where is a shallow place where we can cross where is the shallow place where we can cross you say rich men perhaps you are enemies said the women who were dipping water if we are enemies we would kill you said dalongan you see the shallow place where the people cross said the people who were dipping water from the well not long after they spread their belt on the water and they rode across when they arrived on the other side of the river they took a bath as soon as they finished bathing they went on top of a high stone and dried their bodies the water which dropped from their bodies became agates which have no holes through them and the women who were dipping water saw the agates which dropped from their bodies and they touched each other and said look at that when they put their clouts on they asked the women where is the road to the house of algaba of dagla you follow the sagang 117 they lead to his house and his balaua said the women who were dipping water from the well will one of you guide us to the house of our cousin algaba they said no because no one comes to get water unless all are together said the women not long after dalongan and his companion went up to the town and the defensive fence which was made of boa constrictors did not notice them for the snakes slept not long after they arrived at the balaua wes they said and the old woman alan 118 came to look at them through the window how are you she said do not go to the balaua because algaba can see you said the alan algaba was playing with his sweetheart in the other house when his sweetheart arrived from the well your big snakes which make the fence did not see the enemies who came inside of the town then algaba ran to his house and he was very angry when he saw the two men he went to get his headaxe and spear and when he took them down the weapons shed tears which were of oil what is the matter with my weapons that they weep oil perhaps these men are my relatives said the angry man he dropped them and when he took another set they shed bloody tears the two men went up into the kitchen of the house and algaba went there how do you do now he said still angry what do you want here what are you here for you ask and we came to buy the mango fruit for aponibolinayen who is nearly dead it is good that you came here said algaba but he was angry and the two men were frightened and they did not eat much as soon as they finished eating what do you want to pay said algaba they let him see the one earring of aponibolinayen i dont like that look at the yard of my house all the stones are gold said algaba when he did not want the earring they let him see the belt and algaba smiled how pretty it is i think the lady who owns this is much prettier he said to them ala you go and get two of the fruit so they went truly and dalongan went to climb and when he secured two mangoes he went down we go now i will go with you for i wish to see aponibolinayen said algaba he said to his mother alan you mother do not feel anxious concerning me while i am gone for i want to go and see the sick lady who so desires the mango fruit watch for enemies who come inside the town yes do not stay long said his mother alan not long after they went and when they were in the middle of the way algaba said is it far yet it is near now they answered i use my power so that the sick woman for whom they came to get fruit will feel very ill and nearly die said algaba to himself not long after truly they almost arrived when they reached the well he asked again is it still far but he knew that the well belonged to aponibolinayen it is near now she owns this well they said not long after they entered the gate of the town i use my power so that aponibolinayen will die he said and she truly died why is aponibolinayen dead the mango fruit which we went to get is worthless now they said perhaps she is the one they are wailing for said algaba of dagla when they reached the ladder the mango fruit which you went to get is no good at all said aponibalagen to them yes it is i came because i wish to see her said algaba of dagla if it is possible for you to bring her to life please do so said aponibalagen to him and took him inside of the house algaba looked at her and she was a lady without an equal for beauty not long after he took the body in his arms i use my power so that when i whip my perfume 119 kaladakad she will move directly he said and the body moved i use my power so that when i whip my perfume banawes she will say wes and she at once said wes i use my power so that when i whip my perfume she will wake up and she woke up wes how long my sleep was said aponibolinayen for she was alive again how long i sleep you say you have been dead said algaba and aponibolinayen looked at him and she it saw was not aponibalagen who held her in his arms why aponibalagen do you detest me another man is holding me she said and she arose from his arms because she was ashamed do not leave me lady you would have been dead a long time if i had not come said algaba and their rings exchanged of themselves while he was holding her and when aponibolinayen had regained her breath algaba divided the mango fruit into two parts and he gave to aponibolinayen but she did not want to take it for she was ashamed if you do not wish to eat this fruit which i give you you cannot go to anyone but me said algaba and aponibalagen left them alone not long after aponibolinayen could sit up straight and she wanted to leave algaba but he took her when aponibolinayen looked at her ring she saw it was not her own why have i another ring she asked and she caught the hand of algaba for he wanted to take her give me my ring it is not good for you for it looks like copper take your ring for it is really gold said aponibolinayen no this is good for i did not take it from your finger the spirits wanted it to come to my finger our rings are both gold but they are different colors he said let us chew betelnut for it is bad for us to talk when we do not know each others names it is not my custom to chew betelnut said aponibolinayen then you learn said algaba not long after he made her chew and he gave to her now lady whom i visit you tell your name first he said no because i am ashamed as a woman to tell my name first not long after he said my name is algaba of dagla i have looked in all parts of the world for a wife but i did not find anyone like you and now i have found you and i want you to be married to me my name is aponibolinayen of kaodanan sister of aponibalagen who are son and daughter of ebang and pagboksan said aponibolinayen not long after they laid down their quids and they were rows of agate beads which have no holes algaba said it is good for us to be married so they were married and they went to dagla as soon as they arrived in dagla mother he said to his mother alan now we are going to take you to kadalayapan because i have found a wife no said the alan we must first build balaua here that is good if it is what you desire said algaba not long after aponibolinayen commanded people to pound rice and others to get betelnuts which were covered with gold so they truly made sayang 120 not long after when it became evening they made libon the best for us to do is to invite aponibalagen and all the people of kadalayapan and some other places said algaba not long after they sent the betelnuts which were covered with gold to invite their relatives some of the betelnuts they sent to kaodanan sir come to dagla because aponibolinayen and algaba build balaua said the betelnut to aponibalagen when the other betelnuts arrived at kadalayapan to invite the people they said to langaan come to dagla because aponibolinayen and algaba make balaua not long after aponibalagen and aponigawani and the other people went when they reached the middle of the way they met the people of kadalayapan so they were a large party who went when they arrived at dagla at the place where the spring is they saw that all the stones by the river were gold and they were surprised and the people who were dipping water from the spring were there you people who are dipping water where is the shallow place for us to cross they said you look for the place where the people go across said the people who were dipping water not long after they went across the river as soon as they reached the other side of the river they took a bath the women who were dipping water saw that the water which ran from their bodies were agates which had no holes how wonderful are the people who live in kadalayapan and kaodanan for they are relatives of kaboniyan 121 and they have power said the women who were dipping water from the well you people who are dipping water where is the trail which leads to the house of algaba of dagla they said follow the head poles they are along the road to his house said the women who were dipping water so they went up truly to the town and the boa constrictors which made the fence around the town did not move when they passed for they were afraid and when they arrived at the house of algaba the alan danced when they sat down pagatipnan was in a hurry ala langaan let us go and give the betelnut which is covered with gold to algaba he said and they went truly they told algaba that they were going to chew betelnut because they wished to learn if they were relatives and algaba said that is good and they called aponigawani to the house and they cut the betelnut in pieces as soon as they cut it in pieces the best way to do is for you to tell your name first because we came to visit you said pagatipnan to algaba no old man you tell your name first said algaba not long after my name is pagatipnan who am the lakay 122 of kadalayapan not long after my name is pagboksan who is the father of aponibalagen of kaodanan not long after my name is algaba who is the son of an alan who has deformed feet 123 who has no sister we are not like you people who have power said algaba not long after my name is aponibalagen of kaodanan who is the son of ebang and pagboksan not long after my name is aponigawani of kadalayapan who has no brother so that when some enemies come into our town i dress in the bark of trees not long after my name is aponibolinayen who is the sister of aponibalagen as soon as they told their names they laid down their betelnut quids the quids of algaba and aponigawani both went to the quid of pagatipnan also the quids of aponibalagen and aponibolinayen went to the quid of pagboksan then aponigawani stood up you are so strange algaba you are my brother i am so glad that i have a brother now you are bad for you let the enemies come into kadalayapan she said excuse me for i was far from kadalayapan and did not see it is our custom for some of us to go to fight said algaba the best way to do aponitolau 124 is for you to go back with us to kadalayapan said aponigawani if that is what you wish it is all right he said not long after the balaua was finished and they took them to kadalayapan the valuable things which the alan owned she gave to them and she flew away when they arrived in kadalayapan aponibalagen wanted to marry aponigawani he sent his mother to go and give the message as soon as she arrived in kadalayapan good morning nephew aponitolau said ebang good morning what are you here for said aponitolau what are you coming for you say aponibalagen sent me to talk to you for he wishes to marry aponigawani she said if you think it is good it will be all right said aponitolau so she took out the engagement gift and she put one earring inside of a little jar and it was filled with gold aponitolau lifted his eyebrows and half of the gold disappeared so ebang put another earring in the pot and it was full again ala when it becomes evening you come and bring aponibalagen he said to ebang yes she said so she went home as soon as she arrived in their house in kaodanan aponibalagen asked the result of her trip they agreed all right we will go when it becomes evening said ebang when it became night they went to kadalayapan and he lived with aponigawani when it became morning he took aponigawani to kaodanan and the father and mother of aponigawani and the other people followed them they went to get the marriage payment it was the balaua filled nine times with jars as soon as they gave all the payment aponitolau was the next to make his payment it was also the balaua filled nine times as soon as they made all the payment they went home told by mano a woman of patok 3 i am going to wash my hair give me the rice straw which has been inherited nine times said aponitolau to his mother langaan so langaan gave him some and he went to the river to wash as soon as he arrived at the well he saw the pretty girl who was washing her hair he went and sat down on her skirt and the pretty girl told him not to cut her in many places so she would not need to doctor the wounds if i were an old enemy i would have killed you at the first it is bad for us to talk when we do not know each others names let us chew betelnut said aponitolau no for it is not my custom said the girl but aponitolau compelled her to chew betelnut with him you tell your name first he said to her no it is not good for me to tell my name first for i am a woman you are a man you tell your name first so aponitolau said my name is aponitolau of kadalayapan who am the son of langaan and pagatipnan who came here to wash my hair it is good fortune for me that i met you here washing your hair my name is gimbangonan of natpangan who am the daughter of ittonagan who is the sister of aldasan as soon as she told her name she disappeared and went to hide among the betel nuts on the branch of a tree so aponitolau was very sorry and he went back home without washing his hair as soon as he arrived where langaan was sitting he said to her mother when i arrived at the well by the river i met a pretty girl whose name was gimbangonan the daughter of ittonagan of natpangan we chewed betelnuts and told our names but as soon as she told her name she disappeared and i could not see her she said that she lived in natpangan i want to marry her will you go and arrange the paklon 125 so langaan went at once and got her hat which was as large as the salakasak 126 for she saw that aponitolau was sorrowful when she took her hat it clucked 127 why does my hat cluck when i take it down i think they do not like you aponitolau said langaan no you go and try so langaan went again to get her hat and again it clucked but nevertheless she took it and went when she was in the middle of the way the head of the hat which was like a bird swung and made langaan turn her head and it clucked again langaan sat down by the trail and wondered what would happen not long after she went on again and she met asindamyan near the ford she asked where the ford was and when asindamyan told her she spread her belt on the water and it ferried her across not long after she reached the other side of the river and she inquired for the house of gimbangonan asindamyan answered you look for the house where many people are putting props under the house that is the house of gimbangonan her porch has many holes in it when langaan arrived at the house she said good afternoon and ittonagan and gimbangonan answered good afternoon they invited her to go up into the house and she went why do you come here aunt said gimbangonan i came to arrange for you to marry aponitolau for he wants to marry you and has sent me to talk about the paklon gimbangonan was very happy and said to her mother you tell him yes for i wish to marry aponitolau so ittonagan agreed to the marriage and langaan asked how much the marriage price would be the regular custom of the people with magical power which is the balaua nine times full said aldasan because ittonagan was always restless and was walking outside the house so langaan left a little jar and agate bead as a sign of the engagement for gimbangonan not long after she went back home to kadalayapan when she arrived where aponitolau was lying down she said wes for she was tired and aponitolau heard her and he went and inquired what was the matter his mother answered that they had agreed on the marriage and the next day he could go and marry gimbangonan as soon as the next day came they prepared jars of basi 128 and pigs to be carried to natpangan and aponitolau carried one large empty jar 129 so they went as soon as they arrived aponitolau asked where gimbangonan was and the people said look at the big woman he looked and saw that she was a very big woman and aponitolau cried for she was not the girl he had seen before and he bent his head while the old men were talking to each other gimbangonan said to aponitolau come here aponitolau be very happy why do you bend your head aponitolau did not listen and he did not go not long after langaan and the others went back home and left aponitolau to be joined to gimbangonan aponitolau was afraid to go to gimbangonan for she was a very big woman she called to him all the time but he did not go to her ittonagan was restless and did not stay in the house even in the night and they could not sleep after ten days aponitolau said i am going to kadalayapan for a little while i will return soon if you go to kadalayapan i will go with you she said do not go this time and i will take you next time he said and he went when he was near the gate of the town of kadalayapan he hung his head until he reached his house his mother asked why he hung his head i do not wish to marry gimbangonan for she is not the woman i met by the river do not be angry with me for i did what you wished i would not have engaged you to gimbangonan if you had not sent me they sent their liblibayan 130 to go and get betelnuts which were covered with gold for they intended to make sayang so that they could find out who the woman was who had been by the river soon the liblibayan returned and they said we did not get the betelnuts which you desired for we found a pretty toy among the branches of the tree aponitolau took the branch of the tree which shone as if covered with fire and he put a blanket on it and many pillows around it as soon as they had again commanded the liblibayan to get the betelnuts they went and soon they arrived with the fruit they oiled the betelnuts and sent them to every place in the world and if anyone refused to come they were to grow on their knees not long after the betelnuts went to the different towns and invited all the people when they arrived they danced and aponitolau looked at them to see if the woman he met at the river was there but she was not among them and he wondered what had become of the woman for the betelnuts had gone to all parts of the world aponitolau went into the house for he was sorrowful and he laid down near the blankets and he noticed that the blankets appeared as if on fire and he was frightened 131 he got up and unwrapped the blankets and he saw a pretty girl i did not think you were here i have been engaged you said your name was gimbangonan and i sent my mother to engage me to you but when i saw gimbangonan she was a big woman so i left her and came here to make balaua so i might find you you cannot escape from me now for i shall hold your hand let us chew betelnut so they chewed and aponitolau said my name is aponitolau of kadalayapan who is the son of langaan and pagboksan to whom you told a lie for you said you were gimbangonan and now i want to know your real name my name is aponibolinayen of natpangan who is the daughter of ebang and pagatipnan when they had told their names they saw that they were related and that they both possessed magical power so they were married after three days aponitolau said to aponibolinayen wait for me in the house do not be lonesome for our mother is here i am going to see my pasture do not stay long said aponibolinayen if anyone comes you hide in the house said aponitolau not long after he went and when he arrived in the pasture all the jars went around him and all the jars stuck out their tongues for they were very hungry for they had not been fed for a long time the jars were somadag ginlasan malayo and tadogan and other kinds also 132 when aponitolau thought that all the jars had arrived where he was he fed them with betelnut first covered with lawed 133 leaves as soon as he had fed them he gave them some salt not long after he went back home and he rode on a carabao when he arrived at their house he called to aponibolinayen but no one answered him and he was surprised so he hurried to the house and he saw that aponibolinayen was dead and he was grieved he took her in his lap and while her body was in his lap it began to sweat he used his power so that when he whipped 134 his perfume banawes she said wes when he whipped his perfume dagimonau she awoke when he whipped his perfume alikadakad she stood up and said i told you not to go aponitolau but you went anyway a big woman came here and stole all my things and killed me i dont know who she was aponitolau called his mother and asked who it was and his mother replied that it was gimbangonan so aponitolau went to natpangan why did you go to kill aponibolinayen i went to kill her for you do not care for me any more i do not like you for you are a very big woman every time you step the floor is broken if you come again to kadalayapan i will cut your head off do not come again to harm aponibolinayen he went home to kadalayapan and he divorced gimbangonan not long after they went to the pasture and they rode on the back of a carabao as soon as they arrived all the jars rolled around them and stuck out their tongues and aponibolinayen was afraid for she feared the jars would eat them the wide field was full of jars aponitolau gave them betelnut and lawed vine and salt as soon as they fed them they went back home not long after aponibolinayen said to aponitolau we are going to natpangan to visit my father and mother so they went as soon as they arrived there aponibolinayen told her father and mother that aponitolau had a pasture filled with many different kinds of jars in the place of kabinalan when they had been in natpangan ten days they returned home and aponibolinayens father and mother went with them and saw the jars when they reached the field where the jars were they were afraid that the jars would eat them but aponitolau fed them the father and mother of aponibolinayen were surprised for there were many valuable jars which filled the wide field of kabinalan not long after they went back home to natpangan told by angtan a woman of lagangilang 4 sinogyaman come and oil my hair so that i can go to war said aponitolau and you sinagayan put some rice in the pot and cook it and also some fish for us to eat not long after she cooked and sinogyaman oiled his hair when sinagayan finished cooking they ate and started to go to gegenawan where asibowan lived sinogyaman and sinagayan did not want him to go but aponitolau went anyway when he arrived at the edge of the town he stood still a long time for he did not know the way to gegenawan a bird went to him and said why do you stand here for a long time aponitolau why do you stand a long time you say and i am going to the town of asibowan whom every one says is a pretty girl said aponitolau to the bird ala aponitolau it is best for you to follow me and i will show you the way to the place where asibowan lives not long after they went and they soon arrived at the town of gegenawan ala aponitolau i leave you now for i have showed you the way said the bird so aponitolau went alone to the house of asibowan when he reached the ladder of her house asibowan was looking out of the window and she said oh there is a rich gentleman how are you where are you going aponitolau said i am going to nagsingkawan but i have lost my way and i thought that this was nagsingkawan i saw this house so i came to get a drink this is not nagsingkawan come up and i will cook and we will eat aponitolau went up into the house and the girl gave him water to drink she cooked and then she called him i do not want to eat yet i will rest for awhile and eat when your husband comes said aponitolau not long after while they were talking he saw asibowan break the fish stick and put it in the pot and he watched to see what would become of the stick he saw that it became a fish 135 she called often for aponitolau to come and eat and he went and he said i want to wait until your husband comes for it is not good for us to eat first and it is not good for us to be eating when he arrives come it will be all right we will eat now and he can eat when he comes said asibowan so he went to eat with her for he was very hungry he saw that she took all the rice and fish out of the pots and there were only dishes for them what is the matter with this woman that she does not leave any fish for her husband he said to himself while they were eating asibowan told him that she did not have a husband and aponitolau smiled when they finished eating they cut betelnut for them to chew now be patient for we must chew betelnut for it is not good for us to talk until we know each others names asibowan said how can we chew betelnut for i do not chew for i am related to kaboniyan 136 you must chew anyway for we cannot tell our names unless we chew said aponitolau when aponitolau urged her a long time she took the betelnut and they chewed since you are the lady who lives here it is best that you tell your name first said aponitolau no it is not good for a woman to tell her name first so you must tell your name said asibowan not long after my name is aponitolau of kadalayapan who is the son of langaan and pagatipnan who goes to find a pretty girl who has power like me said aponitolau my name is asibowan of gegenawan who lives alone in the field who has no neighbors for this is my fortune said asibowan so aponitolau staid with her nine months and his father and mother were searching for him they had many people searching for him and they killed many animals to feed the people until all their animals were gone the bones which they threw away made a pile nine times as large as the balaua asibowan became pregnant and not long after she gave birth what shall we call our girl said aponitolau we will call her binaklingan when asibowan bathed the baby it grew one span for she used magical power so the baby grew one span every time 137 not long after she could walk aponitolau saw the pile of bones which the searchers had thrown away when they ate and it was nine times larger than the balaua the best thing for us to do asibowan is for us to go to kadalayapan for my father and mother are still searching for me and the people who are searching are eating all their animals the best thing for you to do is to go home and find a woman whom you should marry and then when you are married you make sayang 138 and i will come to kadalayapan said asibowan for it was not good for them to be married because she had less magical power than aponitolau if you do not wish to go i will take our daughter binaklingan wait awhile until we have commanded that a house be built for her to live in not long after they commanded that a house be made for binaklingan and it was all of gold it was finished in the middle of the night and she used magic so that the golden house went to kadalayapan when aponitolau woke up early in the early morning he heard many roosters crowing and many people talking my daughter binaklingan how bad your mother is for she sent us here to kadalayapan without telling us said aponitolau his daughter was very sorry but she played on the pan pipe when it was morning langaan saw the golden house by their house why there is a different house here i think aponitolau has arrived and maybe he is in that house said langaan to pagboksan 139 and pagboksan went outdoors are you here aponitolau we had sought you for a long time but did not find you none of our animals are left alive said pagboksan why did you search for me i told sinogyaman and sinagayan that i was going to fight did they not tell you said aponitolau we thought that you encountered our old dangerous enemies for you have been away many months why do you have a daughter who is a young girl yes binaklingan who is here is my daughter and her mother asibowan with whom i lived for a long time did not want to come here to kadalyapan for she said i must find a girl suitable for me to marry and then we must make balaua so that she will come to our town when they had been in kadalayapan five days they went to take a walk in the evening of the sixth day and they went to the spring of lisnyan as soon as he arrived at the spring he used magic so that all the pretty girls who never go outdoors felt hot and went to the spring to bathe 140 not long after aponibolinayen felt very hot and she went to take a bath at the spring aponitolau saw her taking a bath and she looked like the half of a rainbow and aponitolau went to her and aponibolinayen saw him while she was bathing do not wound me in more than one place so i will not have so much to cure if i was an enemy i would have killed you at once said aponitolau soon he cut a betelnut into two pieces it is best for us to chew betelnut for it is bad for us to talk when we do not know each others names aponibolinayen did not wish to chew but when aponitolau urged her she chewed and they told their names my name is aponitolau of kadalayapan who is the son of pagboksan and langaan my name is aponibolinayen of kaodanan who is the sister of aponibalagen who put me at the place close to the spring of lisnyan for he does not wish anyone to see me but you have found me not long after while they were talking aponibolinayen used magic so that she vanished and she went among the betelnuts on the branch of the tree where did the girl go i did not see her when she vanished said aponitolau to himself not long after he went home with his head bent for he was very sorrowful when he arrived at their house why are you bending your head aponitolau said his mother what are you bending your head for you say and i went to the well of lisnyan and talked with aponibolinayen but after a while she vanished and i could not see her anymore did you not give her any betelnut asked his mother yes i did what are you so sorry for if you gave her betelnut you will find her bye and bye said his mother on the second night he went again to lisnyan and he used his power so that all the young girls were hot again so that they went to the spring when he looked up where there were many betelnuts he saw aponibolinayen taking a bath i did not see you when you left me aponibolinayen said aponitolau now i am going to take you home no do not take me for my brother will hate me i do not want to go to your house he took her to his town of kadalayapan and he sent his mother to natpangan to tell aponibalagen that aponibolinayen was in kadalayapan not long after his mother langaan took her skirt and her hat which was like a bird and when she arrived at the gate of kaodanan sinogyaman was dipping water from the spring niece sinogyaman where is the ford look there at the shallow place for it is the ford she took off her belt and she spread it on the water and she rode on it to the other side and then she took a bath when she finished bathing she stood on a high stone and the drops of water from her body were agate beads with no holes how strange the people of kadalayapan are they are very different from us said the women who were dipping water from the spring not long after langaan put on her skirt and when she finished she said are you not finished dipping water sinogyaman i want you to guide me to the house of my nephew aponibalagen for i have forgotten the way for i have not been here for a long time no i am not through but i will show you the way aunt said sinogyaman and she guided her when they reached the yard of aponibalagen good morning nephew good morning aunt he said to her come up not long after she went up the stairs what are you coming here for aunt what are you coming here for you say i come because i wish to see you not long after he went to get basi and he had made her drink when they had drunk she said the other reason i came here nephew aponibalagen is that aponitolau sent me for he wishes to marry your sister i have no sister i do not know what my mother did with her he replied we have no daughter aponibalagen is our only child said ebang while they were still talking they kept on drinking the basi when the old woman langaan became drunk she told them that aponibolinayen was in kadalayapan and aponibalagen was surprised and his heart jumped i went to hide aponibolinayen in lisnyan so that no one would see her but now someone has found her so langaan gave them the engagement present 141 and she asked how much they must pay as the marriage price you must fill the balaua nine times they answered so langaan filled the balaua nine times with different kinds of valuable things as soon as she had paid the marriage price she went back home when she arrived in kadalayapan and reached the top of the ladder of the house she laid down and slept for she was drunk how strange you act mother why dont you tell us the news before you sleep said aponitolau and she said the engagement and marriage gifts were accepted in the afternoon they began to make sayang 142 not long after the old woman alokotn who conducted the sayang and made them dance daeng 143 arrived and she began to perform the ceremony when it became morning you people who live with us come and pound rice said aponibolinayen so the people gathered and pounded rice for them as soon as they finished pounding rice she commanded her liblibayan 144 to go and get betelnuts when they arrived with the betelnuts you betelnuts come and oil yourselves and go to invite all our relatives for we are making sayang invite all the people except the old enemies she said and when it became evening they made libon 145 asibowan was anxious to chew betelnut and she went to search for one in the corner of her house and she found an oiled nut which was covered with gold when she tried to cut it in two it said to her do not cut me for i came to invite people to attend the sayang of aponitolau and aponibolinayen and asibowan said i cannot go if you do not come i will grow on your knee said the betelnut no go on my big pig so the betelnut jumped on the head of her pig and it grew very high and the pig squealed get off from my pig and i will come said asibowan late in the afternoon they saw her below the talagan 146 asibowan is here now aponibolinayen come and see her said aponitolau so aponibolinayen came and she took her to their house and iwaginan took two skirts and he made them dance he danced first with asibowan before he made the others dance and his wife gimbagonan was jealous when they finished dancing he gave the skirts to aponibalagen and sinagayan as soon as aponibalagen had finished iwaginan made aponitolau dance with gimbagonan while they were dancing gimbagonan danced to the sound of the jars which she had about her neck and in her hair ie she had necklaces of big jars and they stuck together so she could not hear the gansas not long after asibowan wished to go back home now i am going home aponibolinayen for no one is watching my house no do not go yet for someone wants to marry your daughter binaklingan i must go now you take care of her so she went back home and they did not see her as soon as the sayang was over dinaogan was engaged to binaklingan soon he paid the marriage price and it was the balaua filled nine times with valuable things not long after all the people went back to their homes and aponibalagen was left alone and he acted as if he was drunk but he was not drunk he laid down in the balaua and aponibolinayen covered him with blankets not long after aponigawani went outdoors for she felt hot and aponibalagen peeped at her not long after she went inside of the house and went into the ninth room and aponibalagen watched her when it became night aponibalagen went to the place where she was and aponitolau did not see him so he looked for her in the ninth room and she was playing the pan pipe while she was playing she saw a firefly and she tried to hit it with her pan pipe and aponibalagen said do not strike me or you will hit my headaxe and he became a man again how did you get in here said aponigawani i came because i saw you when i was lying in the balaua he sat down beside her and tried to cut a betelnut for her to chew we will chew betelnut so we can tell our names said aponibalagen she took the betelnut and they chewed you tell your name first for you live here no it is not good for me to tell my name first for i am a woman you are the first my name is aponibalagen who is the brother of aponibolinayen who is the son of pagboksan of kaodanan my name is aponigawani who is the sister of aponitolau who is the daughter of pagatipnan and langaan when they had been in the room nine nights aponitolau went to see aponigawani and when he got to the room aponibalagen was there why are you here brotherinlaw said aponitolau i am here because i wish to marry your sister said aponibalagen if you want to marry her you must engage her and you come another day to make paklon 147 not long after aponibalagen went home and told his father and mother that they would go next day to make the paklon so he could marry aponigawani aponitolau and his father and mother went to kaodanan and took the marriage price before aponibalagen and his people made the paklon aponibalagen paid the same as aponitolau did for aponibolinayen not long after they returned to kadalayapan and the next day aponibalagen went and got aponigawani they danced for one month and then they took aponigawani to kaodanan and all the people went home this is all told by lagmani a woman of patok 5 mother dinawgan go and engage me to someone for i want to be married i like the sister of aponibalagen of natpangan said gawigawen of adasin yes said his mother so she took her hat which looked like the moonbeam and she started to go and when she arrived in natpangan she said good morning nephew aponibalagen what do you want here aunt he replied what do you want you say and i want to talk with you come up aunt and we will hear what you have to say so he asked his mother ebang to prepare food as soon as ebang had prepared the food and called them to eat aponibalagen went to get the basi and they drank before they ate and ebang broke up the fish stick and put it in the pot and it became fish 148 not long after they ate and when they had finished aponibalagen said to dinawgan come and see this no i better stay here when aponibalagen urged her she came in and he opened the basi jar which was nine times inherited and as soon as they had drank dinawgan said that she could not tarry for it was afternoon i have something to tell you aponibalagen what is it said aponibalagen my son gawigawen of adasin wants to marry your sister aponibalagen agreed so she gave a golden cup which looked like the moon as an engagement present and they agreed on a day for paklon 149 aponibalagen said tomorrow will be the day for paklon dinawgan went home did they accept our golden cup which looks like the moon mother asked gawigawen yes tomorrow will be the paklon said the mother not long after she said all you people who live in the same town with us prepare to go to the paklon of gawigawen in natpangan tomorrow afternoon the people agreed and in the morning they truly started and they went you my jar bilibili which always salutes the visitors go first and you my jar ginlasan follow and you malayo and tadogan and you gumtan 150 so they went first to natpangan and gawigawen and the people followed them and also eighteen young girls who were gawigawens concubines went also not long after they arrived in natpangan and iwaginan and the other people went to attend the paklon and also many people from the other towns when all whom they had invited arrived they agreed how much gawigawen should pay for his wife aponibalagen told them to fill the balaua 151 eighteen times with valuable things so the balaua was filled not long after they ate and when they had finished they went to the yard and they played on gansas and danced iwaginan took the skirts and gave one to nagtenngaeyan of kapanikiyan and they danced 152 when she danced she looked like the spindle she did not go around but always moving and the water from the river went up into the town and the striped fishes bit her heels not long after they stopped dancing and gimbagonan was jealous and she said ala give me the skirt and i will dance next do not say that gimbagonan for it is shameful for us he answered her not long after he gave the cloth to dakandokan of pakapsowan she danced with algaba of dagala not long after they finished dancing and iwaginan made aponibolinayen and balogaygayan dance he often went to fight in the enemies towns not long after aponibolinayen went down from the house and the sunshine vanished when she appeared she danced with balogaygayan and when she moved her feet the water from the river went up again into the town and the fish bit at her heels as they did before after they stopped iwaginan made his wife gimbagonan dance and she was happy when she danced with aponibalagen when they danced the big jars around gimbagonans neck made more noise than the gansas and the jars said kitol kitol kanitol inka inka inkantol as soon as they finished dancing the people said the best thing to do is to go home for we have been here three months now we will take aponibolinayen said dinawgan to the people who lived in the same town with her and she spoke to aponibalagen so they prepared rice and coconut soaked together and wrapped in leaves and a cake made of rice flour and coconut shaped like a tongue a rice cake which was fried for aponibolinayens provision on the road you who live in the other towns who were invited do not go home yet for we are going to take aponibolinayen to adasin said aponibalagen soon it became morning and they all went to adasin and gimbagonan carried two big baskets of cakes and while they were walking she ate all the time and she ate half of them when they arrived at the spring of gawigawen of adasin they were surprised for it was very beautiful and its sands were of beads and the grass they used to clean pots with was also beads and the place where the jars sat was a big dish 153 go and tell gawigawen that he must come here and bring an old man for i am going to take his head and make a spring for aponibolinayen said aponibalagen so someone went and told gawigawen to bring the old man taodan with him to the spring so aponibalagen cut off his head and he made a spring and the water from it bubbled up and the body became a big tree called alangigan 154 which used to shade aponibolinayen when she went to the spring to dip water and the blood of the old man was changed to valuable beads not long after they went up to the town and the place where they walkedfrom the spring to the ladder of the housewas all big plates gimbagonan sat below the house ladder because they were afraid the house could not hold her for she was a big woman and she hated them and she said to iwaginan why do you put me here we put you there because we are afraid that you will break the house and give a bad sign to the boy and girl who are to be married 155 aponibolinayen covered her face all of the time and she sat down in the middle of the house for indipan said that she must not uncover her face for her husband gawigawen had three noses and she was afraid to look at him 156 but gawigawen was a handsome man aponibolinayen believed what indipan had told her not long after dinawgan spread the string of agate beads along the floor where aponibolinayen sat 157 after a month they were still there and the people from the other towns wished to go home and aponibalagen said to aponibolinayen ala be good to your husband and uncover your face we are going back home now but aponibolinayen would not uncover her face not long after all the people went back to their towns and aponibolinayens motherinlaw commanded her to go and cook she did not uncover her face but always felt when she went about and when she had cooked she refused to eat but gawigawen and his father and mother ate when gawigawen went to aponibolinayen at night she changed to oil and she did that every night and they put the carabao hides under her mat so the oil would not drop to the ground on the fifth night she used magic so that they could not see her go out and she dropped her beads under the house and then she became oil and dropped her body so she went away and always walked and gawigawen looked for her for a long time he went to natpangan for he could not find her in any of the towns when aponibolinayen was in the middle of the jungle she met a wild rooster which was crowing where are you going aponibolinayen it said to her why are you walking in the middle of the jungle and aponibolinayen said i came here for i am running away from my husband for i do not want to be married to him for he has three noses no gawigawen is a handsome man i often see him for this is where he comes often to snare chickens do not believe what indipan said to you for she is crazy said the rooster not long after she walked on and she reached the place of many big trees and the big monkey met her and said where are you going aponibolinayen and she answered where are you going you say i am running away because i do not want to marry gawigawen why dont you wish to marry gawigawen because indipan told me he has three noses the monkey laughed and said do not believe that indipan wants to marry gawigawen herself he is a handsome man aponibolinayen walked on and soon she reached a wide field and she did not know where she was she stopped in the middle of the field and she thought she would go on to the other side not long after she reached the ocean and she sat down on a log and a carabao came along it passed often where she sat aponibolinayen thought she would ride on the carabao and she got on its back and it took her to the other side of the ocean when they reached the other side aponibolinayen saw a big orange tree with much fruit on it the carabao said wait here while i eat grass and i will return soon aponibolinayen said yes but the carabao went to the place of the man who owned him and said come over here for there is a good toy for you and kadayadawan of pintagayan said what is it come hurry said the carabao so he combed his hair and oiled it and put on his striped coat and his clout and belt and he took his spear and he rode on the carabaos back not long after kadayadawan saw the pretty girl in the orange tree and he said how pretty she is and the carabao said that is the toy i told you about when they reached the orange tree aponibolinayen heard him when he stuck his spear in the ground and she looked down and saw a handsome man good morning lady he said good morning answered aponibolinayen not long after they chewed betelnut and they told their names my name is kadayadawan of pintagayan who is the son of an alan 158 my name is aponibolinayen of natpangan who is the daughter of pagboksan and ebang who is the sister of aponibalagen their betelnut quids became agate beads and kadayadawan said to her ala it is good for us to marry i am going to take you home so he took her to his home and he was good to his carabao because it had found him a pretty woman when they reached the house he put her in a room and the ati 159 commanded the soldiers to call kadayadawan when they reached the yard of kadayadawans house they called good morning and he looked out of the window and said what do you want we came because the king wants you and we came to get you so they started and went when they arrived where the king was why kadayadawan have you a pretty girl in your house every night i notice that your house appears as if it were burning no i have not answered kadayadawan i think you have for i notice the flames every night no i have not where would i find a pretty woman 160 not long after he went back home when he reached home aponibolinayen said to him it is best for us to make sayang 161 and kadayadawan asked how do we make sayang by ourselves our neighbors are all soldiers do not worry about that i will see said aponibolinayen not long after kadayadawan took the betelnuts and they oiled them and they sent them to the towns of their relatives to invite them to their balaua the betelnuts went aponibolinayen told kadayadawan to go and get molave sticks when he arrived with them aponibolinayen used magic and she said i use magic so that when i thrust the molave stick in the ground it will become a balaua not long after the stick became a balaua the betelnuts arrived in natpangan and said to aponibalagen we came to call you for kadayadawan of pintagayan is making balaua aponibalagen said how can we attend the balaua when we are searching for my sister if you do not wish to come i will grow on your knee go on my pig so the betelnut grew on the pig and it was so high the pig could not carry it and it squealed very much ala get off from the pig and we will come so the betelnut got off and they started all you people who live in the same town come with me to attend the balaua of kadayadawan of pintagayan so they went they arrived at the same time as gawigawen of adasin and they met near to the river not long after kadayadawan saw them by the river and he sent the betelnuts to carry the people across the river when they were in the middle of the river kadayadawan used his power so that their old clothes which they wore in mourning for aponibolinayen were taken off from them and they were surprised for they did not know when their old clothes had been taken off when they reached the other side aponibalagen said to the people who lived with kadayadawan we are ashamed to come up into the town for we have no clothes then the betelnuts told kadayadawan and he said ala go and tell them that i will come and bring some clothes for them not long after he arrived where they were and he gave them some clothes to use ala take these clothes and use them and come up to the town but aponibalagen and his companions were ashamed kadayadawan urged them until they accepted the clothes soon they reached the town and they danced and iwaginan and nagtenngeyan danced again and the water from the river went up into the town and the fish bit her feet not long after that they stopped dancing and iwaginan made gawigawen and aponibolinayen dance while they were dancing gawigawen watched aponibolinayen and when they had danced around nine times gawigawen seized her and put her in his belt 162 why do you do that gawigawen said kadayadawan to him and he threw his spear and gawigawen fell down and aponibolinayen escaped and kadayadawan put her in a room as soon as he put her in the room he went to bring gawigawen back to life not long after he revived him why did you do that gawigawen i did not steal aponibolinayen from you and gawigawen said even if you did steal aponibolinayen from me she was my wife and i could not find her until now that is why i put her in my belt and aponibalagen knows that she is my wife and kadayadawan said she is my wife now not long after the alan who took care of kadayadawan told langaan kadayadawan is your son i picked him up when he was only blood which fell from you 163 why do you say that you are not my mother said kadayadawan to the alan langaan said to the alan it is good if he is my son they were very happy and they said to aponibalagen now we will pay the marriage price and also the price which gawigawen paid before we will repay to him aponibalagen agreed you fill my balaua nine times with valuable things not long after they filled the balaua nine times with valuable things and they repaid gawigawen what he had paid when he married aponibolinayen when they had paid they danced again ala now we must go home for we have staid here a month said the people from the other towns so they went home and they took aponibolinayens marriage price ala now my cousin alan we are going to take aponitolau 164 home for you have said he is our son and the alan said yes take all of my things i took him for i had no children to inherit my possessions so they took them to kadalayapan the alan went to the other part of the world and langaan used magic so that the golden house which the alan gave to aponitolau went to their town of kadalayapan not long after the golden house arrived and the people were surprised when they woke up in the morning and saw the big golden house not long after aponitolau and aponibolinayen and their father arrived there told by magwati of lagangilang 6 there was a woman whose name was ginambo of gonigonan who went to fight aponibolinayen of kaodanan when she reached the place where the spring was she said you people who are dipping water from the spring whose place is this where the spring is it belongs to aponibolinayen of kaodanan they said and when they went up to the town they raised a clamor what are you so noisy about you women who are like me said aponibolinayen you ask why we are noisy because there are many women who have come to fight against you at the place where the spring is they said and aponibolinayen hurried to take her spear what are you so noisy for women like aponibolinayen asked her father pagatipnan what are we noisy about you ask because there are many of my enemies at the spring do not go aponibolinayen for i will go no for you are weak what can you do now once you did kill people in the place where the spring is and now perhaps it is my fortune she said and she went to the spring she looked down and truly the enemies looked like many locusts about the spring ala said ginambo of gonigonan you people who live with me you are anxious to carry away this woman whom we do not like yes they answered but only our names will go back to the towns we came from ie they expected to be killed ginambo answered no we are anxious to capture her without fail aponibolinayen said you old enemy take this betelnut and she cut it in two and gave it to them how are we sure ginambo of gonigonan that only our names will not go back we are afraid ginambo said do not be afraid but hurry to be brave ala now do what you can shouted aponibolinayen who stood on a high rock when they started toward aponibolinayen their spears looked like rain they were so many she glanced off the spears with both elbows now i am the next to throw my spears said aponibolinayen yes because all our weapons are gone they said aponibolinayen was next she said i will use my magic and you my spear shall kill six and seven at one time and you my headaxe cut off their heads from the left side and from the right side and in back and in front ala you spare me so that i may tell the people in gonigonan where i live said ginambo yes but next month i will come to your town gonigonan to fight said aponibolinayen ginambo went home alone to her town why are you alone asked the people who lived in the same town when she arrived what can we do all my companions who went to fight are lost because they did not throw their spears at aponibolinayen that is what we told you ginambo of gonigonan when you started but you did not heed you know that the people of kaodanan are powerful like kaboniyan 165 soon after that ginwan of nagtinawan said you people who live in the same town in which i live let us go to fight aponigawani of kadalayapan no we do not wish to go because the people who live in kadalayapan are powerful like kaboniyan we do not know whether she has a brother or not though someone has said that aponigawani has no brother no we go said ginwan if that is what you say we will go said the people so they went and they walked and walked until they reached the spring at kadalayapan ginwan said you women who are dipping water from the spring to whom does it belong to aponigawani they said ginawan said ala you go and tell your bravest that we fight with steel weapons the women who dipped water from the well said we do not know who is the bravest whom we should tell for aponigawani has no brother they went up to the town and said uncle pagboksan the place about the spring is filled with enemies then aponigawani was in a hurry to go do not go you will kill somebody said her father no father the spring will be lost and then what can we do father i am a woman and since i have no brother perhaps it is my fortune to fight for you are weak she took her skirt headaxe and spear and she went to the edge of the hill above the spring she looked and looked at the place where the spring was for truly the enemies were thick like locusts about the well what did you come for she asked we come to fight the people who live in kadalayapan because we have heard that the woman who is always in the house 166 has no brother so we have come to carry her away they said ala if you wish to prove her bravery you take this betelnut she cut it in two pieces and gave it to them we asked you to excuse us from going ginwan they said ala you begin and see what you can do said aponigawani who stood on a high stone and she stood with her hands on her hips while they threw their weapons now i am next she said you my spear when i throw you kill at once seven and six and you my headaxe cut off their heads from the left and right sides from in back and in front when aponigawani had killed all of them except ginwan and she had all their weapons ginwan said please my friend let me live so that someone may go back to the town we came from ala yes if that is what you ask my friend but i will come next to your town she said and ginwan went home alone not long after that the month which they had agreed on came now mother go and make cakes and after that i will go to fight said aponibolinayen do not go said her mother ebang of kaodanan but she could not detain her so she made the cake and when she finished aponibolinayen went mother make preparations for me to go to war for this is the month we agreed upon with ginwan of nagtinawan said aponigawani to her mother langaan of kadalayapan bye and bye aponibolinayen who was walking in the middle of the road stopped because she was tired aponigawani was also walking and when she looked up she saw a woman to whom none compared and she was startled and she said here is a woman who looks like me i do not like to approach her who looks like me yet i am ashamed not to do so for she has seen me she said good morning said aponigawani to aponibolinayen who sat on a high stone by the road they leaned their spears together between them and then they talked now my friend where are you going said aponibolinayen i am going to war said aponigawani and where are you going said aponigawani to aponibolinayen i am going to gonigonan because the month which i agreed upon with ginambo of gonigonan has come said aponibolinayen ala let us chew betelnut yes if that is what you say we will chew betelnut said aponigawani after that they exchanged quids and the quid which had been chewed by aponigawani was covered with agate beads which are called pinogalan and the quid of aponibolinayen was covered with gold aponigawani said you are more beautiful and have more power than i because your betelnut is covered with gold after that they spat in front of them the place looked like the place where a child had been born now my friend we are going to tell our names yes said each one and they told their names i am aponibolinayen of kaodanan who has no brother and ginambo of gonigonan came to fight against me and the month in which we agreed to fight has come so i go meet her i go also to the town of ginwan of nagtinawan because the month which we agreed on has arrived my name is aponigawani of kadalayapan who also has no brother if that is what you are going to do we will go first to gonigonan then we will go to the town of nagtinawan said aponibolinayen to her if that is what you say we will both go so they went not long after they arrived at gonigonan now ginambo of gonigonan i am here because the month which we agreed has come you people who live in the same town with me prepare because the woman who always stays in the house in kaodanan has come to fight against us said ginambo yes ginambo we will fight against her we told you not to go against her before because the people of her town are related to kaboniyan we do not know what magic they may use they said now what can we do we are lost after that they began to fight ala you my spears and headaxes kill the people from the left and the right sides from in back and in front said aponibolinayen and aponigawani as soon as they commanded their spears and headaxes their invisible helpers flew and they went to dangdangyan of naglitnan oh sir you are so happy who are in bed in the house the people who live in gonigonan have nearly killed your sister because she went to fight against them said the helpers after that he went to bathe and wash his hair ala you three girls take the rice straw and wash my hair he said and the three girls washed his hair after that he finished to wash and he went up to the town as soon as they arrived in the town the three girls combed his hair when they finished to comb his hair now you put little golden beads on each of my hairs he said as soon as they put all the gold in his hair he took his spear and headaxe and he went lingiwan of nagtangpan was in bed in his house sir you are so happy in your bed in your house your sister went to fight and the enemies have nearly killed her said the invisible spirit helpers mother alan i ask you if i have a sister i never have seen her what can you do i picked you up where you had fallen when your father was jealous of your mother 167 she said after that he hurried to start and he went when dangdangyan of naglitnan was in the road he sat down on a high stone where the two women had set before how terrible it is that those women who never go out of the house have gone to war for here is where they exchanged their weapons while he was sitting good morning my friend said lingiwan of nagtangpan where are you going said the man who sat on the high stone i am going anywhere he answered and they talked we are going to tell our names because it is bad for us when we do not know each others names they cut and chewed the betelnut as soon as they chewed they found that they were relatives my name is lingiwan of nagtangpan my name is dangdangyan of naglitnan let us go together when we go to fight after that they went when they truly arrived they looked into the town they saw the two women who looked like flames of fire because of their beauty how terrible that those ladies who always stay in the house have gone to war they said after that they went to them and the people whom they killed were so many that the pig troughs floated in their blood so they went to them when the women saw them they said how terrible are those two rich men who have power after that oh ladies how were you born they said why are you here you ask ginambo came to fight against us that is why we are here in the town of gonigonan so dangdangyan went in front of them and he scooped them up with his headaxe and put them inside of his belt 168 after that the two men fought against the enemies please leave someone to bear children said ginambo of gonigonan if that is what you ask we will kill you last they said and she begged mercy now we will go to nagtinawan which is the town of ginwan with whom aponigawani agreed to fight this month after that you plunder and heads go before us to kadalayapan when you arrive at the gate you divide equally and part of you go to kaodanan so they went to nagtinawan when they arrived in nagtinawan you ginwan of this town now the agreed month is here how are you ginwan we told you not to go before and you went now we will all be killed said the people who lived in the same town now we seek vengeance they looked as if they cut down banana trees when they cut down their enemies please spare me and if you wish marry me said ginwan if that is what you say we will kill you last but they did not kill her after that they went home and sent all the heads before them and also the plunder after that they arrived in kaodanan good afternoon uncle said dangdangyan to old man pagboksan come up the ladder he said you go and cook so that these boys may eat he said after that you go and get one jar of basi which you used to like when you were young said his wife ebang as soon as she said this they went and they drank and pagboksan said to them this is reserved for aponibolinayen to drink when she returns from fighting when the old woman had finished cooking she took the rice from the jar and put it on the woven basket and she took the meat from the jar and put it in the coconut shells and so they ate as soon as they finished to eat now we are not going to stay long because we must go home they said so dangdangyan dropped down the women who never go out of the house why aponibolinayen is here and lingiwan also they said dingowan of nagtangpan took aponibolinayen and put her inside of a big jar then they went to kadalayapan because they went to take aponigawani when they arrived they said good afternoon uncle to the old man pagatipnan good morning he answered and he was glad come up he said when they went up the stairs they were given basi while they were drinking they let aponigawani fall in front of them and they were all glad because aponigawani was there how fine that aponigawani is here we feared that she was lost said the old man and woman ala boys if you go home now return soon for we are going to chew betel nut as soon as they went lakay 169 pagatipnan and his wife built balaua and they called one woman medium 170 to begin their balaua as soon as they built their balaua they sent someone to go and secure betelnuts which were covered with gold not long after the betelnuts which were covered with gold arrived and the old woman langaan oiled them and she used magic so that the betelnuts went to invite all their relatives who lived in other towns to attend balaua with them she told the betelnuts that if any did not wish to attend balaua with them to grow on their knees as soon as she commanded them they went and the betelnut which went to kaodanan arrived good morning it said to the old man pagboksan who was lying in the balaua he looked up and said who was that and he saw it was a betelnut covered with gold and oiled and the betelnut said i come to bid you attend the balaua of pagatipnan of kadalayapan because aponigawani has returned from fighting so they celebrate pagboksan sat up after that he went down out of the balaua and the told people to wash their hair and clothes and to bathe so as to attend the balaua of pagatipnan of kadalayapan so the people who lived with them all went to the river and washed their clothes and hair and took a bath as soon as they finished they went home and they started to go to kadalayapan old man pagboksan took aponibolinayen from the jar and put her inside of his belt so they went as soon as they arrived there the families who made the balaua went to meet them at the gate of the town and made alawig 171 for them after that they stopped dancing and they talked to each other and the two young men who met aponibolinayen and aponigawani were with them because they arrived at the same time so the old man pagatipnan said ala cousin pagboksan now we are going to chew betelnut to see if those two young men who took home aponigawani are our relatives and old man pagboksan agreed so they cut the betelnut which was covered with gold for them to chew and as soon as they cut the nut they all chewed and they all spat the spittle of lingiwan went to the spittle of pagatipnan and the spittle of aponigawani went there also the spittle of dangdangyan went to the spittle of pagboksan and that of aponibolinayen also and thus they found out that they were relatives pagboksan was surprised for he did not know that he had a son and ebang took her son and she carried him as if he was a baby and lingiwan was glad because he had met his sister during the fight and langaan carried him as if a baby when they had learned that the boys who had carried the girls home were their sons they all went back to town and their people who had been invited were there as soon as they sat down iwaginan commanded someone to play the gansas and he took the two skirts and made everyone dance his wife gintoban who was a big woman who used the big jars like agate beads on her head and about her neck said to iwaginan why dont you my husband bid me dance i have been waiting for a very long time iwaginan said gintoban do not say that or i shall be ashamed before the people wait until i am ready for you as soon as aponibolinayen and lingiwan finished dancing iwaginan took the skirts from them and he gave one to gintoban and the other to ilwisan and so they danced and the big jars which she had hung around her neck made a noise and the earth shook when she moved her body as soon as they finished dancing the people who went to attend balaua with them said now we going to put the heads around the town and then go for it is nearly one month now and our families are lonesome for us so they went to put the heads on the sticks around the town at that time the two alan who had picked up lingiwan and dangdangyan arrived they did not wish to attend balaua but the betelnut had grown on their heads and they had arrived very late as soon as lingiwan and dangdangyan saw them they took them back to the town as soon as pagatipnan knew that they were the alan who took care of the boys he summoned the people around the town they danced for one month after that langaan and ebang went to talk with the two alan and said to them we are surprised for we did not feel our sons come out the alan said lingiwan i picked up by the side of the road while you were walking that is why you did not feel him he was a little bloody when i picked him up and i made him a man because i have no child to inherit all my things now that you found out that he is your son you come and take all my things in kabinbinlan as soon as the balaua is finished as soon as you will get all of them i will fly somewhere so when the people went home after the balaua was finished lingiwan and dangdangyan went to follow their alan mothers as soon as they arrived in the different places where the alan lived they gave them all the things which they had and they used their power so that all the things went to their town when all the things arrived in kadalayapan the people in the town were frightened for there was a golden house when the things arrived in kaodanan the people were frightened for there were the valuable things which dangdangyan took with him after one month passed lingiwan said to his father pagatipnan you go and make paklon for aponibolinayen for i want to marry her so his father sent his wife langaan to kaodanan to tell to the father and mother of aponibolinayen that lingiwan wished to marry her so langaan took her hat which looked like the salaksk 172 and her new skirt as soon as she dressed she started and went when she arrived in kaodanan pagboksan was lying down in his balaua good morning she said to him pagboksan was a in hurry to sit up and he said to her i am glad to see you what are you coming here for in the middle of the day what am i coming for you say i am coming to see if you want lingiwan for a son for he wishes to marry aponibolinayen pagboksan took her to his house and said to his wife here is cousin langaan who came to see us so ebang told him that he should get some old basi for them to drink as soon as they drank ebang went to cook as soon as she finished cooking they ate after they finished eating they took the big coconut shell and filled it with basi and each of them drank and they were all drunk and langaan said i like to hear from you if you wish lingiwan to be a son soon pagboksan and ebang agreed they decided on the day for paklon so langaan went home and when she arrived she laid down on the porch of the house for she was drunk and lingiwan saw her and waked her what is the matter with you he said i am drunk for pagboksan and ebang urged me to drink much basi so i was scarcely able to get home that is why i slept on the porch mother you go into the house do not sleep on the porch so she went in and lingiwan asked her the result of her visit to kaodanan they accepted you and we agreed to make paklon the day after tomorrow so lingiwan was glad and went to tell the people about his marriage and all the people prepared so that they might go as soon as the agreed day came they went to kaodanan and they took many pigs and basi jars when they arrived there pagboksan who was the father of aponibolinayen and the other people were already there and had cooked many caldrons of rice and meat pagboksan took the gansa 173 and he commanded someone to play and they danced after that they ate as soon as they finished to eat they played the gansa again and they danced iwaginan of pindayan said stop playing the gansas we are going to settle on how much they must pay for aponibolinayen as soon as we agree we will dance and the people were quiet and they agreed how much lingiwan was to pay the father and mother of lingiwan offered the balaua three times full of jars which are malayo and tadogan and ginlasan 174 the people did not agree and they said five times full if you do not have that many lingiwan may not marry aponibolinayen he was so anxious to marry her that he told his parents to agree to what the people said as soon as they agreed langaan used magic so that all the jars which the people wanted were already in the balauafive times full as soon as they gave all the jars which they paid iwaginan ordered them to play the gansas and they danced after they danced all their relatives who went to attend paklon were anxious to go home for they had been there one month do not detain us for we are one month here so pagboksan let them go everyone carried home some jars and they all went home 175 so pagatipnan said to pagboksan now that the paklon is over we will take aponibolinayen because lingiwan wants her now pagboksan said do not take her now you come and bring lingiwan day after tomorrow if that is what you say we will bring him if you will not let us take aponibolinayen now when they started to go home pagboksan said to them dangdangyan wants to marry aponigawani who is your daughter you will wait until next month said langaan after aponibolinayen and lingiwan are married we will think first not long after the day on which they agreed to take lingiwan to aponibolinayen came and he carried one jar 176 as soon as they arrived there they made the rice ceremony 177 when the ceremony was over pagatipnan and langaan and the others went home and left lingiwan as soon as they arrived in kadalayapan langaan asked aponigawani if she wanted dangdangyan to be her husband aponigawani said if you think it is good for me to be married now and you think he is a good man for my husband it is all right for he has magical power like us as soon as the agreed month passed the parents of dangdangyan came to ask if they wished the marriage they prepared a number of basi jars for them to drink from when they should arrive when they arrived there pagatipnan was prepared and he met them with the basi and they all drank after that they told all the people who lived in their town that they were going to celebrate the arrival of pagboksan and his companions ala we do not stay long now abalyan 178 we want to know if you wish dangdangyan to be married to aponigawani we will have a good time during paklon they said after that langaan and pagatipnan said now the meal is ready we are going to eat first and after that you will hear what we say and pagboksan and ebang did not wish to eat for they were in a hurry and only went to hear if they wished dangdangyan to be the husband of aponigawani if you do not wish to come and eat with us we do not want dangdangyan to be married to aponigawani they said then they all went to eat after they ate ala now that we have finished eating you excuse us for we want to know if you wish dangdangyan to be married to aponigawani langaan and pagatipnan said you will come next month we will make paklon so they went home and dangdangyan went to meet them at the gate of the town and he asked at once father and mother did they accept me he said yes if we can agree on what they want us to pay and we have to go there next month so dangdangyan was glad and told the people about it and he invited them to go the next month to make paklon as soon as the agreed month to go to kadalayanpan came they went as soon as they arrived there they danced for one month lingiwan and aponibolinayen had their golden house which the alan had given them the people agreed on how much they should pay for the paklon and pagatipnan and langaan said pay just the same as we paid for aponibolinayen when lingiwan married her if that is what you say it is all right they said and ebang used magic so that the balaua was five times full of jars which are malayo tadogan and ginlasan so the balaua was filled five times and each of the relatives who went to attend the paklon took some jars as soon as the paklon was finished the people all went home and pagboksan and ebang said ala now that the paklon is over let us take aponigawani langaan answered if you make extra payment you can take aponigawani now and dangdangyan said to his mother if they want the extra payment ask them how much langaan replied another five times the balaua full and ebang said to her son we have to pay again the balaua five times full that is all right mother i have many jars which my alan mother gave me so they gave the extra jars which they asked as soon as they gave all the jars they took aponigawani of kaodanan with them as soon as they arrived they made a big party and they invited the alan as soon as the alan arrived at the party they danced and gave more presents to them after that the alan and the other people went home and aponigawani and dangdangyan had their own house which the alan gave them this is all told by lagmani of patok 7 aponitolau told aponibolinayen that they would go to the river to wash their hair not long after aponibolinayen went with him when they arrived at the spring they washed their hair as soon as they washed their hair they went to get the lawed 179 vine and they went back home as soon as they reached home aponitolau said to aponibolinayen will you comb my hair i am anxious to go to fight so aponibolinayen combed his hair as soon as she combed it he said ala you go and get my clout my belt which is sewed with gold and my striped coat and also get my ambosau 180 aponibolinayen got them and aponitolau dressed up as soon as he was dressed he took his shield his headaxe and spear and went he struck the side of his shield and it sounded like one hundred people while he was walking and striking his shield in the middle of the way gimbagonan the wife of iwaginan heard him when he was near to pindayan when he passed by the town he continued toward the town of giamblan in a short time he arrived at the well of giamblan he met the young girls who were dipping water from the well he killed all of them with his headaxe and spear not long after he cut off their heads and he went up to the town and directly to the house of giamblan when he arrived at the house he said good morning giamblan go and get your shield headaxe and spear and boars tusk armlet for we are going to fight here in your yard giamblan got his headaxe and spears for he wanted to fight as soon as he arrived where aponitolau was he threw his spears at him and aponitolau soon got all the spears which he threw then he tried to cut off aponitolaus head but aponitolau got his headaxe and said to him now i am next for you did not injure me at all and giamblan said yes aponitolau commanded his headaxe and spear to go to giamblans side as soon as he threw them so giamblan laid down and the headaxe went and cut off giamblans ten heads as soon as aponitolau had killed giamblan he again commanded his spear and headaxe to cut off the heads of all the people in the houses and the headaxe and spear went and aponitolau sat by the town waiting for them as soon as the spear and headaxe had killed all the people who lived in the town they went back to him and aponitolau said you heads of the people gather in one place but you heads of giamblan and you heads of the women be separate from the others you gather by the house of giamblan not long after all the heads gathered and he said again you heads of giamblango first and you heads of the men precede the women as soon as you arrive in kadalayapan stop by the gate of the town you house of

house they went and aponitolau followed them and the oranges followed him not long after aponitolau looked back and he saw the alzados following him for they wished to kill him as soon as he saw them he commanded his strikealight to become a high bank so the alzados could not follow him 181 so the strikealight became a high bank and the alzados were on the other side and could not follow him not

people who lived with him gather here by the gate he went to the town and told the people to gather by the gate and play the gansas and dance and he commanded someone to invite their friends in other towns not long after the people from the other towns arrived in kadalayapan and the people who lived there were still dancing aponitolau danced with danay of kabisilan the next was his son kanag kabagbagowan who danced with five young girls who never go outdoors as soon as they had all danced they went to their towns then they put the heads around the town of kadalayapan told by magwati of lagangilang 8 aponibolinayen and aponitolau were anxious to make sayang 182 so aponitolau asked aponibolinayen about his clout and his striped belt well you go and get them for i am going to get the head of the old man toodan of kalaskigan before we make sayang so aponibolinayen went to get his clout and belt after that he oiled his hair and aponibolinayen put a golden bead on each hair not long after he went to get his headaxe and spear as soon as aponibolinayen gave him his provisions for the journey he started when he was in the middle of the way he became very tired for it was far so he used magic and he said i use my power so that i will arrive at once at the town of toodan of kalaskigan soon after he arrived in kalaskigan when he arrived at the yard beside the balaua the old man was lying down the old man saw him and said eb i have a man to eat and aponitolau said you will never eat me go and get your headaxe and spear for you must fight with me i will take your head before i make sayang the old man was angry and he stood up and went to get his headaxe and spear you are the only person who ever came in my town go on and throw your spear if you are brave said toodan if i am the first to throw my spear you will never have a chance to throw yours for i will kill you at once you better throw yours first said aponitolau the old man was angry and he threw his spear but his spear glanced off from the body of aponitolau for he used his power so that everything glanced away from his body the old man toodan ran toward him and tried to cut off his head but the headaxe could not cut aponitolau and the old man toodan said to him you truly are a brave man that was why you came to my town try and throw your spear at me for if you can hit me it is all right for i have killed many people aponitolau threw his spear at his side and it went clear through his body and toodan laid down aponitolau cut off his head not long after aponitolau went back home and don carlos of kabaiganan vigan 183 was anxious to go and see aponibolinayen so he commanded his spirit companions to be ready to go with him to kadalayapan as soon as they were ready he said to them you go first my companions we are going to the town of aponibolinayen for i have heard that she is a pretty woman and i wish to see her not long after they arrived at the river and they got on to the raft soon they arrived at the well of kadalayapan and indipan was dipping water from the well and don carlos spoke to her is this the well of aponibolinayen indipan said yes will you go and tell her to come here and see what i have to sell indipan went up to the town and said aponibolinayen don carlos wants you to see what he has to sell i dont wish to go and see what he has to sell so indipan went back to the well and said to don carlos aponibolinayen does not wish to come and she does not wish to buy what you have to sell so he pondered what he should do the best thing for me to do is to go to their house to get a drink so he went up to the town and said good morning aponibolinayen will you give me some water to drink for a long time i have wished to drink your water aponibolinayen answered why did you come from the well why did you not drink while you were there i did not drink there for i wished to drink of your water aponibolinayen did not give him any for she was afraid then don carlos used magic so that she dropped her needle the needle dropped and she said to him will you hand the needle which i dropped to me don carlos so don carlos picked up the needle and he put a love charm on it and he gave it to her 184 not long after don carlos wanted to go back home but aponibolinayen would not let him go and she said come up in the house so he went up into the house not long after aponitolau shouted near to the town and he did not hear aponibolinayen answer as soon as he reached the gate of the town he shouted again and she did not answer for don carlos was with her not long after don carlos went home and aponibolinayen saw his belt which he had left for he was in a hurry so she ran and got the ladder to the rice granary and she hid the belt aponitolau met don carlos at the gate of the town and he asked him why he had gone into the town and he answered i want to sell something not long after aponitolau went to their house and asked aponibolinayen why she did not reply to him when he shouted two times i did not answer for i have a headache why is the fastening on the door different from before i dont know no one came in not long after aponitolau went up into the house now aponibolinayen i have taken the head of the old man toodan of kalaskigan you command the people to begin to pound rice for we will make sayang not long after aponitolau saw a flame of fire in the rice granary and he said why is there a fire in the rice granary so he ran to see not long after he went inside of the granary and he saw what it was as soon as he saw that it was a golden belt he said i think this is the belt of the man who came here while i was gone so he took it and hid it and did not let aponibolinayen see it not long after they commanded the people to go and get betelnuts when they arrived with the fruit they oiled them and aponitolau said tell me whom we shall invite beside our relatives in the other towns and aponibolinayen told him to invite don carlos of kabaiganan for she wished always to see him so they sent a betelnut to go and get don carlos and they sent one to the old woman alokotn of nagbotobotn and awig of natpangan and other towns not long after the betelnut reached the place where don carlos lived and it met his spirit helpers as soon as the betelnut reached don carlos aponitolau and aponibolinayen are making sayang and i came to invite you all right you go first i will dress and go after you he said not long after he dressed up and went to follow the betelnuts not long after all the other people from the other towns arrived where they were making sayang and aponitolau tried to put the belt on each person to see if it fitted and no one was the right size as soon as don carlos arrived aponitolau tried the belt on him and it was all right so aponitolau gave him the belt and he got a golden chair and he put it in the middle of the party and made don carlos sit on it all of the people were dancing and aponitolau went and sharpened his headaxe not long after ala you aponibolinayen take kanag and alamaan with you and dance with don carlos not long after they danced while they were dancing aponitolau cut off the head of don carlos the head sprang up and went to the breast of aponibolinayen and aponibolinayen and kanag and alamaan ran away and their clothes were torn for they ran through many thorns not long after the people who went to attend the sayang went home and aponibolinayen and kanag and alamaan arrived in a level plain they went to the shade of an alosip 185 tree and they sat there many days for they were very tired i am anxious to drink water said aponibolinayen and not long after they heard a rooster crowing i think we are near a town for i hear a rooster crowing so they went where they had heard the rooster we go and drink said aponibolinayen not long after they reached the place where silit one kind of lightning and the dog kimat 186 guarded silit and the dog were sleeping and did not see them go inside of the town soon they arrived in the yard of the golden house of balbalaoga of dona and they were ashamed to ask for water to drink for they were naked so they went to the balaua and slept for they were tired while they were sleeping balbalaoga saw them in his balaua and he was surprised because no one was permitted to enter the town for silit and the dog prevented he said what is the matter of the guards that they did not see those people enter the town perhaps they are my relatives so he took some clothes to the balaua for them he covered them with blankets while they slept as soon as he covered them he sat down in the balaua and waited until they got up as soon as aponibolinayen awoke she saw him and said do not wound us in many places so we will not need to cure so much balbalaoga said if i were an enemy i would have killed you while you slept we are going to chew betelnut and see who you are so he cut a betelnut and gave to them and their spittle was like agate beads so he took them up into his golden house and told his mother alan to give them some clothes not long after they drank basi after they had finished eating all the alan were drunk and the mother of balbalaoga of dona said to them aponibolinayen balbalaoga is your brother for he was the afterbirth of awig which they put in the tabalang which they sent down the stream 187 so i picked him up for i had no child to inherit all my things not long after they knew that they were brother and sister balbalaoga asked his sister why they came to dona without clothes she said aponitolau is jealous of don carlos and he cut off his head and the head jumped to my breasts so we were frightened and ran away that is why we came here i did not know i had a brother who lived here the head still hung to the breasts of aponibolinayen but they had not seen it before for she had covered it as soon as she showed it to balbalaoga he took the head from her breasts and they sent some betelnuts to go and summon their mother as soon as the betelnut arrived in kaodanan it said to pagboksan and ebang good morning i came here for balbalaoga and his sister sent me to come and get you so ebang and pagboksan were surprised because aponibolinayen had another brother so they called awig and said to him here is a betelnut from dona which aponibolinayen and balbalaoga sent for they want to see us awig said to them i dont believe that aponibolinayen is still alive for we have searched for her a very long time and i never heard of a place called dona and i have been all over the world they started and the betelnut led them where is dona they said to the betelnut dona is somewhere follow me you must step on the big dishes where i step not long after they arrived in the place where balbalaoga lived and were surprised at the big golden house and balbalaoga and aponibolinayen were watching them from the window and they went to the yard of the house ebang and pagboksan did not believe that balbalaoga was their son so they chewed betelnut as soon as they chewed they found out that he was the afterbirth of awig so balbalaoga took them into his house not long after balbalaoga said to them wait for me for awhile for i am going to hunt deer so he called his dogs who talked with the thunder they were so big and also powerful not long after he went to the wood and the dogs caught three deer he cut up the deer and took them back home not long after aponitolau heard that aponibolinayen was with her brother in dona he went to follow her for he intended to live with her again ebang and pagboksan took balbalaoga and aponibolinayen to kaodanan and they used their power so that all the things which the alan had given to balbalaoga went to kaodanan not long after the house and the other things which the alan had given went to kaodanan all the alan flew away not long after they made balaua in kaodanan and they called all their relatives in the other towns and all of the alan who cared for balbalaoga of dona after that all the people went to attend their balaua in that time balbalaoga was married and aponitolau was very sorry because he could not remarry aponibolinayen and he went to the balaua even though he was not invited as soon as the balaua was over all the people went back home but balbalaoga did not go back to dona the alan flew away after he was married told by magwati of lagangilang 9 ayo went to the spring when she went she met dagdagalisit who was fishing in the river when she reached him she became pregnant not long after she went home when she arrived in her house the space between the little finger and the next itched bolinayen you stick the needle in my finger where it itches i do not know what makes it itch so she said as soon as bolinayen stuck the needle the little baby popped out 188 what shall we name the baby dagolyan will be his name the baby shook his head so they gave him the name kanag awig went to wash his hair in the spring when he finished washing his hair he went home when he reached his house he made ayo louse him while ayo was lousing him the milk from her breasts dropped on awigs legs why ayo does the milk from your breasts drop on my legs he asked he sat up and asked them many times until they brought the baby when they brought the baby we are going home to natpangan now because it does not do me any good to try and hide you he took them home and soon he made a bamboo bench by the gate of the town where the people passed when they went to the well and he placed the baby on it then they built balaua for he wanted to see the father of the baby not long after he commanded some one to go and get betelnuts and he oiled them he sent them to go and invite all the people in the world when they arrived none of them wanted the baby to recognize them when the baby did not go to any of them he sent someone to get a betelnut to send to dagdagalisit whom they had not invited as soon as the betelnut arrived at the place where dagdagalisit lived dagdagalisit came to natpangan for awig makes balaua it said i cannot go for i am ashamed because i have no good clothes he said for his clout was the dried bark of a banana tree if you do not come i will grow on your big pig it said and the betelnut jumped on the back of the big pig and it began to squeal when his big pig began squealing loudly because the tree grew on his back dagdagalisit said i come now not long after he went when he came walking up the trail from the spring the baby saw him and went to him and awig saw him carrying the baby i did not think it would happen this way to aponibolinayen he said then he sent aponibolinayen away and he made her carry the poor house box that they used to put the fish in which dagdagalisit caught in the river you carry the female pig so that you have something to eat by the river said awig to dagdagalisit so they went aponibolinayen carried the poor box and awig took her beads and clothes off from her and he gave her old clothes to use and so they went when they were near the spring they threw away the things they carried the female pig and poor box while they were walking near the town of dagdagalisit which was kabenbenlan ayo saw the golden house we must not walk by the side of the golden house for i am ashamed before the man who owns it said ayo to dagdagalisit they were still walking and ayo followed him as soon as they arrived at the ladder dagdagalisit went upstairs and ayo did not because she thought that dagdagalisit did not own that house and dagdagalisit made her go up and she did as soon as she arrived above dagdagalisit went to get rice to give ayo to cook cook this ayo while i go to catch fish for us to eat he said and he went as soon as he caught two fish he went home and he left the dry bark of the banana which he used as a clout by the river and he became ligi 189 so he went home as soon as he arrived he made ayo wake up when he finished cooking the fish and the baby went to him to be carried he called ayo and she did not go i wait for my husband we will both eat at one time bye and bye she said and she took the baby which he carried for she was ashamed no i was dagdagalisit but used the bark of the banana tree for a clout because i changed my form let us eat so they ate as soon as they finished eating we shall make balaua so that we invite all our relatives in the different towns and we also shall invite awig and aponigonay he said not long after he went and took the betelnuts which he cut when he had cut them all he oiled them and sent them to the different towns when the people from the different towns arrived by the spring in kabenbenlan they were surprised because all the stones of the spring were of gold not long after they went up to the town next day awig and aponigonay started to go ala aponigonay take rice so that we may cook it in kabenbenlan because aponibolinayen and dagdagalisit have no rice to cook what will dagdagalisit use for his balaua he ties a banana bark clout on his body i do not think he has rice so we will take some for us to eat you people who live in the same town we go to attend balaua you take food with you for aponibolinayen and dagdagalisit make balaua not long after they went and when they arrived in the place where the spring is in kabenbenlan they saw the beautiful spring whose stones were all gold the gravel which they used to wash the pottery with was all agates which have no holes through them i do not think that dagdagalisit has a spring like this for his clout is only the dry bark of the banana but it is best for us to go and see in the town they went and when they had almost reached the town the golden house twinkled we must not walk by the golden house said awig we must not walk by that golden house you say but that is where the people are dancing said aponibolnay as they walked they saw that the men and women who were making alawig 190 were the companions of aponibolinayen awig said that is the man who used to put the clout of banana leaves on him as soon as aponitolau 191 and aponibolinayen finished dancing they went to take the hands of awig and aponibolay and aponitolau commanded the people who lived with them to bring golden seats after that aponitolau went to make awig sit down you sit down brotherinlaw and we will forget the things which have passed then he made him sit down and soon awig and asigtnan danced while they were dancing aponitolau went to cut off awigs head not long after the women who never go outdoors 192 went to bring awig to life as soon as they made him alive again aponitolau gave the marriage price it was nine times full the balaua and when aponibolnay raised up her elbow half of it vanished which was in the balaua and aponibolinayen used her power and the balaua was full again not long after they chewed betelnut and the quid of langaan and pagatipnan and the quids of dagdagalisit went together and the quid of pagboksan and ebang went to the quid of aponibolinayen and awig and langaan and pagatipnan changed the name of dagdagalisit to ligi ala now mother old alan do not feel sorry for we take aponitolau to kadalayapan said langaan ala yes you take them take all my valuable things if it were not for me aponitolau would not be alive for you langaan had a miscarriage and lost him when you went to wash your hair so i picked him up because i had no one to inherit my possessions take all my things so that aponitolau and his wife may own them not long after they went home and awig took all the payment for aponibolinayen and all the alan flew away so awig and aponitolau went to their towns 10 aponibalagen went to put aponibolinayen in kabwaan where no one could see her as soon as they arrived at the ocean they rode on the crocodiles to kabwaan when they arrived there aponibalagen used magic so that a big golden house stood in the middle of a wide plain in the yard were many betelnut trees and a spring below the trees the gravel where the stream flowed was beads called pagatpat and kodla and the leaves and grass used to rub the inside of the jars was a necklace of golden wire when the golden house and betelnuts and spring had appeared aponibalagen left an old woman with aponibolinayen and alamaan and sinogyaman and indipan and he went back home and he said to them do not be afraid to stay for no one can see you here where i have put you and if anyone tries to come here the crocodiles will eat them you have everything you need so he went home ingiwan who lived in kabilabilan went to take a walk as soon as he arrived at the ocean he wondered how he could get across not long after he put his headaxe on the water and he rode on it for he used magic and his headaxe floated and went to the other side of the ocean as soon as he reached the other side he took a walk and he saw the big golden house in the middle of the wide plain he was surprised and he went to see it and the crocodiles all slept while he crossed the ocean when he reached the spring he said how pretty the well is i think the girl who owns this well has magical power and that she is pretty also so he went to the house and said good afternoon alamaan was cooking and she said good afternoon she looked at him from the window and she saw that he was a fine looking man she did not tell aponibolinayen but she had him go up the ladder the old woman who took care of them asked why she did not tell her and aponibolinayen alamaan said she did not know what she was doing when she had him go up so the old woman went to ask him what he came for he said i just took a walk and i did not know how to get home for there was a very high bank in the way so i came across the ocean to learn the other way back home while i was still on the ocean i saw this big golden house i came here for i was very tired for it is more than one month since i left kabilabilan ala you alamaan go and cook some food for this young man said the old woman and alamaan went truly and when she finished cooking the old woman called him to eat the young man said he did not wish to eat unless one of the ladies who never went outdoors 193 ate with him alamaan is the girl who never goes outdoors said the old woman but he did not believe her and so he did not go when he would not eat she called sinogyaman to go and eat but the young man said i do not wish to eat with anyone except the pretty girl who never goes outdoors so the old woman called indipan as soon as she went outdoors to the place where the young man was no that is not the girl i want there is one prettier still i will not go to eat the old woman became angry and said if you are not hungry and do not wish to eat that is all right i have offered three young girls to eat with you but if you do not wish to eat with them i do not care when the old woman and the three girls had eaten they gave him a place to sleep and they slept also while the others were talking to the young man aponibolinayen was looking through a crack of the house and she liked him very much she wished to go outdoors and talk to him but she was afraid because the old woman had said there were only the three young girls whom she called as soon as they had finished talking they went to bed in the middle of the night ingiwan said to himself i believe there are other young girls here prettier than the last one she showed me i will use my power and will become a firefly and i will fly to all parts of the house and see if there is a prettier one there so he used his power and he became a firefly and he flew 194 when he was in the room where the old woman was he left and went where alamaan was and he went on to sinogyaman when he did not like her he went to indipan this is the last girl she showed me and i like her but i believe that there is another prettier so he went to the next room but no one slept there and so he went on to the ninth room he heard the sound of the pan pipe in the ninth room and he was very glad he flew over the head of the woman who was playing and she stopped playing and struck at him how did the firefly get in here i do not think there are any cracks in here the firefly said do not strike at me for i fear you will hit my headaxe and be cut so he became a man and sat down beside her and aponibolinayen saw that it was the man who had talked with the old woman and the girls and she loved him but she said go outdoors do not come here i am afraid that the old woman who cares for us will see us if you want something wait until morning and we will talk with her ingiwan did not get up and he would not go outdoors and he said the best thing for us to do is to chew betelnut so we will know each other do not be afraid for i would not have come here if it was not my fortune to marry you for i was taking a walk and intended to go back home but i met a high bank in the way and there was no place to go except the ocean so i came across the ocean as soon as i reached the field i saw your house and i was surprised to see the golden house in the middle of the field i spoke to the young girl who was cooking and she asked me to come up and the old woman hated her they asked me to eat but i would not unless a pretty girl ate with me so the old woman called two other pretty girls but i did not want them for they are not so pretty as you i thought there were others prettier than the last one she showed me so i became a firefly it is my fortune to marry you so he cut the betelnut but aponibolinayen did not want to chew when he talked to her so she could not sleep she took the betelnut and when they chewed they saw that they both had magical power and that it was good for them to marry ingiwan said you are the woman who lives here and you must tell your name first no it is not good for a woman to tell her name first you tell your name not long after my name is ingiwan the son of alan of kabilabilan who did not find a way to go home but who found you my name is aponibolinayen who is the sister of aponibalagen of natpangan who put me here so no one might see me it is bad that you have come when the daylight came alamaan went to cook and when she finished the old woman said to her go and call the man and see if he wishes to eat with the girls you call them but do not call aponibolinayen for that is why we are here so no one can see her i do not know why the alligators did not see him aponibolinayen and ingiwan heard what she said and they laughed so alamaan went to call him but he was not in the room she went to tell the old woman that he was not there and they were surprised for they thought he had gone home for all the other rooms were locked if he is not there you go and call aponibolinayen and we will eat the three girls went to the room of aponibolinayen but ingiwan disappeared and they only saw aponibolinayen so they all went to eat and ingiwan was not hungry for aponibolinayen used magic so that rice and meat went to where he was hiding when they had lived together a long time aponibolinayen said to him you better go home now for it is time for my brother to visit us if you wish to marry me you must arrange with him and my father so ingiwan went back home and the crocodiles only watched him but did not try to eat him he rode on his headaxe and when he reached the other side of the ocean he saw that the high bank had disappeared and he found the way home not long after aponibalagen went to wash his hair and he went to the place where aponibolinayen and the other girls were living the three girls and the old woman agreed not to tell that a man had been there as soon as aponibalagen arrived in kabwaan he asked the old woman if anyone had been there and she replied no he called alamaan and the other girls to the place where aponibolinayen was so all of them might louse him while aponibolinayen was lousing her brother the milk from her breasts dropped on his legs and aponibalagen was surprised and he said what have you done aponibolinayen she tried to rub it off from his leg no do not rub it off what is that i do not know brother i guess i am sweating for i am hot no i do not believe you i think someone has been here he called the old woman and asked her you grandmother did you see a man who came here do not tell a lie why asked the old woman but she knew that aponibolinayen had a little baby for she had pricked her little finger and the baby had come out 195 when the girls were lousing me the milk from aponibolinayens breast dropped on my legs i think you know the man who has been here i do not believe anyone came here for we are on this side of the ocean and the crocodiles protect us aponibalagen called all the crocodiles to the side of the house and he whipped all the crocodiles and he asked them why they did not eat the man who went to kabwaan as soon as he whipped them one of them said we did not see any man come here but we were all very sleepy one day a long time ago we would have eaten the man if we had seen him aponibalagen whipped all of them again i put you here to prevent anyone from coming here and you did not watch go away the crocodiles were afraid and they said if that is what you say we will go so they went aponibalagen went back to the house and whipped the girls we will go back now to kaodanan i thought it was good for you to be here but you have done wrong so he took them back to kaodanan and they made balaua in order to find out who was the father of the boy the boy grew one span every time they bathed him 196 for they used their power in a few days they built their balaua and the liblibayan 197 got betelnuts which were covered with gold and they oiled them and sent them to invite the people in all parts of the world so the betelnuts went as soon as the betelnuts arrived in kabilabilan they said good morning kagkagkag 198 to the man who was lying in his balaua covered with mud we came to invite you to the balaua of aponibalagen i do not wish to go for i have no clothes and am ashamed i do not know the man who is going to make balaua if you do not go i will grow on your knee said one of the betelnuts do as you wish so the betelnut grew on his knee when it grew big he became tired and he said get off from me now and i will go so they went all the people from the other towns had arrived and aponibalagen carried the baby to see whom the baby would want to go to but the baby did not want any of them when the betelnut and kagkagkag appeared the baby was happy and wanted to go to him so aponibalagen gave the boy to him and all the people were surprised that aponibolinayen had wanted him not long after they danced and when they had finished aponibalagen said to aponibolinayen take off all your things and go to kagkagkag aponibolinayen did not wish to go for he was not the same man she was with before but her brother made her go and he said kagkagkag take her to your town so he took her to his town and when they reached the gate aponibolinayen was crying but he said to her do not feel bad i am the man who came to kabwaan that is why the boy wants me for i am his father aponibolinayen did not believe him but when they arrived at the spring of kabilabilan she was surprised to see that the stones were of gold and the fruits of the trees were of gold and were beads and she said to kagkagkag why do we come here it is shameful for us to be seen by the man who owns this kagkagkag laughed at her if you do not believe that i am your husband you watch and he went to take a bath and the mud all washed off and she saw that he was the man who was with her before in kabwaan so they went up to the town and the alan who cared for ingiwan was glad to see them not long after they made balaua for they wished to call aponibalagen so that he would not always feel badly about them not long after they sent the betelnuts to summon their relatives as soon as the betelnut arrived in kaodanan good afternoon aponibolinayen and kagkagkag want you to attend their sayang aponibalagen laughed and said yes and he called all the people and told them to prepare to go to the balaua when they arrived at the spring everyone was astonished for all the fruit of the trees was of gold and all the places they walked were covered with plates and aponibalagen said i do not think this is the spring of kagkagkag i think someone else owns it we will go up to the house where he lives when they reached the gate of the town they asked the young girl who was going to the spring where aponibolinayen and kagkagkag slept and the woman said you follow these plates for they go to the ladder of kagkagkags house so they went and they always walked on the plates when they arrived they saw many people dancing in the yard and aponibalagen shook their hands kagkagkag if you had come as you are now to my balaua i would not have been bad to my sister kagkagkag laughed at them and they all chewed betelnut while they were chewing langaan and pagatipnan went to them and they said we came to chew betelnut also to see if we are related to you kagkagkag gave them betelnut and when they chewed they found out that they were relatives and they called kagkagkag aponitolau and he paid the marriage price for aponibolinayen aponigawani said to him i thought i had no brother i do not know what my father and mother did with you the alan who cared for aponitolau said he was by the road where langaan had dropped him on her way to nagbotobotn so i picked him up for i have no children as soon as aponitolau paid the marriage price they danced again and the alan gave all her things to aponitolau for langaan and pagatipnan took them home not long after aponibalagen married aponigawani and he paid the same as aponitolau had paid for aponibolinayen told by madomar a woman of riang barrio patok 11 i go to visit my cousin gawigawen of adasin said aponitolau he pushed his raft until he reached pangasinan at the spring he asked the women if his cousin aponibolinayen was there she is not because she went to celebrate sayang 199 did you not get the invitation of gawigawen of adasin no said aponitolau aponibolinayen went to have lisnaya fix her upper arm beads and they sat in the shade of the pamloongen tree and aponibolinayen dropped her switch i wish to visit my relatives but am ashamed because the invitation did not reach me said aponitolau so he went to rest in the shade of the pamloongen tree and he saw there the switch which was spread out and there was none like it the women who had been at the spring said why did you not invite aponitolau whenever we have trouble it is he and his cousin that we call ala we go down to the river to see they went to get aponitolau and when they arrived at the spring he was there in the shade of the tree ala forgive us because the invitation did not reach you and come up to the sayang yes but if the old enemy is there when i go the dance circle will be disturbed if we fight they still requested him and he went up to the place where they danced during the two months dalinmanok of dalinapoyan said long ago when my grandfather was young the town of kadalayapan became wooded he meant that his grandfather had destroyed the town in which aponitolaus ancestors lived my grandfather dagolyen long ago said dalinapyan dagala and also dagopan became wooded then dalinmanok became angry he looked like a courting cock and seized aponitolau by the hair it is as i predicted cousin gawigawen the circle is now broken they parted the fighters but the hawk hastened to the town of kadalayapan to tell aponigawani cousin dumalgan cousin agyokan the enemythe old onehas killed my brother aponitolau at the sayang of gawigawen of adasin so says the hawk after that they started and soon arrived in adasin they began at the south end of the town and killed so many it looked as though they were cutting down banana trees look down aponitolau and see if you know the men who are destroying the town aponitolau truly looked why cousin dumalgan and cousin agyokan do you destroy the town because the hawk reported to aponigawani that you had been killed by the old enemy in the town of adasin and she has thrown away her upper arm beads 200 by the gate of kadalayapan ala you stop ala you who live join their heads and their bodies you join all he said i will spit once and they will appear as if they were not cut at all i will whip my perfume which is banowes they quickly breathe i whip my perfume which is alikadakad clatter and they quickly stand up i whip my perfume which is dagimonau monaujust awakened and they quickly recover 201 oh how long we have slept they said how long we have slept you say and you have been dead oh how powerful are the people of kadalayapan even if we die we may hope to live again at once they said and all went up to the house of gawigawen now dalinmanok of dalinapoyan dumpoga of dagala ligi of madagitan and ligi of dagopan expect me in two months time for i shall come to fight you after that they agreed and everybody went home when they arrived at kadalayapan there were no upper arm beads on aponigawani for she believed the hawk when it told her aponitolau was dead no i am not dead but when two months have passed i shall go to fight dalinmanok and his companions when you went to sail did you not find the switch which belongs to aponibolinayen they are now making a ceremony to find it it is here that which i picked up in the shade of the pamloongen tree and i will take it back when i go to fight not long after that according to the custom of the story the second month came old men who know the signs and very old women come and see the liver and gall sack because i go to fight after that they all gathered they caught the pig and cut it in large pieces ala old men who know the signs and very old women come and see the gall for i go to fight 202 this is better than your grandfather had when he consulted the gall how fearful you will be to the town which you go to fight cousin agyokan go and tell all our cousins that we start when morning comes when early morning cameas goes in a storythey arrived aponitolau played his jews harp at the spring of the town and it sounded like the song of a bird and the people smelt the odor of alangigan ilangilang which is only possessed by the people of kadalayapan ala it is aponitolau said dalinmanok go and tell our companions that we go to fight him at the river for we do not wish them to come on shore in our town when it was day they met at the river and they fought until afternoon and when aponitolau was thirsty his headaxe turned slantwise and water blue as indigo flowed off it freely dumpoga of dagala ligi of madagitan ligi of dagopan masilnag of kaskasilnagan i come to teach you because you do not know how to kill when one tries to kill your left side receive the blow with your right and when they try to kill the right side receive it with the left ala you that are left alive it is better that i spare you and that you marry the wives of your companions i will spare you if you will all agree to give me one hundred jars which are ginlasan summadag and tadogan they agreed they rolled the jars which they took down to the river and there were among them doldoli and ginaang 203 and the jars were glad for they had formerly belonged to dagolyen the grandfather of aponitolau but had been stolen after that aponitolau said give me your betelnut with magic power you jars and all you heads of dead persons which are cut off go first to kadalayapan after that they went and aponitolau followed after they arrived they danced with the heads and in a short time put them on the sagang 204 now aponigawani bring me the switch of aponibolinayen for i go to take it to her he took the switch and used the power of the betelnut so that he went as quickly as a person can point to the place of many betelnuts in a short time as the story goes they arrived good evening said aponitolau but aponibolinayen thought him to be an enemy does the old enemy bring greetings asked aponitolau then they went up into the house and he leaned against the corner pole aponibolinayen looked at aponitolau and his good looks seemed to climb the corner pole it is better for us to tell our names said aponitolau for it is difficult to talk when we do not know each others names after that he took out from his little sack nuts whose husks were of gold he cut a nut and when he gave the half to aponibolinayen their golden finger rings exchanged themselves give back my ring she said our relationship is the reason they change said aponitolau then they chewed and laid the quids on the headaxe and they became agate beads which looked like honey and laid in parallel lines we are relatives they said and in a short time they told their names when it became time to eat aponibolinayen said what do we eat he took the boiling stick and broke it into pieces and it became a fish which they ate 205 and aponitolau took the bone out of the fish which aponibolinayen ate when they finished eating she spread the mat and the blanket which they kept in the box i do not like a blanket which is kept in a box for it smells like kimi 206 said aponitolau why do you not like it it is what we keep for company and is easy to use said aponibolinayen the end of my clout is enough for my blanket said aponitolau then aponibolinayen used the power of the betelnut and vanished why is there no one here said aponitolau i use your power betelnut so that i may become the insect which belongs to kaodanan ie the firefly after that he flew and arrived in the ninth room and sailed back and forth near aponibolinayen who was playing a panpipe he touched her body and she struck him away you must not strike me away for you hit my headaxe after that aponitolau sat down how did you pass in here she asked i passed through the crack in the wall said aponitolau and after that they laid together when it was early morning aponibolinayen sent him away for she feared her brother might come as aponitolau went quickly to his raft he was seen by balau of baboyan a great bird how fine is aponitolau ala i shall take him to marry ginteban 207 then he was seized by balau and was carried to baboyan now aponitolau you must marry ginteban who lived in baygan for this place is surrounded with water blue as indigo and many crocodiles lie in that water in a little while as the story goes aponibolinayen gave birth to a child ala grandmother prick my little finger for it itches she truly opened it and the baby popped out like popped rice 208 after that they bathed it and called him balokanag for that is a name of the people of kadalayapan soon the child was large and asked for a clout then he asked the name of his father but they told him falsely that it was dumanagan ala get me a top so that i can play with the others he said then his mother gave him the top which was his fathers when he was a little boy after that he went to play with it when it was late afternoon the old woman alokotn went to feed the pigs but kanag threw his top and it broke her jar paya said the old woman the son is brave when you go to rescue your father who balau captured it will not be my pot toward which you act brave kanag cried you said mother that dumanagan is my father but there is another who is my fatheraponitolau whom balau stole then aponibolinayen cried how bad you are old woman we should have exchanged for your jar if you had not told him of his father you must make me sweets for i go to get my father he said if he was seized you who are little will be also said his mother but he insisted then she used magic and secured for him the headaxe used by his father when he was a little boy and she made him sweets he started and went and his mother planted a lawed vine by their hearth 209 your power betelnut so that i go as quickly as pointing to baboyan said kanag soon he arrived there and he saw the crocodiles lying in the water you power betelnut that i may walk on the crocodiles make them all sleep so that they do not feel me he reached the home of balau where he saw great snakes hanging in the trees he climbed the trees he cut them so that they fell down he cast them downthose big snakesthen he cut off the head of balau and the earth trembled after that he went to find his father who was in the place of many betelnuts i am balokanag whom aponibolinayen desired whom you left he said now i take you home to kadalayapan after that he truly took home aponitolau and ginteban who lived in baygan in a short time they arrived in kadalayapan and kanags mother was there because aponigawani had taken her home now we are married forever aponitolau said ginteban who lived in baygan no for aponibolinayen is his wife replied aponigawani ala you chance it and the one who loses is not the one who is married put clay dishes in line which you are to step on the one who breaks them loses aponibolinayen stepped first and there was nothing broken ginteban followed and all those clay dishes which she stepped on were broken then she went home to baygan and after that aponitolau and aponibolinayen were married 12 i am anxious to eat the fruit of the bolnay tree 210 of matawitwen said aponibolinayen what is that said ligi i am anxious to eat fish roe i said bring me a fish net and i will go and get some said ligi so she went to get the fish net and gave it to him not long after he went to the river and he used magic so that all the fish in the river were caught so truly all the fish were in the net he caught one of them and cut it open and took out the roe as soon as he secured the roe he let the fish all go out of the net and he went back home not long after he reached the yard of their house aponibolinayen come and get the fish roe which you desire he said she went to get it from him she did not cook it but put it on the bamboo hanger above the fire ligi went to the balaua and when aponibolinayen thought he was in the balaua she threw away the roe and the dogs went to eat it and they snarled and barked beneath the kitchen what are the dogs fighting about aponibolinayen i think you threw away the fish roe he said to her i dropped one of them aponibolinayen went again to the room and she said again that she wished to eat the fruit of matawitwen and ligi asked what she said i am anxious for the liver of a deer i said so ligi went to the woods to hunt deer as soon as he reached the woods he sent his dogs and he said to them you my black dog do not catch deer except in the low grass and you my striped dog do not touch any deer unless they have large horns not long after his dogs caught some deer and he took their livers and he let them go again not long after he arrived at his house and he called aponibolinayen come and get the liver which you wish to eat aponibolinayen said to him put it in the rattan hanger ligi went back to the balaua and aponibolinayen used magic so that ligi slept while he was asleep she went to the kitchen to throw away the livers of the deer and the dogs went to eat and made such a great disturbance that ligi awoke and asked aponibolinayen what was the matter one small piece of liver which i did not eat she went again to the room and laid down and ligi used magic and became an ant and he went to the crack of the floor for he wanted to know what aponibolinayen was saying for he suspected that she was not telling him the truth as soon as he arrived in the crack aponibolinayen repeated her wish to eat the bolnay fruit of matawitwen and ligi became a man again and appeared to her why did you not tell the truth aponibolinayen he said and she answered i did not because matawitwen is very far and i am afraid that you will be lost no give me a sack he said to her so he went and he used magic so that he arrived at the tree at once not long after he arrived truly at the place and he secured the fruit and put it in the sack as soon as the sack was filled he took some of the fruit to hold in his other hand and he went not long after he reached the spring in kadalayapan and his sweethearts were at the spring ligi how many and how pretty the bolnay fruit are your sack is filled and you have some in your hands will you give us some of it to eat so ligi gave them all the fruit in the sack and all he held in his hand do not give everything to aponibolinayen but give to us also so he gave them all he had the baby inside of aponibolinayen which desires the bolnay is not your child but is the child of maobgan said his sweethearts and when they had eaten all of the fruit ligi went home with nothing but the sack he gave the sack to aponibolinayen as soon as she received it she looked to see what was inside and she found one little piece of the fruit which the women had overlooked and she ate it as soon as she ate it i am anxious to eat more if there are more my headache is gone what is that said ligi angrily you get ready for i will put you in the place where the tree is if you want more aponibolinayen said to him because i said that i wanted more you want to put me by the tree ligi was angry and he seized her by the arm and dragged her to the tree as soon as they arrived at the bolnay tree he dug a hole about neck deep and he put her in it as soon as he put her in the hole he went back home soon aponibolinayen was ready to give birth what can i do she said to the spirit ayo ayo said the best thing for us to do is to prick your little finger not long after the little baby popped out of her finger 211 what shall we call him they said we will call him kanag for it is the name of the people who live in kadalayapan every time they gave him a bath the baby always grew for they used magic 212 not long after the baby became a boy and he wanted them to get out of the hole no we do not get out for i am afraid your father is watching us the little boy got out even though his mother was afraid as soon as the boy got out of the hole he listened to hear where many children were playing so he walked to where the sounds came from as soon as he arrived at the place where the boys were swimming dagolyan saw him who is that boy he said to his companions and the little boy went near to them why this boy looks like my uncle in kadalayapan said dagolyan to his companions and he asked him who his father was and the boy said he was the son of an alan of matawitwen not long after they agreed that they would go to fight so kanag agreed with them and they decided on a day and dagolyan told him that he would go to his home if that is what you say it is all right said kanag and they all went home as soon as he arrived at the hole by the bolnay tree why we are cousins said the other boy to me and aponibolinayen said perhaps it is the boy from kaodanan we agreed to go to fight day after tomorrow make cakes for me to take with me no do not go for i fear that your father will meet you no i am going i will plant the lawed vine by the stove and if it wilts i am dead 213 he said not long after aponibolinayen went to make cakes for his provisions and dagolyan started early in the morning to go to see kanag and it seemed as if a thousand men struck their shields kanag heard the sound of the shield who are the boys with dagolyan who go with us to fight as soon as kanag met dagolyan they went and they both struck their shields and ligi heard them and he was surprised for it sounded like two thousand people so ligi thought that dagolyan had many companions as soon as they arrived where ligi was waiting for them where did you get the other boy who is with you he said to dagolyan he answered that he met him where they were swimming and that they agreed to go to fight together ligi wanted to kill him and he said i want to kill no do not kill him said dagolyan not long after they went as soon as they arrived where there were no houses kanag used his power so that it rained very hard and they had nothing to cook not long after it rained and ligi and dagolyan did not cook anything for everything was damp the spirit helpers of aponibolinayen always fed kanag and ligi and dagolyan ate with him what is the matter of this boy who is the son of alan he has something to eat i do not believe that his mother alan knows how to prepare good food said ligi angrily after they had finished eating they went and after a while they wished to fight the best for us to do is to stand in different places and ambush the people said ligi the best for you son of alan is to stay at the place where the carabao pass by and ligi went to hide where the people passed by on the way to the spring and dagolyan staid on the other side a young pretty girl passed by the place where kanag was hiding so he cut off her head and he shouted for he was very happy why did the son of alan kill someone before us said ligi not long after an old woman and an old man passed by where ligi and dagolyan were hiding and they killed them not long after they saw the head which kanag had taken and kanag saw the heads which ligi and dagolyan had taken were those of an old man and old woman dagolyan said to him what did you say when you killed that pretty girl i think i heard you say your father does not like you i did not hear very well so i ask for sure the son of alan of matawitwen kills the pretty girl is what i said no that is not what you said you said you were the son of a man who lives in kadalayapan not long after when dagolyan could not make kanag repeat what he had said they all went back to kadalayapan where ligi lived when they arrived in kadalayapan they played the gansa and danced and aponibolinayen heard the sound of the gansa and she was anxious to go but her spirit companion would not let her go they saw that the lawed vine was green not long after they made kanag dance and when his body trembled while he danced the whole town of kadalayapan trembled also and when he moved his feet the fish were around his feet and they went to lap his feet because the water came up into the town when he stamped his feet the coconuts fell from the trees and ligi was very angry and he went to sharpen his headaxe as soon as he had sharpened his headaxe he went to where kanag was dancing and he cut off his head when aponibolinayen looked at the lawed vine each leaf was wilted grandmother the lawed vine which kanag planted is wilted said aponibolinayen i am going to get him so she went and as she approached the place where ligi used to live he saw her how angry you were ligi you killed your son said aponibolinayen and ligi bent his head for he did not know it was his son i will use magic so that when i whip my perfume alikadakad he will stand up 214 so the little boy stood up at once not long after she used her power again and whipped her perfume dagimonau so that her son awoke he woke up and said how long my sleep is no do not say that your father killed you she wanted to take him back to matawitwen but ligi prevented them and he begged them to forgive him and aponibolinayen said no we will go back for you did not want us and you put us there so they went to matawitwen and ligi followed them as soon as they arrived at the spring of matawitwen aponibolinayen used her power i use my power so that ligi cannot see us and the trail will become filled with thorns 215 not long after ligi could not walk in the trail and he could not see them and he was very sorry he laid down because he could not follow them and his hair grew like vines along the ground and he did not eat for he was always sorry about the things he had done to his wife and son not long after they forgave him and went to get him and they all went back to kadalayapan ligi commanded his spirit attendants to take his sweethearts and kill them for they told falsehoods about aponibolinayen so that he did not want her any more this is all told by magwati of lagangilang 13 there was a husband and wife who were aponitolau and aponibolinayen aponitolau laid down in their balaua and aponibolinayen was in the house and she had a headache i am anxious to eat the fruit of the orange tree which belongs to gawigawen of adasen said aponibolinayen aponitolau heard her what is that he said to her i am anxious to eat the biw 216 of matawitwen give me a sack and i will go to get it said aponitolau and he went as soon as aponitolau filled the sack with biw he went back home as soon as he arrived in their house here is the fruit you wished aponibolinayen come and get put it on the bamboo hanger above the fire and i will go and get some to eat when my head does not feel so badly for i cannot get up yet so aponitolau went to put the fruit on the hanger above the fire and he laid down again in the balaua as soon as aponitolau laid down in the balaua aponibolinayen went to the kitchen and peeled one of the biw fruit and she ate it truly as soon as she ate she vomited and so she threw them away what is the matter aponibolinayen i think you threw away the fruit one of them i dropped she went into the room and she said again i am anxious to eat the oranges of gawigawen of adasen what is that said aponitolau i am anxious to eat fish roe said aponibolinayen so aponitolau went to get his fish net and he fished in the river as soon as he arrived at the river he threw his net and secured a fish with fish roe he cut open the fish and took out the roe when he had taken out the roe he spat on the place where he had cut the fish and it became alive again and swam in the river after that he went back home as soon as he arrived at their house he gave the fish to aponibolinayen and he laid down in the balaua again and aponibolinayen went to the kitchen and she toasted the roe when she finished she tasted it and she vomited so she threw it away also what is the matter aponibolinayen why are the dogs barking i dropped some of the roe she went again to the room of the house i am anxious to eat the oranges which belong to gawigawen of adasen what is that aponibolinayen said aponitolau i am anxious to eat a deers liver i said so aponitolau called his dogs and he went to hunt deer as soon as he arrived on the mountain ala my black dog do not catch a deer unless it is in the low grass ala my dog boko do not catch deer unless it is in a level field not long after his dogs caught deer and he took out their livers as soon as he took out the liver he spat on the places he had cut and the deer ran away again not long after he went back home as soon as he arrived here is the liver which you wanted come and take it put it in the kitchen i will go and fix it when my head does not hurt aponitolau put it in the kitchen and he went to the balaua again when aponitolau was in the balaua aponibolinayen went to the kitchen and cooked the liver and she tried to eat but she vomited again so she threw it away and the dogs all barked what is the matter why do the dogs bark i think you threw away the livers aponibolinayen said i threw away what i did not eat for i did not eat all of it do not throw them away for bye and bye i will eat for it is hard to go and get them not long after she went again to the room and aponitolau thought that aponibolinayen did not tell the truth so he used his power i use my power so that i will become a centipede so he became a centipede and he went in the crack of the floor where aponibolinayen was lying not long after aponibolinayen said again i am anxious to eat the oranges which belong to gawigawen of adasen i know now what you want why did you not tell the truth at first that is why you threw away all the things i went to get for you said aponitolau and he became a man and appeared to her i did not tell the truth for i feared you would not return for no one who has gone there has returned so i am patient about my headache ala go and get rice straw and i will wash my hair not long after he went to wash his hair when he finished washing his hair he went to get one lawed vine and he went back home he planted the vine by the hearth make some cakes for my provision on the journey no do not go aponitolau said aponibolinayen make some for if you do not i will go without provisions not long after aponibolinayen went to cook cakes as soon as she finished ala you come and oil my hair as soon as she oiled his hair go and get my dark clout and my belt and my headband so aponibolinayen went to get them as soon as he dressed he took his spear and headaxe and he told aponibolinayen that if the lawed leaves wilted he was dead 217 so he went as soon as he arrived at the well of gimbangonan all the betelnut trees bowed and gimbangonan shouted and all the world trembled how strange that all the world trembles when that lady shouts so aponitolau took a walk not long after the old woman alokotn saw him and she sent her little dog to bite his leg and it took out part of his leg do not proceed for you have a bad sign if you go you cannot return to your town said the old woman alokotn no i can go back so he went as soon as he arrived at the home of the lightning where are you going said the lightning i am going to get the oranges from gawigawen of adasen go and stand on the high stone and i will see what your sign is so he went and stood on the high stone and the lightning made a light and aponitolau dodged do not go for you have a bad sign and gawigawen will secure you no i am going so he went as soon as he arrived at the place of silit 218 it said to him where are you going aponitolau i am going to get the oranges of gawigawen of adasen stand on top of that high stone so i can see if you have a good sign so he went and silit made a great noise as soon as he made the great noise he jumped go back aponitolau and start another time for you have a bad sign 219 no i go he arrived at the ocean and he used magic i use my power so that you my headaxe sail as fast as you can when i stand on you as soon as he stood on it it sailed very fast not long after he was across the ocean and he was at the other edge of the ocean and he walked again not long after he arrived at the spring where the women went to get water good morning you women who are dipping water from the spring good morning if you are an enemy cut us in only one place so we will not need to cure so much if i was an enemy i would have killed all of you when i arrived here after that he asked them is this the spring of gawigawen of adasen yes it is said the women so he sent the women to the town to tell gawigawen and the women did not tell him for he was asleep so he went up to the town but did not go inside because the bank reached almost up to the sky and he could not get in he was sorrowful and bent his head soon the chief of the spiders went to him what are you feeling sorry about aponitolau i feel sorry because i cannot climb up the bank and go into the town do not feel sorry you wait for me while i go up and put some thread which you can hold said the chief of the spiders 220 so aponitolau waited for him not long after the spider said now you can climb so aponitolau climbed on the thread after he got inside of the town of gawigawen he went directly to the house of gawigawen when he arrived there gawigawen was still asleep in his balaua as soon as he woke up and saw aponitolau sitting by his balaua he stood and ran to his house and got his headaxe and spear aponitolau said to him good morning cousin gawigawen do not be angry with me i came here to buy your oranges for my wife aponibolinayen wishes to eat one for she always has a headache because she has nothing she can eat gawigawen took him to his house and he fed him one carabao if you cannot eat all of the carabao which i give you you cannot have the oranges which your wife wishes to eat aponitolau was sorrowful for he thought he could not eat all of the carabao and he bent his head not long after the chiefs of the ants and flies went to him what makes you feel so badly aponitolau they said to him i am sorrowful for i cannot get the oranges which aponibolinayen wishes to eat until i eat this carabao which gawigawen feeds to me do not be sorrowful said the chiefs of the ants and flies so they called all the ants and flies to go and eat all the meat and rice not long after the flies and ants finished eating the meat and rice and aponitolau was very glad and he went to gawigawen and said to him i have finished eating the food which you gave me gawigawen was surprised what did you do i ate all of it gawigawen took him where the oranges were and aponitolau saw that the branches of the tree were sharp knives gawigawen said to him go and climb the tree and get all you want he went to climb when he got two of the oranges he stepped on one of the knives and he was cut so he fastened the fruit to his spear and it flew back to kadalayapan not long after the fruit dropped on the floor in the kitchen and aponibolinayen heard it and she went into the kitchen as soon as she got there she saw the fruit and she ate it at once and the spear said to her aponitolau is in adasen he sent me first to bring you the oranges which you wished as soon as she ate the oranges she went to look at the lawed vine by the stove and it was wilted and she knew that aponitolau was dead not long after aponibolinayen gave birth and every time they bathed the baby it grew one span and soon it was large 221 he often went to play with the other children and his mother gave him a golden top which had belonged to his father when he was a little boy when he struck the tops of the other children they were broken at once not long after he struck the garbage pot of the old woman and she was angry and said if you are a brave boy you go and get your father whom gawigawen of adasen has inherited and kanag went back to their house crying i did not have a father you said mother but the old woman said he was inherited by gawigawen when he went to get the orange fruit now prepare provisions for me to take for i am going to get my father aponibolinayen said to him do not go or gawigawen will get you as he did your father but kanag said if you do not let me go and do not give me food i will go without anything not long after aponibolinayen cooked food for him and kanag was ready to go and he took his headaxe which was one span long and his spear not long after he went as soon as he got to the gate of the town he struck his shield and it sounded like one thousand people and everyone was surprised how brave that boy is we think he is braver than his father he can strike his shield and it sounds like one thousand when he arrived at the spring of gimbangonan he was still striking his shield and when gimbangonan heard she said someone is going to fight he shouted for he was very happy and the world trembled and kanag looked like a flitting bird for he was always moving as soon as he arrived at the place where alokotn lived she sent her dog against him and the dog ran at him and kanag cut off its head how brave you are little boy where are you going where are you going you say i am going to adasen to follow my father your father is dead i hope you secure him for you have a good sign said alokotn so kanag went on in a hurry not long after he arrived at the place where the thunder was and it said where are you going little boy i am going to follow my father in adasen go and stand on the high stone and see what your sign is so he went as soon as he stood on the high stone the thunder rolled but kanag did not move and the thunder was surprised go at once i think you can get your father whom gawigawen inherits so kanag went not long after he arrived at the place of the lightning and he made him stand on the high stone as soon as he stood on it the lightning made a big noise and flash but he did not move so the boy went at once for he had a good sign kanag struck his shield until it sounded like a thousand people and all the women who were dipping water at the spring of gawigawen were surprised for they saw only a little boy who struck his shield approaching them and it sounded like a thousand as soon as he arrived at the spring good morning women who are dipping water go and tell gawigawen of adasen that he must prepare for i am going to fight with him so all the women ran to the town and told gawigawen that a strange boy was at the spring gawigawen said to the women go and tell him that if it is true that he is brave he will come into the town if he can so one of the women went to tell him and he went when he arrived at the bank which reached to the sky kanag used his power and he jumped like the flitting bird and he entered the town and went directly to the balaua and house of gawigawen of adasen not long after he had arrived he saw that the roof of his house and balaua was of hair and around his town were heads and kanag said this is why my father did not return it is true that gawigawen is a brave man but i think i can kill him as soon as gawigawen saw kanag in the yard of his house he said how brave you are little boy why did you come here i came to get my father for you secured him when he came to get the oranges which my mother wanted if you do not wish to give my father to me i will kill you and gawigawen laughed at him and said one of my fingers will fight you you will not go back to your town you will be like your father kanag said we shall see go and get your arms and we will fight here in the yard of your house gawigawen became angry and he went to get his headaxe which was as big as half of the sky and his spear as soon as he returned to the place where kanag was waiting he said can you see my headaxe little boy if i put this on you you cannot get it off so you throw first so you can show how brave you are kanag said to him no you must be first so you will know that i am a brave boy gawigawen tried to put his headaxe on him and the boy used his power and he became a small ant and gawigawen laughed at him and said now the little boy is gone not long after the little boy stood on his headaxe and he was surprised little boy you are the first who has done this your father did not do this it is true that you are brave if you can dodge my spear i am sure you will get your father so he threw his spear at him and kanag used his power and he disappeared and gawigawen was surprised you are the next then kanag used magic so that when he threw his spear against him it would go directly to the body of gawigawen as soon as he threw gawigawen laid down kanag ran to him and cut off his five heads and there was one left and gawigawen said to him do not cut off my last head and i will go and show you where your father is so kanag did not cut off the last head and they went to see his father the skin of his father had been used to cover a drum and his hair was used to decorate the house and his head was placed by the gate of the town and the body was put below the house as soon as kanag had gathered together the body of his father he used his power and he said i whip my perfume banawes and directly he will say wes 222 his father said wes not long after he said i whip my perfume alakadakad and directly he will stand up so his father stood beside him after that he whipped his perfume dagimonau and his father woke up and he was surprised to see the little boy by him and he said who are you how long i slept i am your son how long i slept you said you were dead and gawigawen inherited you take my headaxe and cut off the remaining head of gawigawen so he took the headaxe of kanag and went to the place where gawigawen stood when he struck the headaxe against gawigawen it did not hurt him and aponitolau slipped and his son laughed at him what is the matter with you father gawigawen looks as if he were dead for he has only one head left he took the headaxe from his father and he went to gawigawen and he cut off the remaining head not long after they used magic so that the headaxes and spears went to kill all the people in the town so the spears and headaxes went among the people and killed all of them and aponitolau swam in the blood and his son stood on the blood what is the matter with you father that you swim in the blood cant you use your power so you dont have to swim then he took hold of him and lifted him up as soon as all the people were killed they used their power so that all the heads and valuable things went to kadalayapan aponibolinayen went to look at the lawed vine behind the stove and it looked like a jungle it was so green so she believed that her son was alive not long after all the heads arrived in kadalayapan and aponibolinayen was surprised not long after she saw her husband and her son and she shouted and the world smiled not long after they went up into their house and summoned all the people and told them to invite all the people in other towns for kanag had returned from fighting and had his father so the people went to invite their relatives not long after the people from other towns arrived and they danced they were all glad that aponitolau was alive again and they went to see the heads of gawigawen who killed aponitolau as soon as the people returned to their towns when the party was over aponitolau went to take a walk when he reached the brook he sat down on a stone and the big frog went to lap up his spittle not long after the big frog had a little baby 223 not long after she gave birth and the anitos 224 went to get the little baby and flew away with it they used their power so that the baby grew fast and it was a girl and they taught her how to make dawak 225 not long after the girl knew how to make dawak and every time she rang the dish to summon the spirits kanag went to follow his father but he did not find him where he had been sitting by the brook and kanag heard the sound of the ringing which sounded like the bananyo 226 as soon as he heard it he stood still and listened not long after he used his power so that he became a bird and he flew as soon as he arrived at the place where the girl was making dawak she said to him you are the only person who has come here if you are an enemy cut me in only one place so i will not have so much to heal i am not an enemy i came here for i heard what you were doing so i became a bird and flew kanag gave betelnut to her and they chewed their quids looked like the beads pinogalan so they knew that they were brother and sister the girl said to him go inside of the big iron caldron so that the anitos who care for me will not eat you so kanag went inside of the big iron caldron when the anitos did not arrive at the accustomed time kanag went out of the caldron and said to his sister now my sister i will take you to kadalayapan our father and mother do not know that i have a sister do not stay always with the anitos his sister replied i cannot go to sudipan 227 when no one is making balaua for i always make dawak as the anitos taught me if i come in sudipan when no one is making balaua it would make all of the people very ill so kanag went home as soon as he arrived he told his father and mother to make balaua for he wanted his sister to see them we just made balaua how can we make balaua again said his father and mother i want you to see my sister whom i found up in the air where the anitos took her you are crazy kanag you have no sisters or brothers you are the only child we have kanag said to them it is sure that i have a sister i dont know why you did not know about her the anitos took her when she was a little baby and they taught her how to make dawak and she always makes dawak i wanted to bring her when i came back but she said she could not come to sudipan when no one makes balaua for she is always making dawak she said if she came to sudipan and did not make dawak everyone would be ill so i did not bring her if you wish to see your daughter father make balaua at once so they made balaua for they wished to see their daughter they sent messengers to go and get betelnuts which were covered with gold and when they had secured the betelnuts they oiled them and sent them to the different towns where their relatives lived and they sent one into the air to go and get their daughter agtenngaeyan so all the betelnuts went and invited the people to the balaua as soon as the betelnut went up into the air it arrived where agtenngaeyan was making dawak when she saw the betelnut beside her she was startled for it was covered with gold she tried to cut it up for she wished to chew it and the betelnut said do not cut me for your brother and father in kadalayapan sent me to summon you to their balaua for they are anxious to see you so agtenngaeyan told the anitos that a betelnut which was covered with gold had come to take her to aponitolau who was making sayang and they wished to see her the anitos let her go but they advised her to return so she went when they arrived in kadalayapan the people from the other towns were dancing and she went below the talagan 228 and kanag went to see what it was that looked like a flame beneath the talagan when he reached her he saw it was his sister and he tried to take her away from the talagan and she said to him i cannot get off from here for the anitos who care for me told me to stay here until someone comes to make dawak with me so they sent the old woman alokotn to make dawak with her all the people were surprised for she made a pleasanter sound when she rang and they thought she was a bananyo 229 the young men who went to attend the balaua loved her for she was pretty and knew very well how to sing the dawak as soon as they finished the dawak she was free to leave the talagan so her brother kanag took her and put her in his belt 230 and he put her in the high house 231 so the young men could not reach her as soon as the balaua was over the people went home but the young men still remained below the house watching her and the ground below became muddy for they always remained there when kanag saw the young men below the house fighting about her he took her again into the air so that the young men could not see her as soon as they arrived in the air they met the anitos and kanag said to them i intended to keep my sister in sudipan for i had made a little golden house for her to live in but i have brought her back for all the young men are fighting about her the anitos were glad that she was back with them and they gave kanag more power so that when he should go to war he would always destroy his opponents agtenngaeyan used to go and teach the women how to make dawak when anyone made balaua so that she taught them very well how to make dawak this is all told by a medium named magwati of lagangilang 14 ala aponibolinayen prepare our things for we are going to plant sugar cane said aponitolau not long after they went to see the cuttings and they were big they took them and planted them when they arrived at the place where they wished to plant them aponitolau planted them and aponibolinayen watered them not long after aponibolinayen used magic and she said i use my power so that all the cuttings will be planted soon they truly were all planted so they went back home after seven days aponitolau went to look at them and their leaves were long and pointed so he used magic and said i used my power so that after five days all the sugar cane which we planted will be ready to chew then he went back home in five days he went again to see them and as soon as he arrived at the planting he saw they were all tall and about ready to chew not long after gaygayma looked down on the sugar cane and she was anxious to chew it ala my father bagbagak 232 send the stars to go and get some of the sugar cane which i saw for i am anxious to chew it she said for she was pregnant and desired to chew the sugar cane not long after ala you salibobo 233 and bitbitwen 234 let us go and get the sugar cane for gaygayma is anxious to chew it said bagbagak not long after they went as soon as they arrived where the sugar cane was they went inside of the bamboo fence and some of them secured the beans which aponibolinayen had planted the stems of the bean pods were gold and they got five of them most of them got one stalk of sugar cane as soon as they secured them they went back up when they arrived gaygayma chewed one of the sugar cane stalks and she felt happy and well and she saw the beans with the golden stems and she cooked and ate them when she had chewed all the sugar cane which the stars had secured she said ala my father bagbagak come and follow me to the place where the sugar cane grows for i am anxious to see it not long after ala salibobo and bitbitwen we are going to follow gaygayma for she wishes to go and see the place of the sugar cane some of you stay outside of the fence to watch and see if anyone comes and some of you get sugar cane said bagbagak to them and the moon shone on them soon they all arrived at the place of the sugar cane and they made a noise while they were getting the sugar cane which they used to chew gaygayma went to the middle of the field and chewed sugar cane as soon as they had chewed all they wished they flew up again the next day aponitolau said to aponibolinayen i am going to see our sugar cane to see if any carabao have gone there to spoil it for it is the best to chew so he went as soon as he arrived he saw that the sugar cane was spoiled and he looked he saw that there were many places near the fence where someone had chewed for each one of the stars had gone by the fence to chew the cane which they wished when he reached the middle of the field he saw the cane there which had been chewed and there was some gold on the refuse and he was surprised and he said how strange this is i think some beautiful girl must have chewed this cane i will try to watch and see who it is perhaps they will return tonight then he went back home as soon as he reached home he said ala aponibolinayen cook our food early for i want to go and watch our sugar cane someone has gone and spoiled it they have also spoiled our beans which we planted so aponibolinayen cooked even though it was not time as soon as she finished cooking she called aponitolau and they ate when they had eaten he went and he hid a little distance from the sugar cane in the middle of the night there were many stars falling down into the sugar cane field and aponitolau heard the cane being broken soon he saw the biggest of them which looked like a big flame of fire fall into the field not long after he saw one of the other stars at the edge of the fence take off her dress which was like a star and he saw that she looked like the half of the rainbow and the stars which followed her got the sugar cane which they wished they chewed it by the fence and they watched to see if anyone was coming aponitolau said what shall i do because of those companions of the beautiful woman if i do not frighten them they will eat me the best thing for me to do is to frighten them i will go and sit on the stars dress 235 he frightened them the stars flew up and aponitolau went and sat on the star dress not long after the pretty girl came from the middle of the field to get her star dress she saw aponitolau sitting on it you ipogau 236 you must pardon us for we came to steal your sugar cane for we were anxious to chew it if you came to get some of my sugar cane it is all right the best thing for you to do is to sit down for i wish to know your name for we ipogau have the custom to tell our names it is bad for us if we do not know each others names when we talk not long after he gave her betelnut and the woman chewed it as soon as they chewed now that we have chewed according to our custom we will tell our names yes if that is what you say but you must tell your name first said the woman my name is aponitolau who am the husband of aponibolinayen of kadalayapan my name is gaygayma who am the daughter of bagbagak and sinag 237 up in the air said the woman ala now you aponitolau even though you have a wife i am going to take you up for i wish to marry you if you do not wish to come i will call my companion stars and give you to them to eat aponitolau was frightened for he knew that the woman who was talking was a spirit if that is what you say and you do not wish me to go and see aponibolinayen and you wish to be married to me it is all right said aponitolau to her not long after the stars dropped the galonggalong 238 of gold which gaygayma had ordered to be made as soon as they dropped it aponitolau and gaygayma got in it and were drawn up and soon they were there as soon as they arrived he saw one of the stars come to the place where they were and it was a very big star for it was bagbagak someone is coming where we are said aponitolau to gaygayma do not be afraid he is my father said gaygayma those stars eat people if you do anything wrong to them not long after bagbagak reached the place where they were it is good for you aponitolau that you wished to follow my daughter here if you had not we would have eaten you he said aponitolau was frightened yes i followed her here but i am ashamed before you who live here for you are powerful he said while they were talking bagbagak went back home after he had lived with gaygayma five months she had him prick between her last fingers and a little baby popped out and it was a beautiful baby boy what shall we call our son said aponitolau we are going to call him tabyayen because it is the name of the people who used to live above said gaygayma so they called him tabyayen and they used their power so that the baby grew all the time soon he was big after three months now gaygayma let me go back down and see aponibolinayen of kadalayapan i think she is searching for me i will return soon for you two are my wives said aponitolau but gaygayma would not let him go ala let me go and i will return soon he said again ala you go but you come back here soon i will send the stars to eat you if you do not wish to return said gaygayma to him yes he said not long after he rode again in the galonggalong and the stars followed and they went down aponitolau wanted all of them to go to kadalayapan but he went alone and the stars and gaygayma and the boy went up not long after aponitolau said wes at the entrance to the yard of their house in kadalayapan aponibolinayen got up from her mat and she had not eaten for a long time when she looked at him she was very happy aponitolau saw that she was thin why are you so thin aponibolinayen said aponitolau i have not eaten since you went away where have you been so long i thought that you were dead no i did not die but gaygayma took me up into the sky because they were the ones who spoilt our sugar cane she would not let me come back any more and she took me up i did not want to go with her but she threatened to feed me to the stars who were her companions so i was afraid and i went with her for she is a spirit when the day came on which aponitolau and gaygayma had agreed for his return up aponitolau failed to go because aponibolinayen would not let him go in the evening many stars came to the yard of their house and some of them went to the windows and some of them went beside the wall of the house and they were very bright and the house looked as though it was burning the stars said we smell the odor of the ipogau and we are anxious to eat aponitolau said hide me aponibolinayen for those stars have come to eat me because you would not let me go back to gaygayma i told you that if i did not go back to her she would send the stars to eat me and now truly they have come i told you i would come back but you would not let me go not long after the stars went inside of the house where they were and they said to aponitolau do not hide from us aponitolau we know where you are you are in the corner of the house come out of there or we will eat you said bagbagak soon he appeared to them and they said to him do you not wish to come back up with us i will go with you he answered for he was afraid so they did not eat him for gaygayma had told them not to eat him if he was willing to follow them not long after they flew away with him and aponibolinayen cried when they arrived up gaygayma said why aponitolau did you lie to me and not return you were fortunate when you followed the stars for if you had not they would have eaten you i did not return because aponibolinayen would not let me you and she are my wives do not blame me said aponitolau after he had lived with her eight months he said now i am going to leave you for our son tabyayen is large if you will not let me take our son tabyayen down he can stay up here with you you may go now but you cannot take our son you will return here said gaygayma yes said aponitolau so they went down again in the galonggalong aponitolau wanted to take them to kadalayapan but they would not go with him no do not take us for it is not our custom to stay down here we are always above they said so they went up and aponitolau went to kadalayapan not long after he said wes at the yard of the house and aponibolinayen went to see who it was she saw that it was aponitolau and she was very glad after one year with aponibolinayen he said command someone to pound rice for we are going to make balaua and i am going to call our son tabyayen from above aponibolinayen had also given birth five days after gaygayma had given birth and they called the boy kanag not long after aponitolau went to take tabyayen from above and gaygayma was very glad to see him when they were talking he said now i am going to take tabyayen down for i want him to attend our sayang yes you may take him but you must bring him back when the sayang is finished so aponitolau took the boy to attend the balaua in kadalayapan as soon as they arrived there he began to play with kanag and they were the same size and looked alike because they were half brothers while they were playing during the sayang kanag said mother it is showering and aponitolau heard what the boy said to aponibolinayen he said it is the tears of tabyayens mother for i think she is thinking of him i told them not to go over there but they went anyway i think gaygayma saw them playing and she cried then aponibolinayen went to take them away from the yard where they were playing she took them upstairs it was at the time when they were building the balaua not long after that they made libon 239 and they invited gaygayma and all their relatives from the other towns and they danced for one month then the people from the other towns went home as soon as all the people had gone home aponitolau went to take back the boy to his mother gaygayma when they arrived where gaygayma lived he gave the boy to her and he staid there three days after three days he went back home and he said i am going now but i will come back in a few days for i cannot live here all the time for we ipogau are accustomed to live below and i also have another wife there i cannot leave aponibolinayen alone most of the time so gaygayoma let him go down and she said yes you may go but you come back sometimes it is good that tabyayen came down and made sayang with us then he went down again when he arrived down aponibolinayen was glad to see him for she feared he would not return to kadalayapan not long after they arranged for kanag to be married and as soon as kanag was married they arranged for tabyayen also and he lived down below and gaygayma always staid above told by lagmani a man of domayko 15 i am going to wash my hair said aponitolau not long after he went to the river and washed his hair as soon as he finished he took a bath and went back home when he arrived in his house he said aponibolinayen please comb my hair take the comb and go to indipan for i have no time answered aponibolinayen if you have no time give it to me then said aponitolau aponibolinayen was angry and went to get it for him what is the matter that you cannot go and get it yourself as soon as he got it aponitolau went to indipan kabkabagaan who lived up in the air was looking down and said indipan you have good fortune for aponitolau will come and ask you to comb his hair not long after aponitolau arrived will you comb my hair indipan because aponibolinayen is impatient and does not want to comb my hair i am sleepy said indipan she sat down ala you come and comb my hair said aponitolau not long after indipan went to comb his hair and aponitolau sat by the door kabkabagaan looked down on them and said indipan has a good fortune for she is combing the hair of aponitolau when she had combed his hair she went to lie down again and aponitolau said to her will you please cut this betelnut into pieces indipan you cut it i am sleepy answered indipan hand me the headaxe then so indipan handed the headaxe to him as soon as she gave the headaxe to him she went to lie down again when aponitolau had cut the betelnut he cut his first finger of his left hand the blood went up in the air ala indipan take your belt for i cannot stop my finger from bleeding come and wrap it said aponitolau to her so indipan got up and she went to get her belt and she wrapped his finger but the blood did not stop so she called aponibolinayen for she was frightened when she saw the blood go up aponibolinayen said what is the matter with you she took her hat which looked like a woodpecker and she went and the sunshine stopped when she went down out of her house and kabkabagaan saw aponibolinayen going to aponitolau what good fortune aponibolinayen has for she is going to see aponitolau as soon as she arrived where indipan lived she wrapped her belt around the finger of aponitolau but the blood did not stop and they were frightened aponibolinayen commanded their spirit helpers to get ginalingan of pindayan who was a sister of iwaginan to make dawak 240 and stop the blood of aponitolau not long after indipan and the spirit helpers arrived where ginalingan lived they said good afternoon you must excuse us for we cannot stay here long for aponibolinayen is in a hurry to have you come to kaldalayapan to see aponitolau he cut his finger and his blood will not stop running and we do not know what to do you come and make dawak ginalingan said even though i should go to make dawak we could do nothing for kabkabagaan who lives in the air loves him we must try and see if kabkabagaan will stop said indipan and ginalingan went with them as soon as they arrived in kadalayapan aponibolinayen said to ginalingan what is best for us to do for aponitolaus finger ginalingan said we cannot do anything i told indipan that kabkabagaan loves aponitolau and even if i make dawak we can do nothing for kabkabagaan is one of the greatest spirits not long after aponitolau had become a very little man and ginalingan stopped making dawak and she went home to pindayan aponitolau became like a hair not long after he disappeared you are good indipan for aponitolau disappeared in your house so they cried together not long after aponibolinayen went back home and aponitolau was up in the air he sat below a tree in a wide field and he looked around the field not long after he saw some smoke so he went as soon as he came near to the smoke he saw that there was a house there i am going to get a drink he said as soon as he arrived in the yard he said wes for he was tired and kabkabagaan saw from the window of her house that it was aponitolau come up she said no i am ashamed to go up will you give me water to drink for i am thirsty kabkabagaan gave him a drink of water as soon as he had drunk he sat down in the yard for kabkabagaan could not make him go up not long after she went to cook as soon as she cooked she called aponitolau and he said to her you eat first i will eat with your husband when he arrives no come up i think he will arrive very late not long after he went up for he was hungry and they ate while they were eating kabkabagaan said to him i have no husband and i live alone that is why i brought you up here for i love you not long after she became pregnant and she gave birth what shall we call the baby said ligi 241 tabyayen not long after the baby began to grow for kabkabagaan used magic so that he grew all the time and every time she bathed him he grew when the baby had become a young boy kabkabagaan said you can go home now aponitolau for our son tabyayen is a companion for me if you say that i must go home i will take tabyayen with me said aponitolau she said we will tell my brother daldalipto 242 who lives above if you wish to take him so they went truly as soon as they arrived where daldalipto lived he said how are you kabkabagaan what do you want what do you want you say we came to tell you that aponitolau wants to take tabyayen do you want to give him up to aponitolau if you let him go it is all right said daldalipto and kabkabagaan said all right so they went home as soon as they arrived where kabkabagaan lived she commanded some one to make something of gold to hold milk for the boy to drink and she filled it with the milk from her breasts in the early morning she lowered her golden house by cords to the earth when it became morning aponitolau awoke and he was surprised to see that they were in kadalayapan why here is kadalayapan he went outdoors and aponibolinayen also went outdoors why there is aponitolau i think he has returned from the home of kabkabagaan aponibolinayen went to him and was glad to see him and she took her son kanag who looked the same as tabyayen and they went to play in the yard aponibolinayen and aponitolau did not know that they had gone to play not long after tabyayen cried for the tears of kabkabagaan fell on him and hurt him so aponibolinayen went down to the yard and took them up into the house not long after aponitolau said to aponibolinayen we will make balaua and we will invite kabkabagaan i think that is why the boy cried aponibolinayen said yes and they truly made sayang not long after they made libon 243 in the evening and they commanded the spirit helpers to go and get betelnuts as soon as they arrived with the betelnuts aponitolau and aponibolinayen commanded you betelnuts go and invite all our relatives and kabkabagaan so one of the betelnuts went to the place where kabkabagaan lived as soon as it arrived up above it said aponitolau and aponibolinayen of kadalayapan want you to attend their balaua that is why i came here kabkabagaan said yes i will follow you you go first when it became afternoon all the people from the other towns had arrived in kadalayapan when they looked under the talagan 244 they saw kabkabagaan and aponibolinayen went to take her hand and they made her dance as soon as she finished dancing she told aponibolinayen and aponitolau that she would go back home no do not go yet for we will make paklon for tabyayen first said aponibolinayen no you care for him i must go home now for no one watches my house not long after she went for they could not detain her and they did not see her when she went as soon as the sayang was over they made paklon for kanag and tabyayen and kanag married dapilisan and tabyayen married binaklingan and the marriage price was the balaua about nine times full for each of them as soon as they both were married tabyayen staid in his house which had been up in the air before kanag staid in another house which aponitolau and aponibolinayen had told by angtan of lagangilang 16 look out for our children ligi while i wash my hair

them where they had been and she was very angry with them do not be angry with us mother for we want to take a walk we were not lost where did you go then we went to kaodanan to see the pretty girls who never go out doors but we did not find any we found some young girls spinning at night but they were not as pretty as we wished and we talked with them until morning for we wanted to see where they lived but we could not wait for them to go back home not long after the old woman alokotn went to cook as soon as she finished cooking they ate not long after they finished eating and they agreed to go at once to kadalayapan the old woman alokotn would not let them go so when they finished eating at night they went to kadalayapan without her consent as soon as they arrived at the place where the young girls were spinning they said good evening young girls good evening the girls answered how are you what do you want here what do you want here you say and we came to watch you spin and we want to talk with you so they talked until morning but the young boys could not wait until the girls went to their homes ayo was still searching for the pigs who had become boys she heard somebody say that three young boys were talking with the girls last night and they said to her that they were pretty young boys ayo said those were my sons i think they have become men so she went around the town looking for them not long after she met them and she saw that they were no longer little pigs where did you come from my dear sons we came from nagbotobotn aunt they answered do not call me aunt call me mother said aponlbolinayen the young boys would not call her mother so aponibolinayen pressed her breasts and the milk from her breasts went into kanags mouth and when she pressed again the milk went into the mouth of dumalawi and when she pressed her breasts the third time the milk went to the mouth of ogogibeng so aponibolinayen was sure that they were her sons the little boys asked her why it was that the milk from her breasts went into their mouths i pressed my breasts to make sure that you are my sons i am surprised that you have become men for you were little pigs that is why you must call me mother not aunt for a long time i have searched for you and when i heard that you were talking with the young girls last night i came to look for you so the boys believed that she was their mother why did we grow up in nagbotobotn with our mother alokotn if you are truly our mother i think she found you and took you away for she is a good woman she thought you were lost and took you to nagbotobotn so aponibolinayen took them home as soon as they arrived home aponibolinayen said to aponitolau here are our sons whom i found they said that they came from nagbotobotn and that alokotn was their mother i told them that i was their mother but they did not believe me i do not believe that they are our sons for our children were three little pigs i also had doubts when i met them but i pressed my breasts and the milk went to their mouths so i am sure that they are our sons aponitolau was glad that they were men for he did not want them when they were pigs not long after aponitolau said to aponibolinayen we are going to make balaua so that we can invite all our relations in the other towns especially alokotn aponibolinayen used magic so that when she put a grain of rice in each of twelve big jars they were filled 246 not long after aponitolau commanded his spirit helpers to go and get betelnuts to send to the relatives who lived in other places to invite them as soon as one of the betelnuts arrived in nagbotobotn it said good afternoon old woman alokotn i cannot stay long aponibolinayen and aponitolau sent me to invite you to attend their sayang i cannot go for i am searching for my three sons if you do not come i will grow on your knee you go first and i will follow but i cannot stay there long not long after all the people from the other towns arrived and they danced until the old woman alokotn arrived the three young boys went to hide when alokotn arrived not long after when the batana was nearly finished i cannot wait until your balaua is finished for i am searching for my three boys do not go home yet for we will see if they will come here to see the young girls perhaps they are near here said aponitolau not long after the three boys appeared to her and alokotn was glad to see them where have you been my sons we came to this town and we intended to go back to nagbotobotn but our mother aponibolinayen saw us and she detained us for she was sure that we are her sons she pressed her breasts and the milk came into our mouths the old woman alokotn was surprised and she went to aponibolinayen and aponitolau and talked with them are you sure those boys are your sons they are my sons they grew up with me yes we are sure that they are my sons for the milk from my breasts went to their mouths i am surprised that they have become men for they were three pigs i searched for them a long time that is why i was surprised when i saw them so i pressed my breasts why were you searching for them did someone else hang them in the tree said alokotn aponibolinayen was surprised and she asked aponitolau if he saw someone hang the little pigs in the tree while she was washing her hair aponitolau laughed i did not see anyone get them one of the women had seen aponitolau hang them in the tree and she told alokotn that aponitolau had hung them up alokotn hated aponitolau and she asked why he had hung them in the tree i went to hang them up for i was ashamed because they were not men but pigs that is why you hung them up you have power if you did not want them to be pigs you could change them to men if i had not found them perhaps they would have died not long after the balaua was finished and the people went home and the old woman alokotn went home after the others she gave all her things to the three boys this is all told by angtan of langangilang 17 aponibolinayen and aponitolau had a son and they called him kanag kabagbagowan who was dumalawi every afternoon soon he became a young man and he went to make love to aponitolaus concubines when aponitolau went where his concubines were he said open the door the women did not open the door but answered we do not want to open the door unless you are dumalawi please open the door said ligi 247 to them the women did not open the door so he went back home and he was very angry in the second night aponitolau went again good evening women he said good evening said the women and aponitolau asked them to open the door you put your hands into the door and let us see if the marks on the wrist are the marks on kanag kabagbagowan aponitolau showed them his hands and they said you are not kanag but you are ligi and we do not wish you ligi was very angry and he went back home five days later he said sharpen your knife kanag and we will go to cut bamboo so kanag sharpened his knife not long after they went where many bamboo grew as soon as they reached the place ligi said you go up and cut the bamboo and sharpen the ends ligi cut the bamboo below him as soon as ligi had cut many bamboo he asked kanag if he had cut many and kanag said yes did you sharpen the ends if you pointed them put them in one place kanag soon put them in one place after that aponitolau said to him ala my son throw them at me so that we can see which is the braver of us ala you are the first if you want to kill me not long after aponitolau threw all the bamboo at kanag but did not hit him ala you are the next my son said aponitolau kanag said no i do not want to throw any at you for you are my father and i am ashamed aponitolau said if you do not wish to throw at me we will go back home as soon as they arrived in kadalayapan kanag laid down in their balaua when they called him at meal time he did not wish to go when aponitolau and aponibolinayen finished eating they said if you do not wish to eat we will go to see our little house in the fields we will go and fix it so we will have some protection during the rainy season said aponitolau so they went truly as soon as they arrived at the little house in their farm dig up the jar of basi 248 which i buried when i was a boy so kanag dug up the basi which aponitolau had made when he was a little boy as soon as he had dug it up they drank it and they put the basi in a big coconut shell aponitolau made his son drink a shell full of basi so kanag truly drank all of it ala dip again and i will drink next said ligi to him and ligi drank a shell cup of basi ala dip again we will drink three shell cups of this basi said ligi when kanag had drunk the three shells of wine he was drunk and he slept as soon as he was asleep what shall i do now said ligi to himself the best thing for me to do is to send him away with the storm so he used his magical power and soon the big storm came and took kanag to kalaskigan while he was sleeping not long after aponitolau went back home to kadalayapan aponibolinayen asked him where kanag was i thought he came ahead of me ligi said i think you have killed him said aponibolinayen for you think he loves your concubines aponitolau went to lie down in their balaua and aponibolinayen laid down in the house and their hair grew long along the floor they laid so long not long after kanag awoke and he saw that he was in the middle of a field so wide that he could not see the edges of it how bad my father is to me for he sent me here he said the best thing for me to do is to create people so that i will have neighbors i will use magic so that many betelnut trees will grow in the middle of the field not long after the betelnut trees bore fruit which was covered with gold he took the betelnuts and cut them in many pieces in the middle of the night he used his power and he said i will use magic and when i scatter all the betelnuts which i have cut they will become women and men who will be my neighbors tomorrow not long after it became morning and he saw that he had many neighbors and he heard many people talking near to his house and many roosters crowing so kanag was glad for he had many companions he went down the ladder and he went where the people were burning fires in the yards of their houses and he went to see all of them while he was visiting them he saw dapilsan in the yard of her house and kanag said to bangan and dalongan my aunt bangan and my uncle dalongan do not be surprised for i want to marry your daughter dapilsan if you marry our daughter your father and mother will be greatly ashamed said dalongan kanag said to them my father and mother did not want me and they will not interfere so they were married the best way for us to do dapilsan is for us to make sayang said kanag so dapilsan commanded someone to go and get the betelnut fruit which was covered with gold not long after ala you betelnuts which are covered with gold come here and oil yourselves and go and invite all the people to come and attend our sayang so the betelnuts oiled themselves and they went to invite the people in the different towns not long after they went one of the betelnuts went to kadalayapan and one went where kanags sweetheart lived some of them went to pindayan and donglayan which is the home of iwaginan and gimbangonan not long after aponibolinayen was anxious to chew betelnut i am going to chew what ails me for i am so anxious to chew i had not intended to eat anything while kanag is away she looked up at her basket and she saw that an oiled betelnut which was covered with gold was in it she picked it up and tried to cut it do not cut me for i came to invite you for kanag and his wife dapilsan sent me to summon you to their sayang in kalaskigan said the betelnut aponibolinayen was glad when she heard that kanag was alive so she got up and told all the people of kadalayapan to wash their hair so that they might attend the sayang in kalaskigan the people asked who was making sayang in kalaskigan and she replied that it was kanag and his wife dapilsan not long after they washed their clothes and hair and took a bath when it became afternoon they went and aponitolau followed them and he looked as if he was crazy as soon as they arrived at the river near the town of kalaskigan kanag saw them and there were many of them by the river he sent crocodiles and they went to take the people across the river aponitolau was the first who rode on one of the crocodiles and the crocodile dived so aponitolau went back again to the bank of the river not long after aponitolaus companions were all on the other side of the river and he was alone for the crocodiles would not carry him across he shouted as if crazy and kanag sent one of the crocodiles to get him not long after one crocodile went where aponitolau was and he stood on its back and it took him to the other side of the river when they all sat down beside the river dalongan said what shall we use for the alawig 249 for your father and mother the singed pig for it is the custom of the people in kadalayapan said kanag to his motherinlaw go and get some of the pigs and singe them said dalongan to him not long after he singed the pigs and he carried them to the people and his wife dapilsan carried one little jar which looked like a fist filled with basi as soon as the woman who was making sayang had finished the diam 250 near by the well dapilsan made the people drink the basi which she carried each person drank from a golden cup filled with basi from out of the little jar which looked like a fist and one third of the basi in the jar was still left 251 as soon as the people drank they took them up to the town when they arrived in the town aponibolinayen was anxious for them to chew betelnut so she gave some to kanag and his wife dapilsan and to some others so they chewed and kanag said to them you are first to tell your names my name is aponitolau of kadalayapan said the man who looked like he was crazy my name is aponibolinayen as soon as they had told their names kanag was the next and he said my name is kanag kabagbagowan who was carried by the big storm my name is dapilsan who is the daughter of bangan and dalongan who is the wife of your son kanag for whom you did not make paklon it is bad if you do not like the marriage our daughter dapilsan we like you for kanag wanted to marry you said aponibolinayen not long after the balaua was nearly finished but the people were still dancing now my abalayan 252 dalongan we are going to pay the marriage price according to the custom said aponibolinayen our custom is to fill the balaua nine times with the different kind of jars so aponibolinayen said ala

they were abashed in the golden house of ilwisan which had many valuable jars in it for the alan had given them to him as soon as they finished eating they gathered again and the alan kilagen told them that ilwisan was the son of aponibolinayen and dondonyn was the son of aponigawani she said the reason that we made your son come to life was that we might have someone to give our things to for we have no children to inherit them if that is so we are going to change their names ilwisan will be kanag kabagbagowan said aponitolau dondonyn will be dagolyen who is a rich man now it is two months

and went to kadalayapan and the gold house of dondonyn went to natpangan aponigawani used her power and when it became morning kanag cried because his golden house of dagpan which was the alans town went to kadalayapan do not cry kanag this is your town we are your father and mother so kanag stopped crying the next month kanag said to his father and mother the best thing for you to do is to engage me to daliknyan who never goes out doors and there is no one to compare with her who looks like the firefly in the evening and her footprints are loved by all the men for they look like the rainbow not long after aponibolinayen took the golden beads which look like the moon to use as an engagement present not long after aponibolinayen and aponitolau arrived at kabisilan good morning aunt danay they said how are you said danay come up and we will eat they went up the stairs and danay took the rice out of the jar and took out the meat and they ate as soon as they finished eating we

whom they invited arrived they fed them all when they had all finished eating now that we have finished eating we are going to settle on the price my balaua must be filled eighteen times with different jars before kanag and daliknyan can be married so they filled the balaua eighteen times now that the paklon is finished and we have paid the price we will take her home and you prepare the food for her to take so they started to fix a box for her with pillows and they gave her a golden hat which looked like a bird and she put her skirt on her head and it twinkled not long after they went as soon as they arrived in kadalayapan they went upstairs and they made her sit on the bamboo floor and they counted the bamboo strips on which she sat and it was an arm span long of agate beads 259 not long after they had a son and they named him dumalawig this is all told by magwati of lagangilang 19 i am going to hunt deer with the dogs mother said kanag no do not go you will be lost said aponibolinayen no i will not be lost give me provisions to take he said and he fretted so his mother let him go and she gave provisions for she could not prevent him from going so he went eyeykota my puppy eyey my fat dog do not catch anything until we reach the middle of the wood which is the place where the anteng tree grows not long after while he was walking the puppy went into the jungle and it barked in the wood he went to reach it when he arrived he saw that what the puppy barked at was a very small house by the resin tree he went up to the house wanwanyenaponibolinayen went to hide under the hearth and kanag did not go out of the house until the girl appeared one night had passed then the girl who owned the house appeared he saw that she was a beautiful girl and they talked it is not good for us to talk until we know our names said dumanau 260 and he gave her betelnut and she did not receive it so he made it very good so that she wanted it after two days after that she received the betelnut which was covered with gold as soon as they chewed you first tell your name for you live here it is not good for me to tell first for i come from another place said dumanau no it is not good for a girl to tell her name first you are a boy and even though you came from another place you tell your name first said wanwanyenaponibolinayen my name is dumanau who is the son of aponibolinayen and aponitolau of kadalayapan my name is wanwanyenaponibolinayen who is the daughter of an alan in matawatawen when they put down their quids they laid in good order as agates with no holes in them we are close relatives and it is good for us to be married so they married three years passed the best thing is for us to take our house to kadalayapan and go there perhaps my father and mother are searching for me no we must not go because i am ashamed for they did not engage me to you said wanwanyenaponibolinayen no we go we must not stay always in the jungle he said so in the middle of the night dumanau used his power i use my magic so that this house we are in goes to kadalayapan you stand there by our house he said so the little house went there while they were asleep the next morning wanwanyen was surprised because many chickens were crowing and many people were talking and when she went to look out of the window there were many houses why dumanau it is not the jungle where we are now where are we she said it is the town of kadalayapan not long after their three children went to look out of the window and they saw the sugar cane and they were anxious to chew it father go and get the sugar cane for us to chew they said dumanau went and he advised wanwanyenaponibolinayen to fasten the door while he was gone if anyone comes do not open the door he went and dumanaus father and mother were frightened because the little house was by their dwelling for there was no little house there before as soon as dumanau arrived in the house of his father and mother they were surprised for they had searched for him three years they asked where he had been and he said he had found a wife in the wood when he had staid for three years he told his mother that she must not go to his house and say bad words to his wife so dumanau went to the place of the sugar cane and his mother went to the house and said bad words to his wife open the door you bad woman who has no shame you are the cause of my son being lost and we spent much time to find him what did you come here for worthless woman said aponibolinayen wanwanyenaponibolinayen did not answer her not long after dumanau arrived at their house and wanwanyen said to him it is true what i told you i told you not to go and you did truly and your mother came and said many bad words i said it was best for us to stay always in matawatawen but you paid no heed now my stomach is sick for your mother came here to say many bad things to us not long after she died dumanau sharpened his headaxe and spear for he wanted to kill his mother because she said bad things to his wife wanwanyen but he did not kill her because she fastened the door as soon as dumanau arrived in their house he made a tabalang 261 of gold and put the body of wanwanyen inside of it and he put a golden rooster on top of it as soon as he finished he put the body of wanwanyen inside of it as soon as he had done this he said if you pass many different towns where the people get water you rooster crow the rooster said tatalao i am tabalang of kadalayapan on top of me is a golden rooster he pushed the tabalang into the river and so it floated away when it passed by the springs in the other towns the rooster said tatalao i am tabalang of kadalayapan and on top of me is a golden rooster that is what the rooster always said when they passed the springs in the other towns dumanau wandered about as if crazy and his oldest son walked in front of him he carried the next child on his back and carried the third on his hip when the tabalang arrived in nagbotobotn tatalao i am tabalang of kadalayapan and on me is a golden rooster said the rooster on the tabalang which was made of gold the old woman alokotn was taking a bath by the river and she was in a hurry to put on her skirt and she followed the tabalang you tabalang where did you come from are you the tabalang of kapaolan if you are not from kapaolan are you from kanyogan the tabalang did not stop and it nearly went down into the hole where the stream goes 262 so alokotn ran very fast are you tabalang from kaodanan the tabalang hesitated a little are you tabalang of kadalayapan yes said the tabalang and stopped so she went inside of the tabalang and she took the body to her house she was afraid of the tabalang because it was made of gold and she was surprised because the woman who was inside was beautiful and there was no one to compare with her as soon as they arrived to her house i whip perfume alikadakad and make her wake up directly i whip my perfume banaues and directly she will say wes i whip my perfume dagimonau and directly she will wake up entirely 263 how long i slept grandmother said wanwanyenaponibolinayen the old woman alokotn took her inside of the house how long my sleep you say and you were dead there is the tabalang they put you in and i was surprised for it was made of gold and has a golden rooster on top of it they used it to send you down the river not long after the old woman alokotn hid her and dumanau who was always wandering about with his children approached the place where the women were dipping water from the spring all the women who were dipping water from the well said here is a lone man who is carrying the babies we agree that we all salute him at one time as soon as they agreed dumanau arrived to the place where they were dipping water and he said good day women good day also answered all the women in unison where are you going lone man who is carrying the babies where are you going you say women i am following wanwanyenaponibolinayen whom i put inside the tabalang for she was dead did you see the tabalang pass here said dumanau it passed by here long ago perhaps it is in nagbotobotn now ala i leave you now women and i go and follow yes answered the women while they were walking they arrived in nagbotobotn and dumanau saw the tabalang in the yard by the house of alokotn and they exchanged greetings good afternoon they said and alokotn took them upstairs so they went up not long after while they were talking this was my tabalang my grandmother old woman alokotn bring out of hiding wanwanyenaponibolinayen so that i may take her home said dumanau and the old woman alokotn did not bring her out because she did not believe that he was the husband of wanwanyenaponibolinayen so she used magic and when she found that he was the husband of wanwanyen she said she is over there i hid her so she went to get her and dumanau was joyful for he saw wanwanyen alive again ala now grandmother old woman alokotn how much must i pay because you saved my wife wanwanyen that is all right no pay at all that is why i stay in this place so as to watch and see if any of my dead relatives pass by my house and i make them alive again if you were not my relative i would have let her go so dumanau thanked her many times and they went back home not long after they arrived in kadalayapan the best for us to do wanwanyenaponibolinayen is for us to build balaua and invite all of our relatives perhaps you are not the daughter of an alan said dumanau why not i am the daughter of the alan said wanwanyenaponibolinayen ala let us build balaua anyway not long after they commanded people to pound rice and as soon as wanwanyen was ready she commanded someone to go and secure the betelnuts which were covered with gold as soon as they arrived they oiled them when it became evening they made libon 264 the next morning they sent the betelnuts to invite their relatives so they went not long after i am anxious to chew betelnut what is the matter with me said aponigawani who was lying down on her bed as soon as she got up she found an oiled betelnut which was covered with gold beside her do not cut me i came to invite you to the balaua which wanwanyen and dumanau make said the betelnut when she took it intending to cut it so aponigawani told the people of kaodanan to start to attend balaua with dumanau and wanwanyenaponibolinayen she was surprised because dumanau had arrived for they had heard that he was lost when he went to hunt deer she said perhaps he met a lady who never goes outdoors who has power when he went to hunt deer not long after ala you people who live in the same town let us go now to kadalayapan for dumanaus and wanwanyens balaua as soon as they arrived in the place where the people dipped water from the spring they asked where the ford was you look for the shallow place said the people who were dipping the water not long after they went across the river and some of the people who were dipping water went to notify the people making balaua that the visitors were there so dumanau and wanwanyen went to the gate of the town and met them there and made alawig 265 aponigawani and aponibolinayen looked at the woman who was the wife of dumanau and she was almost the same as aponigawani as soon as they finished alawig they took them up to the town while they were sitting aponigawani was anxious to know who dumanaus wife really was so she went to dumanau and said that they were going to chew betelnut that is the best way to do so that we may know if we are related said dumanau so they took the betelnuts and divided them in pieces you tell your name first because you are the people who live here no my uncle you old men are the first to tell your names my name is aponibalagen who is the son of pagatipnan and ebang of natpangan who is the brother of aponibolinayen my name is aponitolau who is the son of pagboksan and langaan who is the brother of aponigawani whose son is dumnau my name is dumanau who is the son of aponitolau and aponibolinayen of kadalayapan my name is aponigawani of kaodanan who is the wife of aponibalagen who has no sister my name is aponibolinayen of kadalayapan who is the wife of aponitolau whose son is dumanau my name is wanwanyenaponibolinayen who is the daughter of an alan of matawatawen when they had told their names the quid of wanwanyenaponibolinayen went to the quid of aponibalagen and aponigawani and dumanau laid down his quid the quid of dumanau went to those of aponibolinayen and aponitolau now aponitolau we know wanwanyenaponibolinayen is our daughter it is best for you now to pay the marriage price nine times full the balaua said aponigawani and aponibalagen aponibolinayen the mother of dumanau begged the pardon of dumanau and his wife for she did not know that his wife was the daughter of aponigawani and aponibalagen who was her brother not long after they gave the marriage price i use my power so that the balaua of wanwanyen and dumanau is nine times filled said aponibolinayen and it was nine times filled with different kinds of jars then aponigawani raised her eyebrows and half disappeared and aponibolinayen used magic again and the balaua was full again when they gave all the marriage price they danced as soon as the dance was over they went to eat all the people whom they invited when they finished eating wanwanyenaponibolinayen talked you father and mother you were not careful of your daughter i would not have heard any bad words if you had been careful ala wanwanyenaponibolinayen that is our custom because we are related to the kaboniyan and the alan always picks up some of us said her father and mother it is good that dumanau found you who is your husband aponibolinayen who talked bad before is our relative she is my sister said aponibalagen it is true that i said bad words to her because i did not know that we were related though i am your relative forgive me daughter your father is my brother said aponibolinayen to wanwanyen not long after they drank basi for they knew each other and made friends as soon as they drank they danced during one month when the balaua was finished all of the people went home and took some of the jars as soon as they went home the father and motherinlaw of dumanau took all the other jars to kaodanan it is said told by madomar of riang barrio patok 20 we are going away cousin dagolyan said kanag if that is what you say we must go not long after they went as soon as they reached the middle of the way they agreed upon their destination where are we going they asked we are going to the place ginayod of binglayan said kanag why are we going there said his cousin dagolyan we are going because ginayod of binglayan has a pretty girl who never goes outdoors and we are going to see her said kanag not long after they arrived where the young girls spun at night stay here cousin dagolyan and i will meet you here i am going to see the daughter of ginayod who is asimbyan of ilang if that is what you say it is all right said dagolyan not long after kanag reached the place where the girl was and he talked with her the girl who never goes outdoors said to him if you will get the perfume of baliwn i will believe all you say if you will agree to my mission i will go and get whatever you want said kanag ala if you do not believe me you take my arm beads from my left arm for you are kind to go for me so she gave him her arm beads and kanag started to go at once as soon as he arrived at the place where the young girls spun and had joined his companion his cousin asked what did she say she told me that if i will secure the perfume of baliwn she will do everything i ask of her let us both go no i do not wish to go with you for you will not go with me where i wish to go please come with me and another time i will go with you said kanag not long after they went and they met the doldoli 266 in the way where are you going rich young men it said to them where are you going you say and we are going to get the perfume of baliwn for though we are far from it still we can smell it now ala young men you cannot go there for when anyone goes there only his name goes back to his town but the boys replied we are going anyway that is the reason we are already far from home and it is the thing the pretty girl wants if you say that you are going anyway you will repent when you reach there it is the thing which will make the girls love us so they left the jar and walked on when they reached the middle of the jungle they met a big frog and it said where are you going young men where are we going you say and we are going to get the perfume of baliwn for that is what asimbyan of ilang desires no do not go there for everyone who has gone there has died we will go on anyway for we are already far from our town and we cannot return without the perfume so they left the frog and walked on not long after they approached the place where the perfume was and while they were still a long way off they could smell its odor what a fine odor it has that is why the young girl who never goes outdoors desires it so much they walked on and in a short time they reached the place below the perfume when they were there dagolyan said to kanag take some from the lower branches no it is better for me to climb and get some from the top for i think they are better above than below so kanag climbed and as soon as he broke off the stem which held the perfume his legs became like part of a snake dagolyan looked up and he saw that the legs of his companion had changed to part of a snake he said now my cousin kanag i am going to leave you for you are no longer a man but you are a serpent do not leave me even if i do become a serpent i will not injure you do not be afraid in a short time all his body had become a real serpent and dagolyan ran and went home and the big serpent followed him not long after dagolyan arrived in kadalayapan and aponitolau and aponibolinayen asked where kanag was kanag has become a big serpent as soon as he broke off the perfume of baliwn which the young girl desired he became a serpent aponitolau and aponibolinayen went around the town and told the people that they must accompany them for they were going to see if kanag had really become a serpent when aponitolau and aponibolinayen had killed many animals and given much food to the searchers and they did not find him they stopped searching not long after kanag thought he would go to the river where the people took their baths so he went not long after langaayan was anxious to wash her hair so she went to the river and washed it and doansowan washed his hair first and langaayan helped him for he was her husband as soon as she had washed his hair he said to her i am going to the town so he went and left langaayan alone by the river washing her hair when she had washed her hair she washed her arm beads while she was washing her upper arm beads she heard a great commotion in the river and soon after a big serpent appeared on the other bank langaayan saw that it was a big serpent and she was so frightened that she started to run but the serpent said to her do not run my aunt i am not a real serpent for i was a young boy before so langaayan stopped and asked him why he had become a great serpent because i went to ilang to see the pretty girl and she told me that if i could get the perfume of baliwn she would do whatever i asked so i went i did not want to go for i was not sure that she told the truth but she gave me her left bracelet so i went when i was still far away from baliwn i could smell the perfume and when i reached the tree i climbed it and i tried to break the stem which held the perfume and my companion saw that i was changing to a serpent and he ran away i truly became a serpent and now i have come here and have met you if you do not believe that i was truly a boy i will show you the arm beads so he lifted his head and langaayan truly saw the arm beads around his neck my aunt will you find out how i may become a man again she said if what you have said is true you follow me so they went up to the town doansowan said to his wife how long you have staid at the river my wife i was there a long time for i met a big serpent if you wish to see it it is in the yard he says he was a young boy and he showed me the arm beads of a young girl which he has about his neck i believe that he is a young boy who has become a serpent when he broke the stem of the perfume which the girl wanted he became a serpent he wants to know how he can again become a boy ala if that is what he wants you go and take him to my uncle maobagan so they went and when they arrived where maobagan lived she said good morning uncle good morning he answered the reason i came is because a young boy who became a big snake is here will you please put him in your magic well which changes everything which goes in it and make him a young boy again if he will go into the water even if it feels bad you call him and let him go in so they went and when they arrived at the well the serpent went into the water and the serpents skin began to crack and fall off and he became a boy again not long after they went back to the house of langaayan as soon as they arrived there the boy went to the balaua and did not follow langaayan to the house doansowan saw that he was a handsome young boy as soon as langaayan had finished cooking they called him to come and eat and he said to them i do not wish to eat if there are no girls to eat with me we are afraid if you do not eat for you did not eat for a long time while you were a serpent the boy said even though i did not eat while i was a serpent i will follow my custom for i do not eat unless a pretty young girl who never goes outdoors eats with me when they could not persuade him doansowan said to his wife go and call our daughter amau not long after she went to call her when she arrived where they had put her she said come and eat with the rich young man how can i go i do not know how to walk take the big gold basket and hold on to it while you walk not long after she arrived where the food was and langaayan and doansowan said to the boy who was still in the balaua come and eat now nephew with our daughter who never goes outdoors so the boy went quickly and when he reached the place where the girl was they ate when they had finished eating he said that he was sick but he was not so they went to fix a place for him to lie and he said perhaps i am sick because of the spirit of the young girl so they went to call their daughter for kanag wanted her to touch him and he wanted to see her the girl went to touch his body and he was all right for he wished her to touch him and he said now my uncle and aunt if you wish me for a soninlaw i wish to marry amau i will not go any further to find a wife the father and mother of the girl agreed to what kanag said for the girl wanted to marry him so they were married now kanag we are going to make sayang and invite your mother and father so that they can see that you are a young man again said his fatherinlaw and motherinlaw they made sayang and they sent someone to invite their relatives and someone went to asimbyan of ilang and told her that kanag kabagbagowan who lived in kalaskigan and his wife amau were making sayang some of the betelnuts which they sent arrived in kadalayapan where aponitolau and aponibolinayen lived and they said good morning to aponitolau who was lying down in the balaua he felt badly because kanag was a serpent and he said to the betelnut good morning come to kalaskigan for kanag and amau are making sayang and they want you to come so aponitolau got up quickly and told aponibolinayen who was lying down in the house that kanag and his wife were making sayang and they were happy because kanag was a boy again they told all the people to prepare to go to the sayang of kanag and his wife so they went and when they arrived they saw that kanag was handsomer than before and asimbyan went also for they had invited her asimbyan saw that kanag was the boy who had taken her bracelet and had gone to get the perfume for her and while she was watching him kanag went to talk with her he told her what had happened when he went to get the perfume for her and he told her how he had become a snake and his motherinlaw had met him by the river and had taken him to the old man who changed him again to a boy and he had married the daughter of doansowan and langaayan kanag said now i cannot marry you so i will give back your bracelet so he gave it back not long after aponitolau and aponibolinayen asked how much they must pay for the wife of kanag and langaayan and doansowan said fill our balaua nine times with valuable things when they had paid all they said now we are going to take them to kadalayapan for we have paid all you asked no do not take them they are going to stay here said doansowan and langaayan they will come there bye and bye ala if that is what you say they must come and visit us even if they stay here not long after kanag and his wife went to kadalayapan to visit his father and they staid there three months then doansowan and his wife were anxious for them to return when kanag and his wife returned to kalaskigan they said why did you stay so long we thought you were going to live in kadalayapan and we intended to follow you we staid a long time for my father and mother would not let us return when we wished said kanag told by angtan of lagangilang 21 goto watch our langpadan 267 kanag because the wild pigs spoil it kanag went when he arrived at the field he went around it and it was not injured so he went to the little watch house and he was sorrowful and he always hung his head not long after aponitolau said to aponibolinayen cook some rice and meat for i am going to our field and carry the food to kanag so aponibolinayen went to cook as soon as she finished cooking they ate first as soon as they finished eating aponitolau took the rice and meat and started for the field where their son was when aponitolau appeared kanag took his lipi nuts and he played and the mountain rice which he went to watch was not injured as soon as aponitolau arrived to the place where he was playing come to eat kanag and kanag said i am not hungry yet put the food in the house i will play awhile first when aponitolau could not make him eat he put the provisions in the house and he went home and left the boy kanag did not go and eat the next morning aponitolau went to take him food again and as soon as kanag saw him he took his game and went to play when aponitolau arrived he called him to go and eat but he did not go for he wished to play and he asked his father to put the rice and meat in the house aponitolau was surprised because he did not eat and the provisions for the first day were still untouched he asked why do you not like to eat and he said i am not hungry yet when aponitolau could not make him eat he went home again and kanag used magic and he became a labeg 268 aponitolau said to aponibolinayen i wonder why kanag does not like to eat i think he is sorrowful because he was sent to watch the mountain rice what is the reason that you sent him to the field when the fences are strong and no wild pigs can get in said aponibolinayen you must cook and we will eat and then i will go and get him aponibolinayen went to cook as soon as she finished cooking they ate and after that aponitolau took some rice and meat for kanag to eat aponibolinayen said to him as soon as he finishes eating bring him home do not let him stay there alone that is why he does not wish to eat aponitolau said yes and so he went when he arrived at the field he could not see kanag any more he called to him and the little boy answered him from the top of the bamboo tree his father felt very sorry that he had become a little bird why did you become a little bird kanag come and eat i will not send you here any more kanag said i do not wish to eat and i would rather be a bird and carry the signs to everyone so his father went back home and he was sorrowful as soon as aponitolau arrived in kadalayapan he said to aponibolinayen kanag has become a bird perhaps he felt sorry because we sent him to watch the rice he said that when i am going to war he will fly over me and he will give me the good and bad signs 269 not long after aponitolau started out to fight he took his spear headaxe and shield and he went when he was near the gate of the town kanag gave the bad sign go back father for you have a bad sign said the little bird so his father went back at once the next morning he started again and he went when he reached the gate of the town the little bird gave him a good sign so he went the little bird flew near to him and he always gave the good sign aponitolau was happy for he knew that nothing would injure him not long after they arrived at the alzado 270 town and the alzados were glad when they saw aponitolau and they said to him you are the only man who ever came to our town now you cannot return home we inherit you said the bravest of them ala if you say that i cannot go back home you summon all the people in your town for we are going to fight said aponitolau and the alzado said to him you are very brave if you wish to fight with all of us so the bravest summoned all the people to prepare for aponitolau wished to fight all of them the people were surprised that one man wished to fight with them and they said to aponitolau one of my fingers will fight with you dont say that you will fight with all of us aponitolau replied do whatever you wish i still want to fight you the alzados were angry the bravest of them ran toward aponitolau and he threw his spear and headaxe and aponitolau jumped the alzados were surprised for he jumped very high and they all began to throw their spears at him and they ran and tried to cut his head off aponitolau jumped and he secured all their spears and headaxes and he said to them am i the next now yes because we are now unarmed aponitolau used magic so that when he threw his spear it would fly among them until they were all dead when he threw his spear it flew to all the alzados and killed all of them so aponitolau again used magic and his headaxe cut off the heads of the alzados and aponitolau sat by the gate of the town the little bird flew by him and said the good sign which i gave to you father was all right and you have killed all the enemies aponitolau said yes as soon as the headaxe had cut off all the heads from the dead alzados he used his power again so that all of the heads went to kadalayapan the heads went first and he followed them and the little bird always followed him as soon as they arrived at the gate of the town the little bird flew away and aponitolau used magic so that the heads were stuck around the town as soon as the heads were placed around the town aponitolau commanded all the people in his town to go and invite the people who lived in different places to come and attend his big party he told them to invite all the pretty girls who never go outdoors so the people went all over the world to invite the people to attend the party as soon as the people arrived in kadalayapan they played the gansas and danced and aponitolau said to kanag come down kanag do not stay always in the tops of trees come and see the pretty girls and see if you want to marry one of them come and get the golden cup and put basi in it and make them drink the little bird said i prefer to stay in the trees and make the signs when anyone goes to fight when aponitolau could not make him become a boy and come down he felt very sorry when the party was over all the people whom they invited went home and kanag said to his father now that your party is over and the people have gone i will go down and get the fruit of the trees to eat 271 aponibolinayen said to him my dear little son do not go down and eat the fruit of the trees we have all we need here forgive your father and me we will not send you again to the field kanag did not pay attention and he started to go down so aponibolinayen and aponitolau commanded the spirit helpers go and follow kanag wherever he goes so that he has companions do not leave him find a pretty girl for him so that he will not go down not long after they overtook kanag in the forest and they all sat down and they said to him wait here for us a minute kanag while we find a toy for you no i do not wish a toy i am going down and eat the fruit of the trees no please wait for us it is very near we will be back soon if you do not care for any you will see wherever you go we shall accompany you kanag answered to them yes and they went as soon as they arrived at the well they used their power so that all the pretty girls who never go outdoors felt very hot so that they all came to the well to bathe not long after the pretty girls went to the well in the early morning and their parents did not know about it as soon as the pretty girl arrived at the well the helpers saw the girl who appeared like the flame of fire about the betelnut blossoms as soon as they saw her washing her hair they went back in a hurry where kanag was waiting kanag come and hurry and see the pretty girl kanag said i do not wish to see her i am going down to eat the fruit of the trees and they said again please come it is very near if you do not like her we will go wherever you wish so kanag went with them and when they arrived he flew to the top of the betelnut tree and he saw the pretty girl and he flew to another betelnut tree above her what can i do if i become a man now i have no clothes and headband the helpers said do not worry about that your father and mother told us to give you whatever you wish and we have everything here so kanag went down and took the clothes and headband and he became a man he went and sat on the girls skirt and she said do not harm me if you are going to cut me do it only in one place so there will not be so much to heal if i was an enemy i would have killed you at once kanag went to her and handed the skirt to her not long after he gave her betelnut and they chewed as soon as they chewed they saw that it was good for them to marry for they both had magical power and kanag told his name first and said my name is kanag kabagbagowan who is the son of aponitolau and aponibolinayen of kadalayapan who did not like him and they sent him to watch their mountain rice and he became a bird which is a labeg my name is dapilsan who is the daughter of bangan and dalongan of kabnoangan after that the girl was in a hurry to go home for she was afraid her father and mother would see her for they did not know that she had gone to the well she did not want kanag to go with her to the town but he did not want to leave her and the sun shone in the east the girl went home and kanag followed her not long after they approached the town and bangan was in the yard of their house and dalongan was looking out of the door not long after she saw them what is the matter with dapilsan a boy is with her as she returns from the well said dalongan bangan was surprised and he did not believe it for their daughter never went outdoors if you do not believe it look at them they are coming here she said so bangan turned and saw them as soon as they arrived where bangan sat good morning uncle said kanag do not be surprised because i am with your daughter for i am to be married to her my father and mother sent me to our rice field and left me there alone and i was sorry that they did not like me so i became a bird which gives the sign to those who go to war when my father went to fight i went with him and he killed all the alzados in one town and he invited all the people in the world to his party to see if any of the young girls pleased me but i do not think they came here i did not like to go to the pretty girls who attended the party so i started to go down to eat the fruit of the trees but they sent their spirit helpers to follow and take care of me when i was in the wood the helpers met me and said wait for us here while we go to find you a toy and i scarcely waited but finally waited and they made all the pretty girls go to the well for they felt hot so your daughter dapilsan went to take a bath when the helpers saw her they came to tell me and i did not wish to go but they compelled me as soon as i saw her i thought it was good for me to marry her so i became a man and came home with her if you wish me for a soninlaw i will be very happy bangan and dalongan said to him i wondered why my daughter went to the well i did not believe that dapilsan was there and i am afraid that your father and mother will not like our daughter dapilsan for they did not send an engagement present to us kanag said to him this is why i came here and they sent their spirit helpers with me to find a pretty girl to marry so i will not go down they will be glad when they know that i am here and want to marry your daughter so bangan and his wife sent someone to call aponitolau and aponibolinayen and to tell them that kanag was in kabnoangan before the messenger arrived in kadalayapan aponitolau and aponibolinayen knew that kanag was in kabnoangan for the spirit helpers went to them when kanag went with the girl to the town aponibolinayen and aponitolau were ready to go to kabnoangan before the messenger arrived in kadalayapan they went there directly and they took many things to be used in the wedding as soon as they arrived in kabnoangan they were glad to see that kanag was a man again bangan and his wife asked if they liked daplsan as a daughterinlaw and they replied it is all right for kanag to marry daplsan we are glad he found her and did not go down and remain always a bird so they agreed on the marriage price and bangan and his wife said the balaua nine times full of different kinds of jars as soon as the balaua was filled nine times dalongan raised her eyebrows and half of the jars vanished and aponibolinayen used her power and the balaua was filled again so it was full truly and dalongan said to aponibolinayen the web of the spider will be put around the town and you put golden beads on it and if it does not break kanag can marry dapilsan when aponibolinayen had put the golden beads on the web dalongan said again i am going to hang on the thread and if i do not break it the sign is good and kanag and his wife will not separate when she hung on the thread and it did not break they allowed kanag to marry daplsan after that they played on the gansas and they danced when they had danced all the guests took some jars before they went home as soon as the people went home aponitolau and aponibolinayen took kanag and his wife to kadalayapan this is all told by magwati of lagangilang 22 i am going to take a bath said ligi so he went i am going to take a bath said gamayawn also as soon as she arrived in the river she went to bathe and ligi took a bath further down the stream and he put his balangat 272 on the bank and it flew and alighted on the skirt of gamayawn not long after gamayawn went in a hurry to seize it here is my toy she said and she put on her skirt and ligi was sorrowful and he went home as soon as ligi arrived by his house he went at once to the balaua and laid down in it and his mother saw him from the window what are you so downcast for why do you lie on your stomach said his mother why are you downcast for you say my mother my balangat is lost he said do not grieve it will appear bye and bye said his mother when gamayawn arrived in her town of magsiliwan you alan who live with me look at my toy which i found by the river she said and was very happy and the alan truly looked at it and it was the balangat of ligi and they all laughed what are you laughing for said gamayawn to them we laugh because we are happy because it is beautiful said the alan not long after gamayawn had a baby not long after she gave birth what are we going to do i am about to give birth to a child she said the best thing for us to do is for us to get a thorn and stick your little finger so they truly stuck her finger and the little baby popped out like popped corn 273 what are we going to name it they said the best name is galinginayen for it is the name of the ancestor of the people who live in kadalayapan said the alan gamayawn gave him a bath and he grew about one span for she used her magic not long after the baby was large for she always used her magic when she bathed him 274 not long after the baby could fly what can i do for this baby i cannot work so well said gamayawn the best thing for you to do so you can do much work is for you to carry

they went to the town and they left the boy beside ligi who was sleeping in the balaua as soon as they were far away from the town gamayawn used her magic and all the people who slept awoke as soon as ligi woke up he saw the boy by him again and they at once hid him when it became afternoon gamayawn and her companions went to kadalayapan to get the boy and as soon as they arrived she used magic again so that all the people slept then they went up to the town they looked for the boy but they could not find him and they were troubled they went back home crying as soon as ligi woke up he went outdoors five days later ligi told his mother he thought they should build balaua we are going to make sayang mother for we want to find the mother of this boy langaan said yes not long after they made balaua and when it became afternoon they made libon 276 and they commanded someone to go and get the betelnuts which were covered with gold so that they might send them to invite all the people in the world as soon as the people whom they sent arrived they oiled the betelnuts and sent them to all parts of the world to invite all the people not long after the betelnut which went to the town of gamayawn arrived good afternoon lady i cannot tarry i came to invite you for ligi and his mother and father of kadalayapan make sayang said the betelnut i cannot come for there is no one to watch the house said gamayawn if you do not wish to come i will grow on your knee said the betelnut grow on my big pig for i cannot go she said so it went on to her big pig and the pig squealed very much you get off and come on my knee said gamayawn to the betelnut for she was sorry for her pig so the betelnut went on her knee and it grew high so that it hurt her ala you betelnut i am going now to take a bath and then i will come so the betelnut got off and she went to take a bath when she arrived at the river she was in no hurry for she did not wish to go and the people from pindayan who were iwaginan and his wife gimbagonan and the other people passed by the place where she was bathing when they were going to attend the sayang in kadalayapan they saw the pretty lady taking her bath by the river ala you gimbagonan give me some betelnut so that i can give that lady a chew said iwaginan no do not lose any time we are in a hurry said gimbagonan he compelled her to give it to him so he went to give the lady the betelnut and gimbagonan was angry as soon as iwaginan reached the lady and offered her the betelnut to chew she refused it but he compelled her to chew it with him as soon as he gave the betelnut to her he urged her to go with them to attend the sayang the lady did not want to go but he urged her very long until she went with them she said wait for me here while i go to change my clothes if you want me to accompany you but it is shameful for me to go for they did not invite me she went slowly to their house and when iwaginan and the others waited a long time for her gimbagonan was angry with iwaginan and said bad words to him not long after an agta 277 woman passed by them at the river ay agta did you not see the lady for whom we are waiting said iwaginan no i did not see her said the agta if you did not see her you come with us and we will go to attend sayang said iwaginan to her i am ashamed to go for i have no clothes said the agta no if i wish it do not be ashamed said iwaginan not long after they went as soon as they arrived in kadalayapan the agta went to sit down behind a rice winnower and galinginayen was carried by his father and he took him past all the people and he noticed none of them and when they were in front of the agta he wanted to go to her but the agta winked at him and he did not go to her though he recognized her as his mother not long after the agta became drunk for they gave her much basi to drink while she was drunk iwaginan called ligi now cousin ligi my companion the agta is drunk and she has laid down on the ground i want you to take her into the house and give her a mat ligi took her into the house and he held her by the little finger for he did not want to touch her as soon as they were in the house he put her by the door and he put some old clothes over her and the boy said when he saw his mother how bad my father is for he gave my mother the old blankets which the dogs lie on as soon as his father was among the people the boy changed the blankets on his mother and he sucked milk from her breasts as soon as he had sucked the milk from her breasts he went to play by the window and the guests went below him for they feared that he would fall when they were there all the time ligi went to the house not long after he arrived in the house he saw the breasts of the agta twinkle like stars and ligi took the sharp knife and cut the skin off from the agta as soon as he had cut off all of the black skin he threw it out of the window he lifted her up and put her on a good mat and all the people who went to attend balaua went to where the skin had fallen for they thought it was the child who had fallen and they saw it was the skin of the agta they were surprised not long after iwaginan was anxious to go home ala now cousin ligi i want to go home for we have been here so long a time do not detain us go and get my agta companion so that we can go home i dont know where your agta companion is now for i did not see where she went iwaginan was sorry and he went to look for her not long after he saw her on the mat she is on the mat my cousin iwaginan but i do not like to let her go with you for she is the cause of my making sayang for i wanted to find out who was the mother of the boy now she is his mother the best thing for you to do is to marry aponibolinayen and i am going to marry this woman said ligi not long after iwaginan went back home as soon as they arrived in pindayan he divorced gimbagonan and he went to marry aponibolinayen so truly he married gamayawn as soon as the paklon was over he paid the marriage price next evening iwaginan and aponibolinayen lived together next morning they went to wash their hair wait for me here for i am going to dive in the river said iwaginan so he dived and he went to the place where the alan lived under the water and the alan said eb we have something to eat for breakfast it is a man no do not eat me i came to change my clothes said iwaginan is aponibolinayen here they said no he said and the alan covered each hair of his head with golden beads and they gave clothes to him after that when he went back home they went to guide him as soon as they arrived by the river they saw aponibolinayen how cunning you are iwaginan you told us she was not here and she is here said the alan if we had known that aponibolinayen was by the river we would have eaten you for we wanted to take her they said no said iwaginan and they went home a day later he took aponibolinayen to pindayan and gimbagonan prepared the baladon poison because she wanted to kill iwaginan as soon as he and aponibolinayen arrived in pindayan gimbagonan went to their house and she took betelnuts as soon as she reached the house she gave the nut to aponibolinayen and it had baladon poison on it she gave also to iwaginan but it had no poison on it as soon as they chewed the betelnut aponibolinayen died not long after iwaginan sharpened his headaxe and spear for he intended to cut off gimbagonans head they went to get a medium 278 to make the ceremony for aponibolinayen and when the medium was making the ceremony she said aponibolinayen cannot be cured unless gimbagonan comes to cure her for she used the poison which is baladon not long after they went to get gimbagonan and iwaginan was anxious to get her head but she asked his pardon and she went to cure aponibolinayen as soon as she made aponibolinayen drink of her medicine she was at once alive again not long after gimbagonan went back to her house and when she went back iwaginan said to her do not do that you are not good iwaginan i do not know why you divorced me she said 23 tikgi tikgi ligi if you want us to cut rice for you we will come to work with you said the tikgi birds because we like to cut your rice amasi which is mixed with alomski in the place of domaysi ligi said to them what are you going to do i do not think you can cut rice for you are birds and only know how to fly you tikgi but they still asked until he let them cut his rice ala ligi even if we are tikgi we know how to cut rice if you want to come and cut you must come again because the rice is not yet ripe when you think it is ripe you come he said if that is what you say ligi that we shall come when the rice is ripe we will go home and come again said the tikgi not long after they went home as soon as the birds went ligi fell sick he wanted always to see them and he had a headache so he went home to kadalayapan the tikgi used magic so that ligis rice was ripe in a few days five days later ligi went back to his rice field and the tikgi went also and they arrived at the same time tikgi tikgi ligi ala now we have come to cut your rice amasi which is mixed with alomski in the place of domaysi said the tikgi come tikgi if you know how to cut rice said ligi not long after the tikgi went we use magic so that you cut the rice you rice cutters you cut alone the rice and you tying bands you tie alone the rice which the rice cutters cut said the tikgi so the rice cutters and bands worked alone and ligi went home when he had shown them where to cut rice he advised the tikgi to cut rice until afternoon and they said yes ligi when it is afternoon you truly come back yes said ligi when it became afternoon ligi went as soon as he arrived at the field the rice which they had cut was gatheredfive hundred bundles now ligi come and see the rice which we have cut for we want to go back home said the tikgi ligi was surprised what did you do you tikgi you have nearly finished cutting my rice alomski in the place of domaysi he said what did you do you say and we cut it with our rice cutters now you tikgi i am ashamed to separate the payment for each of you you take all you want said ligi so the tikgi took truly one head of rice for each one now ligi we have taken all we can carry said the tikgi all right if that is all you want help yourself said ligi and you come again after that the tikgi flew and took with them one head of rice each after the tikgi left ligi had the headache again so he did not put the rice in the carabao sled but went home in a hurry as soon as he arrived in his house ligi used his power so that it again became morning as soon as it became day the tikgi went and ligi went also and they arrived at the same time tikgi tikgi ligi can we cut

rice granary when it became afternoon they had finished cutting the rice and ligi went to the fields to see them as soon as he arrived there we have finished all the rice ligi they said come and give us the payment and then you can go home and see the rice granary where you put the rice and all the rice bundles will arrive there directly for you cannot carry them home i cannot take them home for i always have a headache when you go since you came i began to have headaches said ligi why do you blame us ligi because since you came i have had headaches after that ligi went home to see the rice granary as soon as ligi left them they used magic so that all the rice went to the granary of ligi in his town as soon as ligi arrived at the drying enclosure he saw the rice which the tikgi had sent and he was surprised i wonder how those tikgi sent all the rice i think they are not real tikgi said ligi as soon as the tikgi sent all the rice to the town they went home and ligi went to his house not long after he built balaua and made sayang and he invited all the tikgi as soon as the people whom ligi invited arrived the tikgi came also and they flew over the people and they made them drink basi not long after they became drunk now ligi we must go home because it is not good for us to stay for we cannot sit among the people whom you have invited for we are tikgi and always fly not long after they went home and ligi followed them he left the people in the party and he watched where they went and they went to the banasi tree and ligi went to them and he saw them take off their feathers and put them in the rice granary and ligi said to them is that what you become a girl sometimes you are tikgi who come to cut rice for me now that you are not tikgi i would like to marry you it is true that i am the tikgi who came to cut rice because you would not have found me if i had not done it he married the woman who had power so that she became several birds 279 and he took her home when they arrived in kadalayapan the people whom ligi had invited were still there and were dancing the father and mother of ligi were surprised and so they chewed betelnut so as to find out who the lady was the quid of ebang and pagatipnan and the quid of aponibolinayen the tikgi went together the quid of langaan and pagboksan went to the quid of ligi and thus they knew who aponibolinayen was ebang and pagatipnan were surprised that she was their daughter and they called her aponibolinayen and they called ligi aponitolau as soon as they found out who she was ligi gave the payment to the relatives of aponibolinayen as soon as he made the payment they played the gansas and danced for three months as soon as the balaua was over all the people went home and aponibolinayens father asked her where she had been she said she had been in the banasi tree where kaboniyan 280 had put her and they were surprised for they did not know when kaboniyan had taken her from them after that they used magic and the house where aponibolinayen had lived went to kadalayapan this is all told by madomar of riang barrio of patok 24 there was a man named wadagan and his wife was dolimman they were sitting together in the middle of the day and dolimman commanded wadagan to stick with a thorn the place between her fourth and little finger so wadagan stuck her finger with the thorn and as soon as he did so a little baby popped out what name shall we give to this boy said wadagan you ask what name we shall give him we are going to call him kanag kabagbagowan she replied give him a bath every day i use my power so that every time i give him a bath he will grow 281 she always said this when she bathed him and every time the baby grew not long after she said i use my power so that when i bathe him again he will be so big he will ask for his clout belt and top as soon as she said this and bathed him the boy became big and asked for his clout belt and top not long after he dressed up and took his top and went to play with the other boys not long after dolimman said to wadagan take care of the boy while i go to the well and wadagan said yes as soon as dolimman arrived at the well wadagan made a little raft and kanag went to the place where he was working and asked what is that for father what is that for you say i am going to make it for your toy not long after he said my son go and change your clothes and as soon as you change your clothes i will see you when kanag went to change his clothes his father was watching for him he said my dear son now we will follow your mother to the well so they went but they did not go to the place where dolimman was they went to the east of dolimman and wadagan said ala kanag go on the raft which i have just made and i will drag it up stream with a rope kanag did not want to but his father lifted him and put him on the new raft as soon as he put him on the raft he pushed it out into the current and then he went back home when he reached the yard wadagan went into the balaua and laid down and when dolimman returned she inquired for kanag and she said where is kanag why can i not see him here wadagan said i do not know i think he is playing with the other boys in the east not long after dolimman went to ask agtanang and gamayawan and she said to them did you see our son kanag no we did not see him they replied not long after while she was inquiring they told her the truth and they said he went to the well with his father and they carried a little raft which had just been made not long after dolimman went to the west of the well and she saw the marks of the raft in the sand by the river and she sat there for along time and agtanang and gamayawan shaded her while she sat there by the river not long after the old woman alokotn went to the well for she felt hot as she was taking a bath she saw the little raft which was just made and said you new little raft if the son of wadagan and dolimman is inside of you come here so the little raft went to her where she was making a pool in which the dead or sick were put to restore them as soon as she finished the pool she took him to her house and kanag asked for something to eat the old woman alokotn said go and eat it is already prepared so kanag went and ate and he said mother give me that nose flute so i can play so she gave it to him and he played agdaliyan you are feeling so happy while your mother is feeling unhappy and is going to die by the river side said the flute as he played so he stopped playing and he said what is the matter with this flute it sounds bad i am going to break you into pieces not long after he asked the old woman alokotn for the bunkaka 282 and she gave it to him when he received it he played and the bunkaka said the same as the flute what is the matter with this bunkaka that it talks bad i am going to break you he put it down again and said to alokotn mother i am going to play with the other boys no do not go said the old woman but he went nevertheless to play with the boys not long after he reached the balaua and he met a little boy playing with lipi nuts and they played together will you come with me to the place where my mother is while i ask for my tobacco said dagolyan if that is what you say we will go said kanag so they went to the place where dolimman was and the milk from her breasts went to kanags mouth here is my son now said dolimman who was lying down and she sat up what is the matter of this woman she called me her son and she is not my mother said kanag where is your mother then said dolimman my mother is in nagbotobotn and her name is alokotn said the boy ala let us go where is nagbotobotn guide me said dolimman as soon as they arrived she said good morning my aunt good morning also said alokotn my son is with you said dolimman yes your son is with me because i met him by the river near the well how much must i pay you my aunt because you found him and he has staid with you said dolimman to the old woman i do not wish anything for my reason for taking him was so that i might have someone to inherit my possessions because i have no child that is not my mother said kanag to alokotn and she replied yes that is your mother but your father put you on the river when you were a little boy and i found you there and i took you so i might have someone to inherit my things not long after ala my aunt now we are not going home we will stay here because my husband wadagan does not like us so they used magic so that their house in kadalayapan went to nagbotobotn and the people were surprised at the noise made by the house when it went to nagbotobotn they saw that it was a big house all made of gold and they placed it near to the house of alokotn not long after wadagan made balaua because he could not find his family in their golden house wadagan got out of the balaua and said i am going to take a walk and see if i can meet dolimman and our house which is made of gold not long after he went to walk and he did not meet any of them i am going to go to nagbotobotn and see if the new raft went there so wadagan went and not long after while he was walking he reached the edge of the town of nagbotobotn and he saw the golden house and he went to it directly and he said perhaps that was our house for there was no other to compare with it when he arrived in the yard he said good morning good morning also said the old woman alokotn how are you my aunt she said we are well and he asked her if she had seen the little raft pass by and she said yes it passed by here and i took it so they made him go upstairs and when he got up there he saw dolimman and kanag and kanag did not know his father you call me father for you are my son said wadagan to him no you are not my father said kanag if you do not wish to call me so then i will go home and we will leave you here let us go dolimman if kanag does not like me it is all right said wadagan i dont like you for you sent me away said kanag go back home we are going to stay here said dolimman so wadagan went back home and he went everywhere and dolimman kanag and dagolyan staid in nagbotobotn told by madomar of riang 25 there was a man awig and aponibolinayen and there was a girl named linongan ala you make linongan start for she goes to watch the mountain rice you cook for her so that she goes to watch and i go to guide her said awig why do you dislike our daughter linongan do not make her go to watch for she is a girl if she were a boy it would be all right you know that a girl is in danger that is why you must not put her to watch the field no you give her cooked rice and cooked meat and make her start for i am ready to go now said awig not long after they went to the place where the mountain rice grew and he went to station her in the high watch house he commanded her to climb and when she was in the middle of the ladder she was afraid for she nearly fell down it was so high not long after she reached the watch house when she looked down it seemed as if her eyes fell down it was so high ala you my daughter linongan live here and watch our rice i will come to see you do not show yourself if anyone comes said awig to her and he went home to natpangan ala you are so happy now awig for you cannot see our daughter linongan said his wife aponibolinayen and awig laid down in the balaua and aponibolinayen laid down in the room as soon as awig left linongan in the field the tattooed alzados went to the watch house and linongan laid down for she was afraid of them when the tattooed alzados looked up toward the watch house it seemed as if the moon shone ala we will go up and see what that is they went up and when they arrived in the place where the girl was they were surprised at her beauty we will not kill her said the young men to the bravest of them yes said the bravest get away so i can see her if she is very beautiful when the young men got away he cut her in two at her waist they took her body and her head and went home why did you kill her said the young men so that you do not get a bad omen young men said the bravest of them not long after they had killed linongan why does my breast flutter so awig said aponibolinayen i feel sad also said awig ala aponibolinayen you cook food for me to take when i go and see our daughter said awig aponibolinayen truly went to cook for him when aponibolinayen finished cooking ala give me my dark colored clout and my belt which has pretty colors so that i go at once to the place where the tattooed alzados are perhaps they found our daughter look often at the lawed which i shall plant by the stove if it wilts so that its leaves are drooped you can say awig is dead 283 when aponibolinayen thought he had arrived at the field she looked at the lawed and it was green and flourishing not long after awig saw the blood below the watch house perhaps this is the blood of my daughter i am going to see if they have killed her he climbed up and when he got up the body and head were not there so he went down as soon as he got down he sat and he bent his head what can i do where am i going to go to find my daughter he said not long after he took a walk when he reached the jungle he looked at the big high tree we can see all over the world from the high trees this was a side remark by the storyteller the best thing is for me to climb so that i watch and see where the alzados live where my daughter is he said and so he climbed as soon as he climbed up he saw all over the world he looked to the west there were no people there who celebrated there is no one there he said he looked toward the north there were none there who celebrated there is no one there he said he turned his face to the east there was no one there when he looked in the south he saw the alzados who were making a celebration and they danced with the head of his daughter perhaps that is my daughter he said how terrible if it is my daughter and his tears dropped not long after he went down as soon as he got down if i follow the path i will spend much time the best way is for me to go through the woods to make the way short i will go where they are he said and he went when he had almost reached the place where the alzados were dancing he said what can i do to get the head of my daughter and he bent his head not long after he remembered to go and get the juice of the poison tree as soon as he secured it he split some bamboo for his torch as he went to the celebration of the alzados as soon as he arrived there he said good evening good evening they answered he laid down the torch by the fire of the alzados who thought him a companion where did you come from it has taken you so long to arrive we thought that you were dead we did not meet you but we found one lady who never goes out of the house who is very beautiful that is why we celebrate i took long because i was in the middle of the wood for i wanted to get a head i was ashamed to go back home without a head but i did not meet anyone so i did not secure one for i had a bad sign that is why i did not reach the town where i wanted to go and fight he said ala make him sit down said the bravest yes said alzados and they made him sit and they danced again ala you give him a coconut shell filled with basi then he must dance when he finishes to drink said the bravest again awig stood up ala i ask that if it is possible i take the coconut shell for i am the one who must give the people to drink and when i have made all drink then i will dance i will make kanyau 284 so that next time i may be successful he said ala you give the golden cup to him and let him serve us drink as soon as he will make us drink we will make him dance yes they said not long after he took the cup and he used his power so that though he drank the basi the poison which he put in the big jar would not kill him and he drank first as soon as he drank he made the bravest drink not long after he made all of them drink and the alzados all died for he used magic so that when they had all drunk then they all died he put a basket on his back and he went to put the head of his daughter in the basket he took the head into the middle of the circle and he took all the valuable things which the alzados had put on her as soon as he got all the things he went home when he was in the middle of the field he turned back his face and saw four young alzados who followed him through the cogon grass and he used magic so that the flame of the fire was so hot that the alzados who followed could not reach him 285 when the flame of the fire was over he turned his face again when he reached the middle of the next field he used his magic again so that the flame was so high there that the alzados who always followed could not reach him as soon as the flame was gone they followed again and awig shouted the alzados were frightened and were afraid to follow him for they were then near to kaodanan ala we will go back or the people of kaodanan will inherit our heads and they went back home those were all who were left for awig did not give them poison not long after awig arrived in natpangan he went back to get the rest of his daughters body from the place where the mountain rice grew when he arrived in their house he joined the body and the head they looked at her and she was sweating ala awig you go and command someone to get the old woman alokotn when she speaks to the cut on our daughters body the body and head will join better said aponibolinayen to awig not long after ala you spirit helpers go to get old woman alokotn of nagbotobotn so she will speak to the cut on linongan said awig yes said the spirits and they went not long after they arrived at nagbotobotn good morning they said what are you coming for you spirits said old woman alokotn what are you coming for you say awig sent us to call you and take you to natpangan for you to speak to the cut on their daughter for the alzados killed her when they sent her to watch the mountain rice that is why those people are bad for when they have only one daughter they do not know how to take care of her ala what can you do that is their custom please come said the spirits ala you go first and i follow i ought not come for i want them to feel sorrowful for their only daughter which they sent to the field but i will come for i want linongan to live you go and i will follow she said yes they said when the spirits arrived in kaodanan the old woman alokotn arrived also as soon as she arrived she went at once where linongan was lying ala you aponibolinayen and awig this is your pay for although you have only one daughter you sent her to the mountain field said the old woman alokotn to them awig and aponibolinayen did not answer for they were ashamed when the old woman had finished to talk to them she put saliva around the cut on linongan and caused it to join when she finished joining it i use my power so that when i snap my perfume 286 which is called dagimonau to wake up she will wake up at once when she snapped her perfume linongan woke up at once i use my power so that when i use my perfume alikadakad sound of walking or moving she will at once make a movement when she snapped her perfume linongan moved at once i use my power so when i snap my perfume banawes she will blow out her breath when she snapped her perfume she at once breathed a long breath wes how terrible my sleep was said linongan how terrible my sleep you say the tattooed

iwaginan was engaged to linongan aponibolinayen said we do not wish that our daughter be married yet but awig agreed why do you agree awig do you not like our only daughter said aponibolinayen i like

long after they made paklon ala now sisterinlaw how much will we pay said dinowgan to aponibolinayen the balaua three times full of jewels said aponibolinayen ala yes sisterinlaw she replied so she used her magic and the balaua was three times full of jewels and aponibolinayen raised her eyebrows and half of the things in the balaua disappeared and dinowgan used her power again and filled the balaua ala stop that is enough to pay for our daughter said aponibolinayen i pay now yes they said now that we have made the payment we will go home said dinowgan if you do not let us take linongan to pindayan iwaginan will live here and i will come to visit them said dinowgan to awig and aponibolinayen as soon as dinowgan and her companions went home ala my wife we go to pindayan to see our mother

in pindayan iwaginan and linongan went to bathe in the river and iwaginan saw the place where the alzados had cut linongan in her side and he went to make a magical well in which a person can bathe and lose all scars and wounds and it looked as if she had no cut and she was prettier and they went home when they arrived in the house dinowgan was surprised for she was more beautiful than before i made the magic pool and cured the cut in her side which i saw he said not long after when they had been two days in pindayan they went to natpangan 26 dumangan sent his mother langaan to kaodanan when she arrived there she said good morning ebang and ebang replied good morning cousin langaan why are you coming here i came to visit you so they made her go upstairs and they talked not long after they all became drunk and the old woman asked if aponibalagen had a sister and they told her that he had one soon they agreed on the day for the paklon when the day agreed on came aponibalagen put aponibolinayen inside of his belt 287 so they went to kadalayapan as soon as they arrived at the gate of the town of kadalayapan sinogyaman carried cake and rice to the gate of the town to take away a bad sign if one had been seen while on the way they did not like her so she went back to the town and they sent kindiingan and they did not like her either as soon as kindiingan returned they sent aponigawani when she arrived at the gate of the town they were very glad and dumangan thought that aponibalagen had used his power so that the sweets made of rice were not in the basket until aponigawani went to meet them at the gate of the town not long after they went up to the gate of the town and they agreed on the marriage price when dumangan should marry aponibolinayen they said the price was the balaua filled nine times not long after when they had paid they all danced then the people went back home and aponibalagen and his people went back home also not long after aponibolinayen was very anxious to eat biw fruit of tagapolo so dumangan went to get it for her he arrived where the biw was and he got some and in a short time he returned to kadalayapan and he gave the fruit to his wife to eat as soon as she ate it she became well again after seven months she gave birth and they called the boy asbinan as soon as the boy became large he went to play with the girls as soon as asigowan of nagwatowtan noticed the braveness of asbinan she made balaua and she commanded the people to pound rice not long after she commanded the betelnuts to go and invite their relatives the betelnuts went to all the towns in the world and invited all the people the next day they oiled the gansas and the people played them and all the people who heard them danced for they liked the sound of them very much so asbinan went to attend the balaua all the people arrived at the place by the spring and a big storm came and wet all of them not long after the people who lived in the same town as asigowan which was the town of nagwatowtan went to meet them at the spring to give them dry clothes they changed their clothes and went up to the town as soon as they all danced asbinan saw asigowan and he wanted to marry her so he gave her betelnut to chew and they told their names and when they had told their names their quids showed that it was good for them to marry the father and mother of asigowan were gagelagatan and dinowgan but she lived with the alan her father and mother did not know her until she made balaua and asbinan did not know her until the balaua then he married her at once as soon as he married her all his concubines used their magic power so that while he was living with asigowan she would cut her finger not long after she truly cut her finger and died they put her in the tabalang 288 which had a rooster on top of it then all the concubines of asbinan were glad not long after they sent the tabalang along the stream and the rooster on top of it crowed and the old woman alokotn went to see it she stopped the tabalang and took out the body of the dead person not long after she made her alive again as soon as she made her alive again she put her in a well and she became a beautiful girl not long after she became a bird and she flew back to the place where asbinan lived the bird flew above him and he tried to catch it when he could not catch her she went to the top of a tree and asbinan went into his house and he was sorrowful because his wife was dead soon he fell asleep and the bird went near to him and asbinan awoke and caught it the bird became a girl again the same as before and asbinan saw that it was his wife so he was very happy and they made a big party they invited all their relatives not long after all the people arrived and they all danced the old woman alokotn was there and asigowan told asbinan that she was the woman who gave her life again so they treated her very good and the old woman alokotn gave them all her property and all the people who went to attend the party were very glad told by masnal of abang 27 289 when i was a young fellow i went to all parts of the world to every town where the tattooed igorot live who were all enemies mother dinowgan put the rice in the pot which looks like the roosters egg 290 so that i eat rice for i go to fight the tattooed igorots said ibago wa agimlang who was four months old do not go my son agimlang your feet are too young and your hands look like needles they are so small you just came from my womb oh mother dinowgan do not detain me for it will make me heavy for fighting said agimlang as soon as he finished eating mother dinowgan and father dagilagatan let me start and give me the little headaxe and spear and also a shield for i am going to walk on the mountain daolwan not long after he started as soon as he arrived on top of the mountain daolwan he sat on a stone which looked like a bamboo bench under the alangigan tree and there were

for it is bad for me if you detain me for i will be too heavy for fighting said ibago wa agimlang if i return from war i will invite you to attend my big party he said to them and so he went not long after he arrived at the town where the tattooed igorot lived and they were so many they looked like locusts he used his power you my headaxe and my spear go and fight with the tattooed igorot and kill all of them as soon as the tattooed igorot heard what he said they said why do you brave baby come to fight with us for you are very young now you cannot return to your town for we inherit you said the bravest of the alzados 292 if you had said that you intended to kill me i would have killed all of you even though i am a baby just from my mothers womb said agimlang so the bravest of the alzados told his people that they should prepare to fight with the baby and they began to throw their spears at him but they could not hit him as soon as all the spears and headaxes were gone the baby fought with them and his spear and headaxes killed all the people who lived in that town as soon as he killed all of them he used magic so that the heads of the tattooed alzados went to pindayan not long after truly all the heads went to pindayan and he followed them when he arrived at the spring of lisnayan in the town of ibowan he rested and he sat on the high stone and began to play the bamboo jews harp and igowan saw him adolan come and see this young fellow and hear him play the jews harp the harp said iwaginan adolan inalangan come and see your brother if he is your true brother so adolan went truly to see him and he found that it was a newborn baby who was just beginning to walk where did you come from little baby said adolan where did you come from you say i come from fighting the tattooed igorot how does it happen that you went to war for you are only just from your mothers womb how does it happen you say i heard my father saying that when he was young he went to all parts of the world in all the towns said ibago wa agimlang to adolan not long after he gave him betelnut and they chewed as soon as they finished chewing they told their names and adolan told his name first

for i just return from fighting said ibago wa agimlang ala you go first and i will go to see our brother said adolan not long after ibago wa agimlang started to go and he lost his way and he went through the mountain rice clearing of kabangoweyan who was the lakay 293 and he walked through many lawed vines which were wide spreading and when anyone cut off a leaf they smiled as soon as he arrived at the little house of the old man oh grandfather tell me the way back home and i will not take your head said ibago wa agimlang to the old man where are you going he said i am going home to the town of pindayan for i am returning from fighting stop while i cook and you can eat first and then you can go said the old man no i do not wish to eat tell me the way back home said ibago wa agimlang so he showed him the way to pindayan but missed the way and they went through the middle of the reeds and the place where the lawed vines grew and he met the pretty girl who was his sister who had been hiding between two leaves now pretty girl i have found you among the lawed vines and i am going to take you said ibago wa agimlang so he took her and he put her inside of his belt not long after he arrived in pindayan and he made a big party adolan and iwaginan and igowan went to attend the party not long after he took inalingan out of his belt she was a pretty girl who looked like the newly opened flower of the betelnut tree where did you get her where did you get her you say i met her in the place where there are many lawed vines and when you cut their leaves they smile said ibago wa agimlang now brother we are going to chew betelnut and see if we are truly relations said daliwagenan ibago wa agimlang and he called adolan igowan and all his brothers and sisters and his father and mother he gave them betelnut to chew and dagilagatan and dinowgan told their names first and iwaginan was the next and then adolan and then igowan but he said that he was the son of the alan and next was agimlang and then the pretty girl she said my name is inaling who is the little girl who never goes out of the lawed vines which when somebody cuts they smile after they finished

i thought that i did not have any more my daughter and son and that the alan had taken we did not feed you rice said the old woman dinowgan ala my son agimlang do not feel sorry because you heard what

and adolan and iwaginan went home and they did not let ginalingan go back home as soon as igowan arrived in his town he built balaua and he invited all his relatives who lived in different towns and all the alan in the world not long after the people whom he invited arrived in the town of igowan and all the alan went to his sayang and the alan were surprised that dagilagatan and dinowgan knew that igowan and ginalingan were their son and daughter so they asked them they said that ibago wa agimlang met them when he came from war and he took them to his party so they knew that they were their son and daughter for they chewed betelnut as soon as igowans sayang was over the alan gave all their valuable things to him and also those who had taken ginalingan as soon as they had given them all their things the alan flew away and dinowgan and her husband took their sons and daughters to pindayan 28 294 there was a man named asbinan who was the son of ayo but the old woman alokotn took

the yard of dawinisan he said good morning dawinisan will you look out of the window at me dawinisan said to the alan who had spreading toes and who bent double when they walked 296 look out of the window and see who it is the alan said to her he wants you to look at him dawinisan said i cannot go to the window to look at him for the sunshine is hot i do not wish the sun to shine in my face when asbinan could not get her to go to the window he used magic and went inside of the golden cup and he pretended that he was ill in his stomach he said ana mother i am going to die for my stomach suffers greatly and he said to the alan ala you alan tell her that she must look out of the window to see me the alan said to dawinisan come and look at him he wants you to see him he says that his stomach is ill but dawinisan said to the alan tell him that i cannot go and look at him i am ashamed you look at him and then you rub his stomach the alan told asbinan that dawinisan would not look at him and he would not let the alan rub his stomach he said if dawinisan does not want to look at me from the window and if i die it is her fault for i came here because of her the alan who saw that asbinan was a beautiful young boy said if you will not go to look at him we are going to leave you for we fear that he is going to die because of you dawinisan did not wish the alan to leave her and she said ala bring him up on the porch and i will see him the alan took him up on the porch and she went to look at him when she saw that he was a handsome boy she said i am ashamed for i did not think he was a rich and handsome boy when she saw that the boy appeared to be suffering greatly she went into the house she changed her dress and went out on the porch and she looked like the sunshine when she reached the porch she rubbed the boys stomach and directly asbinan sat up dawinisan said to him come into the house and we will tell our names and see if we are relatives so they went into the house and she told him to set down on a golden seat which looked like a fawn as soon as he sat down he said pretty young girl when i see you i am blinded by your beauty i came here because i wish to marry you oh asbinan i am ashamed but i do not want to be married yet said dawinisan dawinisan even if you tell me to leave you i will not do it until you promise to marry me i will stay with you now he said dawinisan replied even though you should stay here one month i do not care asbinan said let us chew betelnut and see if the quids turn to beads with no hole and lie side by side or if they lie parallel then it is not good for us to marry so we shall see not long after they chewed betelnut and when they laid down their quids they were agate beads and they laid side by side so they saw it was good for them to marry ala now it is good for us to marry and we are related dawinisan replied ala go and tell your mother that if they have everything we want and will pay what we want you can marry me asbinan said yes and he went to his grandmother alokotn ala my grandmother alokotn what shall we do dawinisan said that if we have everything they want and will pay it for her she will marry me the old woman said ala do not worry about that i will see not long after they started and took asbinan and when they arrived at the house of dawinisan they agreed on the marriage price her mother said if you can fill our balaua nine times with gold shaped like deer and jars which are addeban and ginlasan asbinan can marry our daughter alokotn and the others replied ala if that is what you say it is all right and we can pay more so alokotn used magic and the balaua was filled nine times with the things they wished and there were more golden deer than jars the father and mother and relatives of the girl said asbinan and our daughter dawinisan can be married now when the paklon was over alokotn used magic and she said i use my power so that they will not know that they are transferred to

went to take a walk and a rich man met them and he asked where are you going you two girls we are going to walk around the town the rich man said come and walk with me when they reached their house he gave them some work to do and he treated them just the same as his daughters the rich man was a king and he put the girls in a room and the princesses mary and bintolada were in the other room the king and the queen gave dresses to the girls but they did not give them any bracelets and rings not long after the two girls went to the house of the jeweler and they ordered him to make rings and bracelets for them like those the princesses had as soon as they went in the house of indayo and iwaginan in the town of pindayan they asked for water to drink after that iwaginan and indayo gave them water to drink and they thought that the two girls who were dressed like men were ladies so they followed them when they left and they took basi for them to drink as soon as the princesses arrived in the jewelers house they commanded him to make rings and bracelets for them as soon as the jeweler began to make the rings and bracelets for them iwaginan and indayo arrived with the basi soon it became night and they ate and drank in the night and they became drunk and they all slept in one room the people saw the beads on their arms and the jeweler awakened them and put them in another room so they did not sleep in the same room with the others and he said i thought you were princes for you dress like princes but when i saw your beads i woke up for i think those two men are planning bad for you go and sleep in the other room so they went into the other room to sleep not long after it became daylight and they returned home and iwaginan and indayo did not see them and they were very sorry for they thought the princes were truly girls so they went back home and as soon as they arrived there they said we are going to make balaua to find out if those princes were truly girls so they began to build balaua they sent messengers to go and invite people in every town not long after the people whom they invited arrived and they saw that the princes were not there so they commanded their spirit aids to go to all the world and find those princes so the spirits became hawks and they flew about the world as soon as they came near to the palace of the king they alighted on a tree and they watched the princesses in the windows and hawks said tingi the princesses heard the word tingi and they were ganinawan and asigtanan they saw the birds from the window and the hawks flew by them and the princesses stroked their feathers because they were pretty soon the hawks seized them in their talons and flew away with them and carried them to pindayan not long after they reached there and iwaginan and indayo were very glad and they made a big party and they invited the king the king had been searching for them for a long time some of the spirit helpers who had gone to the palace said good morning we came here to invite you for iwaginan and indayo sent us they are making a big party for those princesses for whom you are searching for we took them to pindayan and iwaginan and indayo married them when the king heard the news he was glad and he went to the party indayo and iwaginan made him dance when he arrived and kanag and dagolyen went to that party not long after they put those girls whom iwaginan and indayo had stolen in their belts and they did not know what had become of their wives and they were sorry kanag and dagolyen took them home when they arrived home they told their names and they chewed betelnut and they found that it was good for them to be married instead of iwaginan and indayo kanag married asigtanan and dagolyen married ganinawan the mother of ganinawan was aponibolinayen and the mother of asigtanan was aponigawani as soon as they were married and they had learned who their mothers were they built balaua and they sent some betelnuts to invite all of their relatives in other towns iwaginan and indayo went to attend the balaua and they danced they saw that those girls were their wives and they tried to take them back home but kanag and dagolyen would not let them they said it was not good for them to be married even though they wished to be married to them because the girls would become oil when they went close to them so indayo and iwaginan were very sorry ganinawan was the sister of kanag and asigtanan was the sister of dagolyen they did not find out that they were related until indayo and iwaginan took them for their mothers had lost them in miscarriages and the girls became women by themselves and the king found them told by talanak of manabo ritualistic and explanatory myths 32 303 the ipogau 304 are making sayang 305 why do not those ipogau who are making sayang start the balaua 306 correctly said the spirits above those anitos 307 who are married who are kadaklan and agemem 308 say it is better

made diam when they built balaua here the medium names the spirits which cause sickness now you get better you who build balaua 33 310 those who knew to make dawak went to make dawak but they did not prepare the pig correctly not long after kaboniyan 311 above was looking down on those who make dawak kaboniyan went down to them he went to tell those preparing the pig because they did not prepare it correctlythose two who make dawak after that they prepared the pig correctly and the sick person got well of the sickness ala when there is again the repetition of the sickness to the person for whom you go to make dawak do not neglect to prepare the pig correctly so that the sick person may get better whom you try to make well i also kaboniyan prepare correctly when there is a person for whom i make dawak and you ipogau do not prepare correctly when you make dawak after that when there is the person they go to cure who is sick they always prepare correctly because it was kaboniyan who told them to do always like that when some one is ill whom they go to cure they prepare correctly 34 312 the spirit who lives in dadaya 313 lies in bed he looks at his igam 314 and they are dull he looks again why are my igam dull ala let us go to sudipn where the tinguian live and let us take our igam so that some one may make them bright again after that they laid them the igam on the house of the ipogau 315 and they are all sick who live in that house kaboniyan 316 looked down on them ala i shall go down to the ipogau he truly went down to them what is the matter with you we are all sick who live in the same place said those sick ones that is true and the cause of your sickness is that they the spirits laid down their igam on you it is best that you make palaan since you have received their igam for that is the cause of your illness after that they made palaan and they recovered from their sickness those who lived in the same place here the medium calls the spirits of dadaya by name and then continues now those who live in the same place make bright again those igam which you left in their house make them well again if you please 35 317 those who live in the same town go to raidto take heads after they arrive those who live in the same town we go and dance with the heads said the people who live in the same town because they make a celebration those who went to kill when

ones we shall wait the blood of the rooster mixed with rice because they remember to command to make sangsang said those who maganwan of nagbotobotn commanded they took the blood of the rooster mixed with rice which was put in the saloko 323 in the yard they arrived to their master how slow you are said maganwan we are only slow because there was no one who listened to us where we arrived first

put in his mouththe one who commanded themhe spit out like this which is spit out shall be the sickness of the ipogau who remember me said maganwan of nagbotobotn after that it is as if nothing had happened to the family 38 324 the ipogau are digging where they make stand the poles of their houses you go to give the sign said the master of the sign to the siket 325 siket went why do we have a bad sign we remove the poles said the ipogau and they removed that there might be no bad sign the deer went to call when they were digging where they removed those poles which they made stand we remove again the poles said the ipogau and they removed again when they were digging where they made to stand those poles which they removed the wild pig went to grunt they removed again the poles which make the house as before the snake went to climb the pole with which they made the house and they removed again when they were digging again where they made the poles stand with which they made the house the labeg 326 skimmed over and as they had a bad sign the ipogau moved again the poles with which they made the house koling and koling and again koling the bird cried they removed again the log which they made stand with which they made the house the salaksk clucked who flew where they dug where they made those poles stand with which they made the house since they have the bad sign again they say to the othersthose who make the poles standwe are very tired always to dig and dig and to make stand and make stand those poles we go ahead to make the house and they placed their lumber and they wentone family of the ipogau then they finished what they built their house there was nothing good for them and there was nothing which was not their sickness ie they had all manner of sickness my wife said kaboniyan give me the coconut oil that i oil my spear for i go to see those ipogau who are sick when those ipogau who were sick were in their house his spear fell in their house what is the matter with you ipogau said kaboniyan what is the matter with you you say and there is nothing which we do not do for our sickness and we are never cured said those ipogau and kaboniyan answered how can you become cured of your sickness when you have a bad sign for that which you madeyour house the reason of your sickness is because you do not make sangsang the good way is you find a rooster and that you command the one who knows how to make diam of the sangsang to make sangsang i am always the one for whom you make diam said kaboniyan and truly before they had finished making sangsang it was as if there had been nothing wrong that family was cured of their sickness 39 327 the poles of the ipogaus house were quarreling said the floor supports to the poles who were quarreling what can you do if i am not what can you do if i am not said the footboards to those floor supports who are quarreling what can you do if i am not said the cross supports to those floor supports who are quarreling what can you do if i am not said the cross supports to those footboards who are quarreling what can you do if i am not said the floor to those cross supports who are quarreling what can you do if i am not said the wall to the floor boards who are quarreling what can you do if i am not said the beams to the wall boards who are quarreling what can you do if i am not said the pongo 328 to the beams who are quarreling what can you do if i am not said the daplat 329 to the pongo who are quarreling what can you do if i am not said the end pole to those daplat who are quarreling what can you do if i am not said the salabwan to those end poles who are quarreling what can you do if i am notwho am legpet said those legpet to those salabwan though you are legpet you can do nothing if i am not said the gakot because you fall said the gakot to the legpet who are quarreling and what can you all do if i am not who am grass you all decay if i am not said the grass roof to those who are quarreling therefore we are all the same use to the house of the ipogau we will unite our thoughts and breath so that in the same manner the thoughts of the ipogau are united who live in us said those who are quarreling and they united their thoughts and breath after that the ipogau who were sick were cured those who lived in the house it was as if there was nothing bad for that family 40 330 the great spirit lives in the sky and he is carrying the goods of the people he says to himself to whom shall i give these goods which i am carrying i shall take them to the earth he looked down on bisau for the people there promised to make ubaya soon the people saw a man entering the town and they sent a man to prevent him 331 he said let me come in for i bring goods for you your food and animals and other things which you need shall be increased after that he said let all the people in the world know of this so that they will make ubaya for me and i will aid them also 41 dayapn was a woman who lived in kaalang for seven years she was sick she went to the spring to bathe and while she was in the water a spirit sent by kadaklan 332 entered her body the spirit held sugarcane and rice he said to her take this sugarcane and rice and plant them in the ground after you reap the sugarcane and rice you will build a bin to hold the rice and a sugar mill for the cane after that you will make sayang and that will make you well dayapn took those things and went back home she planted the sugarcane and rice when she was planting the spirit entered her body again and taught her how to plant when she reaped the sugarcane and rice she began to make sayang the spirit kaboniyan went again into her to teach her how to make sayang the spirit said send a man to get bolo bamboo and weave it into talapitap 333 take lono and bolo as big as a finger and make dakidak and put a jar with water upstairs in the house dance daeng 334 for ten nights you will pass seven evenings then you will build balaua 335 send some persons to get wood and bamboo and rattan and cogon and take ten baskets with cooked rice to follow the number of nights ie on the first night one basket of cooked rice on the talapitap the second night two and so on when you finish the time you will know how to make dawak and to call all the spirits and you will teach the people how to do dawak when she finished the dawak the spirit sent her to wash in the river as a sign that she had finished sayang he told her to get a dog and a cock she went to the river and she tied the cock and the dog by the water and while she was gone the dog killed the cock dayapn wept but for a long time the spirit did not come when kaboniyan came again he said if the dog had not killed the cock no person would die but this is a sign and now somebody will die and some will be well dayapn went home and when she arrived there she began to learn to make dawak and she called all people to hear her and she told all she had seen and heard then the people believed her very much when somebody was sick they called dayapn to see them and to show them how to make them well so dayapn taught them all kinds of dawak which the spirit had told her because before when dayapn was sick no one knew the dawak 336 42 many years ago there was a woman whose name was bagutayka she had had only one daughter whose name was bagan a boy who lived in lantgan wished to marry bagan but she did not wish to marry him because she had no vagina and she was ashamed her mother said take this little pot with pictures on the outside and this sucker of banana and go to the roadside where people are passing when people are passing you will make them sick in their knees or feet then poor bagan went by the roadside in a short time a man passed by her after that he was sick in his knees and did not walk he only lived in his house and could not move his hands or feet his parents were troubled to find medicine for him for none they found did him good they used all the medicine that they knew then bagan went to see him in his house and told him to make bawi 337 the sick man said to her how do we make bawi for we have never heard about that bagan said bring me a white cloth a basket of rice some thread a betelnut coconut a rooster and toknang 338 they brought all of these and bagan took them then they built a bawi in the garden and planted the sucker by it they broke the coconut shell killed the rooster and took his feathers to put in the coconut husk and they broke the coconut meat they made sablau near the bawi and put the coconut meat in it when they had done this the man who was sick was as good as if he had not been sick he could walk just as before this is the way the tinguian people learned to make bawi 43 339 in the first times kaboniyan told a sick man to go to the mango tree at the edge of the village take a feather for your hair a clay dish with oil a headaxe a spear and a small jar of basi when you go to the tree he did as he was bidden and when he reached the tree the pining 340 were there ala now kill a small pig and offer its blood mixed with rice oil the heads of the stones well and decorate them with yellow head bands when you do this apadel will always guard the town the man and his companion always did as kaboniyan said and when they made balaua or were sick or went to fight they did this they ate of the pig they played the gansas and danced all who obeyed were always well but one man who urinated on the stones became crazy one day when the people were preparing to go and fight against manabo 341 they went to the pining and while they danced a red rooster with long tail feathers came out of the stones and walked around them when they stopped dancing he went again into the stones since that time a white cock has sometimes appeared and once a white dog came out while the people danced 44 342 one night a man saw a woman who wore a black cloth walking near the pining when she would not speak to him he cut her in the thigh with his bolo 343 she ran to the stones and vanished next morning the man went to the guardian stones and found one of them cut in the middle as it is now the man soon died of smallpox 45 344 in the first times the old men saw the stones traveling together down the river above them flew many blackbirds then the people went down to the river and watched the stones on their journey after that they caught them and put them near to the gate of the town where they still remain 46 the evil spirit ibwa once had a body like a man and used to visit the people in those days they kept the body of the dead person seven days and when the fat ran from the body they caught it and placed it in the grave 345 one day when he visited a funeral a man gave ibwa some of this fat to drink since that time he has always been bad and always tries to eat the body of the dead and steals his clothes he comes to the funeral with another evil spirit akp who has a large head long slim arms and legs but no body kaboniyan has told us how to keep the evil spirits away but if we fail to do as he said they always make trouble 47 a man died he had a wife and married son they buried him under the house and made bagongon 346 after that his wife was in the field and was watching their corn his daughterinlaw was in the house watching her baby while she was swinging the baby the dead man said take this saloyot 347 to gadgadawan the girl took it the spirit said to her let me swing the baby and you cook the saloyot in gadgadawan when she cooked it the spirit ate it and he asked where is your motherinlaw she said she is in the field watching the corn the spirit went there when he reached there his wife was afraid of him but she did not run he slept there that night with his wife and he did what he wished with her that night in the daytime he went away his wife got big stomach but had no baby and died the spirit did that because the fire for the dead man was not out yet and she had gone from the town before the kanyau 348 was past 48 one man in solay 349 said to another tomorrow we meet on the mountain to get wild carabao the other man agreed and early the next morning the first man set out on horseback the second man died that night but the first man did not know this when he got to the place agreed he said shsh through his teeth and the spirit of the dead answered a little way off the man went towards the answer and signalled again the spirit again answered and then the man saw the spirit of the dead which was very big was running to catch him he ran his horse at full speed but the spirit was gaining when the lasta 350 on the saddle caught on a dead limb and was jerked away very good that you leave that or i would take your life said the spirit then the man ran his horse until he got to solay when he got there he could not get off his horse for his legs were stuck very tight to each side of the horse so a man had to pull each leg loose and lift him from the saddle that is why we know that the spirits of the dead men sometimes do harm and go places 49 a man and his wife were living in the field where they planted corn and rice when they were there the man died the woman did not want to go to the town because there was no one to watch the dead man she could not bury him the ibwa 351 noticed that there was a dead man in the house he sent one of his sons to get the dead man when the ibwa came in the house the woman took the headaxes and cut him in the doorway the ibwa went under the house his father could not wait for him he sent his second son and his third son the boys could not take the body because they were afraid of the headaxes for the woman had one in each hand the ibwa went there he said to his sons why do you not take the dead man his sons said we could not take him because if we go up in the house the woman takes the two headaxes and tries to kill us ibwa went up into the house he broke the door of the house he said to the woman now i am your husband the ibwa took the two ears of the dead man he ate one and gave the other to the woman to chew like betelnut to see the sign the sign of the saliva was good he made the womans two breasts into one in the center of her chest he took her to his house 50 the stems of the alangtin are good charms against the spirits of the dead and are often worn concealed in the hair or hat there were two brothers and one died the other went to hunt and killed a deer while he had it over the fire to singe his dead brothers spirit came to him 352 then the man began to cut the meat into small pieces and as fast as he cut it up the spirit ate it and as fast as he ate it the meat came out of his anus when the meat was almost all gone the man became very much afraid and started to run and the spirit chased him when he ran where some alangtin grew the spirit stopped and said if you had not gone to the alangtin i would have eaten you also 51 one person was dead in a town they buried him under the house they did not put banal 353 and a plow iron over the grave the ibwa went there and saw there was no banal on the grave so he was not afraid he went there and took the dead man he put one foot of the dead man over each shoulder and let him hang down over his back a man saw him while he was walking in the street the man told the people in the town what he had seen the people did not believe it and went to see the grave no dead man there only the clothes and mat 52 it is good to put some branches of trees in the ground near your head when you sleep out doors so the spirits can not spit on you for if they do you will die one man who had lost his carabao went to the mountains to find and at night he did not find so he lay down near the path to sleep he did not put any branches near his head and in the night an evil spirit came and wanted to eat him but when the spirit saw that he had the skin disease he did not care to eat so he spit on him the man got up and went home but soon he got sick and died 53 when itneg 354 go to hunt or have to sleep anywhere that spirits can get them it is good to use sobosob 355 or banal under them for a mat two men were in the mountains and had no mats to sleep on so they pulled much sobosob and put it under them that night the evil spirits came to get them but did not come very near the men heard them say that they wanted to get them but that it was bad for them if they got near the sobosob so they left them alone sobosob and banal are sometimes put with the plow iron over a new grave as an added protection 54 in the first time three tinguian went to hunt at night they lay down to sleep and one of them who had a kambaya 356 had not gone to sleep when two spirits came near and saw him under the blanket one turned to the other and said here we have something to eat for here is a little pig then that man took the blanket from the other man and put his blanket in its place and the spirits came and ate that man so we know it is bad to use that kind of blanket when you go where the spirits can get 55 a man and woman had a beautiful daughter whom they always kept in the house 357 one day while they were away in the fields the girl went outside to pound rice while she pounded the spirit bayon who lives in the sky came to see her he was like a fresh breeze then the girl was like a person asleep for she could not see nor hear when she awoke in the sky she dropped her rice pounder so that it fell near her home and then the people knew she was above bayon changed her two breasts into one large one which he placed in the middle of her chest when her parents made sayang the mediums called bayon and his wife to come they still come when some one calls them in the sayang the womans name is lokadya 56 in the first times men went to the mountains to hunt deer and hogs one man kept his dog in the open land outside of the forest to wait for the game while he waited there with his dog the big bird banog came to take him away and it flew with him over the mountains near to licuan 358 the bird took him to her nest in the tree there were two young birds in the nest when the bird laid him in the nest he was on a branch of the tree three young pigs were in the nest the bird went away to get animals after it went away the man cut the meat in small pieces for the young birds and the man ate also because the tree was big and he could not go away the bird brought deer and pigs all the time and the man always cut the meat in small pieces after a while the two young birds could fly near to the nest when they were standing outside of the nest he held on to their wings and the birds flew down under the tree then the man took his bolo and cut off their heads and took them to his town and made layog 359 for the heads after the mans layog he wanted to go to alzados 360 town to fight them he had been near to the alzados town about one month while he was away his wife died he came back to the town and in the way he met his wife her spirit with a cow and two pigs the man asked his wife where she was going she said to him i am not a person any more i am dead her husband wanted to touch her hand and his wife gave only her shortest finger her husband said wait a while for me i will go with you his wife said if you go to our house take the white chicken and you will see the footmarks of the cow and pigs he followed the footmarks and while he was walking he saw his wife washing in the river under the tree she said you come and i go with you to own town ie spirit town and i will put you in the rice bin because the people in the town will want to eat you in the nighttime but if they come in the nighttime you must take some of the feathers of the chicken and throw at them and i will bring you something to eat they went to the spirit town and she put him in the rice bin and gave him something to eat in the evening the spirits came to eat the man the man took some of the feathers and threw at them the spirits were afraid of the feathers they did this every night and his wife brought him something to eat every day the spirits said to the mans wife we smell ipogau 361 his wife said no ipogau in here in about two weeks the feathers were nearly gone then his wife told him it is better for you to go home because there are no more feathers i will give you some rice for you to eat in the way i will show you the road the man agreed and they went in the way she showed him the road while the man was walking in the way he saw his town and he asked for his wife they said his wife was dead and they had buried her under his house then he made layog for his wife 57 the father of siagon 362 was head man of patok he walked one night on the road which goes to domayko in the road he saw a big man whom he thought was padawil then he smelt a bad odor and knew it was a ladag 363 he struck it with his whip and it said hah it was night and he ran very fast to the council house and on the way he threw away his clothes when they came to the place where the spirit had stood they found a deep hole there like a carabao wallow 58 364 dalioya died they put her in the ground under the house after a while balugas rice was ripe and was ready to cut baluga went to cut it he went home before dark from his field dalioya came out from the ground she went to cut the rice for him the next morning he went to cut the rice again he saw the rice had been cut but he did not know who cut it he went home again before dark and went to cut the rice again the next morning he saw again the rice cut by dalioya but he did not yet know who cut it he said to himself i must wait for the person who comes to cut my rice after dark his wife came and baluga lay down very still when dalioya walked near him he waked up and caught her dalioya said let me go baluga said no i will not let you go she said if you come with me to get my life i will be very glad yes said he then they went down in the ground where is the spirits home when they got there the spirits were sleeping dalioya said take that green bamboo cup because they put my life in it baluga took it and they went up on the ground one spirit waked up and said there are baluga and his wife walking in our vine way all the spirits ran to catch them when the spirits were going up in the vine baluga cut the vine with his bolo the spirits fell down baluga and his wife went home as soon as they reached their home they made a party there were many people there on that big day they were drinking basi eating rice and meat and singing and dancing because they were having a good time that party lasted two days after that the people went home baluga and dalioya went to cut their rice 59 the alan 365 once found

happened not very long ago 60 in the old times malilipeng was walking along the trail in the woods when he heard the alan 370 in the trees he laid down on his face as if dead and the alan who saw him began to wail for they thought he was dead when they brought gold and beads to place on him he sprang up and drove them away give us the one bead which is nagaba or we will burn your house said the alan the man refused when he reached home his house was burned but he still had the bead 61 two men went to hunt wild pig they killed one but had no fire to singe it so one man climbed a tree to see if he could see where was a fire he saw a little fire at a distance and went to get it when he got where the fire was he saw it was in the house of an alan he was very much afraid but he went up and saw the alan who had a baby was asleep he walked very quietly but the alan woke up and said what do you want i want fire for we have killed a little wild pig do not say little pig but larger said the alan larger said the man for he was afraid do not say larger but big said alan big do not say big but very big said the alan very big said the man then the alan gave him the fire and she took her big basket and went with him to where the pig was they singed the pig and the alan cut it up with her nails then she gave the liver to the man and told him to take it to her house and feed the baby the man went but on the way he ate the liver when he got to the house he saw a big caldron with hot water on the fire he took the alans baby and put it in the hot water and then went back did the baby eat well asked the alan very well he answered then the alan put most of the meat in her basket and started home the man told his companion what he had done and they were both very much afraid so they ran to hide when the alan got home she saw the baby dead in the water then she went to find the men they had climbed a high tree which stood near the water and when the alan looked in the water she saw them in it she put her hand in the water and tried to get them but could not then she looked up and saw them again how did you get up there she asked we climbed up feet first then the alan seized a vine and started up the tree feet first when she had almost reached them they cut the vine and the alan fell to the ground and was dead the men came down from the tree and went to the house of the alan when they got there they saw three jars the first was full of dung the second of beads the third of gold they took the jars with the beads and gold and went home 62 the earth which is very flat was made by the great spirit kadaklan he also made the sun and moon which chase each other over and under the earth sometimes the moon almost catches the sun but it always gets tired and gives up before it succeeds the sun and moon are the lights of kadaklan and so are the stones which are stars the dog of kadaklan is the lightning 63 kaboniyan once sent a flood which covered all the land there was no place for the fire to go so it went into the bamboo the stones and the iron now that is why you can get fire out of the bamboo and stones 64 a man planted rice in the high land when it was grown he saw that something was eating it though he had a fence around it one night he went to watch his field about midnight he heard many wings and saw some big animals with wings alight in his rice he ran and caught one and cut off its wings the animal was pregnant and soon had a young one since then there have been horses on the earth but people have never seen any more fly you can see the place on the horses legs where the wings used to be 65 a lazy man was planting corn in the high land he would plant a few seeds and then put his planting stick in the ground and lean back on it after a while the stick grew there and was a tail and the man became a monkey 371 66 a very lazy boy got a piece of sugarcane and went home with it when he got home he told his mother to take off the outside of the stalk so he might eat it his mother was angry to see him so lazy and told him that if he could not take it off himself to stick it up his anus he did so and became a monkey 67 a very lazy girl would not learn to spin and always pretended that she did not know how one day she took the cotton and asked the women what to do with it beat it out they said then she asked what shall i do with it then put it in a betel leaf on a stick and spin it again she asked how shall i spin it if you do not know how to spin put the stick up your anus she did so and became a monkey after that there were many monkeys 68 372 in an early time the tinguian were like the alzado 373 and hunted heads the men from one town started to another on the other side of the abra river to get heads while they were on the way it rained very hard and when they reached the river they could not get across so they prayed to the spirit that he would give them wings to cross they at once became birds but when they reached the other side of the river they could not resume the forms of men some of the mens wives had just died and they had bark bands on their heads as is the tinguian custom when these became birds their heads were white but those of the others were black and so they are to this day 69 a mother had a very lazy boy who could do nothing one day she went away to get something and she put a big basket over the boy when she came home she took the basket up but instead of the boy there was a bird which flew away crying sigakok sigakok sigakoklazy lazy lazy and so that bird is called sigakok 70 a long time ago there was a young man who cut all the trees in a little wood when he had cut up them he burned them and he planted rice in the field in a few days the rice was ready to cut and the young man went to find a girl for him to marry he found a girl in the other town he married her and he took her with him to his home when they got home the man said to his wife let us go to see our rice they went to see the rice at midday they went home the next day the man sent his wife to go to cut the rice when she got to the rice she thought to herself that she could not cut it in a month said she to herself i want to be a bird she lay down on the floor in a little house that the man had made she put her hat over her to be her blanket then she became a bird which we call kakok now her cloth became her feathers in the morning the man went with some rice for his wife to eat when he got there he could not see his wife he walked and walked but he did not find her then he came to the little house he saw his wifes hat and he picked it up the bird flew away crying kakok kakok 71 in the first time ganoway was the man who possessed a dog which caught many deer and kaboniyan allowed the dog pursued the deer which went in a cave in the rock the dog went in also and ganoway followed into the hole in the rock he walked always following the dog which was barking and he felt the shrubs which he touched the shrubs all had fruit which tinkled when he touched them then he broke off those branches which tinkled as he touched them and kaboniyan allowed he came to the end of the cave in the rock which was at the river makatbay and his dog was there for he had already caught the deer which was a buck it was light in the place where he was at the river makatbay and he looked at the shrub which he had broken off in the dark place in the cave he saw that the shrub was denglay which bore fruitthe choice agate bead which is good for the tinguian dress he was glad he cut up the deer into pieces and placed it on a bamboo pole which he carried he thought always of the beads and wished to return to that shrub which he touched he returned and searched but was not able to find it and because he failed he returned to his home in annay there was not one who did not envy him those beads which he brought home and they asked him to show them the way to the cave he showed them the hole in the rock where he and his dog had gone in they took torches and walked always walked but at last they were not able to go further for the rest of the cave was closed that place is now called ganoway for he was the one who secured the beads which grew in the cave of kaboniyan which cave the spirit always keeps clean 374 72 magsawi my jar when it was not yet broken talked softly but now its lines are broken and the low tones are insufficient for us to understand the jar was not made where the chinese are but belongs to the spirits or kaboniyan because my father and grandfather from whom i inherited it said that in the first times they the tinguian hunted magsawi on the mountains and in the wooded hills my ancestors thought that their dog had brought a deer to bay which he was catching and they hurried to assist it they saw the jar and tried to catch it but were unable sometimes it disappeared sometimes it appeared again and because they could not catch it they went again to the wooded hill on their way to their town then they heard a voice speaking words which they understood but they could see no man the words it spoke were you secure a pig a sow without young and take its blood so that you may catch the jar which your dog pursued they obeyed and went to secure the blood the dog again brought to bay the jar which belonged to kaboniyan they plainly saw the jar go through a hole in the rock which is a cave and there it was cornered so that they captured the pretty jar which is magsawi which i inherited told by cabildo of patok the owner of the famous talking jar magsawi 73 once then sun and moon fought the sun said you are moon not so good if i give you no light you are no good the moon answered you are sun and very hot i am moon and am better the women like me very much and when i shine they go out doors to spin then the sun was very angry and took some sand and threw it on the moon and that is why there are dark places on the moon now 74 in the old time a man went with others to get heads they were gone very very long and the mans daughter who was little when he went away was grown up and beautiful when he returned when he got to the gate of the town his daughter went to hold the ladder for him to come in 375 the man did not recognize his daughter and when he saw her holding the ladder for him he threw his arms around the ladder and seized and kissed her the girl was very sorrowful because her father had not recognized her and had misunderstood her intentions so she went home and said to her mother it is better now that i become a coconut tree to stand close by our house in the morning the man and his wife missed the girl and when they looked out doors there stood a fine coconut tree close to the house so they knew that she had changed to the tree 75 in the old times there were two flying snakes in the gap of the abra river 376 many men had been killed by them so the head man of abra invited malona and biwag two very brave men from cagayan to come and help him kill the snakes they came at once with big bolos shields and the trunk of the banana tree which they used to fight with when they arrived they were taken to the gap and the snakes attacked them the men fought with the trunk of the banana tree and the wings of the snakes stuck to the trunk so they killed them easily when they had killed them they came back to the leader and showed him and he asked what should be their pay they did not ask any reward but the leader gave them gold in the form of deer and horses then they went home and after that the people of abra could pass through the gap 76 hundreds of years ago there were two people who were husband and wife their names were tagpen and giben and they had only one son whose name was soliben those people came from ilocos norte they came down to vigan to pass a while then came into the abra river when they were in banong they sailed on a raft in the abra river to come up to langiden when they reached that town they stopped there to stay a short time because tagpen went to the town to give thoughts to the people there and to give a nice face to the girls when tagpen was in the town in langiden his son soliben was weeping on the raft by his mother sleep sleep sleep my dear son because your father is not here yet ittotes ittotes so sleep my son do not weep said his mother whose name is giben when tagpen came back from the town of langiden they began to sail again until they came to pidigan when they reached the town of pidigan they stopped there because tagpen went to the town to give a nice face to the ladies and girls then his son wept again oh dear son sleep sleep sleep oh dear son sleep sleep sleep for your father is not here yet when he comes back he will get bananas for you to eat ittotes ittotes ittotes sleep soliben sleep my son do not weep your father will give you to eat said the mother in a short time tagpen came back from the town and they sailed to come up when they reached the mouth of the sinalang river they came up in the river they sailed up here this is the river of sinalang town patok we go there to give the people some nice face and good thoughts so they will be very wise when they arrived in sinalang town they left their raft in the river and went up in the town when they reached the town every person went to them to give their regards tagpen and his wife with her son stayed in a little house we call balaua they lived there teaching many dalengs 377 and bagayos of the tinguian people fables 77 the turtle and the monkey there was once a turtle and a monkey who went to make a clearing the monkey did not work but the turtle was the one which cleared the land when one day passed let us go to plant said the turtle they went and banana was what they went to plant the turtle planted his in the clearing but the monkey hung his in a tree when he went to climb five days passed let us go to see our planting said the turtle when they arrived where they had planted the monkey saw that his banana was dry but that which the turtle had planted bore ripe fruit when the monkey reached the place where the turtle sat i am waiting for you monkey for i cannot climb my banana tree give me fruit and i will go to climb my banana which i hung in the tree did not bear fruit said the monkey the turtle laughed and agreed but when the monkey climbed in the tree he only ate and did not throw down any fruit give me monkey said the turtle the thumb still eats replied the monkey then he pushed a banana up his anus and after that threw it down the turtle ate it and again asked for fruit the little finger still eats said the monkey then he finished eating the fruit and he slept on the banana tree the turtle went to search for long sharp shells and when he had secured them he planted them upright around the tree and cried bad in the east bad in the west then the monkey jumped and the shells pierced his side so that he died the turtle dried his meat and sold it to the other monkeys and when he had finished selling he went under the house and hid beneath a coconut shell when all the monkeys had eaten the turtle cried they eat their relative then the monkeys heard but could not see the turtle called many times until at last they found him beneath the coconut shell they agreed to kill him with the axe but the turtle laughed and pointed to the marks on his back 378 the monkeys believed him when he said he had often been cut by his father and grandfather so they did not cut but went to get fire you cannot kill me with that do you not see that my back is almost black from burning ayay said the monkeys let us tie a stone to his waist and drown him in the lake the turtle cried and begged them to spare him but the monkeys did not know that the water was the cause of his living for it was his home they threw him in the lake and when they had watched a long time they saw him float on the water and he was holding a large fish then all the monkeys tied stones to their waists and dived in the lake to catch fish they did not float in the lake but they died only a pregnant monkey was left but the turtle came and drowned her also 379 78 a turtle and a big lizard went to the field of gotgotapa to steal ginger when they got there the turtle told the lizard he must be very still but when the lizard tasted the

turtle could not run fast so he lay very still and the man did not see him but the lizard ran and the man chased him when they were very far the turtle went into the house now the man had a coconut shell which he used to sit on and the turtle hid under it the man could not catch the lizard so in a while he came back to his house and sat on the shell bye and bye the turtle called kook then the man jumped up and looked all around to find where the noise came from but he could not find the turtle called kook again and the man tried very hard to find what made the noise the turtle called a third time more loudly and then the man thought it was his testicles which made the noise so he took a stone and hit them then he died and the turtle ran away when the turtle got a long way he met the lizard again and they saw some honey on the branch of a tree i run first to get said the turtle but the big lizard ran fast and seized the honey then the bees stung him and he ran back to the turtle

house was small and had no floor only the boards to put the floor on he went to the forest to cut bamboo with which to make a floor and he carried cooked rice with him when he got there he hung the rice in a tree and went to cut the bamboo while he was gone a cat came and ate the rice so when the man got hungry and came to eat he had no rice so he went home the next day he went to cut again and when he had hung the rice in the tree the cat came to eat it the third day he went again and hung the rice in the tree but fixed it in a trap then he hid in some brush and did not cut bamboo the cat came to eat the rice and was caught then the man said i will kill you no said the cat do not kill me alright then i take you home to watch my house said the man then he took the cat home and tied it near the door of his house and went away when he came back the cat had become a cock now i go to the cock fight at magsingal 391 said dogidog and he put his rooster under his arm and started for the place he was crossing a river when he met a crocodile where are you going dogidog said the crocodile to the cock fight at magsingal said the man wait i go with you said the crocodile then they went

sink in the water i can beat him the deer said if any man wants to run i am very fast then the earth said if any man wants to wrestle i know very well how to do the monkey said if any man wants to climb i can go higher then they took the rooster to the place of the fighting and dogidog had him fight the other rooster but the rooster had been a cat before and he seized the other rooster in his claws as a cat does and killed it then the people brought many roosters and bet much money and the rooster of dogidog which was a cat before killed them all so there were no more roosters in magsingal and dogidog won much money the people wanted some other sport so they brought a man who could stay very long under water and dogidog had him try with the crocodile after more than two hours the man had to come up first then the people brought a man who runs very fast and the deer raced with him and the man could not beat the deer for he was very fast then they brought a very big man but he could not throw the earth last the people brought a man who climbs very well and the monkey climbed with him and went much higher than the man dogidog had very much money and he bought two horses to carry the sacks of silver to his house when he got near to the town he tied his horses and went to tell his mother to go and ask to buy the good house from the rich man how can you buy said the rich man when you have no money then his mother went home and the man went to get two sacks of money to send to the rich man when the rich man saw so much money he said yes for the money was in sacks and was not counted then dogidog went to live in the good house and the rich man still had no house so he had no where to go when the rain came 90 a woodchopper went to the woods when he passed where the brook ran go away go away he said to banbantay the spirit of the brook he heard a voice in the thicket the voice said i should think he would see me the man answered yes i see you the spirit said where am i now the man answered you are in the thicket the spirit came down and said put my poncho on you when he has it on no one can see him 393 see if i really can see you in my poncho the man took the poncho and put it on then the spirit could not see him any more because the cloth made him invisible then the man went home when he reached there he said to his wife wife where am i now she cried because she thought him dead he said do not cry for i am not dead but i have received a poncho which makes me invisible the man took off his poncho and embraced his wife which made his wife laugh at him for she knew then that her husband was powerful 91 a fisherman went to catch fish with his throw net while he was fishing a big bird banog saw him it seized the man put him on its back and flew away it lighted on a very big tree in the forest in the thicket there was a nest with two small banog in it after the bird had put the man near the nest it flew away again and the nestlings wished to eat the man but he defended himself so they could not eat him he took one in each hand and jumped from the tree and the young birds broke his fall so that he was not hurt the man was much frightened by the things which had happened to him and he ran to his home when he arrived home he told with tears what had happened to him his family were very happy over his return and made him promise not to

aposir and the attributive copulate ni thus the original form of aponitolau probably was apo ni tolau literally sir who is tolau however the storytellers do not now appear to divide the names into their component parts and they frequently corrected the writer when he did so for this reason such names appear in the text as single words following this explanation it is possible that the name aponibolinayen may be derived from apo ni bolan yan literally sir mistress who is place where the moon but bolan generally refers to the space of time between the phases of the moon rather than to the moon itself the proper term for moon is sinag which we have seen is the mother of gaygaymaa starand is clearly differentiated from aponibolinayen 4 malemale femalefemale 5 occasionally the
