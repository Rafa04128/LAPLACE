with their applications to apparatus in common use by archibald williams author of the romance of modern invention the romance of mining etc etc thomas nelson and sons london edinburgh dublin and new york preface how does it work this question has been put to me so often by persons young and old that i have at last decided to answer it in such a manner that a much larger public than that with which i have personal acquaintance may be able to satisfy themselves as to the principles underlying many of the mechanisms met with in everyday life in order to include steam electricity optics hydraulics thermics light and a variety of detached mechanisms which cannot be classified under any one of these heads within the compass of about 450 pages i have to be content with a comparatively brief treatment of each subject this brevity has in turn compelled me to deal with principles rather than with detailed descriptions of individual devicesthough in several cases recognized types are examined the reader will look in vain for accounts of the yerkes telescope of the latest thing in motor cars and of the largest locomotive but he will be put in the way of understanding the essential nature of all telescopes motors and steamengines so far as they are at present developed which i think may be of greater ultimate profit to the uninitiated while careful to avoid puzzling the reader by the use of mysterious phraseology i consider that the parts of a machine should be given their technical names wherever possible to prevent misconception many of the diagrams accompanying the letterpress have words as well as letters written on them this course also obviates the wearisome reference from text to diagram necessitated by the use of solitary letters or figures i may add with regard to the diagrams of this book that they are purposely somewhat unconventional not being drawn to scale nor conforming to the canons of professional draughtsmanship where advisable a part of a machine has been exaggerated to show its details as a rule solid black has been preferred to fine shading in sectional drawings and all unnecessary lines are omitted i would here acknowledge my indebtedness to my draughtsman mr frank hodgson for his care and industry in preparing the two hundred or more diagrams for which he was responsible four organs of the bodythe eye the ear the larynx and the heartare noticed in appropriate places the eye is compared with the camera the larynx with a reed pipe the heart with a pump while the ear fitly opens the chapter on acoustics the reader who

cohesion and move freely round one anotherthe ice is turned into water heat water above 212 fahrenheit and the molecules exhibit a violent mutual repulsion and like dormant bees revived by spring sunshine separate and dart to and fro if confined in an airtight vessel the molecules have their flights curtailed and beat more and more violently against their prison walls so that every square inch of the vessel is subjected to a rising pressure we may compare the action of the steam molecules to that of bullets fired from a machinegun at a plate mounted on a spring the faster the bullets came the greater would be the continuous compression of the spring the mechanical energy of steam if steam is let into one end of a cylinder behind an airtight but freelymoving piston it will bombard the walls of the cylinder and the piston and if the united push of the molecules on the one side of the latter is greater than the resistance on the other side opposing its motion the piston must move having thus partly got their liberty the molecules become less active and do not rush about so vigorously the pressure on the piston decreases as it moves but if the piston were driven back to its original position against the force of the steam the molecular activitythat is pressurewould be restored we are here assuming that no heat has passed through the cylinder or piston and been radiated into the air for any loss of heat means loss of energy since heat is energy the boiler the combustion of fuel in a furnace causes the walls of the furnace to become hot which means that the molecules of the substance forming the walls are thrown into violent agitation if the walls are what are called good conductors of heat they will transmit the agitation through them to any surrounding substance in the case of the ordinary house stove this is the air which itself is agitated or grows warm a steamboiler has the furnace walls surrounded by water and its function is to transmit molecular movement heat or energy through the furnace plates to the water until the point is reached when steam generates at atmospheric pressurethat is if not confined in any waysteam would fill 1610 times the space which its molecules occupied in their watery formation if we seal up the boiler so that no escape is possible for the steam molecules their motion becomes more and more rapid and pressure is developed by their beating on the walls of the boiler there is theoretically no limit to which the pressure may be raised provided that sufficient fuelcombustion energy is transmitted to the vaporizing water to raise steam in large quantities we must employ a fuel which develops great heat in proportion to its weight is readily procured and cheap coal fulfils all these conditions of the 800 million tons mined annually throughout the world 400 million tons are burnt in the furnaces of steamboilers a good boiler must be1 strong enough to withstand much higher pressures than that at which it is worked 2 so designed as to burn its fuel to the greatest advantage even in the bestdesigned boilers a large part of the combustion heat passes through the chimney while a further proportion is radiated from the boiler professor john perry1 considers that this waste amounts under the best conditions at present obtainable to eleventwelfths of the whole we have to burn a shillingsworth of coal to capture the energy stored in a pennyworth yet the steamengine of today is three or four times as efficient as the engine of fifty years ago this is due to radical improvements in the design of boilers and of the machinery which converts the heat energy of steam into mechanical motion circulation of water in a boiler if you place a pot filled with water on an open fire and watch it when it boils you will notice that the water heaves up at the sides and plunges down at the centre this is due to the water being heated most at the sides and therefore being lightest there the rising steambubbles also carry it up on reaching the surface the bubbles burst the steam escapes and the water loses some of its heat and rushes down again to take the place of steamladen water rising illustration fig 1 illustration fig 2 if the fire is very fierce steambubbles may rise from all points at the bottom and impede downward currents fig 1 the pot then boils over fig 2 shows a method of preventing this trouble we lower into our pot a vessel of somewhat smaller diameter with a hole in the bottom arranged in such a manner as to leave a space between it and the pot all round the upward currents are then separated entirely from the downward and the fire can be forced to a very much greater extent than before without the water boiling over this very simple arrangement is the basis of many devices for producing free circulation of the water in steamboilers we can easily follow out the process of development in fig 3 we see a simple utube depending from a vessel of water heat is applied to the left leg and a steady circulation at once commences in order to increase the heating surface we can extend the heated leg into a long incline fig 4 beneath which three lamps instead of only one are placed the direction of the circulation is the same but its rate is increased illustration fig 3 a further improvement results from increasing the number of tubes fig 5 keeping them all on the slant so that the heated water and steam may rise freely the enclosed furnace illustration fig 4 illustration fig 5 still a lot of the heat gets away in a steamboiler the burning fuel is enclosed either by firebrick or a waterjacket forming part of the boiler a waterjacket signifies a double coating of metal plates with a space between which is filled with water see fig 6 the fire is now enclosed much as it is in a kitchen range but our boiler must not be so wasteful of the heat as is that useful household fixture on their way to the funnel the flames and hot gases should act on a very large metal or other surface in contact with the water of the boiler in order to give up a due proportion of their heat illustration fig 6diagrammatic sketch of a locomotive type of boiler water indicated by dotted lines the arrows show the direction taken by the air and hot gases from the airdoor to the funnel the multitubular boiler illustration fig 7the babcock and wilcox watertube boiler one side of the brick seating has been removed to show the arrangement of the watertubes and furnace to save room boilers which have to make steam very quickly and at high pressures are largely composed of pipes such boilers we call multitubular they are of two kinds1 watertube boilers in which the water circulates through tubes exposed to the furnace heat the babcock and wilcox boiler fig 7 is typical of this variety 2 firetube boilers in which the hot gases pass through tubes surrounded by water the ordinary locomotive boiler fig 6 illustrates this form the babcock and wilcox boiler is widely used in mines power stations and in a modified form on shipboard it consists of two main parts1 a drum h in the upper part of which the steam collects 2 a group of pipes arranged on the principle illustrated by fig 5 the boiler is seated on a rectangular frame of firebricks at one end is the furnace door at the other the exit to the chimney from the furnace f the flames and hot gases rise round the upper end of the sloping tubes tt into the space a where they play upon the under surface of h before plunging downward again among the tubes into the space b here the temperature is lower the arrows indicate further journeys upwards into the space c on the right of a firebrick division and past the down tubes ss into d whence the hot gases find an escape into the chimney through the opening e it will be noticed that the greatest heat is brought to bear on tt near their junction with uu the uptake tubes and that every succeeding passage of the pipes brings the gradually cooling gases nearer to the downtake tubes ss the pipes tt are easily brushed and scraped after the removal of plugs from the headers into which the tube ends are expanded other wellknown watertube boilers are the yarrow belleville stirling and thorneycroft all used for driving marine engines firetube boilers fig 6 shows a locomotive boiler in section to the right is the firebox surrounded on all sides by a waterjacket in direct communication with the barrel of the boiler the inner shell of the firebox is often made of copper which withstands the fierce heat better than steel the outer like the rest of the boiler is of steel plates from 12 to 34 inch thick the shells of the jacket are braced together by a large number of rivets rr and the top or crown is strengthened by heavy longitudinal girders riveted to it or is braced to the top of the boiler by long bolts a large number of firetubes only three are shown in the diagram for the sake of simplicity extend from the firebox to the smokebox the most powerful mammoth american locomotives have 350 or more tubes which with the firebox give 4000 square feet of surface for the furnace heat to act upon these tubes are expanded at their ends by a special tool into the tubeplates of the firebox and boiler front george stephenson and his predecessors experienced great difficulty in rendering the tubeend joints quite watertight but the invention of the expander has removed this trouble the firebrick arch shown fig 6 in the firebox is used to deflect the flames towards the back of the firebox so that the hot gases may be retarded somewhat and their combustion rendered more perfect it also helps to distribute the heat more evenly over the whole of the inside of the box and prevents cold air from flying directly from the firing door to the tubes in some american and continental locomotives the firebrick arch is replaced by a water bridge which serves the same purpose while giving additional heating surface the water circulation in a locomotive boiler isupwards at the firebox end where the heat is most intense forward along the surface downwards at the smokebox end backwards along the bottom of the barrel other types of boilers for small stationary land engines the vertical boiler is much used in fig 8 we have three forms of this typea and b with cross watertubes c with vertical firetubes the furnace in every case is surrounded by water and fed through a door at one side illustration fig 8diagrammatic representation of three types of vertical boilers the lancashire boiler is of large size it has a cylindrical shell measuring up to 30 feet in length and 7 feet in diameter traversed from end to end by two large flues in the rear part of which are situated the furnaces the boiler is fixed on a seating of firebricks so built up as to form three flues a and bb shown in cross section in fig 9 the furnace gases after leaving the two furnace flues are deflected downwards into the channel a by which they pass underneath the boiler to a point almost under the furnace where they divide right and left and travel through cross passages into the side channels bb to be led along the boilers flanks to the chimney exit c by this arrangement the effective heating surface is greatly increased and the passages being large natural draught generally suffices to maintain proper combustion the lancashire boiler is much used in factories and in a modified form on ships since it is a steady steamer and is easily kept in order illustration fig 9cross and longitudinal sections of a lancashire boiler in marine boilers of cylindrical shape cross watertubes and firetubes are often employed to increase the heating surface return tubes are also led through the water to the funnels situated at the same end as the furnace aids to combustion we may now turn our attention more particularly to the chemical process called combustion upon which a boiler depends for its heat ordinary steam coal contains about 85 per cent of carbon 7 per cent of oxygen and 4 per cent of hydrogen besides traces of nitrogen and sulphur and a small incombustible residue when the coal burns the nitrogen is released and passes away without combining with any of the other elements the sulphur unites with hydrogen and forms sulphuretted hydrogen also named sulphurous acid which is injurious to steel plates and is largely responsible for the decay of tubes and funnels more of the hydrogen unites with the oxygen as steam the most important element in coal is the carbon known chemically by the symbol c its combination with oxygen called combustion is the act which heats the boiler only when the carbon present has combined with the greatest possible amount of oxygen that it will take into partnership is the combustion complete and the full heatvalue fixed by scientific experiment at 14500 thermal units per pound of carbon developed now carbon may unite with oxygen atom for atom and form carbon monoxide co or in the proportion of one atom of carbon to two of oxygen and form carbon dioxide co2 the former gas is combustiblethat is will admit another atom of carbon to the moleculebut the latter is saturated with oxygen and will not burn or to put it otherwise is the product of perfect combustion a properly designed furnace supplied with a due amount of air will cause nearly all the carbon in the coal burnt to combine with the full amount of oxygen on the other hand if the oxygen supply is inefficient co as well as co2 will form and there will be a heat loss equal in extreme cases to twothirds of the whole it is therefore necessary that a furnace which has to eat up fuel at a great pace should be artificially fed with air in the proportion of from 12 to 20 pounds of air for every pound of fuel there are two methods of creating a violent draught through the furnace the first is the forced draught very simply exemplified by the ordinary bellows used in every house on a ship fig 10 the principle is developed as followsthe boilers are situated in a compartment or compartments having no communication with the outer air except for the passages down which air is forced by powerful fans at a pressure considerably greater than that of the atmosphere there is only one way outnamely through the furnace and tubes or gasways of the boiler and the funnel so through these it rushes raising the fuel to white heat as may easily be imagined the temperature of a stokehold especially in the tropics is far from pleasant in the red sea the thermometer sometimes rises to 170 fahrenheit or more and the poor stokers have a very bad time of it illustration fig 10sketch showing how the forced draught is produced in a stokehold and how it affects the furnaces illustration scene in the stokehold of a battleship the second system is that of the induced draught here air is sucked through the furnace by creating a vacuum in the funnel and in a chamber opening into it turning to fig 6 we see a pipe through which the exhaust steam from the locomotives cylinders is shot upwards into the funnel in which and in the smokebox beneath it a strong vacuum is formed while the engine is running now nature abhors a vacuum so air will get into the smokebox if there be a way open there isthrough the airdoors at the bottom of the furnace the furnace itself and the firetubes and on the way oxygen combines with the carbon of the fuel to form carbon dioxide the power of the draught is so great that as one often notices when a train passes during the night redhot cinders plucked from the firebox and dragged through the tubes are hurled far into the air it might be mentioned in parenthesis that the socalled smoke which pours from the funnel of a moving engine is mainly condensing steam a steamship on the other hand belches smoke only from its funnels as fresh water is far too precious to waste as steam we shall refer to this later on p 72 boiler fittings the most important fittings on a boiler are1 the safetyvalve 2 the watergauge 3 the steamgauge 4 the mechanisms for feeding it with water the safetyvalve professor thurston an eminent authority on the steamengine has estimated that a plain cylindrical boiler carrying 100 lbs pressure to the square inch contains sufficient stored energy to project it into the air a vertical distance of 312 miles in the case of a lancashire boiler at equal pressure the distance would be 212 miles of a locomotive boiler at 125 lbs 112 miles of a steam tubular boiler at 75 lbs 1 mile according to the same writer a cubic foot of heated water under a pressure of from 60 to 70 lbs per square inch has about the same energy as one pound of gunpowder steam is a good servant but a terrible master it must be kept under strict control however strong a boiler may be it will burst if the steam pressure in it be raised to a certain point and some device must therefore be fitted on it which will give the steam free egress before that point is reached a device of this kind is called a safetyvalve it usually blows off at less than half the greatest pressure that the boiler has been proved by experiment to be capable of withstanding in principle the safetyvalve denotes an orifice closed by an accuratelyfitting plug which is pressed against its seat on the boiler top by a weighted lever or by a spring as soon as the steam pressure on the face of the plug exceeds the counteracting force of the weight or spring the plug rises and steam escapes until equilibrium of the opposing forces is restored on stationary engines a lever safetyvalve is commonly employed fig 11 the blowingoff point can be varied by shifting the weight along the arm so as to give it a greater or less leverage on locomotive and marine boilers where shocks and movements have to be reckoned with weights are replaced by springs set to a certain tension and locked up so that they cannot be tampered with illustration fig 11a lever safetyvalve v valve s seating p pin l lever f fulcrum w weight the figures indicate the positions at which the weight should be placed for the valve to act when the pressure rises to that number of pounds per square inch boilers are tested by filling the boilers quite full and 1 by heating the water which expands slightly but with great pressure 2 by forcing in additional water with a powerful pump in either case a rupture would not be attended by an explosion as water is very inelastic the days when an engineer could sit on the valvesthat is screw them downto obtain greater pressure are now past and with them a considerable proportion of the dangers of highpressure steam the factory act of 1895 in force throughout the british isles provides that every boiler for generating steam in a factory or workshop where the act applies must have a proper safetyvalve steamgauge and watergauge and that boilers and fittings must be examined by a competent person at least once in every fourteen months neglect of these provisions renders the owner of a boiler liable to heavy penalties if an explosion occurs one of the most disastrous explosions on record took place at the redcar iron works yorkshire in june 1895 in this case twelve out of fifteen boilers ranged side by side burst through one proving too weak for its work the flying fragments of this boiler striking the sides of other boilers exploded them and so the damage was transmitted down the line twenty men were killed and injured while masses of metal weighing several tons each were hurled 250 yards and caused widespread damage the following is taken from a journal dated december 22 1895 providence rhode islanda recent prophecy that a boiler would explode between december 16 and 24 in a store has seriously affected the christmas trade shoppers are incredibly nervous one store advertises no boilers are being used lifts running electrically all stores have had their boilers inspected the watergauge no fitting of a boiler is more important than the watergauge which shows the level at which the water stands the engineer must continually consult his gauge for if the water gets too low pipes and other surfaces exposed to the furnace flames may burn through with disastrous results while on the other hand too much water will cause bad steaming a section of an ordinary gauge is seen in fig 12 it consists of two parts each furnished with a gland g to make a steamtight joint round the glass tube which is inserted through the hole covered by the plug p1 the cocks t1 t2 are normally open allowing the ingress of steam and water respectively to the tube cock t3 is kept closed unless for any reason it is necessary to blow steam or water through the gauge the holes c c can be cleaned out if the plugs p2 p3 are removed most gauges on highpressure boilers have a thick glass screen in front so that in the event of the tube breaking the steam and water may not blow directly on to the attendants a further precaution is to include two ballvalves near the ends of the gaugeglass under ordinary conditions the balls lie in depressions clear of the ways but when a rush of steam or water occurs they are sucked into their seatings and block all egress illustration fig 12section of a watergauge on many boilers two watergauges are fitted since any gauge may work badly at times the glasses are tested to a pressure of 3000 lbs or more to the square inch before use the steamgauge it is of the utmost importance that a person in charge of a boiler should know what pressure the steam has reached every boiler is therefore fitted with one steamgauge many with two lest one might be unreliable there are two principal types of steamgauge1 the bourdon 2 the schfferbudenberg the principle of the bourdon is illustrated by fig 13 in which a is a piece of rubber tubing closed at one end and at the other drawn over the nozzle of a cycle tyre inflator if bent in a curve as shown the section of the tube is an oval when air is pumped in the rubber walls endeavour to assume a circular section because this shape encloses a larger area than an oval of equal circumference and therefore makes room for a larger volume of air in doing so the tube straightens itself and assumes the position indicated by the dotted lines hang an empty inner tube of a pneumatic tyre over a nail and inflate it and you will get a good illustration of the principle illustration fig 13showing the principle of the steamgauge illustration fig 14bourdon steamgauge part of dial removed to show mechanism in fig 14 we have a bourdon gauge with part of the dial face broken away to show the internal mechanism t is a flattened metal tube soldered at one end into a hollow casting into which screws a tap connected with the boiler the other end closed is attached to a link l which works an arm of a quadrant rack r engaging with a small pinion p actuating the pointer as the steam pressure rises the tube t moves its free end outwards towards the position shown by the dotted lines and traverses the arm of the rack so shifting the pointer round the scale as the pressure falls the tube gradually returns to its zero position the schfferbudenberg gauge depends for its action on the elasticity of a thin corrugated metal plate on one side of which steam presses as the plate bulges upwards it pushes up a small rod resting on it which operates a quadrant and rack similar to that of the bourdon gauge the principle is employed in another form for the aneroid barometer p 329 the water supply to a boiler the water inside a boiler is kept at a proper level by 1 pumps or 2 injectors the former are most commonly used on stationary and marine boilers as their mechanism is much the same as that of ordinary force pumps which will be described in a later chapter we may pass at once to the injector now almost universally used on locomotive and sometimes on stationary boilers at first sight the injector is a mechanical paradox since it employs the steam from a boiler to blow water into the boiler in fig 15 we have an illustration of the principle of an injector steam is led from the boiler through pipe a which terminates in a nozzle surrounded by a cone e connected by the pipe b with the water tank when steam is turned on it rushes with immense velocity from the nozzle and creates a partial vacuum in cone e which soon fills with water on meeting the water the steam condenses but not before it has imparted some of its velocity to the water which thus gains sufficient momentum to force down the valve and find its way to the boiler the overflow space o o between e and c allows steam and water to escape until the water has gathered the requisite momentum illustration fig 15diagram illustrating the principle of a steaminjector illustration fig 16the giffard injector a form of injector very commonly used is giffards fig 16 steam is allowed to enter by screwing up the valve v as it rushes through the nozzle of the cone a it takes up water and projects it into the mixing cone b which can be raised or lowered by the pinion d worked by the handwheel wheel shown so as to regulate the amount of water admitted to b at the centre of b is an aperture o communicating with the overflow the water passes to the boiler through the valve on the left it will be noticed that the cone a and the part of b above the orifice o contract downward this is to convert the pressure of the steam into velocity below o is a cone the diameter of which increases downwards here the velocity of the water is converted back into pressure in obedience to a wellknown hydromechanic law an injector does not work well if the feedwater be too hot to condense the steam quickly and it may be taken as a rule that the warmer the water the smaller is the amount of it injected by a given weight of steam2 some injectors have flapvalves covering the overflow orifice to prevent air being sucked in and carried to the boiler when an injector receives a sudden shock such as that produced by the passing of a locomotive over points it is liable to fly offthat is stop momentarilyand then send the steam and water through the overflow if this happens both steam and water must be turned off and the injector be restarted unless it be of the selfstarting variety which automatically controls the admission of water to the mixingcone and allows the injector to pick up of itself for economys sake part of the steam expelled from the cylinders of a locomotive is sometimes used to work an injector which passes the water on at a pressure of 70 lbs to the square inch to a second injector operated by highpressure steam coming direct from the boiler which increases its velocity sufficiently to overcome the boiler pressure in this case only a fraction of the weight of highpressure steam is required to inject a given weight of water as compared with that used in a singlestage injector 1 the steamengine p 3 2 by weight of steam is meant the steam produced by boiling a certain weight of water a pound of steam if condensed would form a pound of water

governorsthe condenser having treated at some length the apparatus used for converting water into highpressure steam we may pass at once to a consideration of the mechanisms which convert the energy of steam into mechanical motion or work steamengines are of two kinds1 reciprocating employing cylinders and cranks 2 rotary called turbines reciprocating engines illustration fig 17sketch showing parts of a horizontal steamengine fig 17 is a skeleton diagram of the simplest form of reciprocating engine c is a cylinder to which steam is admitted through the steamways3 w w first on one side of the piston p then on the other the pressure on the piston pushes it along the cylinder and the force is transmitted through the piston rod p r to the connecting rod c r which causes the crank k to revolve at the point where the two rods meet there is a crosshead h running to and fro in a guide to prevent the piston rod being broken or bent by the oblique thrusts and pulls which it imparts through c r to the crank k the latter is keyed to a shaft s carrying the flywheel or in the case of a locomotive the drivingwheels the crank shaft revolves in bearings the internal diameter of a cylinder is called its bore the travel of the piston is called its stroke the distance from the centre of the shaft to the centre of the crank pin is called the cranks throw which is half of the pistons stroke an engine of this type is called doubleacting as the piston is pushed alternately backwards and forwards by the steam when piston rod connecting rod and crank lie in a straight linethat is when the piston is fully out or fully inthe crank is said to be at a dead point for were the crank turned to such a position the admission of steam would not produce motion since the thrust or pull would be entirely absorbed by the bearings illustration fig 18sectional plan of a horizontal engine doublecylinder engines illustration fig 19 illustration fig 20 locomotive marine and all other engines which must be started in any position have at least two cylinders and as many cranks set at an angle to one another fig 19 demonstrates that when one crank c1 of a doublecylinder engine is at a dead point the other c2 has reached a position at which the piston exerts the maximum of turning power in fig 20 each crank is at 45 with the horizontal and both pistons are able to do work the power of one piston is constantly increasing while that of the other is decreasing if singleaction cylinders are used at least three of these are needed to produce a perpetual turning movement independently of a flywheel the function of the flywheel a flywheel acts as a reservoir of energy to carry the crank of a singlecylinder engine past the dead points it is useful in all reciprocating engines to produce steady running as a heavy wheel acts as a drag on the effects of a sudden increase or decrease of steam pressure in a pump mangoldslicer cakecrusher or chaffcutter the flywheel helps the operator to pass his dead pointsthat is those parts of the circle described by the handle in which he can do little work the cylinder illustration fig 21diagrammatic section of a cylinder and its slidevalve the cylinders of an engine take the place of the muscular system of the human body in fig 21 we have a cylinder and its slidevalve shown in section first of all look at p the piston round it are white grooves r r in which rings are fitted to prevent the passage of steam past the piston the rings are cut through at one point in their circumference and slightly opened so that when in position they press all round against the walls of the cylinder after a little use they settle down to their workthat is wear to a true fit in the cylinder each end of the cylinder is closed by a cover one of which has a boss cast on it pierced by a hole for the piston rod to work through to prevent the escape of steam the boss is hollowed out true to accommodate a gland g1 which is threaded on the rod and screwed up against the boss the internal space between them being filled with packing steam from the boiler enters the steamchest and would have access to both sides of the piston simultaneously through the steamways w w were it not for the slidevalve a hollow box open at the bottom and long enough for its edges to cover both steamways at once between w w is e the passage for the exhaust steam to escape by the edges of the slidevalve are perfectly flat as is the face over which the valve moves so that no steam may pass under the edges in our illustration the piston has just begun to move towards the right steam enters by the left steamway which the valve is just commencing to uncover as the piston moves the valve moves in the same direction until the port is fully uncovered when it begins to move back again and just before the piston has finished its stroke the steamway on the right begins to open the steamway on the left is now in communication with the exhaust port e so that the steam that has done its duty is released and pressed from the cylinder by the piston reciprocation is this backward and forward motion of the piston hence the term reciprocating engines the linear motion of the piston rod is converted into rotatory motion by the connecting rod and crank illustration fig 22perspective section of cylinder the use of a crank appears to be so obvious a method of producing this conversion that it is interesting to learn that when james watt produced his rotative engine in 1780 he was unable to use the crank because it had already been patented by one matthew wasborough watt was not easily daunted however and within a twelvemonth had himself patented five other devices for obtaining rotatory motion from a piston rod before passing on it may be mentioned that watt was the father of the modernthat is the highpressuresteamengine and that owing to the imperfection of the existing machinery the difficulties he had to overcome were enormous on one occasion he congratulated himself because one of his steamcylinders was only threeeighths of an inch out of truth in the bore nowadays a good firm would reject a cylinder 1500 of an inch out of truth and in small petrolengines 15000 of an inch is sometimes the greatest limit of error allowed illustration fig 23the eccentric and its rod the eccentric is used to move the slidevalve to and fro over the steam ports fig 23 it consists of three main partsthe sheave or circular plate s mounted on the crank shaft and the two straps which encircle it and in which it revolves to one strap is bolted the big end of the eccentric rod which engages at its other end with the valve rod the straps are semicircular and held together by strong bolts b b passing through lugs or thickenings at the ends of the semicircles the sheave has a deep groove all round the edges in which the straps ride the eccentricity or throw of an eccentric is the distance between c2 the centre of the shaft and c1 the centre of the sheave the throw must equal half of the distance which the slidevalve has to travel over the steam ports a tapering steel wedge or key k sunk half in the eccentric and half in a slot in the shaft holds the eccentric steady and prevents it slipping some eccentric sheaves are made in two parts bolted together so that they may be removed easily without dismounting the shaft the eccentric is in principle nothing more than a crank pin so exaggerated as to be larger than the shaft of the crank its convenience lies in the fact that it may be mounted at any point on a shaft whereas a crank can be situated at an end only if it is not actually a vshaped bend in the shaft itselfin which case its position is of course permanent setting of the slidevalve and eccentric the subject of valvesetting is so extensive that a full exposition might weary the reader even if space permitted its inclusion but inasmuch as the effectiveness of a reciprocating engine depends largely on the nature and arrangement of the valves we will glance at some of the more elementary principles illustration fig 24 illustration fig 25 in fig 24 we see in section the slidevalve the ports of the cylinder and part of the piston to the right are two lines at right anglesthe thicker c representing the position of the crank the thinner e that of the eccentric the position of an eccentric is denoted diagrammatically by a line drawn from the centre of the crank shaft through the centre of the sheave the edges of the valve are in this case only broad enough to just cover the portsthat is they have no lap the piston is about to commence its stroke towards the left and the eccentric which is set at an angle of 90 in advance of the crank is about to begin opening the lefthand port by the time that c has got to the position originally occupied by e e will be horizontal fig 25that is the eccentric will have finished its stroke towards the left and while c passes through the next right angle the valve will be closing the left port which will cease to admit steam when the piston has come to the end of its travel the operation is repeated on the righthand side while the piston returns illustration fig 26 it must be noticed here1 that steam is admitted at full pressure all through the stroke 2 that admission begins and ends simultaneously with the stroke now in actual practice it is necessary to admit steam before the piston has ended its travel so as to cushion the violence of the sudden change of direction of the piston its rod and other moving parts to effect this the eccentric is set more than 90 in advancethat is more than what the engineers call square fig 26 shows such an arrangement the angle between e and e1 is called the angle of advance referring to the valve you will see that it has opened an appreciable amount though the piston has not yet started on its rightwards journey lap of the valveexpansion of steam in the simple form of valve that appears in fig 24 the valve faces are just wide enough to cover the steam ports if the eccentric is not square with the crank the admission of steam lasts until the very end of the stroke if set a little in advancethat is given leadthe steam is cut off before the piston has travelled quite along the cylinder and readmitted before the back stroke is accomplished even with this lead the working is very uneconomical as the steam goes to the exhaust at practically the same pressure as that at which it entered the cylinder its property of expansion has been neglected but supposing that steam at 100 lbs pressure were admitted till halfstroke and then suddenly cut off the expansive nature of the steam would then continue to push the piston out until the pressure had decreased to 50 lbs per square inch at which pressure it would go to the exhaust now observe that all the work done by the steam after the cutoff is so much power saved the average pressure on the piston is not so high as in the first case still from a given volume of 100 lbs pressure steam we get much more work how the cutoff is managed illustration fig 27a slidevalve with lap illustration fig 28 look at fig 27 here we have a slidevalve with faces much wider than the steam ports the parts marked black p p are those corresponding to the faces of the valves shown in previous diagrams p 54 the shaded parts l l are called the lap by increasing the length of the lap we increase the range of expansive working fig 28 shows the piston full to the left the valve is just on the point of opening to admit steam behind the piston the eccentric has a throw equal to the breadth of a port the lap of the valve that this must be so is obvious from a consideration of fig 27 where the valve is at its central position hence the very simple formulatravel of valve 2 lap breadth of port the path of the eccentrics centre round the centre of the shaft is indicated by the usual dotted line fig 28 you will notice that the angle of advance denoted by the arrow a is now very considerable by the time that the crank c has assumed the position of the line s the eccentric has passed its dead point and the valve begins to travel backwards eventually returning to the position shown in fig 28 and cutting off the steam supply while the piston has still a considerable part of its stroke to make the steam then begins to work expansively and continues to do so until the valve assumes the position shown in fig 27 if the valve has to have lead to admit steam before the end of the stroke to the other side of the piston the angle of advance must be increased and the eccentric centre line would lie on the line e2 thereforetotal angle of advance angle for lap and angle for lead limit of expansive working theoretically by increasing the lap and cutting off the steam earlier and earlier in the stroke we should economize our power more and more but in practice a great difficulty is met withnamely that as the steam expands its temperature falls if the cutoff occurs early say at onethird stroke the great expansion will reduce the temperature of the metal walls of the cylinder to such an extent that when the next spirt of steam enters from the other end a considerable proportion of the steams energy will be lost by cooling in such a case the difference in temperature between admitted steam and exhausted steam is too great for economy yet we want to utilize as much energy as possible how are we to do it compound engines in the year 1853 john elder founder of the shipping firm of elder and co glasgow introduced the compound engine for use on ships the steam when exhausted from the highpressure cylinder passed into another cylinder of equal stroke but larger diameter where the expansion continued in modern engines the expansion is extended to three and even four stages according to the boiler pressure for it is a rule that the higher the initial pressure is the larger is the number of stages of expansion consistent with economical working illustration fig 29sketch of the arrangement of a tripleexpansion marine engine no valve gear or supports etc shown in fig 29 we have a tripleexpansion marine engine steam enters the highpressure cylinder4 at say 200 lbs per square inch it exhausts at 75 lbs into the large pipe 2 and passes to the intermediate cylinder whence it is exhausted at 25 lbs or so through pipe 3 to the lowpressure cylinder finally it is ejected at about 8 lbs per square inch to the condenser and is suddenly converted into water an act which produces a vacuum and diminishes the backpressure of the exhaust from cylinder c in fact the condenser exerts a sucking power on the exhaust side of cs piston arrangement of expansion engines in the illustration the cranks are set at angles of 120 or a third of a circle so that one or other is always at or near the position of maximum turning power where only two stages are used the cylinders are often arranged tandem both pistons having a common piston rod and crank in order to get a constant turning movement they must be mounted separately and work cranks set at right angles to one another compound locomotives in 1876 mr a mallet introduced compounding in locomotives and the practice has been largely adopted the various types of compounds may be classified as follows1 one lowpressure and one highpressure cylinder 2 one highpressure and two lowpressure 3 one lowpressure and two highpressure 4 two highpressure and two lowpressure the last class is very widely used in france america and russia and seems to give the best results where only two cylinders are used and sometimes in the case of three and four a valve arrangement permits the admission of highpressure steam to both high and lowpressure cylinders for starting a train or moving it up heavy grades reversing gears illustration figs 30 31 32showing how a reversing gear alters the position of the slidevalve the engines of a locomotive or steamship must be reversiblethat is when steam is admitted to the cylinders the engineer must be able to so direct it through the steamways that the cranks may turn in the desired direction the commonest form of reversing device invented by george stephenson is known as stephensons link gear in fig 30 we have a diagrammatic presentment of this gear e1 and e2 are two eccentrics set square with the crank at opposite ends of a diameter their rods are connected to the ends of a link l which can be raised and lowered by means of levers not shown b is a block which can partly revolve on a pin projecting from the valve rod working through a guide g in fig 31 the link is half raised or in midgear as drivers say eccentric e1 has pushed the lower end of the link fully back e2 has pulled it fully forward and since any movement of the one eccentric is counterbalanced by the opposite movement of the other rotation of the eccentrics would not cause the valve to move at all and no steam could be admitted to the cylinder let us suppose that fig 30 denotes one cylinder crank rods etc of a locomotive the crank has come to rest at its halfstroke the reversing lever is at the midgear notch if the engineer desires to turn his cranks in an anticlockwise direction he raises the link which brings the rod of e1 into line with the valve rod and presses the block backwards till the righthand port is uncovered fig 31 if steam be now admitted the piston will be pushed towards the left and the engine will continue to run in an anticlockwise direction if on the other hand he wants to run the engine the other way he would drop the link bringing the rod of e2 into line with the valve rod and drawing v forward to uncover the rear port fig 32 in either case the eccentric working the end of the link remote from b has no effect since it merely causes that end to describe arcs of circles of which b is the centre linking up if the link is only partly lowered or raised from the central position it still causes the engine to run accordingly but the movement of the valve is decreased when running at high speed the engineer links up his reversing gear causing his valves to cut off early in the stroke and the steam to work more expansively than it could with the lever at full or end gear so that this device not only renders an engine reversible but also gives the engineer an absolute command over the expansion ratio of the steam admitted to the cylinder and furnishes a method of cutting off the steam altogether in figs 30 31 32 the valve has no lap and the eccentrics are set square in actual practice the valve faces would have lap and the eccentric lead to correspond but for the sake of simplicity neither is shown other gears in the gooch gear for reversing locomotives the link does not shift but the valve rod and its block is raised or lowered the allan gear is so arranged that when the link is raised the block is lowered and vice vers these are really only modifications of stephensons principlenamely the employment of two eccentrics set at equal angles to and on opposite sides of the crank there are three other forms of linkreversing gear and nearly a dozen types of radial reversing devices but as we have already described the three most commonly used on locomotives and ships there is no need to give particulars of these before the introduction of stephensons gear a single eccentric was used for each cylinder and to reverse the engine this eccentric had to be loose on the axle a lever and gear worked by a treadle on the footplate controlled the position of the eccentrics when starting the engine the driver put the eccentrics out of gear by the treadle then by means of a lever he raised the smallends5 of the eccentric rods and noting the position of the cranks or if more convenient the balance weight in the wheels he by means of another handle moved the valves to open the necessary ports to steam and worked them by hand until the engine was moving then with the treadle he threw the eccentrics over to engage the studs at the same time dropping the smallends of the rods to engage pins upon the valve spindles so that they continued to keep up the movement of the valve6 one would imagine that in modern shunting yards such a device would somewhat delay operations piston valves in marine engines and on many locomotives and some stationary engines the dvalve shown in figs 3032 is replaced by a piston valve or circular valve working up and down in a tubular seating it may best be described as a rod carrying two pistons which correspond to the faces of a dvalve instead of rectangular ports there are openings in the tube in which the piston valve moves communicating with the steamways into the cylinder and with the exhaust pipe in the case of the dvalve the pressure above it is much greater than that below and considerable friction arises if the rubbing faces are not kept well lubricated the piston valve gets over this difficulty since such steam as may leak past it presses on its circumference at all points equally speed governors illustration fig 33a speed governor practically all engines except locomotives and those known as donkeyenginesused on cranesare fitted with some device for keeping the rotatory speed of the crank constant within very narrow limits perhaps you have seen a pair of balls moving round on a seating over the boiler of a threshingengine they form part of the governor or speedcontroller shown in principle in fig 33 a belt driven by a pulley on the crank shaft turns a small pulley p at the foot of the governor this transmits motion through two bevelwheels g to a vertical shaft from the top of which hang two heavy balls on links k k two more links l l connect the balls with a weight w which has a deep groove cut round it at the bottom when the shaft revolves the balls fly outwards by centrifugal force and as their velocity increases the quadrilateral figure contained by the four links expands laterally and shortens vertically the angles between k k and l l become less and less obtuse and the weight w is drawn upwards bringing with it the fork c of the rod a which has ends engaging with the groove as c rises the other end of the rod is depressed and the rod b depresses rod o which is attached to the spindle operating a sort of shutter in the steampipe consequently the supply of steam is throttled more and more as the speed increases until it has been so reduced that the engine slows and the balls fall opening the valve again fig 34 shows the valve fully closed this form of governor was invented by james watt a spring is often used instead of a weight and the governor is arranged horizontally so that it may be driven direct from the crank shaft without the intervention of bevel gearing illustration fig 34 the hartwell governor employs a link motion you must here picture the balls raising and lowering the free end of the valve rod which carries a block moving in a link connected with the eccentric rod the link is pivoted at the upper end and the eccentric rod is attached to the lower when the engine is at rest the end of the valve rod and its block are dropped till in a line with the eccentric rod but when the machinery begins to work the block is gradually drawn up by the governor diminishing the movement of the valve and so shortening the period of steam admission to the cylinder governors are of special importance where the load of an engine is constantly varying as in the case of a sawmill a good governor will limit variation of speed within two per centthat is if the engine is set to run at 100 revolutions a minute it will not allow it to exceed 101 or fall below 99 in very highspeed engines the governing will prevent variation of less than one per cent even when the load is at one instant full on and the next taken completely off marine governors these must be more quickacting than those used on engines provided with flywheels which prevent very sudden variations of speed the screw is light in proportion to the engine power and when it is suddenly raised from the water by the pitching of the vessel the engine would race till the screw took the water again unless some regulating mechanism were provided many types of marine governors have been tried the most successful seems to be one in which water is being constantly forced by a pump driven off the engine shaft into a cylinder controlling a throttlevalve in the main steampipe the water escapes through a leak which is adjustable as long as the speed of the engine is normal the water escapes from the cylinder as fast as it is pumped in and no movement of the piston results but when the screw begins to race the pump overcomes the leak and the piston is driven out causing a throttling of the steam supply condensers the condenser serves two purposes1 it makes it possible to use the same water over and over again in the boilers on the sea where fresh water is not obtainable in large quantities this is a matter of the greatest importance 2 it adds to the power of a compound engine by exerting a back pull on the piston of the lowpressure cylinder while the steam is being exhausted illustration fig 35the marine condenser fig 35 is a sectional illustration of a marine condenser steam enters the condenser through the large pipe e and passes among a number of very thin copper tubes through which seawater is kept circulating by a pump the path of the water is shown by the featherless arrows it comes from the pump through pipe a into the lower part of a large cap covering one end of the condenser and divided transversely by a diaphragm d passing through the pipes it reaches the cap attached to the other end and flows back through the upper tubes to the outlet c this arrangement ensures that as the steam condenses it shall meet colder and colder tubes and finally be turned to water which passes to the well through the outlet f in some condensers the positions of steam and water are reversed steam going through the tubes outside which cold water circulates 3 also called ports 4 the bores of the cylinders are in the proportion of 4 6 9 the stroke of all three is the same 5 the ends furthest from the eccentric 6 the locomotive of today p 87 chapter iii the steam turbine how a turbine worksthe de laval turbinethe parsons turbinedescription of the parsons turbinethe expansive action of steam in a parsons turbinebalancing the thrustadvantages of the marine turbine more than two thousand years ago hero of alexandria produced the first apparatus to which the name of steamengine could rightly be given its principle was practically the same as that of the revolving jet used to sprinkle lawns during dry weather steam being used in the place of water from the top of a closed cauldron rose two vertical pipes which at their upper ends had short rightangle bends between them was hung a hollow globe pivoted on two short tubes projecting from its sides into the upright tubes two little lshaped pipes projected from opposite sides of the globe at the ends of a diameter in a plane perpendicular to the axis on fire being applied to the cauldron steam was generated it passed up through the upright through the pivots and into the globe from which it escaped by the two lshaped nozzles causing rapid revolution of the ball in short the first steamengine was a turbine curiously enough we have reverted to this primitive type scientifically developed of course in the most modern engineering practice how a turbine works in reciprocatingthat is cylinderengines steam is admitted into a chamber and the door shut behind it as it were as it struggles to expand it forces out one of the confining wallsthat is the pistonand presently the door opens again and allows it to escape when it has done its work in heros toy the impact of the issuing molecules against other molecules that have already emerged from the pipes was used one may compare the reaction to that exerted by a thrown stone on the thrower if the thrower is standing on skates the reaction of the stone will cause him to glide backwards just as if he had pushed off from some fixed object in the case of the reactionnamely the herotypeturbine the nozzle from which the steam or water issues moves along with bodies to which it may be attached in action turbines steam is led through fixed nozzles or steamways and the momentum of the steam is brought to bear on the surfaces of movable bodies connected with the shaft the de laval turbine in its earliest form this turbine was a modification of heros the wheel was merely a pipe bent in s form attached at its centre to a hollow vertical shaft supplied with steam through a stuffingbox at one extremity the steam blew out tangentially from the ends of the s causing the shaft to revolve rapidly and work the machinery usually a cream separator mounted on it this motor proved very suitable for dairy work but was too wasteful of steam to be useful where high power was needed illustration fig 36the wheel and nozzles of a de laval turbine in the de laval turbine as now constructed the steam is blown from stationary nozzles against vanes mounted on a revolving wheel fig 36 shows the nozzles and a turbine wheel the wheel is made as a solid disc to the circumference of which the vanes are dovetailed separately in a single row each vane is of curved section the concave side directed towards the nozzles which as will be gathered from the transparent specimen on the right of our illustration gradually expand towards the mouth this is to allow the expansion of the steam and a consequent gain of velocity as it issues each molecule strikes against the concave face of a vane and while changing its direction is robbed of its kinetic energy which passes to the wheel to turn once more to a stonethrowing comparison it is as if a boy were pelting the wheel with an enormous number of tiny stones now escaping highpressure steam moves very fast indeed to give figures if it enters the small end of a de laval nozzle at 200 lbs per square inch it will leave the big end at a velocity of 48 miles per minutethat is at a speed which would take it right round the world in 812 hours the wheel itself would not move at more than about onethird of this speed as a maximum7 but even so it may make as many as 30000 revolutions per minute a mechanical difficulty is now encounterednamely that arising from vibration no matter how carefully the turbine wheel may be balanced it is practically impossible to make its centre of gravity coincide exactly with the central point of the shaft in other words the wheel will be a bitperhaps only a tiny fraction of an ounceheavier on one side than the other this want of truth causes vibration which at the high speed mentioned would cause the shaft to knock the bearings in which it revolves to pieces ifand this is the pointthose bearings were close to the wheel m de laval mounted the wheel on a shaft long enough between the bearings to whip or bend a little and the difficulty was surmounted the normal speed of the turbine wheel is too high for direct driving of some machinery so it is reduced by means of gearing to dynamos pumps and airfans it is often coupled direct the parsons turbine at the grand naval review held in 1897 in honour of queen victorias diamond jubilee one of the most noteworthy sights was the little turbinia of 4412 tons burthen which darted about among the floating forts at a speed much surpassing that of the fastest destroyer inside the nimble little craft were engines developing 2000 horse power without any of the clank and vibration which usually reigns in the engineroom of a highspeed vessel the turbinia was the first turbinedriven boat and as such even apart from her extraordinary pace she attracted great attention since 1897 the parsons turbine has been installed on many ships including several menofwar and it seems probable that the time is not far distant when reciprocating engines will be abandoned on all highspeed craft description of the parsons turbine illustration fig 37section of a parsons turbine the essential parts of a parsons turbine are1 the shaft on which is mounted 2 the drum 3 the cylindrical casing inside which the drum revolves 4 the vanes on the drum and casing 5 the balance pistons fig 37 shows a diagrammatic turbine in section the drum it will be noticed increases its diameter in three stages d1 d2 d3 towards the right from end to end it is studded with little vanes m m set in parallel rings small distances apart each vane has a curved section see fig 38 the hollow side facing towards the left the vanes stick out from the drum like short spokes and their outer ends almost touch the casing to the latter are attached equallyspaced rings of fixed vanes f f pointing inwards towards the drum and occupying the intervals between the rings of moving vanes their concave sides also face towards the left but as seen in fig 38 their line of curve lies the reverse way to that of m m steam enters the casing at a and at once rushes through the vanes towards the outlet at b it meets the first row of fixed vanes and has its path so deflected that it strikes the ring of moving or drum vanes at the most effective angle and pushes them round it then has its direction changed by the ring of f f so that it may treat the next row of m m in a similar fashion illustration fig 38blades or vanes of a parsons turbine illustration one of the lowpressure turbines of the carmania in casing its size will be inferred from comparison with the man standing near the end of the casing the expansive action of steam in a turbine on reaching the end of d1 it enters the second or intermediate set of vanes the drum here is of a greater diameter and the blades are longer and set somewhat farther apart to give a freer passage to the now partly expanded steam which has lost pressure but gained velocity the process of movement is repeated through this stage and again in d3 the lowpressure drum the steam then escapes to the condenser through b having by this time expanded very many times and it is found advisable for reasons explained in connection with compound steamengines to have a separate turbine in an independent casing for the extreme stages of expansion the vanes are made of brass in the turbines of the carmania the huge cunard liner 1115000 vanes are used the largest diameter of the drums is 11 feet and each lowpressure turbine weighs 350 tons balancing of thrust the push exerted by the steam on the blades not only turns the drum but presses it in the direction in which the steam flows this end thrust is counterbalanced by means of the dummy pistons p1 p2 p3 each dummy consists of a number of discs revolving between rings projecting from the casing the distance between discs and rings being so small that but little steam can pass in the highpressure compartment the steam pushes p1 to the left with the same pressure as it pushes the blades of d1 to the right after completing the first stage it fills the passage c which communicates with the second piston p2 and the pressure on that piston negatives the thrust on d2 similarly the passage e causes the steam to press equally on p3 and the vanes of d3 so that the bearings in which the shaft revolves have but little thrust to take this form of compensation is necessary in marine as well as in stationary turbines in the former the dummy pistons are so proportioned that the forward thrust given by them and the screw combined is almost equal to the thrust aft of the moving vanes illustration one of the turbine drums of the carmania note the rows of vanes the drum is here being tested for perfect balance on two absolutely level supports advantages of the marine turbine 1 absence of vibration reciprocating engines however well balanced cause a shaking of the whole ship which is very unpleasant to passengers the turbine on the other hand being almost perfectly balanced runs so smoothly at the highest speeds that if the hand be laid on the covering it is sometimes almost impossible to tell whether the machinery is in motion as a consequence of this smooth running there is little noise in the enginerooma pleasant contrast to the deafening roar of reciprocating engines 2 turbines occupy less room 3 they are more easily tended 4 they require fewer repairs since the rubbing surfaces are very small as compared to those of reciprocating engines 5 they are more economical at high speeds it must be remembered that a turbine is essentially meant for high speeds if run slowly the steam will escape through the many passages without doing much work owing to its construction a turbine cannot be reversed like a cylinder engine it therefore becomes necessary to fit special astern turbines to one or more of the screw shafts for use when the ship has to be stopped or moved astern under ordinary conditions these turbines revolve idly in their cases the highest speed ever attained on the sea was the fortytwo miles per hour of the unfortunate viper a turbine destroyer which developed 11500 horse power though displacing only 370 tons this velocity would compare favourably with that of a good many expresses on certain railways that we could name in the future thirty miles an hour will certainly be attained by turbinedriven liners 7 even at this speed the wheel has a circumferential velocity of twothirds that of a bullet shot from a leemetford rifle a vane weighing only 250 grains about 12 oz exerts under these conditions a centrifugal pull of 15 cwt on the wheel chapter iv the internalcombustion

an airtight vessel the fuel does not actually touch the working fluid in the gas or oil engine the fuel is brought into contact and mixed with the working fluid which is air it combines suddenly with it in the cylinder and heat energy is developed so rapidly that the act is called an explosion coal gas mineral oils alcohol petrol etc all contain hydrogen and carbon if air which contributes oxygen be added to any of these in due proportion the mixture becomes highly explosive on a light being applied oxygen and carbon unite also hydrogen and oxygen and violent heat is generated causing a violent molecular bombardment of the sides of the vessel containing the mixture now if the mixture be compressed it becomes hotter and hotter until a point is reached at which it ignites spontaneously early gasengines did not compress the charge before ignition alphonse beau de rochas a frenchman first thought of making the piston of the engine squeeze the mixture before ignition and from the year 1862 when he proposed this innovation the success of the internalcombustion engine may be said to date illustration illustration fig 39showing the four strokes that the piston of a gasengine makes during one cycle action of the engine the gasengine the oilengine and the motorcar engine are similar in general principles the cylinder has instead of a slidevalve two or sometimes three mushroom valves which may be described as small and thick round plates with bevelled edges mounted on the ends of short rods called stems these valves open into the cylinder upwards downwards or horizontally as the case may be being pushed in by cams projecting from a shaft rotated by the engine for the present we will confine our attention to the series of operations which causes the engine to work this series is called the beau de rochas or otto cycle and includes four movements of the piston reference to fig 39 will show exactly what happens in a gasengine1 the piston moves from left to right and just as the movement commences valves g gas and a air open to admit the explosive mixture by the time that p has reached the end of its travel these valves have closed again 2 the piston returns to the left compressing the mixture which has no way of escape open to it at the end of the stroke the charge is ignited by an incandescent tube i in motor car and some stationary engines by an electric spark and 3 the piston flies out again on the explosion stroke before it reaches the limit position valve e exhaust opens and 4 the piston flies back under the momentum of the flywheel driving out the burnt gases through the still open e the cycle is now complete there has been suction compression including ignition combustion and exhaustion it is evident that a heavy flywheel must be attached to the crank shaft because the energy of one stroke the explosion has to serve for the whole cycle in other words for two complete revolutions of the crank a singlecylinder steamengine develops an impulse every halfturnthat is four times as often in order to get a more constant turning effect motor cars have two three four six and even eight cylinders fourcylinder engines are at present the most popular type for powerful cars the motor car illustration fig 40plan of the chassis of a motor car we will now proceed to an examination of the motor car which in addition to mechanical apparatus for the transmission of motion to the drivingwheels includes all the fundamental adjuncts of the internalcombustion engine8 fig 40 is a birdseye view of the chassis or works and wheels of a car from which the body has been removed starting at the left we have the handle for setting the engine in motion the engine a twocylinder in this case the flywheel inside which is the clutch the gearbox containing the cogs for altering the speed of revolution of the drivingwheels relatively to that of the engine the propeller shaft the silencer for deadening the noise of the exhaust and the bevelgear for turning the drivingwheels in the particular type of car here considered you will notice that a direct or shaft drive is used the shaft has at each end a flexible or universal joint which allows the shaft to turn freely even though it may not be in a line with the shaft projecting from the gearbox it must be remembered that the engine and gearbox are mounted on the frame between which and the axles are springs so that when the car bumps up and down the shaft describes part of a circle of which the gearbox end is the centre an alternative method of driving is by means of chains which run round sprocket cog wheels on the ends of a shaft crossing the frame just behind the gearbox and round larger sprockets attached to the hubs of the drivingwheels in such a case the axles of the drivingwheel are fixed to the springs and the wheels revolve round them where a cardan shaft drive is used the axles are attached rigidly to the wheels at one end and extend through tubes fixed to the springs to bevelwheels in a central compensatinggear box of which more presently several partsthe carburetter tanks governor and pumpare not shown in the general plan these will be referred to in the more detailed account that follows the startinghandle illustration fig 41the startinghandle fig 41 gives the startinghandle in part section the handle h is attached to a tube which terminates in a clutch c a powerful spring keeps c normally apart from a second clutch c1 keyed to the engine shaft when the driver wishes to start the engine he presses the handle towards the right brings the clutches together and turns the handle in a clockwise direction as soon as the engine begins to fire the faces of the clutches slip over one another the engine illustration fig 42end and cross sections of a twocylinder motor we next examine the twocylinder engine fig 42 each cylinder is surrounded by a waterjacket through which water is circulated by a pump9 fig 43 the heat generated by combustion is so great that the walls of the cylinder would soon become redhot unless some of the heat were quickly carried away the pistons are of trunk formthat is long enough to act as guides and absorb the oblique thrust of the piston rods three or more piston rings lying in slots not shown prevent the escape of gas past the piston it is interesting to notice that the efficiency of an internalcombustion engine depends so largely on the good fit of these moving parts that cylinders pistons and rings must be exceedingly true a good firm will turn out standard parts which are well within 15000 of an inch of perfect truth it is also a wonderful testimony to the quality of the materials used that if properly looked after an engine which has made many millions of revolutions at the rate of 1000 to 2000 per minute often shows no appreciable signs of wear in one particular test an engine was run continuously for several months and at the end of the trial was in absolutely perfect condition the cranks revolve in an oiltight case generally made of aluminium and dip in oil which they splash up into the cylinder to keep the piston well lubricated the plate p p through a slot in which the piston rod works prevents an excess of oil being flung up channels are provided for leading oil into the bearings the cranks are 180 apart while one piston is being driven out by an explosion the other is compressing its charge prior to ignition so that the one action deadens the other therefore two explosions occur in one revolution of the cranks and none during the next revolution if both cranks were in line the pistons would move together giving one explosion each revolution illustration fig 43showing how the water which cools the cylinders is circulated the valve seats and the inlet and exhaust pipes are seen in section the inlet valve here works automatically being pulled in by suction but on many engineson all powerful enginesthe inlet like the exhaust valve is lifted by a cam lest it should stick or work irregularly three dotted circles show a a cog on the crank shaft b a lay cog which transmits motion to c on a short shaft rotating the cam that lifts the exhaust valve c having twice as many teeth as a revolves at half its rate this ensures that the valve shall be lifted only once in two revolutions of the crank shaft to which it is geared the cogs are timed or arranged so that the cam begins to lift the valve when the piston has made about seveneighths of its explosion stroke and closes the valve at the end of the exhaust stroke the carburetter a motor car generally uses petrol as its fuel petrol is one of the more volatile products of petroleum and has a specific gravity of about 680that is volume for volume its weight is to that of water in the proportion of 680 to 1000 it is extremely dangerous as it gives off an inflammable gas at ordinary temperatures benzine which we use to clean clothes is practically the same as petrol and should be treated with equal care the function of a carburetter is to reduce petrol to a very fine spray and mix it with a due quantity of air the device consists of two main parts fig 44the float chamber and the jet chamber in the former is a contrivance for regulating the petrol supply a floata cork or airtight metal boxis arranged to move freely up and down the stem of a needlevalve which closes the inlet from the tank at the bottom of the chamber are two pivoted levers w w which when the float rests on them tip up and lift the valve petrol flows in and raises the float this allows the valve to sink and cut off the supply if the valve is a good fit and the float is of the correct weight the petrol will never rise higher than the tip of the jet g illustration fig 44section of a carburetter the suction of the engine makes petrol spirt through the jet which has a very small hole in its end and atomize itself against a sprayingcone a it then passes to the engine inlet pipe through a number of openings after mixing with air entering from below an extra air inlet controllable by the driver is generally added unless the carburetter be of a type which automatically maintains constant proportions of air and vapour the jet chamber is often surrounded by a jacket through which part of the hot exhaust gases circulate in cold weather especially this is a valuable aid to vaporization illustration fig 45sketch of the electrical ignition arrangements on a motor car ignition of the charge all petrolcars now use electrical ignition there are two main systems1 by an accumulator and induction coil 2 magneto ignition by means of a small dynamo driven by the engine a general arrangement of the first is shown in fig 45 a disc d of some insulating materialfibre or vulcaniteis mounted on the cam or halfspeed shaft into the circumference is let a piece of brass called the contactpiece through which a screw passes to the cam shaft a movable plate m p which can be rotated concentrically with d through part of a circle carries a wipe block at the end of a spring which presses it against d the spring itself is attached to an insulated plate when the revolution of d brings the wipe and contact together current flows from the accumulator through switch s to the wipe through the contactpiece to c from c to m p and the induction coil and back to the accumulator this is the primary or lowtension circuit a hightension current is induced by the coil in the secondary circuit indicated by dotted lines10 in this circuit is the sparkingplug see fig 46 having a central insulated rod in connection with one terminal of the secondary coil between it and a bent wire projecting from the iron casing of the plug in contact with the other terminal of the secondary coil through the metal of the engine to which one wire of the circuit is attached is a small gap across which the secondary current leaps when the primary current is broken by the wipe and contact parting company the spark is intensely hot and suffices to ignite the compressed charge in the cylinder illustration fig 46section of a sparkingplug advancing the spark we will assume that the position of w in fig 45 is such that the contact touches w at the moment when the piston has just completed the compression stroke now the actual combustion of the charge occupies an appreciable time and with the engine running at high speed the piston would have travelled some way down the cylinder before the full force of the explosion was developed but by raising lever l the position of w may be so altered that contact is made slightly before the compression stroke is complete so that the charge is fairly alight by the time the piston has altered its direction this is called advancing the spark governing the engine there are several methods of controlling the speed of internalcombustion engines the operating mechanism in most cases is a centrifugal ballgovernor when the speed has reached the fixed limit it either 1 raises the exhaust valve so that no fresh charges are drawn in 2 prevents the opening of the inlet valve or 3 throttles the gas supply the last is now most commonly used on motor cars in conjunction with some device for putting it out of action when the driver wishes to exceed the highest speed that it normally permits illustration fig 47one form of governor used on motor cars a sketch of a neat governor with regulating attachment is given in fig 47 the governor shaft is driven from the engine as the balls b b increase their velocity they fly away from the shaft and move the arms a a and a sliding tube c towards the right this rocks the lever r and allows the valves in the inlet pipe to close and reduce the supply of air and gas a wedge w which can be raised or lowered by lever l intervenes between the end of r and the valve stem if this lever be lifted to its highest position the governing commences at a lower speed as the valve then has but a short distance to travel before closing completely for high speeds the driver depresses l forces the wedge down and so minimizes the effect of the governor the clutch the engine shaft has on its rear end the flywheel which has a broad and heavy rim turned to a conical shape inside close to this revolving loosely on the shaft is the clutch plate a heavy disc with a broad edge so shaped as to fit the inside of a flywheel it is generally faced with leather a very strong spring presses the plate into the flywheel and the resulting friction is sufficient to prevent any slip projections on the rear of the clutch engage with the gearbox shaft the driver throws out the clutch by depressing a lever with his foot some clutches dispense with the leather lining these are termed metal to metal clutches the gearbox we now come to a very interesting detail of the motor car the gearbox the steamengine has its speed increased by admitting more steam to the cylinders but an explosion engine must be run at a high speed to develop its full power and when heavier work has to be done on a hill it becomes necessary to alter the speed ratio of engine to drivingwheels our illustration fig 48 gives a section of a gearbox which will serve as a typical example it provides three forward speeds and one reverse to understand how it works we must study the illustration carefully pinion 1 is mounted on a hollow shaft turned by the clutch into the hollow shaft projects the end of another shaft carrying pinions 6 and 4 pinion 6 slides up and down this shaft which is square at this point but round inside the loose pinion 4 pinions 2 and 3 are keyed to a square secondary shaft and are respectively always in gear with 1 and 4 but 5 can be slid backwards and forwards so as to engage or disengage with 6 in the illustration no gear is in if the engine is working 1 revolves 2 2 turns 3 and 3 revolves 4 idly on its shaft illustration fig 48the gearbox of a motor car to get the lowest or first speed the driver moves his lever and slides 5 into gear with 6 the transmission then is 1 turns 2 2 turns 5 5 turns 6 6 turns the propeller shaft through the universal joint for the second speed 5 and 6 are disengaged and 6 is moved up the page as it were till projections on it interlock with slots in 4 thus driving 1 2 3 4 shaft for the third or solid speed 6 is pulled down into connection with 1 and couples the engine shaft direct to the propeller shaft the reverse is accomplished by raising a long pinion 7 which lies in the gearbox under 5 and 6 the drive then is 1 2 5 7 6 there being an odd number of pinions now engaged the propeller shaft turns in the reverse direction to that of the engine shaft illustration fig 49 the compensating gear every axle of a railway train carries a wheel at each end rigidly attached to it when rounding a corner the outside wheel has further to travel than the other and consequently one or both wheels must slip the curves are made so gentle however that the amount of slip is very small but with a tractionengine motor car or tricycle the case is different for all have to describe circles of very small diameter in proportion to the length of the vehicle therefore in every case a compensating gear is fitted to allow the wheels to turn at different speeds while permitting them both to drive fig 49 is an exaggerated sketch of the gear the axles of the moving wheels turn inside tubes attached to the springs and a central casing not shown and terminate in large bevelwheels c and d between these are small bevels mounted on a shaft supported by the driving drum if the latter be rotated the bevels would turn c and d at equal speeds assuming that both axles revolve without friction in their bearings we will suppose that the drum is turned 50 times a minute now if one wheel be held the other will revolve 100 times a minute or if one be slowed the other will increase its speed by a corresponding amount the average speed remains 50 it should be mentioned that drum a has incorporated with it on the outside a bevelwheel not shown rotated by a smaller bevel on the end of the propeller shaft the silencer the petrolengine as now used emits the products of combustion at a high pressure if unchecked they expand violently and cause a partial vacuum in the exhaust pipe into which the air rushes back with such violence as to cause a loud noise devices called silencers are therefore fitted to render the escape more gradual and split it up among a number of small apertures the simplest form of silencer is a cylindrical box with a number of finely perforated tubes passing from end to end of it the exhaust gases pouring into the box maintain a constant pressure somewhat higher than that of the atmosphere but as the gases are escaping from it in a fairly steady stream the noise becomes a gentle hiss rather than a pop there are numerous types of silencers but all employ this principle in one form or another the brakes every car carries at least two brakes of band patternone usually worked by a side handlever acting on the axle or hubs of the drivingwheel the other operated by the foot acting on the transmission gear see fig 48 the latter brake is generally arranged to withdraw the clutch simultaneously tests have proved that even heavy cars can be pulled up in astonishingly short distances considering their rate of travel trials made in the united states with a touring car and a fourinhand coach gave 2513 and 70 feet respectively for the distance in which the speed could be reduced from sixteen miles per hour to zero speed of cars as regards speed motor cars can rival the fastest express trains even on long journeys in fact feats performed during the gordonbennett and other races have equalled railway performances over equal distances when we come to record speeds we find a car specially built for the purpose covering a mile in less than half a minute a speed of over 120 miles an hour has actually been reached engines of 150 hp can now be packed into a vehicle scaling less than 112 tons even on touring cars are often found engines developing 40 to 60 hp which force the car up steep hills at a pace nothing less than astonishing in the future the motor car will revolutionize our modes of life to an extent comparable to the changes effected by the advent of the steamengine even since 1896 when the manwiththeflag law was abolished in the british isles the motor has reduced distances opened up country districts and generally quickened the pulses of the community in a manner which makes it hazardous to prophesy how the next generation will live notethe author is much indebted to mr wilfrid j lineham m inst ce for several of the illustrations which appear in the above chapter 8 steamdriven cars are not considered in this chapter as their principle is much the same as that of the ordinary locomotive 9 on some cars natural circulation is used the hot water flowing from the top of the cylinder to the tank from which it returns after being cooled to the bottom of the cylinder 10 for explanation of the induction coil see p 122 chapter v electrical apparatus what is electricityforms of electricitymagnetismthe permanent magnetlines of forceelectromagnetsthe electric bellthe induction coilthe condensertransformation of currentuses of the induction coil what is electricity of the ultimate nature of electricity as of that of heat and light we are at present ignorant but it has been clearly established that all three phenomena are but manifestations of the energy pervading the universe by means of suitable apparatus one form can be converted into another form the heat of fuel burnt in a boiler furnace develops mechanical energy in the engine which the boiler feeds with steam the engine revolves a dynamo and the electric current thereby generated can be passed through wires to produce mechanical motion heat or light we must remain content therefore with assuming that electricity is energy or motion transmitted through the ether from molecule to molecule or from atom to atom of matter scientific investigation has taught us how to produce it at will how to harness it to our uses and how to measure it but not what it is that question may perhaps remain unanswered till the end of human history a great difficulty attending the explanation of electrical action is thisthat except in one or two cases no comparison can be established between it and the operation of gases and fluids when dealing with the steamengine any ordinary intelligence soon grasps the principles which govern the use of steam in cylinders or turbines the diagrams show it is hoped quite plainly how it works but electricity is elusive invisible and the greatest authorities cannot say what goes on at the poles of a magnet or on the surface of an electrified body even the existence of negative and positive electricity is problematical however we see the effects and we know that if one thing is done another thing happens so that we are at least able to use terms which while convenient are not at present controverted by scientific progress forms of electricity rub a vulcanite rod and hold one end near some tiny pieces of paper they fly to it stick to it for a time and then fall off the rod was electrifiedthat is its surface was affected in such a way as to be in a state of molecular strain which the contact of the paper fragments alleviated by rubbing large surfaces and collecting the electricity in suitable receivers the strain can be made to relieve itself in the form of a violent discharge accompanied by a bright flash this form of electricity is known as static next place a copper plate and a zinc plate into a jar full of diluted sulphuric acid if a wire be attached to them a current of electricity is said to flow along the wire we must not however imagine that anything actually moves along inside the wire as water steam or air passes through a pipe professor trowbridge says11 no other agency for transmitting power can be stopped by such slight obstacles as electricity a thin sheet of paper placed across a tube conveying compressed air would be instantly ruptured it would take a wall of steel at least an inch thick to stand the pressure of steam which is driving a 10000 horsepower engine a thin layer of dirt beneath the wheels of an electric car can prevent the current which propels the car from passing to the rail and then back to the powerhouse there would indeed be a puncture of the paper if the current had a sufficient voltage or pressure yet the fact remains that current electricity can be very easily confined to its conductor by means of some insulating or nonconducting envelope magnetism the most familiar form of electricity is that known as magnetism when a bar of steel or iron is magnetized it is supposed that the molecules in it turn and arrange themselves with all their northseeking poles towards the one end of the bar and their southseeking poles towards the other if the bar is balanced freely on a pivot it comes to rest pointing north and south for the earth being a huge magnet its north pole attracts all the northseeking poles of the molecules and its south poles the southseeking poles the northseeking pole of a magnet is marked n though it is in reality the south pole for unlike poles are mutually attractive and like poles repellent there are two forms of magnetpermanent and temporary if steel is magnetized it remains so but soft iron loses practically all its magnetism as soon as the cause of magnetization is withdrawn this is what we should expect for steel is more closely compacted than iron and the molecules therefore would be able to turn about more easily12 it is fortunate for us that this is so since on the rapid magnetization and demagnetization of soft iron depends the action of many of our electrical mechanisms the permanent magnet magnets are either 1 straight in which case they are called bar magnets or 2 of horseshoe form as in figs 50 and 51 by bending the magnet the two poles are brought close together and the attraction of both may be exercised simultaneously on a bar of steel or iron lines of force in fig 50 are seen a number of dotted lines these are called lines of magnetic force if you lay a sheet of paper on a horseshoe magnet and sprinkle it with iron dust you will at once notice how the particles arrange themselves in curves similar in shape to those shown in the illustration it is supposed it cannot be proved that magnetic force streams away from the n pole and describes a circular course through the air back to the s pole the same remark applies to the bar magnet electrical magnets illustration fig 50permanent magnet and the lines of force emanating from it if an insulated wire is wound round and round a steel or iron bar from end to end and has its ends connected to the terminals of an electric battery current rotates round the bar and the bar is magnetized by increasing the strength and volume of the current and multiplying the number of turns of wire the attractive force of the magnet is increased now disconnect the wires from the battery if of iron the magnet at once loses its attractive force but if of steel it retains it in part instead of a simple horseshoeshaped bar two shorter bars riveted into a plate are generally used for electromagnets of this type coils of wire are wound round each bar and connected so as to form one continuous whole but the wire of one coil is wound in the direction opposite to that of the other the free end of each goes to a battery terminal in fig 51 you will notice that some of the lines of force are deflected through the iron bar a they pass more easily through iron than through air and will choose iron by preference the attraction exercised by a magnet on iron may be due to the effort of the lines of force to shorten their paths it is evident that the closer a comes to the poles of the magnet the less will be the distance to be travelled from one pole to the bar along it and back to the other pole illustration fig 51electromagnet a armature b battery having now considered electricity in three of its formsstatic current and rotatorywe will pass to some of its applications the electric bell a fit device to begin with is the electric bell which has so largely replaced wirepulled bells these last cause a great deal of trouble sometimes since if a wire snaps it may be necessary to take up carpets and floorboards to put things right their installation is not simple for at every corner must be put a crank to alter the direction of the pull and the cranks mean increased friction but when electric wires have once been properly installed there should be no need for touching them for an indefinite period they can be taken round as many corners as you wish without losing any of their conductivity and be placed wherever is most convenient for examination one bell may serve a large number of rooms if an indicator be used to show where the call was made from by a card appearing in one of a number of small windows before answering a call the attendant presses in a button to return the card to its normal position in fig 52 we have a diagrammatic view of an electric bell and current when the bellpush is pressed in current flows from the battery to terminal t1 round the electromagnet m through the pillar p and flat steel springs s and b through the platinumpointed screw and back to the battery through the push the circulation of current magnetizes m which attracts the iron armature a attached to the spring s and draws the hammer h towards the gong just before the stroke occurs the spring b leaves the tip of the screw and the circuit is broken so that the magnet no longer attracts h is carried by its momentum against the gong and is withdrawn by the spring until b once more makes contact and the magnet is reexcited the hammer vibrations recur many times a second as long as the push is pressed in illustration fig 52sketch of an electricbell circuit the electric bell is used for so many purposes that they cannot all be noted it plays an especially important part in telephonic installations to draw the attention of the subscribers forms an item in automatic fire and burglar alarms and is a necessary adjunct of railway signalling cabins the induction or ruhmkorff coil reference was made in connection with the electrical ignition of internalcombustion engines p 101 to the induction coil this is a device for increasing the voltage or pressure of a current the twocell accumulator carried in a motor car gives a voltage otherwise called electromotive force emf of 44 volts if you attach a wire to one terminal of the accumulator and brush the loose end rapidly across the other terminal you will notice that a bright spark passes between the wire and the terminal in reality there are two sparks one when they touch and another when they separate but they occur so closely together that the eye cannot separate the two impressions a spark of this kind would not be sufficiently hot to ignite a charge in a motor cylinder and a spark from the induction coil is therefore used illustration fig 53sketch of an induction coil we give a sketch of the induction coil in fig 53 it consists of a core of soft iron wires round which is wound a layer of coarse insulated wire denoted by the thick line one end of the winding of this primary coil is attached to the battery the other to the base of a hammer h vibrating between the end of the core and a screw s passing through an upright t connected with the other terminal of the battery the action of the hammer is precisely the same as that of the armature of an electric bell outside the primary coil are wound many turns of a much finer wire completely insulated from the primary coil the ends of this secondary coil are attached to the objects in the case of a motor car the insulated wire of the sparkingplug and a wire projecting from its outer iron casing between which a spark has to pass as soon as h touches s the circuit is completed the core becomes a powerful magnet with external lines of force passing from one pole to the other over and among the turns of the secondary coil h is almost instantaneously attracted by the core and the break occurs the lines of force now at least so it is supposed sink into the core cutting through the turns of the secondary and causing a powerful current to flow through them the greater the number of turns the greater the number of times the lines of force are cut and the stronger is the current if sufficiently intense it jumps any gap in the secondary circuit heating the intermediate air to a state of incandescence the condenser the sudden parting of h and s would produce strong sparking across the gap between them if it were not for the condenser which consists of a number of tinfoil sheets separated by layers of paraffined paper all the odd sheets are connected with t all the even with t1 now the more rapid the extinction of magnetism in the core after break of the primary circuit the more rapidly will the lines of force collapse and the more intense will be the induced current in the secondary coil the condenser diminishes the period of extinction very greatly while lengthening the period of magnetization after the make of the primary current and so decreasing the strength of the reverse current transformation of current the difference in the voltage of the primary and secondary currents depends on the length of the windings if there are 100 turns of wire in the primary and 100000 turns in the secondary the voltage will be increased 1000 times so that a 4volt current is stepped up to 4000 volts in the largest induction coils the secondary winding absorbs 200300 miles of wire and the spark given may be anything up to four feet in length such a spark would pierce a glass plate two inches thick it must not be supposed that an induction coil increases the amount of current given off by a battery it merely increases its pressure at the expense of its volumestores up its energy as it were until there is enough to do what a lowtension flow could not effect a fair comparison would be to picture the energy of the lowtension current as the momentum of a number of small pebbles thrown in succession at a door say 100 a minute if you went on pelting the door for hours you might make no impression on it but if you could knead every 100 pebbles into a single stone and throw these stones one per minute you would soon break the door in any intermittent current can be transformed as regards its intensity you may either increase its pressure while decreasing its rate of flow or amperage or decrease its pressure and increase its flow in the case that we have considered a continuous battery current is rendered intermittent by a mechanical contrivance but if the current comes from an alternating dynamothat is is already intermittentthe contactbreaker is not needed there will be more to say about transformation of current in later paragraphs uses of the induction coil the induction coil is used1 for passing currents through glass tubes almost exhausted of air or containing highly rarefied gases the luminous effects of these geissler tubes are very beautiful 2 for producing the now famous x or rntgen rays these rays accompany the light rays given off at the negative terminal cathode of a vacuum tube and are invisible to the eye unless caught on a fluorescent screen which reduces their rate of vibration sufficiently for the eye to be sensitive to them the rntgen rays have the peculiar property of penetrating many substances quite opaque to light such as metals stone wood etc and as a consequence have proved of great use to the surgeon in localizing or determining the nature of an internal injury they also have a deterrent effect upon cancerous growths 3 in wireless telegraphy to cause powerful electric oscillations in the ether 4 on motor cars for igniting the cylinder charges 5 for electrical massage of the body 11 what is electricity p 46 12 if a magnetized bar be heated to white heat and tapped with a hammer it loses its magnetism because the distance between the molecules has increased and the molecules can easily return to their original positions chapter vi the electric telegraph needle instrumentsinfluence of current on the magnetic

case over the top and under the bottom now lay the compass on a table and turn it about until the coil is on a line with the needlein fact covers it next touch the terminals of a battery with the ends of the wire the needle at once shifts either to right or left and remains in that position as long as the current flows if you change the wires over so reversing the direction of the current the needle at once points in the other direction it is to this conduct on the part of a magnetic needle when in a magnetic field that we owe the existence of the needle telegraph instrument needle instruments illustration fig 54sketch of the side elevation of a wheatstone needle instrument probably the bestknown needle instrument is the cookewheatstone largely used in signalboxes and in some postoffices a vertical section of it is shown in fig 54 it consists of a base b and an upright front a to the back of which are attached two hollow coils on either side of a magnetic needle mounted on the same shaft as a second dial needle n outside the front the wires w w are connected to the telegraph line and to the commutator a device which when the operator moves the handle h to right and left keeps reversing the direction of the current the needles on both receiving and transmitting instruments wag in accordance with the movements of the handle one or more movements form an alphabetical letter of the morse code thus if the needle points first to left and then to right and comes to rest in a normal position for a moment the letter a is signified rightleftleftleft in quick succession b rightleftrightleft c and so on where a marking instrument is used a dot signifies a left and a dash a right and if a sounder is employed the operator judges by the length of the intervals between the clicks influence of current on a magnetic needle illustration figs 55 56the coils of a needle instrument the arrows show the direction taken by the current figs 55 and 56 are two views of the coils and magnetic needle of the wheatstone instrument as they appear from behind in fig 55 the current enters the lefthand coil from the left and travels round and round it in a clockwise direction to the other end whence it passes to the other coil and away to the battery now a coil through which a current passes becomes a magnet its polarity depends on the direction in which the current flows suppose that you are looking through the coil and that the current enters it from your end if the wire is wound in a clockwise direction the s pole will be nearest you if in an anticlockwise direction the n pole in fig 55 the n poles are at the right end of the coils the s poles at the left end so the n pole of the needle is attracted to the right and the s pole to the left when the current is reversed

left b and r are in contact a simple method of changing the direction of the current in a twoinstrument circuit is shown diagrammatically in fig 57 the principle is used in the wheatstone needle instrument the battery terminals at each station are attached to two brass plates a b a1 b1 crossing these at right angles under a a1 and over b b1 are the flat brass springs l r l1 r1 having buttons at their lower ends and fixed at their upper ends to baseboards when at rest they all press upwards against the plates a and a1 respectively r and l1 are connected with the line circuit in which are the coils of dials 1 and 2 one at each station l and r1 are connected with the earthplates e e1 an operator at station 1 depresses r so as to touch b current now flows from the battery to b thence through r to the line circuit round the coils of both dials through l1 a1 and r to earthplate e1 through the earth to e and then back to the battery through l and a the needles assume the position shown to reverse the current the operator allows r to rise into contact with a and depresses l to touch b the course can be traced out easily in the wheatstone drophandle instrument fig 54 the commutator may be described as an insulated core on which are two short lengths of brass tubing one of these has rubbing against it a spring connected with the terminal of the battery the other has similar communication with the terminal projecting from each tube is a spike and rising from the baseboard are four upright brass strips not quite touching the commutator those on one side lead to the line circuit those on the other to the earthplate when the handle is turned one way the spikes touch the forward line strip and the rear earth strip and vice vers when moved in the opposite direction sounding instruments sometimes little brass strips are attached to the dial plate of a needle instrument for the needle to strike against as these give different notes the operator can comprehend the message by ear alone but the most widely used sounding instrument is the morse sounder named after its inventor for this a reversible current is not needed the receiver is merely an electromagnet connected with the line circuit and an earthplate which when a current passes attracts a little iron bar attached to the middle of a pivoted lever the free end of the lever works between two stops every time the circuit is closed by the transmitting key at the sending station the lever flies down against the lower stop to rise again when the circuit is broken the duration of its stay decides whether a long or short is meant telegraphic relays illustration fig 58section of a telegraph wire insulator on its arm the shaded circle is the line wire the two blank circles indicate the wire which ties the line wire to the insulator when an electric current has travelled for a long distance through a wire its strength is much reduced on account of the resistance of the wire and may be insufficient to cause the electromagnet of the sounder to move the heavy lever instead therefore of the current acting directly on the sounder magnet it is used to energize a small magnet or relay which pulls down a light bar and closes a second local circuitthat is one at the receiver endworked by a separate battery which has sufficient power to operate the sounder recording telegraphs by attaching a small wheel to the end of a morsesounder lever by arranging an inkwell for the wheel to dip into when the end falls and by moving a paper ribbon slowly along for the wheel to press against when it rises a selfrecording morse inker is produced the ribbonfeeding apparatus is set in motion automatically by the current and continues to pull the ribbon along until the message is completed the hughes typeprinter covers a sheet of paper with printed characters in bold roman type the transmitter has a keyboard on which are marked letters signs and numbers also a typewheel with the characters on its circumference rotated by electricity the receiver contains mechanisms for rotating another typewheel synchronouslythat is in timewith the first for shifting the wheel across the paper for pressing the paper against the wheel and for moving the paper when a fresh line is needed these are too complicated to be described here in detail by means of relays one transmitter may be made to work five hundred receivers in london a single operator controlling a keyboard in the central dispatching office causes typewritten messages to spell themselves out simultaneously in machines distributed all over the metropolis the tape machine resembles that just described in many details the main difference is that it prints on a continuous ribbon instead of on sheets automatic electric printers of some kind or other are to be found in the vestibules of all the principal hotels and clubs of our large cities and in the offices of bankers stockbrokers and newspaper editors in london alone over 500 million words are printed by the receivers in a year highspeed telegraphy at certain seasons or when important political events are taking place the telegraph service would become congested with news were there not some means of transmitting messages at a much greater speed than is possible by hand signalling fifty words a minute is about the limit speed that a good operator can maintain by means of wheatstones automatic transmitter the rate can be increased to 400 words per minute paper ribbons are punched in special machines by a number of clerks with a series of holes which by their position indicate a dot or a dash the ribbons are passed through a special transmitter over little electric brushes which make contact through the holes with surfaces connected to the line circuit at the receiver end the message is printed by a morse inker it has been found possible to send several messages simultaneously over a single line to effect this a distributer is used to put a number of transmitters at one end of the line in communication with an equal number of receivers at the other end fed by a second distributer keeping perfect time with the first instead of a signal coming as a whole to any one instrument it arrives in little bits but these follow one another so closely as to be practically continuous by working a number of automatic transmitters through a distributer a thousand words or more per minute are easily dispatched over a single wire the pollak virag system employs a punched ribbon and the receiver traces out the message in alphabetical characters on a moving strip of sensitized photographic paper a mirror attached to a vibrating diaphragm reflects light from a lamp on to the strip which is automatically developed and fixed in chemical baths the method of moving the mirror so as to make the rays trace out words is extremely ingenious messages have been transmitted by this system at the rate of 180000 words per hour chapter vii wireless telegraphy the transmitting apparatusthe receiving apparatussyntonic transmissionthe advance of wireless telegraphy in our last chapter we reviewed briefly some systems of sending telegraphic messages from one point of the earths surface to another through a circuit consisting partly of an insulated wire and partly of the earth itself the metallic portion of a long circuit especially if it be a submarine cable is costly to install so that in quite the early days of telegraphy efforts were made to use the ether in the place of wire as one conductor when a hammer strikes an anvil the air around is violently disturbed this disturbance spreads through the molecules of the air in much the same way as ripples spread from the splash of a stone thrown into a pond when the sound waves reach the ear they agitate the tympanum or drum membrane and we hear a noise the hammer is here the transmitter the air the conductor the ear the receiver in wireless telegraphy we use the ether as the conductor of electrical disturbances13 marconi slaby branly lodge de forest popoff and others have invented apparatus for causing disturbances of the requisite kind and for detecting their presence the main features of a wireless telegraphy outfit are shown in figs 59 and 61 the transmitter apparatus we will first consider the transmitting outfit fig 59 it includes a battery dispatching key and an induction coil having its secondary circuit terminals connected with two wires the one leading to an earthplate the other carried aloft on poles or suspended from a kite in the large station at poldhu cornwall for transatlantic signalling there are special wooden towers 215 feet high between which the arial wires hang at their upper and lower ends respectively the earth and arial wires terminate in brass balls separated by a gap when the operator depresses the key the induction coil charges these balls and the wires attached thereto with hightension electricity as soon as the quantity collected exceeds the resistance of the airgap a discharge takes place between the balls and the ether round the arial wire is violently disturbed and waves of electrical energy are propagated through it the rapidity with which the discharges follow one another and their travelling power depends on the strength of the induction coil the length of the airgap and the capacity of the wires14 illustration fig 59sketch of the transmitter of a wireless telegraphy outfit illustration fig 60a marconi coherer receiving apparatus the human body is quite insensitive to these etheric waves we cannot feel hear or see them but at the receiving station there is what may be called an electric eye technically it is named a coherer a marconi coherer is seen in fig 60 inside a small glass tube exhausted of air are two silver plugs p p carrying terminals t t projecting through the glass at both ends a small gap separates the plugs at the centre and this gap is partly filled with nickelsilver powder if the terminals of the coherer are attached to those of a battery practically no current will pass under ordinary conditions as the particles of nickelsilver touch each other very lightly and make a bad contact but if the coherer is also attached to wires leading into the earth and air and ether waves strike those wires at every impact the particles will coherethat is pack tightly togetherand allow battery current to pass the property of cohesion of small conductive bodies when influenced by hertzian waves was first noticed in 1874 by professor de hughes while experimenting with a telephone illustration fig 61sketch of the receiving apparatus in a wireless telegraphy outfit we are now in a position to examine the apparatus of which a coherer forms part fig 61 first we notice the arial and earth wires to which are attached other wires from battery a this battery circuit passes round the relay magnet r and through two choking coils whose function is to prevent the hertzian waves entering the battery the relay when energized brings contact d against e and closes the circuit of battery b which is much more powerful than battery a and operates the magnet m as well as the tapper which is practically an electric bell minus the gong the tapper circuit is indicated by the dotted lines we will suppose the transmitter of a distant station to be at work the electric waves strike the arial wire of the receiving station and cause the coherer to cohere and pass current the relay is closed and both tapper and morse inker begin to work the tapper keeps striking the coherer and shakes the particles loose after every cohesion if this were not done the current of a would pass continuously after cohesion had once taken place when the key of the transmitter is pressed down the waves follow one another very quickly and the acquired conductivity of the coherer is only momentarily destroyed by the tap of the hammer during the impression of a dot by the morse inker contact is made and broken repeatedly but as the armature of the inker is heavy and slow to move it does not vibrate in time with the relay and tapper therefore the morse instrument reproduces in dots and dashes the short and long depressions of the key at the transmitting station while the tapper works rapidly in time with the relay the morse inker is shown diagrammatically while current passes through m the armature is pulled towards it the end p carrying an inked wheel rises and a mark is made on the tape w which is moved continuously being drawn forward off reel r by the clockworkor electricallydriven rollers r1 r2 syntonic transmission if a number of transmitting stations are sending out messages simultaneously a jumble of signals would affect all the receivers round unless some method were employed for rendering a receiver sensitive only to the waves intended to influence it also if distinction were impossible even with one transmitter in action its message might go to undesired stations there are various ways of tuning receivers and transmitters but the principle underlying them all is analogous to that of mechanical vibration if a weight is suspended from the end of a spiral spring and given an upward blow it bobs up and down a certain number of times per minute every movement from start to finish having exactly the same duration as the rest the resistance of the air and the internal friction of the spring gradually lessen the amplitude of the movements and the weight finally comes to rest suppose that the weight scales 30 lbs and that it naturally bobs twenty times a minute if you now take a feather and give it a push every three seconds you can coax it into vigorous motion assuming that every push catches it exactly on the rebound the same effect would be produced more slowly if 6 or 9 second intervals were substituted but if you strike it at 4 5 or 7 second intervals it will gradually cease to oscillate as the effect of one blow neutralizes that of another the same phenomenon is witnessed when two tuningforks of equal pitch are mounted near one another and one is struck the other soon picks up the note but a fork of unequal pitch would remain dumb now every electrical circuit has a natural period of oscillation in which its electric charge vibrates it is found possible to tune or syntonize the arial rod or wire of a receiving station with a transmitter a vertical wire about 200 feet in length says professor ja fleming15 has a natural time period of electrical oscillation of about onemillionth of a second therefore if waves strike this wire a million times a second they will reinforce one another and influence the coherer whereas a less or greater frequency will leave it practically unaffected by adjusting the receiving circuit to the transmitter or vice vers selective wireless telegraphy becomes possible advance of wireless telegraphy the history of wireless telegraphy may be summed up as follows 1842professor morse sent arial messages across the susquehanna river a line containing a battery and transmitter was carried on posts along one bank and earthed in the river at each end on the other bank was a second wire attached to a receiver and similarly earthed whenever contact was made and broken on the battery side the receiver on the other was affected distance about 1 mile 1859james bowman lindsay transmitted messages across the tay at glencarse in a somewhat similar way distance about 12 mile 1885sir william preece signalled from lavernock point near cardiff to steep holm an island in the bristol channel distance about 512 miles in all these electrical induction of current was employed 1886hertzian waves discovered 1895professor a popoff sent hertzian wave messages over a distance of 3 miles 1897marconi signalled from the needles hotel isle of wight to swanage 1712 miles 1901messages sent at sea for 380 miles 1901 dec 17messages transmitted from poldhu cornwall to hospital point newfoundland 2099 miles mr marconi has so perfected tuning devices that his transatlantic messages do not affect receivers placed on board ships crossing the ocean unless they are purposely tuned atlantic liners now publish daily small newspapers containing the latest news flashed through space from land stations in the united states the de forest and fessenden systems are being rapidly extended to embrace the most outoftheway districts every navy of importance has adopted wireless telegraphy which as was proved during the russojapanese war can be of the greatest help in directing operations 13 named after their first discoverer dr hertz of carlsruhe hertzian waves 14 for longdistance transmission powerful dynamos take the place of the induction coil and battery 15 technics vol ii p 566 chapter viii the telephone the bell telephonethe edison transmitterthe granular carbon transmittergeneral arrangement of a telephone circuitdoubleline circuitstelephone exchangessubmarine telephony for the purposes of everyday life the telephone is even more useful than the telegraph telephones now connect one room of a building with another house with house town with town country with country an infinitely greater number of words pass over the telephonic circuits of the world in a year than are transmitted by telegraph operators the telephone has become an important adjunct to the transaction of business of all sorts its wires penetrate everywhere without moving from his desk the london citizen may hold easy converse with a parisian a new yorker with a dweller in chicago wonderful as the transmission of signals over great distances is the transmission of human speech so clearly that individual voices may be distinguished hundreds of miles away is even more so yet the instrument which works the miracle is essentially simple in its principles the bell telephone illustration fig 62section of a bell telephone the first telephone that came into general use was that of bell shown in fig 62 in a central hole of an ebonite casing is fixed a permanent magnet m the casing expands at one end to accommodate a coil of insulated wire wound about one extremity of a magnet the coil ends are attached to wires passing through small channels to terminals at the rear a circular diaphragm d of very thin iron plate clamped between the concave mouthpiece and the casing almost touches the end of the magnet we will suppose that two bell telephones a and b are connected up by wires so that the wires and the coils form a complete circuit words are spoken into a the air vibrations passing through the central hole in the cover make the diaphragm vibrate towards and away from the magnet the distances through which the diaphragm moves have been measured and found not to exceed in some cases more than 110000000 of an inch its movements distort the shape of the lines of force see p 118 emanating from the magnet and these cutting through the turns of the coil induce a current in the line circuit as the diaphragm approaches the magnet a circuit is sent in one direction as it leaves it in the other consequently speech produces rapidly alternating currents in the circuit their duration and intensity depending on the nature of the sound now consider telephone b the currents passing through its coil increase or diminish the magnetism of the magnet and cause it to attract its diaphragm with varying force the vibration of the diaphragm disturbs the air in exact accordance with the vibrations of as diaphragm and speech is reproduced the edison transmitter the bell telephone may be used both as a transmitter and a receiver and the permanent magnetism of the cores renders it independent of an electric battery but currents generated by it are so minute that they cannot overcome the resistance of a long circuit therefore a battery is now always used and with it a special device as transmitter if in a circuit containing a telephone and a battery there be a loose contact and this be shaken the varying resistance of the contact will cause electrical currents of varying force to pass through the circuit edison introduced the first successful microphone transmitter in which a small platinum disc connected to the diaphragm pressed with varying force against a disc of carbon each disc forming part of the circuit vibrations of the diaphragm caused current to flow in a series of rapid pulsations illustration fig 63section of a granular carbon transmitter the granular carbon transmitter in fig 63 we have a section of a microphone transmitter now very widely used it was invented in its original form by an english clergyman named hunnings resting in a central cavity of an ebonite seating is a carbon block c with a face moulded into a number of pyramidal projections p p the space between c and a carbon diaphragm d is packed with carbon granules g g c has direct contact with line terminal t which screws into it d with t1 through the brass casing screw s and a small plate at the back of the transmitter voice vibrations compress g g and allow current to pass more freely from d to c this form of microphone is very delicate and unequalled for longdistance transmission illustration fig 64a diagrammatic representation of a telephonic circuit general arrangement of a telephone circuit in many forms of subscribers instruments both receiver and transmitter are mounted on a single handle in such a way as to be conveniently placed for ear and mouth for the sake of clearness the diagrammatic sketch of a complete installation fig 64 shows them separated the transmitters it will be noticed are located in battery circuits including the primary windings p p2 of induction coils the transmitters are in the line circuit which includes the secondary windings s s2 of the coils we will assume that the transmitters are in the first instance both hung on the hooks of the metallic switches which their weight depresses to the position indicated by the dotted lines the handle of the magnetogenerator at the leftend station is turned and current passes through the closed circuitline a e b2 contact 10 the switch 9 line b 4 the other switch contact 5 and e b both bells ring both parties now lift their receivers from the switch hooks the switches rise against contacts 1 2 3 and 6 7 8 respectively both primary and both secondary circuits are now completed while the bells are disconnected from the line wires the pulsations set up by transmitter t in primary coil p are magnified by secondary coil s for transmission through the line circuit and affect both receivers the same thing happens when t2 is used at the end of the conversation the receivers are hung on their hooks again and the bell circuit is remade ready for the next call illustration a telephone exchange doubleline circuits the currents used in telephones pulsate very rapidly but are very feeble electric disturbances caused by the proximity of telegraph or tram wires would much interfere with them if the earth were used for the return circuit it has been found that a complete metallic circuit two wires is practically free from interference though where a number of wires are hung on the same poles speechsounds may be faintly induced in one circuit from another this defect is however minimized by crossing the wires about among themselves so that any one line does not pass round the corresponding insulator on every pole telephone exchanges in a district where a number of telephones are used the subscribers are put into connection with one another through an exchange to which all the wires lead one wire of each subscriber runs to a common earth the other terminates at a switchboard presided over by an operator in an exchange used by many subscribers the terminals are distributed over a number of switchboards each containing 80 to 100 terminals and attended to by an operator usually a girl when a subscriber wishes to be connected to another subscriber he either turns the handle of a magneto generator which causes a shutter to fall and expose his number at the exchange or simply depresses a key which works a relay at the exchange and lights a tiny electric lamp the operator seeing the signal connects her telephone with the subscribers circuit and asks the number wanted this given she rings up the other subscriber and connects the two circuits by means of an insulated wire cord having a spike at each end to fit the jack sockets of the switchboard terminals the two subscribers are now in communication illustration fig 65the headdress of an operator at a telephone exchange the receiver is fastened over one ear and the transmitter to the chest if a number on switchboard a calls for a number on switchboard c the operator at a connects her subscriber by a jack cord to a trunk line running to c where the operator similarly connects the trunk line with the number asked for after ringing up the subscriber the central exchange of one town is connected with that of another by one or more trunk lines so that a subscriber may speak through an indefinite number of exchanges so perfect is the modern telephone that the writer remembers on one occasion hearing the doorbell ring in a house more than a hundred miles away with which he was at the moment in telephonic connection though three exchanges were in the circuit submarine telephony though telegraphic messages are transmitted easily through thousands of miles of cable16 submarine telephony is at present restricted to comparatively short distances when a current passes through a cable electricity of opposite polarity induced on the outside of the cable damps the vibration in the conductor in the atlantic cable strong currents of electricity are poured periodically into one end and though much enfeebled when they reach the other they are sufficiently strong to work a very delicate mirror galvanometer invented by lord kelvin which moves a reflected ray up and down a screen the direction of the movements indicating a dot or a dash reversible currents are used in transmarine telegraphy the galvanometer is affected like the coils and small magnet in wheatstones needle instrument p 128 telephonic currents are too feeble to penetrate many miles of cable there is telephonic communication between england and france and england and ireland but transatlantic telephony is still a thing of the future it is hoped however that by inserting induction coils at intervals along the cables the currents may be stepped up from point to point and so get across turning to fig 64 we may suppose s to be on shore at the english end and s2 to be the primary winding of an induction coil a hundred miles away in the sea which magnifies the enfeebled vibrations for a journey to s3 where they are again revived and so on till the new world is reached the difficulty is to devise induction coils of great power though of small size yet science advances nowadays so fast that we may live to hear words spoken at the antipodes 16 in 1896 the late li hung chang sent a cablegram from china to england 12608 miles and received a reply in seven minutes chapter ix dynamos and electric motors a simple dynamocontinuouscurrent dynamosmultipolar dynamosexciting the field magnetsalternating current dynamosthe transmission of powerthe electric motorelectric lightingthe incandescent lamparc lampsseries and parallel arrangement of lampscurrent for electric lampselectroplating in previous chapters we have incidentally referred to the conversion of mechanical work into electrical energy in this we shall examine how it is donehow the silently spinning dynamo develops power and why the motor spins when current is passed through it we must begin by returning to our first electrical diagram fig 50 and calling to mind the invisible lines of force which permeate the ether in the immediate neighbourhood of a magnets poles called the magnetic field of the magnet many years ago 1831 the great michael faraday discovered that if a loop of wire were moved up and down between the poles of an electromagnet fig 66 a current was induced in the loop its direction depending upon that in which the loop was moved the energy required to cut the lines of force passed in some mysterious way into the wire why this is so we cannot say but taking advantage of the fact electricians have gradually developed the enormous machines which now send vehicles spinning over metal tracks light our streets and houses and supply energy to innumerable factories illustration fig 66 the strength of the current induced in a circuit cutting the lines of force of a magnet is called its pressure voltage or electromotive force expressed shortly emf it may be compared with the poundstothesquareinch of steam in order to produce an emf of one volt it is calculated that 100000000 lines of force must be cut every second the voltage depends on three things1 the strength of the magnet the stronger it is the greater the number of lines of force coming from it 2 the length of the conductor cutting the lines of force the longer it is the more lines it will cut 3 the speed at which the conductor moves the faster it travels the more lines it will cut in a given time it follows that a powerful dynamo or mechanical producer of current must have strong magnets and a long conductor and the latter must be moved at a high speed across the lines of force a simple dynamo in fig 67 we have the simplest possible form of dynamoa single turn of wire w x y z mounted on a spindle and having one end attached to an insulated ring c the other to an insulated ring c1 two small brushes b b1 of wire gauze or carbon rubbing continuously against these collecting rings connect them with a wire which completes the circuit the armature as the revolving coil is called is mounted between the poles of a magnet where the lines of force are thickest these lines are supposed to stream from the n to the s pole in fig 67 the armature has reached a position in which y z and w x are cutting no or very few lines of force as they move practically parallel to the lines this is called the zero position illustration fig 67 illustration fig 68 in fig 68 the armature moving at right angles to the lines of force cuts a maximum number in a given time and the current induced in the coil is therefore now most intense here we must stop a moment to consider how to decide in which direction the current flows the armature is revolving in a clockwise direction and y z therefore is moving downwards now suppose that you rest your left hand on the n pole of the magnet so that the arm lies in a line with the magnet point your forefinger towards the s pole it will indicate the direction of the lines of force bend your other three fingers downwards over the edge of the n pole they will indicate the direction in which the conductor is moving across the magnetic field stick out the thumb at right angles to the forefinger it points in the direction in which the induced current is moving through the nearer half of the coil therefore lines of force conductor and induced current travel in planes which like the top and two adjacent sides of a box are at right angles to one another while current travels from z to ythat is from the ring c1 to yit also travels from x to w because w x rises while y z descends so that a current circulates through the coil and the exterior part of the circuit including the lamp after z y has passed the lowest possible point of the circle it begins to ascend w x to descend the direction of the current is therefore reversed and as the change is repeated every halfrevolution this form of dynamo is called an alternator or creator of alternating currents a wellknown type of alternator is the magneto machine which sends shocks through any one who completes the external circuit by holding the brass handles connected by wires to the brushes the faster the handle of the machine is turned the more frequent is the alternation and the stronger the current illustration fig 69 continuouscurrent dynamos an alternating current is not so convenient for some purposes as a continuous current it is therefore sometimes desirable even necessary to convert the alternating into a unidirectional or continuous current how this is done is shown in figs 69 and 70 in place of the two collecting rings c c1 we now have a single ring split longitudinally into two portions one of which is connected to each end of the coil w x y z in fig 69 brush b has just passed the gap on to segment c brush b1 on to segment c1 for half a revolution these remain respectively in contact then just as y z begins to rise and w x to descend the brushes cross the gaps again and exchange segments so that the current is perpetually flowing one way through the circuit the effect of the commutator17 is in fact equivalent to transposing the brushes of the collecting rings of the alternator every time the coil reaches a zero position figs 71 and 72 give end views in section of the coil and the commutator with the coil in the position of minimum and maximum efficiency the arrow denotes the direction of movement the double dotted lines the commutator end of the revolving coil illustration fig 70 practical continuouscurrent dynamos the electrical output of our simple dynamo would be increased if instead of a single turn of wire we used a coil of many turns a further improvement would result from mounting on the shaft inside the coil a core or drum of iron to entice the lines of force within reach of the revolving coil it is evident that any lines which pass through the air outside the circle described by the coil cannot be cut and are wasted illustration fig 71 illustration fig 72 the core is not a solid mass of iron but built up of a number of very thin iron discs threaded on the shaft and insulated from one another to prevent electric eddies which would interfere with the induced current in the conductor18 sometimes there are openings through the core from end to end to ventilate and cool it illustration fig 73 we have already noticed that in the case of a single coil the current rises and falls in a series of pulsations such a form of armature would be unsuitable for large dynamos which accordingly have a number of coils wound over their drums at equal distances round the circumference and a commutator divided into an equal number of segments the subject of drum winding is too complicated for brief treatment and we must therefore be content with noticing that the coils are so connected to their respective commutator segments and to one another that they mutually assist one another a glance at fig 73 will help to explain this here we have in section a number of conductors on the right of the drum marked with a cross to show that current is moving as it were into the page connected with conductors on the left marked with a dot to signify current coming out of the page if the crossed and dotted conductors were respectively the up and down turns of a single coil terminating in a simple split commutator fig 69 when the coil had been revolved through an angle of 90 some of the up turns would be ascending and some descending so that conflicting currents would arise yet we want to utilize the whole surface of the drum and by winding a number of coils in the manner hinted at each coil as it passes the zero point top or bottom at once generates a current in the desired direction and reinforces that in all the other turns of its own and of other coils on the same side of a line drawn vertically through the centre there is thus practically no fluctuation in the pressure of the current generated the action of single and multiple coil windings may be compared to that of single and multiple pumps water is ejected by a single pump in gulps whereas the flow from a pipe fed by several pumps arranged to deliver consecutively is much more constant multipolar dynamos hitherto we have considered the magnetic field produced by one bipolar magnet only large dynamos have four six eight or more field magnets set inside a casing from which their cores project towards the armature so as almost to touch it fig 74 the magnet coils are wound to give n and s poles alternately at their armature ends round the field and the lines of force from each n pole stream each way to the two adjacent s poles across the path of the armature coils in dynamos of this kind several pairs of collecting brushes pick current off the commutator at equidistant points on its circumference illustration fig 74a holmes continuous current dynamo a armature c commutator m field magnets exciting the field magnets until current passes through the field magnet coils no magnetic field can be created how are the coils supplied with current a dynamo starting for the first time is excited by a current from an outside source but when it has once begun to generate current it feeds its magnets itself and ever afterwards will be selfexciting19 owing to the residual magnetism left in the magnet cores illustration fig 75partly finished commutator look carefully at figs 77 and 78 in the first of these you will observe that part of the wire forming the external circuit is wound round the arms of the field magnet this is called a series winding in this case all the current generated helps to excite the dynamo at the start the residual magnetism of the magnet cores gives a weak field the armature coils cut this and pass a current through the circuit the magnets are further excited and the field becomes stronger and so on till the dynamo is developing full power series winding is used where the current in the external circuit is required to be very constant illustration fig 76the brushes of a holmes dynamo fig 78 shows another method of windingthe shunt most of the current generated passes through the external circuit 2 2 but a part is switched through a separate winding for the magnets denoted by the fine wire 1 1 here the strength of the magnetism does not vary directly with the current as only a small part of the current serves the magnets the shunt winding is therefore used where the voltage or pressure must be constant illustration fig 77sketch showing a series winding illustration fig 78shunt winding a third method is a combination of the two already named a winding of fine wire passes from brush to brush round the magnets and there is also a series winding as in fig 77 this compound method is adapted more especially for electric traction alternating dynamos these have their field magnets excited by a separate continuous current dynamo of small size the field magnets usually revolve inside a fixed armature the reverse of the arrangement in a directcurrent generator or there may be a fixed central armature and field magnets revolving outside it this latter arrangement is found in the great power stations at niagara falls where the enormous fieldrings are mounted on the top ends of vertical shafts driven by waterturbines at the bottom of pits 178 feet deep down which water is led to the turbines through great pipes or penstocks the weight of each shaft and the fieldring attached totals about thirtyfive tons this mass revolves 250 times a minute and 5000 horse power is constantly developed by the dynamo similar dynamos of 10000 horse power each have been installed on the canadian side of the falls illustration fig 79 transmission of power alternating current is used where power has to be transmitted for long distances because such a current can be intensified or stepped up by a transformer somewhat similar in principle to a ruhmkorff coil minus a contactbreaker see p 122 a typical example of transformation is seen in fig 79 alternating current of 5000 volts pressure is produced in the generating station and sent through conductors to a distant station where a transformer b reduces the pressure to 500 volts to drive an alternating motor c which in turn operates a direct current dynamo d this dynamo has its terminal connected with the insulated or live rail of an electric railway and its terminal with the wheel rails which are metallically united at the joints to act as a return on its way from the live rail to the return the current passes through the motors in the case of trams the conductor is either a cable carried overhead on standards from which it passes to the motor through a trolley arm or a rail laid underground in a conduit between the rails in the top of the conduit is a slit through which an arm carrying a contact shoe on the end projects from the car the shoe rubs continuously on the live rail as the car moves to return for a moment to the question of transformation of current why it may be asked should we not send lowpressure direct current to a distant station straight from the dynamo instead of altering its nature and pressure or at any rate why not use highpressure direct current and transform that the answer is that to transmit a large amount of electrical energy at low pressure or voltage would necessitate large volume or amperage and a big and expensive copper conductor to carry it highpressure direct current is not easily generated since the sparking at the collecting brushes as they pass over the commutator segments gives trouble so engineers prefer highpressure alternating current which is easily produced and can be sent through a small and inexpensive conductor with little loss also its voltage can be transformed by apparatus having no revolving parts the electric motor anybody who understands the dynamo will also be able to understand the electric motor which is merely a reversed dynamo imagine in fig 70 a dynamo taking the place of the lamp and passing current through the brushes and commutator into the coil w x y z now any coil through which current passes becomes a magnet with n and s poles at either end in fig 70 we will assume that the n pole is below and the s pole above the coil the coil poles therefore try to seek the contrary poles of the permanent magnet and the coil revolves until its s pole faces the n of the magnet and vice vers the lines of force of the coil and the magnet are now parallel but the momentum of revolution carries the coil on and suddenly the commutator reverses its polarity and a further halfrevolution takes place then comes a further reversal and so on ad infinitum the rotation of the motor is therefore merely a question of repulsion and attraction of like and unlike poles an ordinary compass needle may be converted into a tiny motor by presenting the n and s poles of a magnet to its s and n poles alternately every halfrevolution in construction and winding a motor is practically the same as a dynamo in fact either machine can perform either function though perhaps not equally well adapted for both motors may be run with direct or alternating current according to their construction on electric cars the motor is generally suspended from the wheel truck and a small pinion on the armature shaft gears with a large pinion on a wheel axle one great advantage of electric traction is that every vehicle of a train can carry its own motor so that the whole weight of the train may be used to get a grip on the rails when starting where a single steam locomotive is used the adhesion of its drivingwheels only is available for overcoming the inertia of the load and the whole strain of starting is thrown on to the foremost couplings other advantages may be summed up as follows1 ease of starting and rapid acceleration 2 absence of waste of energy in the shape of burning fuel when the vehicles are at rest 3 absence of smoke and smell electric lighting dynamos are used to generate current for two main purposes1 to supply power to motors of all kinds 2 to light our houses factories and streets in private houses and theatres incandescent lamps are generally used in the open air in shops and in larger buildings such as railway stations the arc lamp is more often found incandescent lamp if you take a piece of very fine iron wire and lay it across the terminals of an accumulator it becomes white hot and melts owing to the heat generated by its resistance to the current a piece of fine platinum wire would become white hot without melting and would give out an intense light here we have the principle of the glow or incandescent lampnamely the interposition in an electric circuit of a conductor which at once offers a high resistance to the current but is not destroyed by the resulting heat in fig 80 is shown a fan propelling liquid constantly through a pipe let us assume that the liquid is one which develops great friction on the inside of the pipe at the contraction where the speed of travel is much greater than elsewhere in the circuit most heat will be produced illustration fig 80diagram to show circulation of water through a pipe in quite the early days of the glowlamp platinum wire was found to be unreliable as regards melting and filaments of carbon are now used to prevent the wasting away of the carbon by combination with oxygen the filament is enclosed in a glass bulb from which practically all air has been sucked by a mercury pump before sealing illustration fig 81the electrical counterpart of fig 80 the filament takes the place of the contraction in the pipe the manufacture of glowlamps is now an important industry one brand of lamp20 is made as followsfirst cottonwool is dissolved in chloride of zinc and forms a treacly solution which is squirted through a fine nozzle into a settling solution which hardens it and makes it coil up like a very fine violin string after being washed and dried it is wound on a plumbago rod and baked in a furnace until only the carbon element remains this is the filament in the rough it is next removed from the rod and tipped with two short pieces of fine platinum wire to make the junction electrically perfect the filament is plunged in benzine and heated to whiteness by the passage of a strong current which deposits the carbon of the benzine on the joints the filament is now placed under the glass receiver of an airpump the air is exhausted hydrocarbon vapour is introduced and the filament has a current passed through it to make it white hot carbon from the vapour is deposited all over the filament until the required electrical resistance is attained the filament is now ready for enclosure in the bulb when the bulb has been exhausted and sealed the lamp is tested and if passed goes to the finishing department where the two platinum wires projecting through the glass are soldered to a couple of brass plates which make contact with two terminals in a lamp socket finally brass caps are affixed with a special watertight and hard cement arc lamps in arc lighting instead of a contraction at a point in the circuit there is an actual break of very small extent suppose that to the ends of the wires leading from a dynamos terminals we attach two carbon rods and touch the end of the rods together the tips become white hot and if they are separated slightly atoms of incandescent carbon leap from the positive to the negative rod in a continuous and intensely luminous stream which is called an arc because the path of the particles is curved no arc would be formed unless the carbons were first touched to start incandescence if they are separated too far for the strength of the current to bridge the gap the light will flicker or go out the arc lamp is therefore provided with a mechanism which when the current is cut off causes the carbons to fall together gradually separates them when it is turned on and keeps them apart the principle employed is the effort of a coil through which a current passes to draw an iron rod into its centre some of the current feeding the lamp is shunted through a coil into which projects one end of an iron bar connected with one carbon point a spring normally presses the points together when no current flows as soon as current circulates through the coil the bar is drawn upwards against the spring series and parallel arrangement of lamps when current passes from one lamp to another as in fig 82 the lamps are said to be in series should one lamp fail all in the circuit would go out but where arc lamps are thus arranged a special mechanism on each lamp shortcircuits it in case of failure so that current may pass uninterruptedly to the next illustration fig 82incandescent lamps connected in series fig 83 shows a number of lamps set in parallel one terminal of each is attached to the positive conductor the other to the negative conductor each lamp therefore forms an independent bridge and does not affect the efficiency of the rest parallel series signifies a combination of the two systems and would be illustrated if in fig 83 two or more lamps were connected in series groups from one conductor to the other this arrangement is often used in arc lighting illustration fig 83incandescent lamps connected in parallel current for electric lamps this may be either direct or alternating the former is commonly used for arc lamps the latter for incandescent as it is easily steppeddown from the highpressure mains for use in a house glowlamps usually take current of 110 or 250 volts pressure in arc lamps fed with direct current the tip of the positive carbon has a bowlshaped depression worn in it while the negative tip is pointed most of the illumination comes from the inner surface of the bowl and the positive carbon is therefore placed uppermost to throw the light downwards an alternating current of course affects both carbons in the same manner and there is no bowl the carbons need frequent renewal a powerful lamp uses about 70 feet of rod in 1000 hours if the arc is exposed to the air some lamps have partly enclosed arcsthat is are surrounded by globes perforated by a single small hole which renders combustion very slow though preventing a vacuum electroplating electroplating is the art of coating metals with metals by means of electricity silver copper and nickel are the metals most generally deposited the article to be coated is suspended in a chemical solution of the metal to be deposited fig 84 shows a very simple plating outfit a is a battery b a vessel containing say an acidulated solution of sulphate of copper a spoon s hanging in this from a glass rod r is connected with the zinc or negative element z of the battery and a plate of copper p with the positive element c current flows in the direction shown by the arrows from z to c c to p p to s s to z the copper deposited from the solution on the spoon is replaced by gradual dissolution of the plate so that the latter serves a double purpose illustration fig 84an electroplating outfit in silver plating p is of silver and the solution one of cyanide of potassium and silver salts where nickel or silver has to be deposited on iron the article is often given a preliminary coating of copper as iron does not make a good junction with either of the first two metals but has an affinity for copper 17 from the latin commuto i exchange 18

early days of the railway the pulling up of a train necessitated the shutting off of steam while the stoppingplace was still a great distance away the train gradually lost its velocity the process being hastened to a comparatively small degree by the screwdown brakes on the engine and guards van the goods train of today in many cases still observes this practice long obsolete in passenger traffic an advance was made when a chain running along the entire length of the train was arranged so as to pull on subsidiary chains branching off under each carriage and operating levers connected with brake blocks pressing on every pair of wheels the guard strained the main chain by means of a wheel gear in his van this system was however radically defective since if any one branch chain was shorter than the rest it alone would get the strain furthermore it is obvious that the snapping of the main chain would render the whole arrangement powerless accordingly brakes operated by steam were tried under every carriage was placed a cylinder in connection with a main steampipe running under the train when the engineer wished to apply the brakes he turned highpressure steam into the train pipe and the steam passing into the brake cylinders drove out in each a piston operating the brake gear unfortunately the steam during its passage along the pipe was condensed and in cold weather failed to reach the rear carriages water formed in the pipes and this was liable to freeze if the train parted accidentally the apparatus of course broke down hydraulic brakes have been tried but these are open to several objections and railway engineers now make use of airpressure as the most suitable form of power whatever air system be adopted experience has shown that three features are essential1 the brakes must be kept off artificially 2 in case of the train parting accidentally the brakes must be applied automatically and quickly bring all the vehicles of the train to a standstill 3 it must be possible to apply the brakes with greater or less force according to the needs of the case at the present day one or other of two systems is used on practically all automaticallybraked cars and coaches these are known as1 the vacuum automatic using the pressure of the atmosphere on a piston from the other side of which air has been mechanically exhausted and 2 the westinghouse automatic using compressed air the action of these brakes will now be explained as simply as possible the vacuum automatic brake under each carriage is a vacuum chamber fig 85 riding on trunnions e e so that it may swing a little when the brakes are applied inside the chamber is a cylinder the piston of which is rendered airtight by a rubber ring rolling between it and the cylinder walls the piston rod works through an airtight stuffingbox in the bottom of the casing and when it rises operates the brake rods it is obvious that if air is exhausted from both sides of the piston at once the piston will sink by reason of its own weight and that of its attachments if air is now admitted below the piston the latter will be pushed upwards with a maximum pressure of 15 lbs to the square inch the ballvalve ensures that while air can be sucked from both sides of the piston it can be admitted to the lower side only illustration fig 85vacuum brake off illustration fig 86vacuum brake on let us imagine that a train has been standing in a siding and that air has gradually filled the vacuum chamber by leakage the engine is coupled on and the driver at once turns on the steam ejector21 which sucks all the air out of the pipes and chambers throughout the train the air is sucked directly from the under side of the piston through pipe d and from the space a a and the cylinder open at the top through the channel c lifting the ball which as soon as exhaustion is complete or when the pressure on both sides of the piston is equal falls back on its seat on air being admitted to the train pipe it rushes through d and into the space b fig 86 below the piston but is unable to pass the ball so that a strong upward pressure is exerted on the piston and the brakes go on to throw them off the space below the piston must be exhausted this is to be noted if there is a leak as in the case of the train parting the brakes go on at once since the vacuum below the piston is automatically broken illustration fig 87guards valve for applying the vacuum brake for ordinary stops the vacuum is only partially brokenthat is an airpressure of but from 5 to 10 lbs per square inch is admitted for emergency stops full atmospheric pressure is used in this case it is advisable that air should enter at both ends of the train so in the guards van there is installed an ingenious automatic valve which can at any time be opened by the guard pressing down a lever but which opens of itself when the trainpipe vacuum is rapidly destroyed fig 87 shows this device in section seated on the top of an upright pipe is a valve a connected by a bolt b to an elastic diaphragm c sealing the bottom of the chamber d the bolt b has a very small hole bored through it from end to end when the vacuum is broken slowly the pressure falls in d as fast as in the pipe but a sudden inrush of air causes the valve a to be pulled off its seat by the diaphragm c as the vacuum in d has not been broken to any appreciable extent air then rushes into the train pipe through the valve it is thus evident that the driver controls this valve as effectively as if it were on the engine these emergency valves are sometimes fitted to every vehicle of a train when a carriage is slipped taps on each side of the coupling joint of the train pipe are turned off by the guard in the slip and when he wishes to stop he merely depresses the lever e gradually opening the valve under the van is an auxiliary vacuum chamber from which the air is exhausted by the train pipe if the guard after the slip has parted from the train finds that he has applied his brakes too hard he can put this chamber into communication with the brake cylinder and restore the vacuum sufficiently to pull the brakes off again when a train has come to rest the brakes must be sucked off by the ejector until this has been done the train cannot be moved so that it is impossible for it to leave the station unprepared to make a sudden stop if necessary the westinghouse airbrake this system is somewhat more complicated than the vacuum though equally reliable and powerful owing to the complexity of certain parts such as the steam airpump and the triplevalve it is impossible to explain the system in detail we therefore have recourse to simple diagrammatic sketches which will help to make clear the general principles employed the airbrake as first evolved by mr george westinghouse was a very simple affairan airpump and reservoir on the engine a long pipe running along the train and a cylinder under every vehicle to work the brakes to stop the train the highpressure air collected in the reservoir was turned into the train pipe to force out the pistons in the coach cylinders connected to it by short branch pipes one defect of this straight system was that the brakes at the rear of a long train did not come into action until a considerable time after the driver turned on the air and since when danger is imminent a very few seconds are of great importance this slowness of operation was a serious fault also it was found that the brakes on coaches near the engine went on long before those more distant so that during a quick stop there was a danger of the forward coaches being bumped by those behind it goes without saying that any coaches which might break loose were uncontrollable mr westinghouse therefore patented his automatic brake now so largely used all over the world the brake ensures practically instantaneous and simultaneous action on all the vehicles of a train of any length illustration fig 88diagrammatic sketch of the details of the westinghouse airbrake brake off the principle of the brake will be gathered from figs 88 and 89 p is a steamdriven airpump on the engine which compresses air into a reservoir a situated below the engine or tender and maintains a pressure of from 80 to 90 lbs per square inch a threeway cock c puts the train pipe into communication with a or the open air at the wish of the driver under each coach is a triplevalve t an auxiliary reservoir b and a brake cylinder d the triplevalve is the most noteworthy feature of the whole system the reader must remember that the valve shown in the section is only diagrammatic now for the operation of the brake when the engine is coupled to the train the compressed air in the main reservoir is turned into the train pipe from which it passes through the triplevalve into the auxiliary reservoir and fills it till it has a pressure of say 80 lbs per square inch until the brakes are required the pressure in the train pipe must be maintained if accidentally or purposely by turning the cock c to the position shown in fig 89 the trainpipe pressure is reduced the triplevalve at once shifts putting b in connection with the brake cylinder d and cutting off the connection between d and the air and the brakes go on to get them off the pressure in the train pipe must be made equal to that in b when the valve will assume its original position allowing the air in d to escape the force with which the brake is applied depends upon the reduction of pressure in the train pipe a slight reduction would admit air very slowly from b to d whereas a full escape from the train pipe would open the valve to its utmost we have not represented the means whereby the valve is rendered sensitive to these changes for the reason given above illustration fig 89brake on the latest form of triplevalve includes a device which when air is rapidly discharged from the train pipe as in an emergency application of the brake opens a port through which compressed air is also admitted from the train pipe directly into d it will easily be understood that a double advantage is hereby gainedfirst in utilizing a considerable portion of the air in the train pipe to increase the available brake force in cases of emergency and secondly in producing a quick reduction of pressure in the whole length of the pipe which accelerates the action of the brakes with extraordinary rapidity it may be added that this secondary communication is kept open only until the pressure in d is equal to that in the train pipe then it is cut off to prevent a return of air from b to the pipe an interesting detail of the system is the automatic regulation of airpressure in the main reservoir by the airpump governor fig 90 the governor is attached to the steampipe leading from the locomotive boiler to the airpump steam from the boiler entering at f flows through valve 14 and passes by d into the pump which is thus brought into operation and continues to work until the pressure in the main reservoir acting on the under side of the diaphragm 9 exceeds the tension to which the regulating spring 7 is set any excess of pressure forces the diaphragm upwards lifting valve 11 and allowing compressed air from the main reservoir to flow into the chamber c the airpressure forces piston 12 downwards and closes steamvalve 14 thus cutting off the supply of steam to the pump as soon as the pressure in the reservoir is reduced by leakage or use below the normal spring 7 returns diaphragm 9 to the position shown in fig 90 and pinvalve 11 closes the compressed air previously admitted to the chamber c escapes through the small port a to the atmosphere the steam acting on the lower surface of valve 14 lifts it and its piston to the position shown and again flows to the pump which works until the required airpressure is again obtained in the reservoir illustration fig 90airpump of westinghouse brake 21 this resembles the upper part of the rudimentary water injector shown in fig 15 the reader need only imagine pipe b to be connected with the train pipe a rush of steam through pipe a creates a partial vacuum in the cone e causing air from the train pipe to rush into it and be expelled by the steam blast chapter xi railway signalling the block systemposition of signalsinterlocking the signalslocking

systeminterlockingsignalling operationspower signallingpneumatic signallingautomatic signalling under certain conditionsnamely at sharp curves or in darknessthe most powerful brakes might not avail to prevent a train running into the rear of another if trains were allowed to follow each other closely over the line it is therefore necessary to introduce an effective system of keeping trains running in the same direction a sufficient distance apart and this is done by giving visible and easily understood orders to the driver while a train is in motion in the early days of the railway it was customary to allow a time interval between the passings of trains a train not being permitted to leave a station until at least five minutes after the start of a preceding train this method did not of course prevent collisions as the first train sometimes broke down soon after leaving the station and in the absence of effective brakes its successor ran into it the advent of the electric telegraph which put stations in rapid communication with one another proved of the utmost value to the safe working of railways the block system time limits were abolished and distance limits substituted a line was divided into blocks or lengths and two trains going in the same direction were never allowed on any one block at the same time the signalposts carrying the movable arms or semaphores by means of which the signalman communicates with the enginedriver are well known to us they are usually placed on the lefthand side of the line of rails to which they apply with their arms pointing away from the rails the side of the arms which faces the direction from which a train approaches has a white stripe painted on a red background the other side has a black stripe on a white background the distant and other signal arms vary slightly in shape fig 91 a distant signal has a forked end and a vshaped stripe the home and starting signals are squareended with straight stripes when the arm stands horizontally the signal is on or at danger when dropped it is off and indicates all right proceed at the end nearest the post it carries a spectacle frame glazed with panes of red and green glass when the arm is at danger the red pane is opposite a lamp attached to the signal post when the arm drops the green pane rises to that positionso that a driver is kept as fully informed at night as during the day provided the lamp remains alight illustration fig 91distant and home signals position of signals on double lines each set of rails has its own separate signals and drivers travelling on the up line take no notice of signals meant for the down line each signalbox usually controls three signals on each set of railsthe distant the home and the starting their respective positions will be gathered from fig 92 which shows a station on a double line between the distant and the home an interval is allowed of 800 yards on the level 1000 yards on a falling gradient and 600 yards on a rising gradient the home stands near the approach end of the station and the starting at the departure end of the platform the last is sometimes reinforced by an advance starting signal some distance farther on it should be noted that the distant is only a caution signal whereas both home and starting are stop signals this means that when the driver sees the distant on he does not stop his train but slackens speed and prepares to stop at the home signal he must however on no account pass either home or starting if they are at danger in short the distant merely warns the driver of what he may expect at the home to prevent damage if a driver should overrun the home it has been laid down that no train shall be allowed to pass the starting signal of one box unless the line is clear to a point at least a quarter of a mile beyond the home of the next box that point is called the standard clearing point technically described a block is a length of line between the last stop signal worked from one signalbox and the first stop signal worked from the next signalbox in advance illustration fig 92showing position of signals those at the top are off interlocking signals a signalman cannot lower or restore his signals to their normal positions in any order he likes he is compelled to lower them as followsstarting and home then distant and restore themdistant then starting and home if a signalman were quite independent he might after the passage of a train restore the home or starting but forget all about the distant so that the next train which he wants to stop would dash past the distant without warning and have to pull up suddenly when the home came in sight but by a mechanical arrangement he is prevented from restoring the home or starting until the distant is at danger and vice vers he cannot lower the last until the other two are off this mechanism is called locking gear looking gear there are many different types of locking gear in use it is impossible to describe them all or even to give particulars of an elaborate lockingframe of any one type but if we confine ourselves to the simplest combination of a studlocking apparatus such as is used in small boxes on the great western railway the reader will get an insight into the general principles of these safety devices as the same principles underlie them all illustration fig 93a signal lever and its connections to move the lever c is pressed towards b raising the catchrod from its nick in the rack g g g guides r r antifriction rollers s sockets for catchrod to work in the levers in the particular type of locking gear which we are considering have each a tailpiece or tappet arm attached to it which moves backwards and forwards with the lever fig 93 running at right angles to this tappet and close to it either under or above are the lock bars or stud bars refer now to fig 94 which shows the ends of the three tappet arms d h and s crossed by a bar b from which project these studs the levers are all forward and the signals all on if the signalman tried to pull the lever attached to d down the page as it were he would fail to move it on account of the stud a which engages with a notch in d before this stud can be got free of the notch the tappets h and s must be pulled over so as to bring their notches in line with studs b and c fig 95 the signalman can now move d since the notch easily pushes the stud a to the left fig 96 the signals must be restored to danger as h and s are backlocked by dthat is prevented by d from being put back into their normal positionsd must be moved first the interlocking of the three signals described is merely repeated in the interlocking of a large number of signals illustration fig 94 illustration fig 95 on entering a signalbox a visitor will notice that the levers have different coloursgreen signifying distant signals red signifying home and starting signals blue signifying facing points black signifying trailing points white signifying spare levers these different colours help the signalman to pick out the right levers easily to the front of each lever is attached a small brass tablet bearing certain numbers one in large figures on the top then a line and other numbers in small figures beneath the large number is that of the lever itself the others called leads refer to levers which must be pulled before that particular lever can be released illustration fig 96 illustration fig 97model signal equipment in a signalling school by permission of the gwr magazine points mention was made in connection with the lever of points before going further we will glance at the action of these devices for enabling a train to run from one set of rails to another figs 98 and 99 show the points at a simple junction it will be noticed that the rails of the line to the left of the points are continued as the outer rails of the main and branch lines the inner rails come to a sharp vpoint and to the left of this are the two short rails which by means of shifting portions decide the direction of a trains travel in fig 98 the main line is open in fig 99 the branch the shifting parts are kept properly spaced by cross bars or tierods a a illustration fig 98points open to main line illustration fig 99points open to branch line it might be thought that the wheels would bump badly when they reach the point b where there is a gap this is prevented however by the bent ends e e fig 98 on which the tread of the wheel rests until it has reached some distance along the point of v the safety rails s r keep the outer wheel up against its rail until the v has been passed points and signals in combination let us suppose that a train is approaching the junction shown in figs 98 and 99 from the left it is not enough that the driver should know that the tracks are clear he must also be assured that the track main or branch as the case may be along which he has to go is open and on the other hand if he were approaching from the right he would want to be certain that no train on the other line was converging on his danger is avoided and assurance given by interlocking the points and signals to the left of the junction the home and distant signals are doubled there being two semaphore arms on each post these are interlocked with the points in such a manner that the signals referring to either line can be pulled off only when the points are set to open the way to that line moreover before any shifting of points can be made the signals behind must be put to danger the convergence of trains is prevented by interlocking which renders it impossible to have both sets of distant and home signals at all right simultaneously working of block system we may now pass to the working of the block system of signalling trains from station to station on one line of a double track each signalbox except of course those at termini has electric communication with the next box in both directions the instruments used vary on different systems but the principle is the same so we will concentrate our attention on those most commonly employed on the great western railway they are1 two tapperbell instruments connected with similar instruments in the adjacent boxes on both sides each of these rings one beat in the corresponding box every time its key is depressed 2 two spagnoletti disc instrumentsone having two keys communicating with the box in the rear and the other in connection with the forward box having no keys their respective functions are to give signals and receive them in the centre of the face of each is a square opening behind which moves a disc carrying two flagstrain on line in white letters on red ground and line clear in black letters on a white ground the keyed instrument has a red and a white key when the red key is depressed train on line appears at the opening also in that of a keyless disc at the adjacent signalbox a depression of the white key similarly gives line clear a piece of wire with the ends turned over and passed through two eyes slides over the keys and can be made to hold either down in addition to these telephonic and telegraphic instruments are provided to enable the signalmen to converse series of signalling operations illustration fig 100the signaling instruments in three adjacent cabins the featherless arrows show the connection of the instruments we may now watch the doings of signalmen in four successive boxes a b c and d during the passage of an express train signalman a calls signalman bs attention by one beat on the tapperbell b answers by repeating it to show that he is attending a asks is line clear for passenger expressfour beats on the bell b seeing that the line is clear to his clearing point sends back four beats and pins down the white key of his instrument line clear appears on the opening and also at that of as keyless disc a lowers starting signal train moves off a gives two beats on the tapper train entering section b pins indicator at train on line which also appears on as instrument a places signals at danger b asks c is line clear c repeats the bell code and pins indicator at line clear shown on bs keyless disc also b lowers all signals train passes b signals to c train entering section b signals to a train out of section and releases indicator which returns to normal position with half of each flag showing at the window b signals to c train on line and sets all his signals to danger c pins indicator to train on line c asks is line clear but there is a train at station d and signalman d therefore gives no reply which is equivalent to a negative the driver on approaching cs distant sees it at danger and slows down stopping at the home c lowers home and allows train to proceed to his starting signal d when the line is clear to his clearing point signals line clear and pins indicator at line clear c lowers starting signals and train proceeds c signals to d train entering section and d pins indicator at train on line c signals to b train out of section sets indicator at normal and puts signals at danger and so the process is repeated from station to station where however sections are short the signalman is advised one section ahead of the approach of a train by an additional signal signifying fast train approaching the block indicator reminds the signalman of the whereabouts of the train unless his keyless indicator is at normal he may not ask is line clear and until he signals back line clear to the box behind a train is not allowed to enter his section in this way a section of line with a full complement of signals is always interposed between any two trains the working of single lines we have dealt with the signalling arrangements pertaining to double lines of railway showing that a system of signals is necessary to prevent a train running into the back of its predecessor where trains in both directions pass over a single line not only has this element of danger to be dealt with but also the possibility of a train being allowed to enter a section of line from each end at the same time this is effected in several ways the essence of each being that the enginedriver shall have in his possession visible evidence of the permission accorded him by the signalman to enter a section of single line a single train staff the simplest form of working is to allocate to the length of line a train staffa piece of wood about 14 inches long bearing the names of the stations at either end this is adopted where only one engine is used for working a section such as a short branch line in a case like this there is obviously no danger of two trains meeting and the train staff is merely the authority to the driver to start a journey no telegraphic communication is necessary with such a system and signals are placed only at the ends of the line train staff and ticket on long lengths of single line where more than one train has to be considered the line is divided into blocks in the way already described for double lines and a staff is assigned to each the staffs for the various blocks differing from each other in shape and colour the usual signals are provided at each station and block telegraph instruments are employed the only difference being that one disc of the key pattern is used for trains in both directions on such a line it is of course possible that two or more trains may require to follow each other without any travelling intermediately in the opposite direction this would be impossible if the staff passed uniformly to and fro in the block section but it is arranged by the introduction of a train staff ticket used in conjunction with the staff no train is permitted to leave a staff station unless the staff for the section of line to be traversed is at the station and the driver has the strictest possible instructions that he must see the staff if a second train is required to follow the staff is shown to the driver and a train staff ticket handed him as his authority to proceed if however the next train over the section will enter from the opposite end the staff is handed to the driver to render this system as safe as possible train staff tickets are of the same colour and shape as the staff for the section to which they apply and are kept in a special box at the stations the key being attached to the staff and the lock so arranged that the key cannot be withdrawn unless the box has been locked electric train staff and tablet systems these systems of working are developments of the last mentioned by which are secured greater safety and ease in working the line on some sections of single line circumstances often necessitate the running of several trains in one direction without a return train for such cases the train staff ticket was introduced but even on the best regulated lines it is not always possible to secure that the staff shall be at the station where it is required at the right time and cases have arisen where no train being available at the station where the staff was it had to be taken to the other station by a man on foot causing much delay to traffic the electric train staff and tablet systems overcome this difficulty both work on much the same principle and we will therefore describe the former illustration fig 101an electric train staff holder s s staffs in the slot of the instrument leaning against the side of the cabin is a staff showing the key k at the end for unlocking a siding points between two stations the engine driver cannot remove the staff until the points have been locked again at each end of a block section a train staff instrument fig 101 is provided in the base of these instruments are a number of train staffs any one of which would be accepted by an enginedriver as permission to travel over the single line the instruments are electrically connected the mechanism securing that a staff can be withdrawn only by the cooperation of the signalman at each end of the section that when all the staffs are in the instruments a staff may be withdrawn at either end that when a staff has been withdrawn another cannot be obtained until the one out has been restored to one or other of the instruments the safety of such a system is obvious as also the assistance to the working by having a staff available for a train no matter from which end it is to enter the section the mechanism of the instruments is quite simple a doublepoled electromagnet is energized by the depression of a key by the signalman at the further end of the block into which the train is to run and by the turning of a handle by the signalman who requires to withdraw a staff the magnet being energized is able to lift a mechanical lock and permits the withdrawal of a staff in its passage through the instrument the staff revolves a number of iron discs which in turn raise or lower a switch controlling the electrical connections this causes the electric currents actuating the electromagnet to oppose each other the magnetism to cease and the lock to fall back preventing another staff being withdrawn it will naturally be asked how is the electrical system restored we have said that there were a number of staffs in each instrumentin other words a given number of staffs usually twenty is assigned to the section assume that there are ten in each instrument and that the switch in each is in its lower position now withdraw a staff and one instrument has an odd the other an even number of staffs and similarly one switch is raised while the other remains lowered therefore the electrical circuit is out of phasethat is the currents in the magnets of each staff instrument are opposed to one another and cannot release the lock the staff travels through the section and is placed in the instrument at the other end bringing the number of staffs to elevenan odd number and what is more important raising the switch both switches are now raised consequently the electric currents will support each other so that a staff may be withdrawn briefly then when there is an odd number of staffs in one instrument and an even number in the other as when a staff is in use the signalmen are unable to obtain a staff and consequently cannot give authority for a train to enter the section but when there is either an odd or an even number of staffs in each instrument a staff may be withdrawn at either end on the cooperation of the signalmen we may add that where two instruments are in the same signalbox one for working to the box in advance the other to the rear it is arranged that the staffs pertaining to one section shall not fit the instrument for the other and must be of different colours this prevents the driver accidentally accepting a staff belonging to one section as authority to travel over the other interlocking the remarks made on the interlocking of points and signals on double lines apply also to the working of single lines with the addition that not only are the distant home and starting signals interlocked with each other but with the signals and points governing the approach of a train from the opposite directionin other words the signals for the approach of a train to a station from one direction cannot be lowered unless those for the approach to the station of a train from the opposite direction are at danger and the points correctly set signalling operations in the working of single lines as of double the signalman at the station from which a train is to proceed has to obtain the consent of the signalman ahead the series of questions to be signalled being very similar to those detailed for double lines there is however one notable exception on long lengths of single line it is necessary to make arrangements for trains to pass each other this is done by providing loop lines at intervals a second pair of rails being laid for the accommodation of one train while another in the opposite direction passes it to secure that more than one train shall not be on a section of single line between two crossingplaces it is laid down that when a signalman at a noncrossing station is asked to allow a train to approach his station he must not give permission until he has notified the signalman ahead of him thus securing that he is not asking permission for trains to approach from both directions at the same time both for single and double line working a number of rules designed to deal with cases of emergency are laid down the guiding principle being safety but we have now dealt with all the conditions of everyday working and must pass to the consideration of illustration fig 102an electric leverframe in a signalling cabin at didcot power signalling in a power system of signalling the signalman is provided with some auxiliary meanselectricity compressed air etcof moving the signals or points under his control it is still necessary to have a lockingframe in the signalbox with levers interlocked with each other and connections between the box and the various points and signals but the frame is much smaller than an ordinary manual frame and but little force is needed to move the little levers which make or break an electric circuit or open an airvalve according to the poweragent used electric signalling fig 102 represents the lockingframe of a cabin at didcot england where an allelectric system has been installed wires lead from the cabin to motors situated at the points and signals which they operate through worm gearing when a lever is moved it closes a circuit and sets the current flowing through a motor the direction of the flow and consequently of the motors revolution depending on whether the lever has been moved forward or backward indicators arranged under the levers tell the signalman when the desired movements at the points and signals have been completed if any motion is not carried through owing to failure of the current or obstruction of the working parts an electric lock prevents him continuing operations thus suppose he has to open the main line to an express he is obliged by the mechanical lockingframe to set all the points correctly before the signals can be lowered he might move all the necessary levers in due order yet one set of points might remain open and were the signals lowered an accident would result but this cannot happen as the electric locks worked by the points in question block the signal levers and until the failure has been set right the signals must remain at danger the point motors are connected direct to the points but between a signal motor and its arm there is an electric slot consisting of a powerful electromagnet which forms a link in the rod work to lower a signal it is necessary that the motor shall revolve and a control current pass round the magnet to give it the requisite attractive force if no control current flows as would happen were any pair of points not in their proper position the motor can have no effect on the signal arm to lower it owing to the magnet letting go its grip furthermore if the signal had been already lowered when the control current failed it would rise to danger automatically as all signals are weighted to assume the danger position by gravity the signal control currents can be broken by the signalman moving a switch so that in case of emergency all signals may be thrown simultaneously to danger pneumatic signalling in england and the united states compressed air is also used to do the hard labour of the signalman for him instead of closing a circuit the signalman by moving a lever halfway over admits air to a pipe running along the track to an air reservoir placed beside the points or signal to which the lever relates the air opens a valve and puts the reservoir in connection with a piston operating the points or signalarm as the case may be this movement having been performed another valve in the reservoir is opened and air passes back through a second pipe to the signalbox where it opens a third valve controlling a piston which completes the movement of the lever so showing the signalman that the operation is complete with compressed air as with electricity a mechanical lockingframe is of course used automatic signalling to reduce expense and increase the running speed on lines where the sections are short the train is sometimes made to act as its own signalman the rails of each section are all bonded together so as to be in metallic contact and each section is insulated from the two neighbouring sections at the further end of a section is installed an electric battery connected to the rails which lead the current back to a magnet operating a signal stationed some distance back on the preceding section as long as current flows the signal is held at all right when a train enters the section the wheels and axles shortcircuit the current so that it does not reach the signal magnet and the signal rises to danger and stays there until the last pair of wheels has passed out of the section should the current fail or a vehicle break loose and remain on the section the same thing would happen the human element can thus be practically eliminated from signalling to make things absolutely safe a train should have positive control over a train following to prevent the driver overrunning the signals on electric railways this has been effected by means of contacts working in combination with the signals which either cut the current off from the section preceding that on which a train may be or raise a trigger to strike an arm on the train following and apply its brakes chapter xii optics lensesthe image cast by a convex lensfocusrelative position of object and lenscorrection of lenses for colourspherical aberrationdistortion of imagethe human eyethe use of spectaclesthe blind spot light is a third form of that energy of which we have already treated two manifestationsheat and electricity the distinguishing characteristic of ether lightwaves is their extreme rapidity of vibration which has been calculated to range from 700 billion movements per second for violet rays to 400 billion for red rays if a beam of white light be passed through a prism it is resolved into the seven visible colours of the spectrumviolet indigo blue green yellow orange and redin this order the human eye is most sensitive to the yellowred rays a photographic plate to the greenviolet rays all bodies fall into one of two classes1 luminousthat is those which are a source of light such as the sun a candle flame or a redhot coal and 2 nonluminous which become visible only by virtue of light which they receive from other bodies and reflect to our eyes the propagation of light light naturally travels in a straight line it is deflected only when it passes from one transparent medium into anotherfor example from air to waterand the mediums are of different densities we may regard the surface of a visible object as made up of countless points from each of which a diverging pencil of rays is sent off through the ether lenses if a beam of light encounters a transparent glass body with nonparallel sides the rays are deflected the direction they take depends on the shape of the body but it may be laid down as a rule that they are bent toward the thicker part of the glass the common burningglass is well known to us we hold it up facing the sun to concentrate all the heat rays that fall upon it into one intensely brilliant spot which speedily ignites any inflammable substance on which it may fall fig 103 we may imagine that one ray passes from the centre of the sun through the centre of the glass this is undeflected but all the others are bent towards it as they pass through the thinner parts of the lens illustration fig 103showing how a burningglass concentrates the heat rays which fall upon it it should be noted here that sunlight as we call it is accompanied by heat a burningglass is used to concentrate the heat rays not the light rays which though they are collected too have no igniting effect in photography we use a lens to concentrate light rays only such heat rays as may pass through the lens with them are not wanted and as they have no practical effect are not taken any notice of to be of real value a lens must be quite symmetricalthat is the curve from the centre to the circumference must be the same in all directions there are six forms of simple lenses as given in fig 104 nos 1 and 2 have one flat and one spherical surface nos 3 4 5 6 have two spherical surfaces when a lens is thicker at the middle than at the sides it is called a convex lens when thinner a concave lens the names of the various shapes are as followsno 1 planoconvex no 2 planoconcave no 3 double convex no 4 double concave no 5 meniscus no 6 concavoconvex the thickcentre lenses as we may term them nos 1 3 5 concentrate a pencil of rays passing through them while the thincentre lenses nos 2 4 6 scatter the rays see fig 105 illustration fig 104six forms of lenses the camera illustration fig 105 illustration fig 106 we said above that light is propagated in straight lines to prove this is easy get a piece of cardboard and prick a hole in it set this up some distance away from a candle flame and hold behind it a piece of tissue paper you will at once perceive a faint upsidedown image of the flame on the tissue why is this turn for a moment to fig 106 which shows a pinhole camera in section at the rear is a groundglass screen b to catch the image suppose that a is the lowest point of the flame a pencil of rays diverging from it strikes the front of the camera which stops them all except the one which passes through the hole and makes a tiny luminous spot on b above the centre of the screen though a is below the axis of the camera similarly the tip of the flame above the axis would be represented by a dot on the screen below its centre and so on for all the millions of points of the flame if we were to enlarge the hole we should get a brighter image but it would have less sharp outlines because a number of rays from every point of the candle would reach the screen and be jumbled up with the rays of neighbouring pencils now though a good sharp photograph may be taken through a pinhole the time required is so long that photography of this sort has little practical value what we want is a large hole for the light to enter the camera by and yet to secure a distinct image if we place a lens in the hole we can fulfil our wish fig 107 shows a lens in position gathering up a number of rays from a point a and focussing them on a point b if the lens has 1000 times the area of the pinhole it will pass 1000 times as many rays and the image of a will be impressed on a sensitized photographic plate 1000 times more quickly illustration fig 107 the image cast by a convex lens fig 108 shows diagrammatically how a convex lens forms an image from a and b the extremities of the object a simple ray is considered to pass through the centre of the lens this is not deflected at all two other rays from the same points strike the lens above and below the centre respectively these are bent inwards and meet the central rays or come to a focus with them at a1 and b1 in reality a countless number of rays would be transmitted from every point of the object and collected to form the image illustration fig 108showing how an image is cast by a convex lens focus we must now take special notice of that word heard so often in photographic talkfocus what is meant by the focus or focal length of a lens well it merely signifies the distance between the optical centre of the lens and the plane in which the image is formed illustration fig 109 we must here digress a moment to draw attention to the three simple diagrams of fig 109 the object o in each case is assumed to be to the right of the lens in the topmost diagram the object is so far away from the lens that all rays coming from a single point in it are practically parallel these converge to a focus at f if the distance between f and the centre of the lens is six inches we say that the lens has a sixinch focal length the focal length of a lens is judged by the distance between lens and image when the object is far away to avoid confusion this focal length is known as the principal focus and is denoted by the symbol f in the middle diagram the object is quite near the lens which has to deal with rays striking its nearer surface at an acuter angle than before reckoning from the centre as the lens can only deflect their path to a fixed degree they will not after passing the lens come together until they have reached a point f1 further from the lens than f the nearer we approach o to the lens the further away on the other side is the focal point until a distance equal to that of f from the lens is reached when the rays emerge from the glass in a parallel pencil the rays now come to a focus no longer and there can be no image if o be brought nearer than the focal distance the rays would diverge after passing through the lens relative positions of object and image illustration fig 110showing how the position of the image alters relatively to the position of the object from what has been said above we deduce two main conclusions1 the nearer an object is brought to the lens the further away from the lens will the image be 2 if the object approaches within the principal focal distance of the lens no image will be cast by the lens to make this plainer we append a diagram fig 110 which shows five positions of an object and the relative positions of the image in dotted lines first we note that the line a b or a b1 denotes the principal focal length of the lens and a c or a c1 denotes twice the focal length we will take the positions in order position i object further away than 2f inverted image smaller than object at distance somewhat exceeding f position ii object at distance 2f inverted image at distance 2f and of size equal to that of object position iii object nearer than 2f inverted image further away than 2f larger than the object position iv object at distance f as rays are parallel after passing the lens no image is cast position v object at distance less than f no real imagethat is one that can be caught on a focussing screenis now given by the lens but a magnified erect virtual image exists on the same side of the lens as the object we shall refer to virtual images at greater length presently it is hoped that any reader who practises photography will now understand why it is necessary to rack his camera out beyond the ordinary focal distance when taking objects at close quarters from fig 110 he may gather one practically useful hintnamely that to copy a diagram etc full size both it and the plate must be exactly 2f from the optical centre of the lens and it follows from this that the further he can rack his camera out beyond 2f the greater will be the possible enlargement of the original correction of lenses for colour we have referred to the separation of the spectrum colours of white light by a prism now a lens is one form of prism and therefore sorts out the colours in fig 111 we assume that two parallel red rays and two parallel violet rays from a distant object pass through a lens a lens has most bending effect on violet rays and least on red and the other colours of the spectrum are intermediately influenced for the sake of simplicity we have taken the two extremes only you observe that the point r in which the red rays meet is much further from the lens than is v the meetingpoint of the violet rays a photographer very seldom has to take a subject in which there are not objects of several different colours and it is obvious that if he used a simple lens like that in fig 111 and got his red objects in good focus the blue and green portions of his picture would necessarily be more or less out of focus illustration fig 111 illustration fig 112 this defect can fortunately be corrected by the method shown in fig 112 a compound lens is needed made up of a crown glass convex element b and a concave element a of flint glass for the sake of illustration the two parts are shown separated in practice they would be cemented together forming one optical body thicker in the centre than at the edgesa meniscus lens in fact since a is not so concave as b is convex now it was discovered by a mr hall many years ago that if white light passed through two similar prisms one of flint glass the other of crown glass the former had the greater effect in separating the spectrum coloursthat is violet rays were bent aside more suddenly compared with the red rays than happened with the crownglass prism look at fig 112 the red rays passing through the flint glass are but little deflected while the violet rays turn suddenly outwards this is just what is wanted for it counteracts the unequal inward refraction by b and both sets of rays come to a focus in the same plane such a lens is called achromatic or colourless if you hold a common readingglass some distance away from large print you will see that the letters are edged with coloured bands proving that the lens is not achromatic a properly corrected photographic lens would not show these pretty edgings colour correction is necessary also for lenses used in telescopes and microscopes spherical aberration a lens which has been corrected for colour is still imperfect if rays pass through all parts of it those which strike it near the edge will be refracted more than those near the centre and a blurred focus results this is termed spherical aberration you will be able to understand the reason from figs 113 and 114 two rays a are parallel to the axis and enter the lens near the centre fig 113 these meet in one plane two other rays b strike the lens very obliquely near the edge and on that account are both turned sharply upwards coming to a focus in a plane nearer the lens than a if this happened in a camera the results would be very bad either a or b would be out of focus the trouble is minimized by placing in front of the lens a plate with a central circular opening in it denoted by the thick dark line in fig 114 the rays b of fig 113 are stopped by this plate which is therefore called a stop but other rays from the same point pass through the hole these however strike the lens much more squarely above the centre and are not unduly refracted so that they are brought to a focus in the same plane as rays a illustration fig 113 illustration fig 114 distortion of image illustration fig 115section of a rectilinear lens the lens we have been considering is a single meniscus such as is used in landscape photography mounted with the convex side turned towards the inside of the camera and having the stop in front of it if you possess a lens of this sort try the following experiment with it draw a large square on a sheet of white paper and focus it on the screen the sides instead of being straight bow outwards this is called barrel distortion now turn the lens mount round so that the lens is outwards and the stop inwards the sides of the square will appear to bow towards the centre this is pincushion distortion for a long time opticians were unable to find a remedy then mr george s cundell suggested that two meniscus lenses should be used in combination one on either side of the stop as in fig 115 each produces distortion but it is counteracted by the opposite distortion of the other and a square is represented as a square lenses of this kind are called rectilinear or straightline producing we have now reviewed the three chief defects of a lenschromatic aberration spherical aberration and distortionand have seen how they may be remedied so we will now pass on to the most perfect of cameras the human eye the eye fig 116 is nearly spherical in form and is surrounded outside except in front by a hard horny coat called the sclerotica s in front is the cornea a which bulges outwards and acts as a transparent window to admit light to the lens of the eye c inside the sclerotica and next to it comes the choroid coat and inside that again is the retina or curved focussing screen of the eye which may best be described as a network of fibres ramifying from the optic nerve which carries sight sensations to the brain the hollow of the ball is full of a jellylike substance called the vitreous humour and the cavity between the lens and the cornea is full of water we have already seen that in focussing the distance between lens and image depends on the distance between object and lens now the retina cannot be pushed nearer to or pulled further away from its lens like the focussing screen of a camera how then is the eye able to focus sharply objects at distances varying from a foot to many miles illustration fig 116section of the human eye as a preliminary to the answer we must observe that the more convex a lens is the shorter is its focus we will suppose that we have a box camera with a lens of sixinch focus fixed rigidly in the position necessary for obtaining a sharp image of distant objects it so happens that we want to take with it a portrait of a person only a few feet from the lens if it were a bellows camera we should rack out the back or front but we cannot do this here so we place in front of our lens a second convex lens which shortens its principal focus so that in effect the box has been racked out sufficiently nature however employs a much more perfect method than this the eye lens is plastic like a piece of indiarubber its edges are attached to ligaments l l which pull outwards and tend to flatten the curve of its surfaces the normal focus is for distant objects when we read a book the eye adapts itself to the work the ligaments relax and the lens decreases in diameter while thickening at the centre until its curvature is such as to focus all rays from the book sharply on the retina if we suddenly look through the window at something outside the ligaments pull on the lens envelope and flatten the curves this wonderful lens is achromatic and free from spherical aberration and distortion of image nor must we forget that it is aided by an automatic stop the iris the central hole of which is named the pupil we say that a person has black blue or gray eyes according to the colour of the iris like the lens the iris adapts itself to all conditions contracting when the light is strong and opening when the light is weak so that as uniform an amount of light as conditions allow may be admitted to the eye most modern camera lenses are fitted with adjustable stops which can be made larger or smaller by twisting a ring on the mount and are named iris stops the image of anything seen is thrown on the retina upside down and the brain reverses the position again so that we get a correct impression of things the use of spectacles illustration fig 117a illustration fig 117b illustration fig 118a illustration fig 118b the reader will now be able to understand without much trouble the function of a pair of spectacles a great many people of all ages suffer from shortsight for one reason or another the distance between lens and retina becomes too great for a person to distinguish distant objects clearly the lens as shown in fig 117a is too convexhas its minimum focus too shortand the rays meet and cross before they reach the retina causing general confusion of outline this defect is simply remedied by placing in front of the eye fig 117b a concave lens to disperse the rays somewhat before they enter the eye so that they come to a focus on the retina if a persons sight is thus corrected for distant objects he can still see near objects quite plainly as the lens will accommodate its convexity for them the scientific term for shortsight is myopia longsight or hypermetropia signifies that the eyeball is too short or the lens too flat fig 118a represents the normal condition of a longsighted eye when looking at a distant object the eye thickens slightly and brings the focus forward into the retina but its thickening power in such an eye is very limited and consequently the rays from a near object focus behind the retina it is therefore necessary for a longsighted person to use convex spectacles for reading the newspaper as seen in fig 118b the spectacle lens concentrates the rays before they enter the eye and so does part of the eyes work for it returning for a moment to the diagram of the eye fig 116 we notice a black patch on the retina near the optic nerve this is the yellow spot vision is most distinct when the image of the object looked at is formed on this part of the retina the blind spot is that point at which the optic nerve enters the retina being so called from the fact that it is quite insensitive to light the finding of the blind spot is an interesting little experiment on a card make a large and a small spot three inches apart the one an eighth the other half an inch in diameter bring the card near the face so that an eye is exactly opposite to each spot and close the eye opposite to the smaller now direct the other eye to this spot and you will find if the card be moved backwards and forwards that at a certain distance the large spot though many times larger than its fellow has completely vanished because the rays from it enter the open eye obliquely and fall on the blind spot chapter xiii the microscope the telescope and the magiclantern the simple microscopeuse of the simple microscope in the telescopethe terrestrial telescopethe galilean telescopethe prismatic telescopethe reflecting telescopethe parabolic mirrorthe compound microscopethe magiclanternthe bioscopethe plane mirror in fig 119 is represented an eye looking at a vase three inches high situated at a a foot away if we were to place another vase b six inches high at a distance of two feet or c nine inches high at three feet or d a foot high at four feet the image on the retina would in every case be of the same size as that cast by a we can therefore lay down the rule that the apparent size of an object depends on the angle that it subtends at the eye illustration fig 119 to see a thing more plainly we go nearer to it and if it be very small we hold it close to the eye there is however a limit to the nearness to which it can be brought with advantage the normal eye is unable to adapt its focus to an object less than about ten inches away termed the least distance of distinct vision the simple microscope illustration fig 120 a magnifying glass comes in useful when we want to examine an object very closely the glass is a lens of short focus held at a distance somewhat less than its principal focal length f see fig 120 from the object the rays from the head and tip of the pin which enter the eye are denoted by continuous lines as they are deflected by the glass the eye gets the impression that a much longer pin is situated a considerable distance behind the real object in the plane in which the refracted rays would meet if produced backwards shown by the dotted lines the effect of the glass practically is to remove it the object to beyond the least distance of distinct vision and at the same time to retain undiminished the angle it subtends at the eye or what amounts to the same thing the actual size of the image formed on the retina22 it follows therefore that if a lens be of such short focus that it allows us to see an object clearly at a distance of two inchesthat is onefifth of the least distance of distinct visionwe shall get an image on the retina five times larger in diameter than would be possible without the lens the two simple diagrams figs 121 and 122 show why the image to be magnified should be nearer to the lens than the principal focus f we have already seen fig 109 that rays coming from a point in the principal focal plane emerge as a parallel pencil these the eye can bring to a focus because it normally has a curvature for focussing parallel rays but owing to the power of accommodation it can also focus diverging rays fig 121 the eye lens thickening the necessary amount and we therefore put our magnifying glass a bit nearer than f to get full advantage of proximity if we had the object outside the principal focus as in fig 122 the rays from it would converge and these could not be gathered to a sharp point by the eye lens as it cannot flatten more than is required for focussing parallel rays illustration fig 121 illustration fig 122 use of the simple microscope in the telescope illustration fig 123 let us now turn to fig 123 at a is a distant object say a hundred yards away b is a double convex lens which has a focal length of twenty inches we may suppose that it is a lens in a camera an inverted image of the object is cast by the lens at c if the eye were placed at c it would distinguish nothing but if withdrawn to d the least distance of distinct vision23 behind c the image is seen clearly that the image really is at c is proved by letting down the focussing screen which at once catches it now as the focus of the lens is twice d the image will be twice as large as the object would appear if viewed directly without the lens we may put this into a very simple formula magnification focal length of lens d illustration fig 124 in fig 124 we have interposed between the eye and the object a small magnifying glass of 212inch focus so that the eye can now clearly see the image when onequarter d away from it b already magnifies the image twice the eyepiece again magnifies it four times so that the total magnification is 2 4 8 times this result is arrived at quickly by dividing the focus of b which corresponds to the objectglass of a telescope by the focus of the eyepiece thus 20 8 212 the ordinary astronomical telescope has a very long focus objectglass at one end of the tube and a very short focus eyepiece at the other to see an object clearly one merely has to push in or pull out the eyepiece until its focus exactly corresponds with that of the objectglass the terrestrial telescope an astronomical telescope inverts images this inversion is inconvenient for other purposes so the terrestrial telescope such as is commonly used by sailors has an eyepiece compounded of four convex lenses which erect as well as magnify the image fig 125 shows the simplest form of compound erecting eyepiece illustration fig 125 the galilean telescope illustration fig 126 a third form of telescope is that invented by the great italian astronomer galileo24 in 1609 its principle is shown in fig 126 the rays transmitted by the objectglass are caught before coming to a focus on a concave lens which separates them so that they appear to meet in the paths of convergence denoted by the dotted lines the image is erect operaglasses are constructed on the galilean principle the prismatic telescope in order to be able to use a longfocus objectglass without a long focussingtube a system of glass reflecting prisms is sometimes employed as in fig 127 a ray passing through the objectglass is reflected from one posterior surface of prism a on to the other posterior surface and by it out through the front on to a second prism arranged at right angles to it which passes the ray on to the compound eyepiece the distance between objectglass and eyepiece is thus practically trebled the bestknown prismatic telescopes are the zeiss fieldglasses illustration fig 127 the reflecting telescope we must not omit reference to the reflecting telescope so largely used by astronomers the front end of the telescope is open there being no objectglass rays from the object fall on a parabolic mirror situated in the rear end of the tube this reflects them forwards to a focus in the newtonian reflector a plane mirror or prism is situated in the axis of the tube at the focus to reflect the rays through an eyepiece projecting through the side of the tube herschels form of reflector has the mirror set at an angle to the axis so that the rays are reflected direct into an eyepiece pointing through the side of the tube towards the mirror the parabolic mirror this mirror fig 128 is of such a shape that all rays parallel to the axis are reflected to a common point in the marine searchlight a powerful arc lamp is arranged with the arc at the focus of a parabolic reflector which sends all reflected light forward in a pencil of parallel rays the most powerful searchlight in existence gives a light equal to that of 350 million candles illustration fig 128a parabolic reflector the compound microscope we have already observed fig 110 that the nearer an object approaches a lens the further off behind it is the real image formed until the object has reached the focal distance when no image at all is cast as it is an infinite distance behind the lens we will assume that a certain lens has a focus of six inches we place a lighted candle four feet in front of it and find that a sharp diminished image is cast on a groundglass screen held seven inches behind it if we now exchange the positions of the candle and the screen we shall get an enlarged image of the candle this is a simple demonstration of the law of conjugate focinamely that the distance between the lens and an object on one side and that between the lens and the corresponding image on the other bear a definite relation to each other and an object placed at either focus will cast an image at the other whether the image is larger or smaller than the object depends on which focus it occupies in the case of the objectglass of a telescope the image was at what we may call the short focus illustration fig 129diagram to explain the compound microscope now a compound microscope is practically a telescope with the object at the long focus very close to a shortfocus lens a greatly enlarged image is thrown see fig 129 at the conjugate focus and this is caught and still further magnified by the eyepiece we may add that the objectglass or objective of a microscope is usually compounded of several lenses as is also the eyepiece the magiclantern the most essential features of a magiclantern are1 the source of light 2 the condenser for concentrating the light rays on to the slide 3 the lens for projecting a magnified image on to a screen fig 130 shows these diagrammatically the illuminant is most commonly an oillamp or an acetylene gas jet or a cylinder of lime heated to intense luminosity by an oxyhydrogen flame the natural combustion of hydrogen is attended by a great heat and when the supply of oxygen is artificially increased the temperature of the flame rises enormously the nozzle of an oxyhydrogen jet has an interior pipe connected with the cylinder holding one gas and an exterior and somewhat larger pipe leading from that containing the other the two being arranged concentrically at the nozzle by means of valves the proportions of the gases can be regulated to give the best results illustration fig 130sketch of the elements of a magiclantern the condenser is set somewhat further from the illuminant than the principal focal length of the lenses so that the rays falling on them are bent inwards or to the slide the objective or object lens stands in front of the slide its position is adjustable by means of a rack and a drawtube the nearer it is brought to the slide the further away is the conjugate focus see p 239 and consequently the image the exhibitor first sets up his screen and lantern and then finds the conjugate foci of slide and image by racking the lens in or out if a very short focus objective be used subjects of microscopic proportions can be projected on the screen enormously magnified during the siege of paris in 187071 the parisians established a balloon and pigeon post to carry letters which had been copied in a minute size by photography these copies could be enclosed in a quill and attached to a pigeons wing on receipt the copies were placed in a special lantern and thrown as large writing on the screen microphotography has since then made great strides and is now widely used for scientific purposes one of the most important being the study of the crystalline formations of metals under different conditions the bioscope living pictures are the most recent improvement in magiclantern entertainments the negatives from which the lantern films are printed are made by passing a ribbon of sensitized celluloid through a special form of camera which feeds the ribbon past the lens in a series of jerks an exposure being made automatically by a revolving shutter during each rest the positive film is placed in a lantern and the intermittent movement is repeated but now the source of illumination is behind the film and light passes outwards through the shutter to the screen in the urban bioscope the film travels at the rate of fifteen miles an hour upwards of one hundred exposures being made every second the impression of continuous movement arises from the fact that the eye cannot get rid of a visual impression in less than onetenth of a second so that if a series of impressions follow one another more rapidly than the eye can rid itself of them the impressions will overlap and give one of motion if the position of some of the objects or parts of the objects varies slightly in each succeeding picture25 the plane mirror illustration fig 131 this chapter may conclude with a glance at the common lookingglass why do we see a reflection in it the answer is given graphically by fig 131 two rays a b a c from a point a strike the mirror m at the points b and c lines b n c o drawn from these points perpendicular to the mirror are called their normals the angles a b n a c o are the angles of incidence of rays a b a c the paths which the rays take after reflection must make angles with b n and c o respectively equal to a b n a c o these are the angles of reflection if the eye is so situated that the rays enter it as in our illustration an image of the point a is seen at the point a1 in which the lines d b e c meet when produced backwards illustration fig 132 when the vertical mirror is replaced by a horizontal reflecting surface such as a pond fig 132 the same thing happens the point at which the ray from the reflection of the spires tip to the eye appears to pass through the surface of the water must be so situated that if a line were drawn perpendicular to it from the surface the angles made by lines drawn from the real spire tip and from the observers eye to the base of the perpendicular would be equal 22 glazebrook light p 157 23 glazebrook light p 157 24 galileo was severely censured and imprisoned for daring

chapter xiv sound and musical instruments nature of soundthe earmusical instrumentsthe vibration of stringsthe soundingboard and the frame of a pianothe stringsthe striking mechanismthe quality of a note sound differs from light heat and electricity in that it can be propagated through matter only soundwaves are matterwaves not etherwaves this can be proved by placing an electric bell under the bellglass of an airpump and exhausting all the air ether still remains inside the glass but if the bell be set in motion no sound is audible admit air and the clang of the gong is heard quite plainly sound resembles light and heat however thus far that it can be concentrated by means of suitable lenses and curved surfaces an echo is a proof of its reflection from a surface before dealing with the various appliances used for producing soundwaves of a definite character let us examine that wonderful natural apparatus the ear through which we receive those sensations which we call sound illustration fig 133diagrammatic sketch of the parts of the ear fig 133 is a purely diagrammatic section of the ear showing the various parts distorted and out of proportion beginning at the left we have the outer ear the lobe to gather in the soundwaves on to the membrane of the tympanum or drum to which is attached the first of a series of ossicles or small bones the last of these presses against an opening in the inner ear a cavity surrounded by the bones of the head inside the inner ear is a watery fluid p called perilymph surrounding water immersed in which is a membranic envelope m containing endolymph inside water also full of fluid into this fluid project e e e the terminations of the auditory nerve leading to the brain when soundwaves strike the tympanum they cause it to move inwards and outwards in a series of rapid movements the ossicles operated by the tympanum press on the little opening o covered by a membrane and every time they push it in they slightly squeeze the perilymph which in turn compresses the endolymph which affects the nerveends and telegraphs a sensation of sound to the brain in fig 134 we have a more developed sketch giving in fuller detail though still not in their actual proportions the components of the ear the ossicles m i and s are respectively the malleus hammer incus anvil and stapes stirrup each is attached by ligaments to the walls of the middle ear the tympanum moves the malleus the malleus the incus and the incus the stapes the last pressing into the opening o of fig 133 which is scientifically known as the fenestra ovalis or oval window as liquids are practically incompressible nature has made allowance for the squeezing in of the oval window membrane by providing a second opening the round window also covered with a membrane when the stapes pushes the oval membrane in the round membrane bulges out its elasticity sufficing to put a certain pressure on the perilymph indicated by the dotted portion of the inner ear illustration fig 134diagrammatic section of the ear showing the various parts the inner ear consists of two main parts the cochleaso called from its resemblance in shape to a snails shelland the semicircular canals each portion has its perilymph and endolymph and contains a number of the nerveends which are however most numerous in the cochlea we do not know for certain what the functions of the canals and the cochlea are but it is probable that the former enables us to distinguish between the intensity or loudness of sounds and the direction from which they come while the latter enables us to determine the pitch of a note in the cochlea are about 2800 tiny nerveends called the rods of corti the normal ear has such a range as to give about 33 rods to the semitone the great scientist helmholtz has advanced the theory that these little rods are like tiny tuningforks each responding to a note of a certain pitch so that when a string of a piano is sounded and the air vibrations are transmitted to the inner ear they affect only one of these rods and the part of the brain which it serves and we have the impression of one particular note it has been proved by experiment that a very sensitive ear can distinguish between sounds varying in pitch by only 164th of a semitone or but half the range of any one corti fibre this difficulty helmholtz gets over by suggesting that in such an ear two adjacent fibres are affected but one more than the other a person who has a good ear for music is presumably one whose corti rods are very perfect unlucky people like the gentleman who could only recognize one tune and that because people took off their hats when it commenced are physically deficient their corti rods cannot be properly developed what applies to one single note applies also to the elements of a musical chord a dozen notes may sound simultaneously but the ear is able to assimilate each and blend it with its fellows yet it requires a very sensitive and welltrained ear to pick out any one part of a harmony and concentrate the brains attention on that part the ear has a much larger range than the eye while the former ranges over eleven octaves but little more than a single octave is possible to the latter the quickest vibrations which strike the eye as light have only about twice the rapidity of the slowest whereas the quickest vibrations which strike the ear as a musical sound have more than two thousand times the rapidity of the slowest26 to come to actual figures the ordinary ear is sensitive to vibrations ranging from 16 to 38000 per second the bottom and top notes of a piano make respectively about 40 and 4000 vibrations a second of course some ears like some eyes cannot comprehend the whole scale the squeak of bats and the chirrup of crickets are inaudible to some people and dogs are able to hear sounds far too shrill to affect the human auditory apparatus not the least interesting part of this wonderful organ is the tympanic membrane which is provided with muscles for altering its tension automatically if we are straining our ears to catch a shrill sound we tighten the membrane while if we are getting ready for a deep loud report like that of a gun we allow the drum to slacken the eustachian tube fig 134 communicates with the mouth its function is probably to keep the airpressure equal on both sides of the drum when one catches cold the tube is apt to become blocked by mucus causing unequal pressure and consequent partial deafness before leaving this subject it will be well to remind our more youthful readers that the ear is delicately as well as wonderfully made and must be treated with respect sudden shouting into the ear or a playful blow may have most serious effects by bursting the tympanum or injuring the arrangement of the tiny bones putting it in communication with the inner ear musical instruments these are contrivances for producing sonorous shocks following each other rapidly at regular intervals musical sounds are distinguished from mere noises by their regularity if we shake a number of nails in a tin box we get only a series of superimposed and chaotic sensations on the other hand if we strike a tuningfork the air is agitated a certain number of times a second with a pleasant result which we call a note we will begin our excursion into the region of musical instruments with an examination of that very familiar piece of furniture the pianoforte which means literally the softstrong by many children the piano is regarded as a great nuisance the swallowerup of time which could be much more agreeably occupied and is accordingly shown much less respect than is given to a phonograph or a musicalbox yet the modern piano is a very clever piece of work admirably adapted for the production of sweet melodyif properly handled the two forms of piano now generally used are the upright with vertical soundboard and wires and the grand with horizontal soundboard27 the vibration of strings as the pianoforte is a stringed instrument some attention should be given to the subject of the vibration of strings a string in a state of tension emits a note when plucked and allowed to vibrate freely the pitch of the note depends on several conditions1 the diameter of the string 2 the tension of the string 3 the length of the string 4 the substance of the string taking them in order1 the number of vibrations per second is inversely proportional to the diameter of the string thus a string onequarter of an inch in diameter would vibrate only half as often in a given time as a string oneeighth of an inch in diameter 2 the length remaining the same the number of vibrations is directly proportional to the square root of the tension thus a string strained by a 16lb weight would vibrate four times as fast as it would if strained by a 1lb weight 3 the number of vibrations is inversely proportional to the length of the string thus a onefoot string would vibrate twice as fast as a twofoot string strained to the same tension and of equal diameter and weight 4 other things being equal the rate of vibration is inversely proportional to the square root of the density of the substance so that a steel wire would vibrate more rapidly than a platinum wire of equal diameter length and tension these facts are important to remember as the underlying principles of stringed instruments now if you hang a wire from a cord and hang a heavy weight from the wire the wire will be in a state of high tension and yield a distinct note if struck but the volume of sound will be very small much too small for a practical instrument the surface of the string itself is so limited that it sets up but feeble motions in the surrounding air now hang the wire from a large board and strike it again the volume of sound has greatly increased because the string has transmitted its vibrations to the large surface of the board to get the full soundvalue of the vibrations of a string we evidently ought to so mount the string that it may influence a large sounding surface in a violin this is effected by straining the strings over a bridge resting on a hollow box made of perfectly elastic wood draw the bow across a string the loud sound heard proceeds not from the string only but also from the whole surface of the box the soundingboard and frame of a piano a piano has its strings strained across a frame of wood or steel from a row of hooks in the top of the frame to a row of tapering squareended pins in the bottom the wires passing over sharp edges near both ends the tuner is able on turning a pin to tension its strings till it gives any desired note readers may be interested to learn that the average tension of a string is 275 lbs so that the total strain on the frame of a grand piano is anything between 20 and 30 tons to the back of the frame is attached the soundingboard made of spruce fir the familiar christmas tree this is obtained from central and eastern europe where it is carefully selected and prepared as it is essential that the timber should be sawn in such a way that the grain of the wood runs in the proper direction the strings these are made of extremely strong steel wire of the best quality if you examine the wires of your piano you will see that they vary in thickness the thinnest being at the treble end of the frame it is found impracticable to use wires of the same gauge and the same tension throughout the makers therefore use highlytensioned thick wires for the bass and finer shorter wires for the treble taking advantage of the three factorsweight tension and lengthwhich we have noticed above the wires for the deepest notes are wrapped round with fine copper wire to add to their weight without increasing their diameter at the tuningpins there are about 600 yards roughly onethird of a mile of wire in a grand piano the striking mechanism we now pass to the apparatus for putting the strings in a state of vibration the grand piano mechanism shown in fig 135 may be taken as typical of the latest improvements the essentials of an effective mechanism are1 that the blow delivered shall be sharp and certain 2 that the string shall be immediately damped or have its vibration checked if required so as not to interfere with the succeeding notes of other strings 3 that the hammer shall be able to repeat the blows in quick succession the hammer has a head of mahogany covered with felt the thickness of which tapers gradually and regularly from an inch and a quarter at the bass end to threesixteenths of an inch at the extreme treble notes the entire eightyfive hammers for the piano are covered all together in one piece and then they are cut apart from each other the consistency of the covering is very important if too hard it yields a harsh note and must be reduced to the right degree by pricking with a needle in the diagram the felt is indicated by the dotted part illustration fig 135the striking mechanism of a grand piano the action carriage which operates the hammer is somewhat complicated when the key is depressed the left end rises and pushes up the whole carriage which is pivoted at one end the hammer shank is raised by the jack b pressing upon a knob n called the notch attached to the under side of the shank when the jack has risen to a certain point its arm b1 catches against the button c and jerks it from under the notch at the very moment when the hammer strikes so that it may not be blocked against the string as it rebounds the hammer is caught on the repetition lever r which lifts it to allow of perfect repetition the check catches the tail of the hammer head during its descent when the key is raised and prevents it coming back violently on the carriage and rest the tail is curved so as to wedge against the check without jamming in any way the moment the carriage begins to rise the rear end of the key lifts a lever connected with the damper by a vertical wire and raises the damper of the string if the key is held down the vibrations continue for a long time after the blow but if released at once the damper stifles them as the hammer regains its seat a bar l passing along under all the damper lifters is raised by depressing the loud pedal the soft pedal slides the whole keyboard along such a distance that the hammers strike two only out of the three strings allotted to all except the bass notes which have only one string apiece or two according to their depth or length in some pianos the soft pedal presses a special damper against the strings and a third kind of device moves the hammers nearer the strings so that they deliver a lighter blow these two methods of damping are confined to upright pianos a highclass piano is the result of very careful workmanship the mechanism of each note must be accurately regulated by its tiny screws to a minute fraction of an inch it must be ensured that every hammer strikes its blow at exactly the right place on the string since on this depends the musical value of the note the adjustment of the dampers requires equal care and the whole work calls for a sensitive ear combined with skilled mechanical knowledge so that the instrument may have a light touch strength and certainty of action throughout the whole keyboard the quality of a note if two strings alike in all respects and equally tensioned are plucked both will give the same note but both will not necessarily have the same quality of tone the quality or timbre as musicians call it is influenced by the presence of overtones or harmonics in combination with the fundamental or deepest tone of the string the fact is that while a vibrating string vibrates as a whole it also vibrates in parts there are as it were small waves superimposed on the big fundamental waves points of least motion called nodes form on the string dividing it into two three four five etc parts which may be further divided by subsidiary nodes the string considered as halved by one node gives the first overtone or octave of the fundamental it may also vibrate as three parts and give the second overtone or twelfth of the fundamental28 and as four parts and give the third overtone the double octave now if a string be struck at a point corresponding to a node the overtones which require that point for a node will be killed on account of the excessive motion imparted to the string at that spot thus to hit it at the middle kills the octave the double octave etc while to hit it at a point onethird of the length from one end stifles the twelfth and all its submultiples a fundamental note robbed of all its harmonics is hard to obtain which is not a matter for regret as it is a most uninteresting sound to get a rich tone we must keep as many useful harmonics as possible and therefore a piano hammer is so placed as to strike the string at a point which does not interfere with the best harmonics but kills those which are objectionable pianoforte makers have discovered by experiment that the most pleasing tone is excited when the point against which the hammer strikes is oneseventh to oneninth of the length of the wire from one end the nature of the material which does the actual striking is also of importance the harder the substance and the sharper the blow the more prominent do the harmonics become so that the worker has to regulate carefully both the duration of the blow and the hardness of the hammer covering 26 tyndall on sound p 75 27 a broadwood grand is made up of 10700 separate pieces and in its

largest organ in the worldhuman reeds longitudinal vibration in stringed instruments we are concerned only with the transverse vibrations of a stringthat is its movements in a direction at right angles to the axis of the string a string can also vibrate longitudinallythat is in the direction of its axisas may be proved by drawing a piece of resined leather along a violin string in this case the harmonics step up at the same rate as when the movements were transverse let us substitute for a wire a stout bar of metal fixed at one end only the longitudinal vibrations of this rod contain overtones of a different ratio the first harmonic is not an octave but a twelfth while a tensioned string is divided by nodes into two three four five six etc parts a rod fixed at one end only is capable of producing only those harmonics which correspond to division into three five seven nine etc parts therefore a freeend rod and a wire of the same fundamental note would not have the same timbre or quality owing to the difference in the harmonics columns of air in wind instruments we employ instead of rods or wires columns of air as the vibrating medium the note of the column depends on its length in the penny whistle flute clarionet and piccolo the length of the column is altered by closing or opening apertures in the substance encircling the column resonance of columns of air why does a tube closed at one end such as the shank of a key emit a note when we blow across the open end the act of blowing drives a thin sheet of air against the edge of the tube and causes it to vibrate the vibrations are confused some pulses occurring more frequently than others if we blew against the edge of a knife or a piece of wood we should hear nothing but a hiss but when as in the case which we are considering there is a partlyenclosed column of air close to the pulses this selects those pulses which correspond to its natural period of vibration and augments them to a sustained and very audible musical sound illustration fig 136showing how the harmonics of a stopped pipe are formed in fig 136 1 is a pipe closed at the bottom and open at the top a tuningfork of the same note as the pipe is struck and held over it so that the prongs vibrate upwards and downwards at the commencement of an outward movement of the prongs the air in front of them is compressed this impulse imparted to the air in the pipe runs down the column strikes the bottom and returns just as it reaches the top the prong is beginning to move inwards causing a rarefaction of the air behind it this effect also travels down and back up the column of air in the pipe reaching the prong just as it arrives at the furthest point of the inward motion the process is repeated and the column of air in the pipe striking on the surrounding atmosphere at regular intervals greatly increases the volume of sound we must observe that if the tuningfork were of too high or too low a note for the column of air to move in perfect sympathy with it this increase of sound would not result now when we blow across the end we present as it were a number of vibrating tuningforks to the pipe which picks out those airpulses with which it sympathizes length and tone the rate of vibration is found to be inversely proportional to the length of the pipe thus the vibrations of a twofoot pipe are twice as rapid as those of a fourfoot pipe and the note emitted by the former is an octave higher than that of the latter a onefoot pipe gives a note an octave higher still we are here speaking of the fundamental tones of the pipes with them as in the case of strings are associated the overtones or harmonics which can be brought into prominence by increasing the pressure of the blast at the top of the pipe blow very hard on your key and the note suddenly changes to one much shriller it is the twelfth of the fundamental of which it has completely got the upper hand we must now put on our thinkingcaps and try to understand how this comes about first let us note that the vibration of a body in this case a column of air means a motion from a point of rest to a point of rest or from node to node in the aircolumn in fig 136 1 there is only one point of rest for an impulsenamely at the bottom of the pipe so that to pass from node to node the impulse must pass up the pipe and down again the distance from node to node in a vibrating body is called a ventral segment remember this term therefore the pipe represents a semiventral segment when the fundamental note is sounding when the first overtone is sounded the column divides itself into two vibrating parts where will the node between them be we might naturally say halfway up but this cannot be so for if the node were so situated an impulse going down the pipe would only have to travel to the bottom to find another node while an impulse going up would have to travel to the top and back againthat is go twice as far so the node forms itself onethird of the distance down the pipe from b to a fig 136 2 and back is now equal to from b to c when the second overtone is blown fig 136 3 a third node forms the pipe is now divided into five semiventral segments and with each succeeding overtone another node and ventral segment are added the law of vibration of a column of air is that the number of vibrations is directly proportional to the number of semiventral segments into which the column of air inside the pipe is divided29 if the fundamental tone gives 100 vibrations per second the first overtone in a closed pipe must give 300 and the second 500 vibrations the open pipe a pipe open at both ends is capable of emitting a note but we shall find if we experiment that the note of a stopped pipe is an octave lower than that of an open pipe of equal length this is explained by fig 137 1 the aircolumn in the pipe of the same length as that in fig 136 divides itself when an end is blown across into two equal portions at the node b the natural point to obtain equilibrium a pulse will pass from a or a1 to b and back again in half the time required to pass from a to b and back in fig 136 1 therefore the note is an octave higher illustration fig 137showing how harmonics of an open pipe are formed b b1 and c are nodes the arrows indicate the distance travelled by a sound impulse from a node to a node the overtones of an open pipe the first overtone results when nodes form as in fig 137 2 at points onequarter of the length of the pipe from the ends giving one complete ventral segment and two semiventral segments the vibrations now are twice as rapid as before the second overtone requires three nodes as in fig 137 3 the rate has now trebled so that while the overtones of a closed pipe rise in the ratio 1 3 5 7 etc those of an open pipe rise in the proportion 1 2 3 4 etc where overtones are used in the flute piccolo and clarionet as well as in the horn class of instrument the overtones are as important as the fundamental notes by artificially altering the length of the column of air the fundamental notes are also altered while the harmonics of each fundamental are produced at will by varying the blowing pressure so that a continuous chromatic or semitonal scale is possible throughout the compass of the instrument the organ from the theory of acoustics30 we pass to the practical application and concentrate our attention upon the grandest of all wind instruments the pipe organ this mechanism has a separate pipe for every note properly proportioned a section of an ordinary wooden pipe is given in fig 138 wind rushes up through the foot of the pipe into a little chamber closed by a block of wood or a plate except for a narrow slit which directs it against the sharp lip a and causes a fluttering the proper pulse of which is converted by the aircolumn above into a musical sound illustration fig 138section of an ordinary wooden flue pipe in even the smallest organs more than one pipe is actuated by one key on the keyboard for not only do pipes of different shapes give different qualities of tone but it is found desirable to have ranks of pipes with their bottom note of different pitches the length of an open pipe is measured from the edge of the lip to the top of the pipe of a stopped pipe from the lip to the top and back again when we speak of a 16 or 8 foot rank or stop we mean one of which the lowest note in the rank is that produced by a 16 or 8 foot open pipe or their stopped equivalents 8 or 4 foot in a big organ we find 32 16 8 4 and 2 foot stops and some of these repeated a number of times in pipes of different shape and construction the arrangement of the pipes we will now study briefly the mechanism of a very simple singlekeyboard organ with five ranks of pipes or stops illustration fig 139the table of a soundboard it is necessary to arrange matters so that the pressing down of one key may make all five of the pipes belonging to it speak or only four three two or one as we may desire the pipes are mounted in rows on a soundboard which is built up in several layers at the top is the upper board below it come the sliders one for each stop and underneath that the table in fig 139 we see part of the table from below across the under side are fastened parallel bars with spaces shown black left between them two other bars are fastened across the ends so that each groove is enclosed by wood at the top and on all sides the under side of the table has sheets of leather glued or otherwise attached to it in such a manner that no air can leak from one groove to the next upper board sliders and table are pierced with rows of holes to permit the passage of wind from the grooves to the pipes the grooves under the big pipes are wider than those under the small pipes as they have to pass more air the bars between the grooves also vary in width according to the weight of the pipes which they have to carry the sliders can be moved in and out a short distance in the direction of the axis of the rows of pipes there is one slider under each row when a slider is in the holes in it do not correspond with those in the table and upper board so that no wind can get from the grooves to the rank over that particular slider fig 140 shows the manner in which the sliders are operated by the little knobs also called stops projecting from the casing of the organ within convenient reach of the performers hands one stop is in the other drawn out illustration fig 140 in fig 141 we see the table etc in cross section with a slider out putting the pipes of its rank in communication with the grooves the same diagram shows us in section the little triangular pallets which admit air from the windchest to the grooves and fig 142 gives us an end section of table sliders and windchest together with the rods etc connecting the key to its pallet when the key is depressed the sticker a slight wooden rod is pushed up this rocks a backfall or pivoted lever to which is attached the pulldown a wire penetrating the bottom of the windchest to the pallet as soon as the pallet opens wind rushes into the groove above through the aperture in the leather bottom and thence to any one of the pipes of which the slider has been drawn out the sliders in fig 142 are solid black it is evident that if the soundboard is sufficiently deep from back to front any number of rows of pipes may be placed on it illustration fig 141 pedals the organ pedals are connected to the pallets by an action similar to that of the keys the pedal stops are generally of deep tone 32foot and 16foot as they have to sustain the bass part of the musical harmonies by means of couplers one or more of the keyboard stops may be linked to the pedals separate soundboards the keyboard of a very large organ has as many as five manuals or rows of keys each manual operates what is practically a separate organ mounted on its own soundboard illustration fig 142 illustration fig 143general section of a twomanual organ the manuals are arranged in steps each slightly overhanging that below taken in order from the top they are1 echo organ of stops of small scale and very soft tone enclosed in a swellbox 2 solo organ of stops imitating orchestral instruments the wonderful vox humana stop also belongs to this manual 3 swell organ contained in a swellbox the front and sides of which have shutters which can be opened and closed by the pressure of the foot on a lever so as to regulate the amount of sound proceeding from the pipes inside 4 great organ including pipes of powerful tone 5 choir organ of soft mellow stops often enclosed in a swellbox we may add to these the pedal organ which can be coupled to any but the echo manual varieties of stops we have already remarked that the quality of a stop depends on the shape and construction of the pipe some pipes are of wood others of metal some are rectangular others circular some have parallel sides others taper or expand towards the top some are open others stopped the two main classes into which organ pipes may be divided are1 flue pipes in which the wind is directed against a lip as in fig 138 2 reed pipesthat is pipes used in combination with a simple device for admitting air into the bottom of the pipe in a series of gusts fig 144 shows a striking reed such as is found in the ordinary motor horn the elastic metal tongue when at rest stands a very short distance away from the orifice in the reed when wind is blown through the reed the tongue is sucked against the reed blocks the current and springs away again a free reed has a tongue which vibrates in a slot without actually touching the sides harmonium and concertina reeds are of this type in the organ the reed admits air to a pipe of the correct length to sympathize with the rate of the puffs of air which the reed passes reed pipes expand towards the top tuning pipes and reeds illustration fig 144a reed pipe pipes are tuned by adjusting their length the plug at the top of a stopped pipe is pulled out or pushed in a trifle to flatten or sharpen the note respectively an open pipe if large has a tongue cut in the side at the top which can be pressed inwards or outwards for the purpose of correcting the tone small metal pipes are flattened by contracting the tops inwards with a metal cone like a candleextinguisher placed over the top and tapped and sharpened by having the top splayed by a cone pushed in point downwards reeds of the striking variety see fig 144 have a tuningwire pressing on the tongue near the fixed end the end of this wire projects through the casing by moving it the length of the vibrating part of the tongue is adjusted to correctness bellows different stops require different windpressures ranging from 110 lb to 1 lb to the square inch the reeds taking the heaviest pressures there must therefore be as many sets of bellows and windchests as there are different pressures wanted a very large organ consumes immense quantities of air when all the stops are out and the pumping has to be done by a powerful gas water or electric engine every bellows has a reservoir see fig 143 above it the top of this is weighted to give the pressure required a valve in the top opens automatically as soon as the reservoir has expanded to a certain fixed limit so that there is no possibility of bursting the leather sides illustration fig 145the keyboard and part of the pneumatic mechanism of the hereford cathedral organ c composition pedals for pushing out groups of stops p at bottom pedals p p at top pipes carrying compressed air m manuals 4 s s stops electric and pneumatic actions we have mentioned in connection with railway signalling that the signalman is sometimes relieved of the hard manual labour of moving signals and points by the employment of electric and pneumatic auxiliaries the same is true of organs and organists the touch of the keys has been greatly lightened by making the keys open airvalves or complete electric circuits which actuate the mechanism for pulling down the pallets the stops pedals and couplers also employ power not only are the performers muscles spared a lot of heavy work when compressed air and electricity aid him but he is able to have the console or keyboard far away from the pipes from the console the player sitting with the singers or in any desirable part of the choir or chancel would be able to command the working of the whole of the largest organ situated afar at the western end of the nave would draw each stop in complete reliance on the sliders and the soundboard fulfilling their office andmarvel of it allthe player using the swell pedal in his ordinary manner would obtain crescendo and diminuendo with a more perfect effect than by the old way31 in cathedrals it is no uncommon thing for the different soundboards to be placed in positions far apart so that to the uninitiated there may appear to be several independent organs scattered about yet all are absolutely under the control of a man who is sitting away from them all but connected with them by a number of tubes or wires the largest organ in the world is that in the town hall sydney it has a hundred and twentysix speaking stops five manuals fourteen couplers and fortysix combination studs the pipes about 8000 in number range from the enormous 64foot contratrombone to some only a fraction of an inch in length the organ occupies a space 85 feet long and 26 feet deep human reeds the most wonderful of all musical reeds is found in the human throat in the anatomical part called the larynx situated at the top of the trachea or windpipe slip a piece of rubber tubing over the end of a pipe allowing an inch or so to project take the free part of the tube by two opposite points between the first fingers and thumbs and pull it until the edges are stretched tight now blow through it the wind forcing its way between the two rubber edges causes them and the air inside the tube to vibrate and a musical note results the more you strain the rubber the higher is the note the larynx works on this principle the windpipe takes the place of the glass pipe the two vocal cords represent the rubber edges and the arytenoid muscles stand instead of the hands when contracted these muscles bring the edges of the cords nearer to one another stretch the cords and shorten the cords a person gifted with a very good ear can it has been calculated adjust the length of the vocal cords to 117000th of an inch simultaneously with the adjustment of the cords is effected the adjustment of the length of the windpipe so that the column of air in it may be of the right length to vibrate in unison here again is seen a wonderful provision of nature the resonance of the mouth cavity is also of great importance by altering the shape of the mouth the various harmonics of any fundamental note produced by the larynx are rendered prominent and so we get the different vocal sounds helmholtz has shown that the fundamental tone of any note is represented by the sound oo if the mouth is adjusted to bring out the octave of the fundamental o results a is produced by accentuating the second harmonic the twelfth ee by developing the second and fourth harmonics while for ah the fifth and seventh must be prominent when we whistle we transform the lips into a reed and the mouth into a pipe the tension of the lips and the shape of the mouth cavity decide the note the lips are also used as a reed for blowing the flute piccolo and all the brass band instruments of the cornet order in blowing a coachhorn the various harmonics of the fundamental note are brought out by altering the lip tension and the wind pressure a cornet is practically a coachhorn rolled up into a convenient shape and furnished with three keys the depression of which puts extra lengths of tubing in connection with the main tubein fact makes it longer one key lowers the fundamental note of the horn half a tone the second a full tone the third a tone and a half if the first and third are pressed down together the note sinks two tones if the second and third two and a half tones and simultaneous depression of all three gives a drop of three tones the performer thus has seven possible fundamental notes and several harmonics of each of these at his command so that by a proper manipulation of the keys he can run up the chromatic scale we should add that the cornet tube is an open pipe so is that of the flute the clarionet is a stopped pipe 29 it is obvious that in fig 136 2 a pulse will pass from a to b and back in

the phonographthe recorderthe reproducerthe gramophonethe making of recordscylinder recordsgramophone records in the patent office museum at south kensington is a curious little piece of machinerya metal cylinder mounted on a long axle which has at one end a screw thread chased along it the screw end rotates in a socket with a thread of equal pitch cut in it to the other end is attached a handle on an upright near the cylinder is mounted a sort of drum the membrane of the drum carries a needle which when the membrane is agitated by the airwaves set up by human speech digs into a sheet of tinfoil wrapped round the cylinder pressing it into a helical groove turned on the cylinder from end to end this construction is the first phonograph ever made thomas edison the wizard of the west devised it in 1876 and from this rude parent have descended the beautiful machines which record and reproduce human speech and musical sounds with startling accuracy illustration fig 146the governor of a phonograph we do not propose to trace here the development of the talkingmachine nor will it be necessary to describe in detail its mechanism which is probably well known to most readers or could be mastered in a very short time on personal examination we will content ourselves with saying that the wax cylinder of the phonograph or the ebonite disc of the gramophone is generally rotated by clockwork concealed in the body of the machine the speed of rotation has to be very carefully governed in order that the record may revolve under the reproducing point at a uniform speed the principle of the governor commonly used appears in fig 146 the last pinion of the clockwork train is mounted on a shaft carrying two triangular plates a and c to which are attached three short lengths of flat steel spring with a heavy ball attached to the centre of each a is fixed c moves up the shaft as the balls fly out and pulls with it the disc d which rubs against the pad p on the end of a spring and sets up sufficient friction to slow the clockwork the limit rate is regulated by screw s the phonograph though the recording and reproducing apparatus of a phonograph gives very wonderful results its construction is quite simple at the same time it must be borne in mind that an immense amount of experimenting has been devoted to finding out the most suitable materials and forms for the parts illustration fig 147section of an edison bell phonograph recorder the recorder fig 147 is a little circular box about one and a half inches in diameter32 from the top a tube leads to the horn the bottom is a circular plate c c hinged at one side this plate supports a glass disc d about 1150th of an inch thick to which is attached the cutting stylusa tiny sapphire rod with a cupshaped end having very sharp edges soundwaves enter the box through the horn tube but instead of being allowed to fill the whole box they are concentrated by the shifting nozzle n on to the centre of the glass disc through the hole in c c you will notice that n has a ball end and c c a socket to fit n exactly so that though c c and n move up and down very rapidly they still make perfect contact the disc is vibrated by the soundimpulses and drives the cutting point down into the surface of the wax cylinder turning below it in a clockwork direction the only dead weight pressing on s is that of n c c and the glass diaphragm illustration fig 148perspective view of a phonograph recorder as the cylinder revolves the recorder is shifted continuously along by a leading screw having one hundred or more threads to the inch cut on it so that it traces a continuous helical groove from one end of the wax cylinder to the other this groove is really a series of very minute indentations not exceeding 11000th of an inch in depth33 seen under a microscope the surface of the record is a succession of hills and valleys some much larger than others fig 151 a a loud sound causes the stylus to give a vigorous dig while low sounds scarcely move it at all the wonderful thing about this soundrecording is that not only are the fundamental tones of musical notes impressed but also the harmonics which enable us to decide at once whether the record is one of a cornet violin or banjo performance furthermore if several instruments are playing simultaneously near the recorders horn the stylus catches all the different shades of tone of every note of a chord there are so to speak minor hills and valleys cut in the slopes of the main hills and valleys illustration fig 149section of the reproducer of an edison bell phonograph illustration fig 150perspective view of a phonograph reproducer the reproducer fig 149 is somewhat more complicated than the recorder as before we have a circular box communicating with the horn of the instrument a thin glass disc forms a bottom to the box it is held in position between rubber rings r r by a screw collar c to the centre is attached a little eye from which hangs a link l pivoted at p from one edge of the box is a floating weight having a circular opening immediately under the eye the link passes through this to the left end of a tiny lever which rocks on a pivot projecting from the weight to the right end of the lever is affixed a sapphire bar or stylus with a ball end of a diameter equal to that of the cutting point of the recorder the floating weight presses the stylus against the record and also keeps the link between the rocking lever of the glass diaphragm in a state of tension every blow given to the stylus is therefore transmitted by the link to the diaphragm which vibrates and sends an airimpulse into the horn as the impulses are given at the same rate as those which agitated the diaphragm of the recorder the sounds which they represent are accurately reproduced even to the harmonics of a musical note the gramophone this effects the same purpose as the phonograph but in a somewhat different manner the phonograph recorder digs vertically downwards into the surface of the record whereas the stylus of the gramophone wags from side to side and describes a snaky course fig 151b it makes no difference in talkingmachines whether the reproducing stylus be moved sideways or vertically by the record provided that motion is imparted by it to the diaphragm illustration fig 151a illustration fig 151b illustration fig 151csection of a gramophone reproducer in fig 151c the construction of the gramophone reproducer is shown in section a is the cover which screws on to the bottom b and confines the diaphragm d between itself and a rubber ring the portion b is elongated into a tubular shape for connection with the horn an arm of which slides over the tube and presses against the rubber ring c to make an airtight joint the needlecarrier n is attached at its upper end to the centre of the diaphragm at a point indicated by the white dot a pin passes through it and the cover the lower end is tubular to accommodate the steel points which have to be replaced after passing once over a record a screw s working in a socket projecting from the carrier holds the point fast the record moves horizontally under the point in a plane perpendicular to the page the groove being zigzag the needle vibrates right and left and rotating the carrier a minute fraction of an inch on the pivot shakes the glass diaphragm and sends waves of air into the horn the gramophone is a reproducing instrument only the records are made on a special machine fitted with a device for causing the recorder point to describe a spiral course from the circumference to the centre of the record disc some gramophone records have as many as 250 turns to the inch the total length of the tracing on a teninch concert record is about 1000 feet the making of records for commercial purposes it would not pay to make every record separately in a recording machine the expense of employing good singers and instrumentalists renders such a method impracticable all the records we buy are made from moulds the preparation of which we will now briefly describe cylinder or phonograph records first of all a wax record is made in the ordinary way on a recording machine after being tested and approved it is hung vertically and centrally from a rotating table pivoted on a vertical metal spike passing up through the record on one side of the table is a piece of iron on each side of the record and a small distance away rises a brass rod enclosed in a glass tube the top of the rods are hooked so that pieces of gold leaf may be suspended from them a bellglass is now placed over the record table and rods and the air is sucked out by a pump as soon as a good vacuum has been obtained the current from the secondary circuit of an induction coil is sent into the rods supporting the gold leaves which are volatilized by the current jumping from one to the other a magnet whirled outside the bellglass draws round the iron armature on the pivoted table and consequently revolves the record on the surface of which a very thin coating of gold is deposited the record is next placed in an electroplating bath until a copper shell onesixteenth of an inch thick has formed all over the outside this is trued up on a lathe and encased in a brass tube the master or original wax record is removed by cooling it till it contracts sufficiently to fall out of the copper mould on the inside surface of which are reproduced in relief the indentations of the wax master copies are made from the mould by immersing it in a tank of melted wax the cold metal chills the wax that touches it so that the mould soon has a thick waxen lining the mould and copy are removed from the tank and mounted on a lathe which shapes and smooths the inside of the record the record is loosened from the mould by cooling after inspection for flaws it is if found satisfactory packed in cottonwool and added to the saleable stock gramophone master records are made on a circular disc of zinc coated over with a very thin film of acidproof fat when the disc is revolved in the recording machine the sharp stylus cuts through the fat and exposes the zinc beneath on immersion in a bath of chromic acid the bared surfaces are bitten into while the unexposed parts remain unaffected when the etching is considered complete the plate is carefully cleaned and tested a negative copper copy is made from it by electrotyping this constitutes the mould from it as many as 1000 copies may be made on ebonite plates by combined pressure and heating 32 the edison bell phonograph is here referred to 33 some of the sibilant or hissing sounds of the voice are computed to be represented by depressions less than a millionth of an inch in depth

flyingmachine when a childs rubber ball gets slack through a slight leakage of air and loses some of its bounce it is a common practice to hold it for a few minutes in front of the fire till it becomes temporarily taut again why does the heat have this effect on the ball no more air has been forced into the ball after perusing the chapter on the steamengine the reader will be able to supply the answer because the molecules of air dash about more vigorously among one another when the air is heated and by striking the inside of the ball with greater force put it in a state of greater tension if we heat an open jar there is no pressure developed since the air simply expands and flows out of the neck but the air that remains in the jar being less in quantity than when it was not yet heated weighs less though occupying the same space as before if we took a very thin bladder and filled it with hot air it would therefore float in colder air proving that heated air as we should expect tends to rise the fireballoon employs this principle the air inside the bag being kept artificially warm by a fire burning in some vessel attached below the open neck of the bag now the sun shines with different degrees of heating power at different parts of the world where its effect is greatest the air there is hottest we will suppose for the sake of argument that at a certain moment the air envelope all round the globe is of equal temperature suddenly the sun shines out and heats the air at a point a till it is many degrees warmer than the surrounding air the heated air expands rises and spreads out above the cold air but as a given depth of warm air has less weight than an equal depth of cold air the cold air at once begins to rush towards b and squeeze the rest of the warm air out we may therefore picture the atmosphere as made up of a number of colder currents passing along the surface of the earth to replace warm currents rising and spreading over the upper surface of the cold air a similar circulation takes place in a vessel of heated water see p 17 land and sea breezes a breeze which blows from the sea on to the land during the day often reverses its direction during the evening why is this the earth grows hot or cold more rapidly than the sea when the sun shines hotly the land warms quickly and heats the air over it which becomes light and is displaced by the cooler air over the sea when the sun sets the earth and the air over it lose their warmth quickly while the sea remains at practically the same temperature as before so the balance is changed the heavier air now lying over the land it therefore flows seawards and drives out the warmer air there light air and moisture light warm air absorbs moisture as it cools the moisture in it condenses breathe on a plate and you notice that a watery film forms on it at once the cold surface condenses the water suspended in the warm breath if you wish to dry a damp room you heat it moisture then passes from the walls and objects in the room to the atmosphere the barometer this property of air is responsible for the changes in weather light moistureladen air meets cold dry air and the sudden cooling forces it to release its moisture which falls as rain or floats about as clouds if only we are able to detect the presence of warm airstrata above us we ought to be in a position to foretell the weather we can judge of the specific gravity of the air in our neighbourhood by means of the barometer which means weightmeasurer the normal airpressure at sealevel on our bodies or any other objects is about 15 lbs to the square inchthat is to say if you could imprison and weigh a column of air one inch square in section and of the height of the worlds atmospheric envelope the scale would register 15 lbs many years ago 1643 torricelli a pupil of galileo first calculated the pressure by a very simple experiment he took a long glass tube sealed at one end filled it with mercury and closing the open end with the thumb inverted the tube and plunged the open end below the surface of a tank of mercury on removing his thumb he found that the mercury sank in the tube till the surface of the mercury in the tube was about 30 inches in a vertical direction above the surface of the mercury in the tank now as the upper end was sealed there must be a vacuum above the mercury what supported the column the atmosphere so it was evident that the downward pressure of the mercury exactly counterbalanced the upward pressure of the air as a mercury column 30 inches high and 1 inch square weighs 15 lbs the airpressure on a square inch obviously is the same illustration fig 152a fortin barometer fortins column barometer is a simple torricellian tube t with the lower end submerged in a little glass tank of mercury fig 152 the bottom of this tank is made of washleather to obtain a reading the screw s pressing on the washleather is adjusted until the mercury in the tank rises to the tip of the little ivory point p the reading is the figure of the scale on the face of the case opposite which the surface of the column stands illustration fig 153 the wheel barometer also employs the mercury column fig 153 the lower end of the tube is turned up and expanded to form a tank c the pointer p which travels round a graduated dial is mounted on a spindle carrying a pulley over which passes a string with a weight at each end the heavier of the weights rests on the top of the mercury when the atmospheric pressure falls the mercury in c rises lifting this weight and the pointer moves this form of barometer is not so delicate or reliable as fortins or as the siphon barometer which has a tube of the same shape as the wheel instrument but of the same diameter from end to end except for a contraction at the bend the reading of a siphon is the distance between the two surfaces of the mercury a very simple barometer is made by knocking off the neck of a small bottle filling the body with water and hanging it up by a string in the position shown fig 154 when the atmospheric pressure falls the water at the orifice bulges outwards when it rises the water retreats till its surface is slightly concave illustration fig 154 the aneroid barometer on account of their size and weight and the comparative difficulty of transporting them without derangement of the mercury column column barometers are not so generally used as the aneroid variety aneroid means without moisture and in this particular connection signifies that no liquid is used in the construction of the barometer fig 155 shows an aneroid in detail the most noticeable feature is the vacuum chamber v c a circular box which has a top and bottom of corrugated but thin and elastic metal sections of the box are shown in figs 156 157 it is attached at the bottom to the base board of the instrument by a screw fig 156 from the top rises a pin p with a transverse hole through it to accommodate the pin k e which has a triangular section and stands on one edge illustration fig 155an aneroid barometer returning to fig 155 we see that p projects through s a powerful spring of sheetsteel to this is attached a long arm c the free end of which moves a link rotating through the pin e a spindle mounted in a frame d the spindle moves arm f this pulls on a very minute chain wound round the pointer spindle b in opposition to a hairspring h s b is mounted on arm h which is quite independent of the rest of the aneroid illustration fig 156 fig 157 the vacuum chamber of an aneroid barometer extended and compressed the vacuum chamber is exhausted during manufacture and sealed it would naturally assume the shape of fig 157 but the spring s acting against the atmospheric pressure pulls it out as the pressure varies so does the spring rise or sink and the slightest movement is transmitted through the multiplying arms c e f to the pointer a good aneroid is so delicate that it will register the difference in pressure caused by raising it from the floor to the table where it has a couple of feet less of aircolumn resting upon it an aneroid is therefore a valuable help to mountaineers for determining their altitude above sealevel barometers and weather we may now return to the consideration of forecasting the weather by movements of the barometer the first thing to keep in mind is that the instrument is essentially a weight recorder how is weather connected with atmospheric weight in england the warm southwest wind generally brings wet weather the north and east winds fine weather the reason for this being that the first reaches us after passing over the atlantic and picking up a quantity of moisture while the second and third have come overland and deposited their moisture before reaching us a sinking of the barometer heralds the approach of heated airthat is moist airwhich on meeting colder air sheds its moisture so when the mercury falls we expect rain on the other hand when the glass rises we know that colder air is coming and as colder air comes from a dry quarter we anticipate fine weather it does not follow that the same conditions are found in all parts of the world in regions which have the ocean to the east or the north the winds blowing thence would be the rainy winds while southwesterly winds might bring hot and dry weather the divingbell water is nearly 773 times as heavy as air if we submerge a barometer a very little way below the surface of a water tank we shall at once observe a rise of the mercury column at a depth of 34 feet the pressure on any submerged object is 15 lbs to the square inch in addition to the atmospheric pressure of 15 lbs per square inchthat is there would be a 30lb absolute pressure as a rule when speaking of hydraulic pressures we start with the normal atmospheric pressure as zero and we will here observe the practice illustration fig 158a diving bell the divingbell is used to enable people to work under water without having recourse to the divingdress a sketch of an ordinary divingbell is given in fig 158 it may be described as a square iron box without a bottom at the top are links by which it is attached to a lowering chain and windows protected by grids also a nozzle for the airtube illustration fig 159 a simple model bell fig 159 is easily made out of a glass tumbler which has had a tap fitted in a hole drilled through the bottom we turn off the tap and plunge the glass into a vessel of water the water rises a certain way up the interior until the air within has been compressed to a pressure equal to that of the water at the level of the surface inside the further the tumbler is lowered the higher does the water rise inside it evidently men could not work in a divingbell which is invaded thus by water it is imperative to keep the water at bay this we can do by attaching a tube to the tap fig 160 and blowing into the tumbler till the airpressure exceeds that of the water which is shown by bubbles rising to the surface the divingbell therefore has attached to it a hose through which air is forced by pumps from the atmosphere above at a pressure sufficient to keep the water out of the bell this pumping of air also maintains a fresh supply of oxygen for the workers illustration fig 160 inside the bell is tackle for grappling any object that has to be moved such as a heavy stone block the divingbell is used mostly for laying submarine masonry the bell slung either from a crane on the masonry already built above sealevel or from a specially fitted barge comes into action the block is lowered by its own crane on to the bottom the bell descends upon it and the crew seize it with tackle suspended inside the bell instructions are sent up as to the direction in which the bell should be moved with its burden and as soon as the exact spot has been reached the signal for lowering is given and the stone settles on to the cement laid ready for it34 for many purposes it is necessary that the worker should have more freedom of action than is possible when he is cooped up inside an iron box hence the invention of the divingdress which consists of two main parts the helmet and the dress proper the helmet fig 161 is made of copper a breastplate b shaped to fit the shoulders has at the neck a segmental screw bayonetjoint the headpiece is fitted with a corresponding screw which can be attached or removed by oneeighth of a turn the neck edge of the dress which is made in one piece legs arms body and all is attached to the breastplate by means of the plate p1 screwed down tightly on it by the wingnuts n n the bolts of which pass through the breastplate air enters the helmet through a valve situated at the back and is led through tubes along the inside to the front this valve closes automatically if any accident cuts off the air supply and encloses sufficient air in the dress to allow the diver to regain the surface the outlet valve o v can be adjusted by the diver to maintain any pressure at the sides of the headpiece are two hooks h over which pass the cords connecting the heavy lead weights of 40 lbs each hanging on the divers breast and back these weights are also attached to the knobs k k a pair of boots having 17 lbs of lead each in the soles complete the dress three glazed windows are placed in the headpiece that in the front r w being removable so that the diver may gain free access to the air when he is above water without being obliged to take off the helmet illustration fig 161a divers helmet by means of telephone wires built into the lifeline which passes under the divers arms and is used for lowering and hoisting easy communication is established between the diver and his attendants above the transmitter of the telephone is placed inside the helmet between the front and a side window the receiver and the button of an electric bell in the crown this last he can press by raising his head the lifeline sometimes also includes the wires for an electric lamp fig 162 used by the diver at depths to which daylight cannot penetrate the pressure on a divers body increases in the ratio of 413 lbs per square inch for every 10 feet that he descends the ordinary working limit is about 150 feet though old hands are able to stand greater pressures the record is held by one james hooper who when removing the cargo of the cape horn sunk off the south american coast made seven descents of 201 feet one of which lasted for fortytwo minutes illustration fig 162divers electric lamp a sketch is given fig 163 of divers working below water with pneumatic tools fed from above with highpressure air owing to his buoyancy a diver has little depressing or pushing power and he cannot bore a hole in a post with an auger unless he is able to rest his back against some firm object or is roped to the post pneumatic chipping tools merely require holding to their work their weight offering sufficient resistance to the very rapid blows which they make illustration fig 163divers at work below water with pneumatic tools airpumps illustration fig 164 illustration fig 165 mention having been made of the airpump we append diagrams figs 164 165 of the simplest form of airpump the cycle tyre inflator the piston is composed of two circular plates of smaller diameter than the barrel holding between them a cup leather during the upstroke the cup collapses inwards and allows air to pass by it on the downstroke fig 165 the edges of the cup expand against the barrel preventing the passage of air round the piston a doubleaction airpump requires a long wellfitting piston with a cup on each side of it and the addition of extra valves to the barrel as the cups under these circumstances cannot act as valves pneumatic tyres illustration fig 166 illustration fig 167 the action of the pneumatic tyre in reducing vibration and increasing the speed of a vehicle is explained by figs 166 167 when the tyre encounters an obstacle such as a large stone it laps over it fig 166 and while supporting the weight on the wheel reduces the deflection of the direction of movement when an irontyred wheel meets a similar obstacle it has to rise right over it often jumping a considerable distance into the air the resultant motions of the wheel are indicated in each case by an arrow every change of direction means a loss of forward velocity the loss increasing with the violence and extent of the change the pneumatic tyre also scores because on account of its elasticity it gives a kick off against the obstacle which compensates for the resistance during compression illustration fig 168section of the mechanism of an airgun the airgun this may be described as a valveless airpump fig 168 is a section of a gem airgun with the mechanism set ready for firing in the stock of the gun is the cylinder in which an accurately fitting and hollow piston moves a powerful helical spring turned out of a solid bar of steel is compressed between the inside end of the piston and the upper end of the butt to set the gun the catch is pressed down so that its hooked end disengages from the stock and the barrel is bent downwards on pivot p this slides the lower end of the compressing lever towards the butt and a projection on the guide b working in a groove takes the piston with it when the spring has been fully compressed the triangular tip of the rocking cam r engages with a groove in the pistons head and prevents recoil when the barrel is returned to its original position on pulling the trigger the piston is released and flies up the cylinder with great force and the air in the cylinder is compressed and driven through the bore of the barrel blocked by the leaden slug to which the whole energy of the expanding spring is transmitted through the elastic medium of the air there are several other good types of airgun all of which employ the principles described above the selfclosing doorstop is another interesting pneumatic device it consists of a cylinder with an airtight piston and a piston rod working through a cover at one end the other end of the cylinder is pivoted to the door frame when the door is opened the piston compresses a spring in the cylinder and air is admitted past a cup leather on the piston to the upper part of the cylinder this air is confined by the cup leather when the door is released and escapes slowly through a leak allowing the spring to regain its shape slowly and by the agency of the piston rod to close the door the action of wind on oblique surfaces why does a kite rise why does a boat sail across the wind we can supply an answer almost instinctively in both cases because the wind pushes the kite or sail aside it will however be worth while to look for a more scientific answer the kite cannot travel in the direction of the wind because it is confined by a string but the face is so attached to the string that it inclines at an angle to the direction of the wind now when a force meets an inclined surface which it cannot carry along with it but which is free to travel in another direction the force may be regarded as resolving itself into two forces coming from each side of the original line these are called the component forces illustration fig 169 to explain this we give a simple sketch of a kite in the act of flying fig 169 the wind is blowing in the direction of the solid arrow a the oblique surface of the kite resolves its force into the two components indicated by the dotted arrows b and c of these c only has lifting power to overcome the force of gravity the kite assumes a position in which force c and gravity counterbalance one another illustration fig 170 a boat sailing across the wind is acted on in a similar manner fig 170 the wind strikes the sail obliquely and would thrust it to leeward were it not for the opposition of the water the force a is resolved into forces b and c of which c propels the boat on the line of its axis the boat can be made to sail even up the wind her head being brought round until a point is reached at which the force b on the boat masts etc overcomes the force c the capability of a boat for sailing up wind depends on her lines and the amount of surface she offers to the wind the balloon is a pearshaped bagusually made of silkfilled with some gas lighter than air the tendency of a heavier medium to displace a lighter drives the gas upwards and with it the bag and the wickerwork car attached to a network encasing the bag the tapering neck at the lower end is open to permit the free escape of gas as the atmospheric pressure outside diminishes with increasing elevation at the top of the bag is a wooden valve opening inwards which can be drawn down by a rope passing up to it through the neck whenever the aeronaut wishes to let gas escape for a descent he is able to cause a very rapid escape by pulling another cord depending from a ripping piece near the top of the bag in case of emergency this is torn away bodily leaving a large hole the ballast usually sand carried enables him to maintain a state of equilibrium between the upward pull of the gas and the downward pull of gravity to sink he lets out gas to rise he throws out ballast and this process can be repeated until the ballast is exhausted the greatest height ever attained by aeronauts is the 714 miles or 37000 feet of messrs glaisher and coxwell on september 5 1862 the ascent nearly cost them their lives for at an elevation of about 30000 feet they were partly paralyzed by the rarefaction of the air and had not mr coxwell been able to pull the valve rope with his teeth and cause a descent both would have died from want of air illustration fig 171 the flyingmachine which scientific engineers have so long been trying to produce will probably be quite independent of balloons and will depend for its ascensive powers on the action of air on oblique surfaces sir hiram maxims experimental airship embodied the principles shown by fig 171 on a deck was mounted an engine e extremely powerful for its weight this drove large propellers s s large aeroplanes of canvas stretched over light frameworks were set up overhead the forward end somewhat higher than the rear the machine was run on rails so arranged as to prevent it rising unfortunately an accident happened at the first trial and destroyed the machine in actual flight it would be necessary to have a vertical rudder for altering the horizontal direction and a horizontal tail for steering up or down the principle of an aeroplane is that of the kite with this difference that instead of moving air striking a captive body a moving body is propelled against more or less stationary air the resolution of forces is shown by the arrows as before up to the present time no practical flyingmachine has appeared but experimenters are hard at work examining the conditions which must be fulfilled to enable man to claim the dominion of the air

presshousehold watersupply fittingsthe ballcockthe watermeterwatersupply systemsthe household filtergas trapswater enginesthe cream separatorthe hydro in the last chapter we saw that the pressure of the atmosphere is 15 lbs to the square inch suppose that to a very long tube having a sectional area of one square inch we fit an airtight piston fig 172 and place the lower end of the tube in a vessel of water on raising the piston a vacuum would be created in the tube did not the pressure of the atmosphere force water up into the tube behind the piston the water would continue to rise until it reached a point 34 feet perpendicularly above the level of the water in the vessel the column would then weigh 15 lbs and exactly counterbalance the atmospheric pressure so that a further raising of the piston would not raise the water any farther at sealevel therefore the lifting power of a pump by suction is limited to 34 feet on the top of a lofty mountain where the airpressure is less the height of the column would be diminishedin fact be proportional to the pressure illustration fig 172 illustration fig 173 the siphon is an interesting application of the principle of suction by its own weight water may be made to lift water through a height not exceeding 34 feet this is explained by fig 173 the siphon pipe a b c d is in the first instance filled by suction the weight of the water between a and b counterbalances that between b and c but the column c d hangs as it were to the heels of b c and draws it down or to put it otherwise the column b d being heavier than the column b a draws it over the topmost point of the siphon any parting between the columns provided that b a does not exceed 34 feet is impossible as the pressure of the atmosphere on the mouth of b a is sufficient to prevent the formation of a vacuum the bucket pump we may now pass to the commonest form of pump used in houses stables gardens etc fig 174 the piston has a large hole through it over the top of which a valve is hinged at the bottom of the barrel is a second valve also opening upwards seated on the top of the supply pipe in sketch a the first upstroke is in progress a vacuum forms under the piston or plunger and water rises up the barrel to fill it the next diagram b shows the first downstroke the plunger valve now opens and allows water to rise above the piston while the lower closes under the pressure of the water above and the pull of that below during the second upstroke c the water above the piston is raised until it overflows through the spout while a fresh supply is being sucked in below illustration fig 174 the forcepump illustration fig 175 forcepump suction stroke illustration fig 176 forcepump delivery stroke for driving water to levels above that of the pump a somewhat different arrangement is required one type of forcepump is shown in figs 175 176 the piston now is solid and the upper valve is situated in the delivery pipe during an upstroke this closes and the other opens the reverse happening during a downstroke an airchamber is generally fitted to the delivery pipe when water is to be lifted to great heights or under high pressure at each delivery stroke the air in the chamber is compressed absorbing some of the shock given to the water in the pipe by the water coming from the pump and its expansion during the next suction stroke forces the water gradually up the pipe the airchamber is a very prominent feature of the fireengine a doubleaction forcepump is seen in fig 177 making an upward stroke both sides of the piston are here utilized and the piston rod works through a watertight stuffingbox the action of the pump will be easily understood from the diagram illustration fig 177 the most marvellous pump known is the heart we give in fig 178 a diagrammatic sketch of the system of blood circulation in the human body showing the heart the arteries and the veins big and little the body is supposed to be facing the reader so that the left lung etc is to his right illustration fig 178a diagrammatic representation of the circulatory system of the blood the heart which forces the blood through the body is a large muscle of about the size of the clenched fist with four cavities these are respectively known as the right and left auricles and the right and left ventricles they are arranged in two pairs the auricle uppermost separated by a fleshy partition between each auricle and its ventricle is a valve which consists of strong membranous flaps with loose edges turned downwards the leftside valve is the mitral valve that between the right auricle and ventricle the tricuspid valve the edges of the valves fall together when the heart contracts and prevent the passage of blood each ventricle has a second valve through which it ejects the blood that of the right ventricle has been shown double for the sake of convenience the action of the heart is thisthe auricles and ventricles expand blood rushes into the auricles from the channels supplying them and distends them and the ventricles the auricles contract and fill the ventricles below quite full there are no valves above the auricles but the force of contraction is not sufficient to return the blood to the veins the ventricles contract the mitral and tricuspid valves close the valves leading to the arteries open blood is forced out of the ventricles the blood channels are of two kinds1 the arteries which lead the blood into the circulatory system 2 the veins which lead the blood back to the heart the arteries divide up into branches and these again divide into smaller and smaller arteries the smallest termed capillaries latin capillus a hair are minute tubes having an average diameter of 13000th of an inch these permeate every part of the body the capillary arteries lead into the smallest veins which unite to form larger and larger veins until what we may call the main streams are reached through these the blood flows to the heart there are three main points of difference between arteries and veins in the first place the larger arteries have thick elastic walls and maintain their shape even when empty this elasticity performs the function of the airchamber of the forcepump when the ventricles contract driving blood into the arteries the walls of the latter expand and their contraction pushes the blood steadily forward without shock the capillaries have very thin walls so that fluids pass through them to and from the body feeding it and taking out waste matter the veins are all thinwalled and collapse when empty secondly most veins are furnished with valves which prevent blood flowing the wrong way these are similar in principle to those of the heart arteries have no valves thirdly arteries are generally deeply set while many of the veins run near the surface of the body those on the front of the arm are specially visible place your thumb on them and run it along towards the wrist and you will notice that the veins distend owing to the closing of the valves just mentioned arterial blood is red and comes out from a cut in gulps on account of the contraction of the elastic walls if you cut a vein blue blood issues in a steady stream the change of colour is caused by the loss of oxygen during the passage of the blood through the capillaries and the absorption of carbon dioxide from the tissues the lungs are two of the great purifiers of the blood as it circulates through them it gives up the carbon dioxide which it has absorbed and receives pure oxygen in exchange if the air of a room is foul the blood does not get the proper amount of oxygen for this reason it is advisable for us to keep the windows of our rooms open as much as possible both day and night fatigue is caused by the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other impurities in the blood when we run the heart pumps blood through the lungs faster than they can purify it and eventually our muscles become poisoned to such an extent that we have to stop from sheer exhaustion the course of the blood it takes rather less than a minute for a drop of blood to circulate from the heart through the whole system and back to the heart we may briefly summarize the course of the circulation of the blood thusit is expelled from the left ventricle into the aorta and the main arteries whence it passes into the smaller arteries and thence into the capillaries of the brain stomach kidneys etc it here imparts oxygen to the body and takes in impurities it then enters the veins and through them flows back to the right auricle is driven into the right ventricle is expelled into the pulmonary lung arteries enters the lungs and is purified it returns to the left auricle through the pulmonary veins enters the left auricle passes to left ventricle and so on a healthy heart beats from 120 times per minute in a oneyearold infant to 60 per minute in a very aged person the normal rate for a middleaged adult is from 80 to 70 beats heart disease signifies the failure of the heart valves to close properly blood passes back when the heart contracts and the circulation is much enfeebled by listening through a stethoscope the doctor is able to tell whether the valves are in good order a hissing sound during the beat indicates a leakage past the valves a thump or clack that they shut completely the hydraulic press it is a characteristic of fluids and gases that if pressure be brought to bear on any part of a mass of either class of bodies it is transmitted equally and undiminished in all directions and acts with the same force on all equal surfaces at right angles to those surfaces the great natural philosopher pascal first formulated this remarkable fact of which a simple illustration is given in fig 179 two cylinders a and b having a bore of one and two inches respectively are connected by a pipe water is poured in and pistons fitting the cylinders accurately and of equal weight are inserted on piston b is placed a load of 10 lbs to prevent a rising above the level of b it must be loaded proportionately the area of piston a is four times that of b so that if we lay on it a 40lb weight neither piston will move the walls of the cylinders and connecting pipe are also pressed outwards in the ratio of 10 lbs for every part of their interior surface which has an area equal to that of piston b illustration fig 179 illustration fig 180the cylinder and ram of a hydraulic press the hydraulic press is an application of this law cylinder b is represented by a force pump of small bore capable of delivering water at very high pressures up to 10 tons per square inch in the place of a we have a stout cylinder with a solid plunger p fig 180 carrying the table on which the object to be pressed is placed bramah the inventor of the hydraulic press experienced great difficulty in preventing the escape of water between the top of the cylinder and the plunger if a gland packing of the type found in steamcylinders were used it failed to hold back the water unless it were screwed down so tightly as to jam the plunger he tried all kinds of expedients without success and his invention excellent though it was in principle seemed doomed to failure when his foreman henry maudslay35 solved the problem in a simple but most masterly manner he had a recess turned in the neck of the cylinder at the point formerly occupied by the stuffingbox and into this a leather collar of usection marked solid black in fig 180 was placed with its open side downwards when water reached it it forced the edges apart one against the plunger the other against the walls of the recess with a degree of tightness proportionate to the pressure on water being released from the cylinder the collar collapsed allowing the plunger to sink without friction the principle of the hydraulic press is employed in lifts in machines for bending drilling and riveting steel plates or forcing wheels on or off their axles for advancing the boring shield of a tunnel and for other purposes too numerous to mention household watersupply fittings among these the most used is the tap or cock when a house is served by the town or district water supply the fitting of proper taps on all pipes connected with the supply is stipulated for by the waterworks authorities the oldfashioned plug tap is unsuitable for controlling highpressure water on account of the suddenness with which it checks the flow lest the reader should have doubts as to the nature of a plug tap we may add that it has a tapering cone of metal working in a tapering socket on the cone being turned till a hole through it is brought into line with the channel of the tap water passes a quarter turn closes the tap illustration fig 181a screwdown water cock its place has been taken by the screwdown cock a very common and effective pattern is shown in fig 181 the valve v with a facing of rubber leather or some other sufficiently elastic substance is attached to a pin c which projects upwards into the spindle a of the tap this spindle has a screw thread on it engaging with a collar b when the spindle is turned it rises or falls allowing the valve to leave its seating v s or forcing it down on to it a packing p in the neck of b prevents the passage of water round the spindle to open or close the tap completely is a matter of several turns which cannot be made fast enough to produce a waterhammer in the pipes by suddenly arresting the flow the reader will easily understand that if water flowing at the rate of several miles an hour is abruptly checked the shock to the pipes carrying it must be very severe the ballcock is used to feed a cistern automatically with water and prevent the water rising too far in the cistern fig 182 water enters the cistern through a valve which is opened and closed by a plug faced with rubber the lower extremity of the plug is flattened and has a rectangular hole cut in it through this passes a lever l attached at one end to a hollow copper sphere and pivoted at the other on the valve casing this casing is not quite circular in section for two slots are cast in the circumference to allow water to pass round the plug freely when the valve is open the buoyancy of the copper sphere is sufficient to force the plugs face up towards its seating as the valve rises and to cut off the supply entirely when a certain level has been attained if water is drawn off the sphere sinks the valve opens and the loss is made good illustration fig 182an automatic ballvalve the watermeter illustration fig 183 some consumers pay a sum quarterly for the privilege of a water supply and the water company allows them to use as much as they require others however prefer to pay a fixed amount for every thousand gallons used in such cases a watermeter is required to record the consumption we append a sectional diagram of kennedys patent watermeter fig 183 very widely used at the bottom is the measuring cylinder fitted with a piston 6 which is made to move perfectly watertight and free from friction by means of a cylindrical ring of indiarubber rolling between the body of the piston and the internal surface of the cylinder the piston rod 25 after passing through a stuffingbox in the cylinder cover is attached to a rack 15 which gears with a cog 13 fixed on a shaft as the piston moves up and down this cog is turned first in one direction then in the other to this shaft is connected the index mechanism to the right the cockkey 24 is so constructed that it can put either end of the measuring cylinder in communication with the supply or delivery pipes if given a quarter turn see fig 184 the weighted lever 14 moves loosely on the pinion shaft through part of a circle from the pinion project two arms one on each side of the lever when the lever has been lifted by one of these past the vertical position it falls by its own weight on to a bufferbox rest 18 in doing so it strikes a projection on the duplex lever 19 which is joined to the cockkey and gives the latter a quarter turn in order to follow the working of the meter we must keep an eye on figs 183 and 184 simultaneously water is entering from a the supply pipe it flows through the cock downwards through channel d into the lower half of the cylinder the piston rises driving out the water above it through c to the delivery pipe b just as the piston completes its stroke the weight raised by the rack and pinion topples over and strikes the keyarm which it sends down till stopped by the bufferbox the tap is then at right angles to the position shown in fig 184 and water is directed from a down c into the top of the cylinder forcing the piston down while the water admitted below during the last stroke is forced up the passage d and out by the outlet b before the piston has arrived at the bottom of the cylinder the lifter will have lifted the weighted lever from the bufferbox and raised it to a vertical position from there it will have fallen on the righthand keyarm and have brought the cockkey to its former position ready to begin another upward stroke illustration fig 184 the index mechanism makes allowance for the fact that the bevelwheel on the pinion shaft has its direction reversed at the beginning of every stroke of the piston this bevel engages with two others mounted loosely on the little shaft on which is turned a screw thread to revolve the index counter wheels each of these latter bevels actuates the shaft through a ratchet but while one turns the shaft when rotating in a clockwise direction only the other engages it when making an anticlockwise revolution the result is that the shaft is always turned in the same direction watersupply systems the water for a town or a district supply is got either from wells or from a river in the former case it may be assumed to be free from impurities in the latter there is need for removing all the objectionable and dangerous matter which river water always contains in a greater or less degree this purification is accomplished by first leading the water into large settling tanks where the suspended matter sinks to the bottom the water is then drawn off into filtration beds made in the following manner the bottom is covered with a thick layer of concrete on this are laid parallel rows of bricks the rows a small distance apart then come a layer of bricks or tiles placed close together a layer of coarse gravel a layer of finer gravel and a thick layer of sand at the top the sand arrests any solid matter in the water as it percolates to the gravel and drains below even the microbes36 of microscopic size are arrested as soon as the film of mud has formed on the top of the sand until this film is formed the filter is not in its most efficient condition every now and then the bed is drained the surface mud and sand carefully drained off and fresh sand put in their place a good filter bed should not pass more than from two to three gallons per hour for every square foot of surface and it must therefore have a large area it is sometimes necessary to send the water through a succession of beds arranged in terraces before it is sufficiently pure for drinking purposes the household filter when there is any doubt as to the wholesomeness of the water supply a small filter is often used the microbestopper is usually either charcoal sand asbestos or baked clay of some kind in fig 185 we give a section of a maignen filter r is the reservoir for the filtered water a the filter case proper d a conical perforated frame b a jacket of asbestos cloth secured top and bottom by asbestos cords to d c powdered carbon between which and the asbestos is a layer of special chemical filtering medium a perforated cap e covers in the carbon and prevents it being disturbed when water is poured in the carbon arrests the coarser forms of matter the asbestos the finer the asbestos jacket is easily removed and cleansed by heating over a fire illustration fig 185 the most useful form of household filter is one which can be attached to a tap connected with the main such a filter is usually made of porcelain or biscuit china the berkefeld filter has an outer case of iron and an interior hollow candle of porcelain from which a tube passes through the lid of the filter to a storage tank for the filtered water the water from the main enters the outer case and percolates through the porcelain walls to the internal cavity and thence flows away through the delivery pipe whatever be the type of filter used it must be cleansed at proper intervals a foul filter is very dangerous to those who drink the water from it it has been proved by tests that so far from purifying the water an inefficient and contaminated filter passes out water much more highly charged with microbes than it was before it entered we must not therefore think that because water has been filtered it is necessarily safe the reverse is only too often the case gas traps dangerous microbes can be breathed as well as drunk into the human system every communication between house and drains should be most carefully trapped the principle of a gas trap between say a kitchen sink and the drain to carry off the water is given in fig 186 enough water always remains in the bend to rise above the level of the elbow effectually keeping back any gas that there may be in the pipe beyond the bend illustration fig 186a trap for foul air waterengines before the invention of the steamengine human industries were largely dependent on the motive power of the wind and running water but when the infant nursed by watt and stephenson had grown into a giant both of these natural agents were deposed from the important position they once held windmills in a state of decay crown many of our hilltops and the waterwheel which formerly brought wealth to the miller now rots in its mountings at the end of the dam except for pumping and moving boats and ships windpower finds its occupation gone it is too uncertain in quantity and quality to find a place in modern economics waterpower on the other hand has received a fresh lease of life through the invention of machinery so scientifically designed as to use much more of the waters energy than was possible with the oldfashioned wheel illustration fig 187a pelton wheel which develops 5000 horsepower observe the shape of the double buckets the turbine of which we have already spoken in our third chapter is now the favourite hydraulic engine some waterturbines work on much the same principle as the parsons steamturbine others resemble the de laval among the latter the pelton wheel takes the first place by the courtesy of the manufacturers we are able to give some interesting details and illustrations of this device illustration fig 188pelton wheel mounted with nozzle in position the wheel which may be of any diameter from six inches to ten feet has buckets set at regular intervals round the circumference sticking outwards each bucket as will be gathered from our illustration of an enormous 5000 hp wheel fig 187 is composed of two cups a nozzle is so arranged as to direct water on the buckets just as they reach the lowest point of a revolution see fig 188 the water strikes the bucket on the partition between the two cups which turns it right and left round the inside of the cups the change of direction transfers the energy of the water to the wheel illustration fig 189speed regulator for pelton wheel the speed of the wheel may be automatically regulated by a deflecting nozzle fig 189 which has a ball and socket joint to permit of its being raised or lowered by a centrifugal governor thus throwing the stream on or off the buckets the power of the wheel is consequently increased or diminished to meet the change of load and a constant speed is maintained when it is necessary to waste as little water as possible a concentric tapered needle may be fitted inside the nozzle when the nozzle is in its highest position the needle tip is withdrawn as the nozzle sinks the needle protrudes gradually decreasing the discharge area of the nozzle pelton wheels are designed to run at all speeds and to use water of any pressure at manitou colorado is an installation of three wheels operated by water which leaves the nozzle at the enormous pressure of 935 lbs per square inch it is interesting to note that jets of very highpressure water offer astonishing resistance to any attempt to deflect their course a threeinch jet of 500lb water cannot be cut through by a blow from a crowbar in order to get sufficient pressure for working hydraulic machinery in mines factories etc water is often led for many miles in flumes or artificial channels along the sides of valleys from the source of supply to the point at which it is to be used by the time that point is reached the difference between the gradients of the flume and of the valley bottom has produced a difference in height of some hundreds of feet illustration fig 190the laxey waterwheel isle of man in the top righthand corner is a pelton wheel of proportionate size required to do the same amount of work with the same consumption of water at the same pressure the fullpage illustration on p 380 affords a striking testimony to the wonderful progress made in engineering practice during the last fifty years the huge waterwheel which forms the bulk of the picture is that at laxey in the isle of man it is 7212 feet in diameter and is supposed to develop 150 horsepower which is transmitted several hundreds of feet by means of wooden rods supported at regular intervals the power thus transmitted operates a system of pumps in a lead mine raising 250 gallons of water per minute to an elevation of 1200 feet the driving water is brought some distance to the wheel in an underground conduit and is carried up the masonry tower by pressure flowing over the top into the buckets on the circumference of the wheel the little cut in the upper corner represents a pelton wheel drawn on the same scale which given an equal supply of water at the same pressure would develop the same power as the laxey monster by the side of the giant the other appears a mere toy the cream separator in 1864 denmark went to war with germany and emerged from the short struggle shorn of the provinces of lauenburg holstein and schleswig the loss of the two last the fairest and most fertile districts of the kingdom was indeed grievous the danish king now ruled only over a land consisting largely of moor marsh and dunes apparently worthless for any purpose but the danes with admirable courage entered upon a second struggle this time with nature they made roads and railways dug irrigation ditches and planted forest trees and so gradually turned large tracts of what had been useless country into valuable possessions agriculture being much depressed owing to the low price of corn they next gave their attention to the improvement of dairy farming laboursaving machinery of all kinds was introduced none more important than the device for separating the fatty from the watery constituents of milk it would not be too much to say that the separator is largely responsible for the present prosperity of denmark illustration fig 191section of a cream separator how does it work asks the reader centrifugal force37 is the governing principle to explain its application we append a sectional illustration fig 191 of messrs burmeister and wains handpower separator which may be taken as generally representative of this class of machines inside a circular casing is a cylindrical bowl d mounted on a shaft which can be revolved 5000 times a minute by means of the cogwheels and the screw thread chased on it near the bottom extremity milk flows from the reservoir r supported on a stout arm through tap a into a little distributer on the top of the separator and from it drops into the central tube c of the bowl falling to the bottom it is flung outwards by centrifugal force finds an escape upwards through the holes

clothes by centrifugal force has a solid outer casing and an inner perforated cylindrical cage revolved at high speed by a vertical shaft the wet clothes are placed in the cage and the machine is started the water escapes through the perforations and runs down the side of the casing to a drain after a few minutes the clothes are dry enough for ironing so great is the centrifugal force that they are consolidated against the sides of the cage and care is needed in their removal 35 inventor of the lathe sliderest 36 living germs some varieties the cause of disease 37 that is centrefleeing

lighting the hotwater supplythe tank systemthe cylinder systemhow a lamp worksgas and gasworksautomatic stokinga gas governorthe gas meterincandescent gas lighting hotwater supply a wellequipped house is nowadays expected to contain efficient apparatus for supplying plenty of hot water at all hours of the day there is little romance about the kitchen boiler and the pipes which the plumber and his satellites have sometimes to inspect and put right but the methods of securing a proper circulation of hot water through the house are sufficiently important and interesting to be noticed in these pages in houses of moderate size the kitchen range does the heating the two systems of storing and distributing the heated water most commonly used are1 the tank system 2 the cylinder system the tank system is shown diagrammatically in fig 192 the boiler is situated at the back of the range and when a damper is drawn the fire and hot gases pass under it to a flue leading to the chimney the almost boiling water rises to the top of the boiler and thence finds its way up the flow pipe into the hotwater tank a displacing the somewhat colder water there which descends through the return pipe to the bottom of the boiler water is drawn off from the flow pipe this pipe projects some distance through the bottom of a so that the hottest portion of the contents may be drawn off first a tank situated in the roof and fed from the main by a ballcock valve communicates with a through the siphon pipe s the bend in this pipe prevents the ascent of hot water which cannot sink through water colder than itself from the top of a an expansion pipe is led up and turned over the coldwater tank to discharge any steam which may be generated in the boiler a hotwater radiator for warming the house may be connected to the flow and return pipes as shown since it opens a short circuit for the circulation the water in the tank above will not be so well heated while it is in action if cocks are fitted to the radiator pipes the amount of heat thus deflected can be governed illustration fig 192the tank system of hotwater supply a disadvantage of the tank system is that the tank if placed high enough to supply all flows is sometimes so far from the boiler that the water loses much of its heat in the course of circulation also if for any reason the cold water fails tank a may be entirely emptied circulation cease and the water in the boiler and pipes boil away rapidly the cylinder system fig 193 is open to neither of these objections instead of a rectangular tank up aloft we now have a large copper cylinder situated in the kitchen near the range the flow and return pipes are continuous and the cold supply enters the bottom of the cylinder through a pipe with a siphon bend in it as before water is drawn off from the flow pipe and a radiator may be put in the circuit since there is no drawoff point below the top of the cylinder even if the cold supply fails the cylinder will remain full and the failure will be discovered long before there is any danger of the water in it boiling away illustration fig 193the cylinder system of hotwater supply boiler explosions are due to obstructions in the pipes if the expansion pipe and the coldwater supply pipe freeze there is danger of a slight accumulation of steam and if one of the circulation pipes is also blocked steam must generate until something has to go38 which is naturally the boiler assuming that the pipes are quite full to the points of obstruction the fracture would result from the expansion of the water steam cannot generate unless there be a space above the water but the expanding water has stored up the heat which would have raised steam and the moment expansion begins after fracture this energy is suddenly let loose steam forms instantaneously augmenting the effects of the explosion from this it will be gathered that all pipes should be properly protected against frost especially near the roof another cause of disaster is the furring up of the pipes with the lime deposited by hard water when heated when hard water is used the pipes will sooner or later be blocked near the boiler and as the deposit is too hard to be scraped away periodical renewals are unavoidable how a lamp works from heating we turn to lighting and first to the ordinary paraffin lamp the two chief things to notice about this are the wick and the chimney the wick being made of closelywoven cotton draws up the oil by what is known as capillary attraction if you dip the ends of two glass tubes one half an inch the other oneeighth of an inch in diameter into a vessel of water you will notice that the water rises higher in the smaller tube or get two clean glass plates and lay them face to face touching at one end but kept slightly apart at the other by some small object if they are partly submerged perpendicularly the water will rise between the platesfurthest on the side at which the two plates touch and less and less as the other edge is approached the tendency of liquids to rise through porous bodies is a phenomenon for which we cannot account mineral oil contains a large proportion of carbon and hydrogen it is therefore termed hydrocarbon when oil reaches the top of a lighted wick the liquid is heated until it turns into gas the carbon and hydrogen unite with the oxygen of the air some particles of the carbon apparently do not combine at once and as they pass through the fiery zone of the flame are heated to such a temperature as to become highly luminous it is to produce these lightrays that we use a lamp and to burn our oil efficiently we must supply the flame with plenty of oxygen with more than it could naturally obtain so we surround it with a transparent chimney of special glass the air inside the chimney is heated and rises fresh air rushes in at the bottom and is also heated and replaced as the air passes through the flame seizes on the oxygen if the wick is turned up until the flame becomes smoky and flares the point has been passed at which the induced chimney draught can supply sufficient oxygen to combine with the carbon of the vapour and the free carbon escapes as smoke the blowerplate used to draw up a fire fig 194 performs exactly the same function as the lamp chimney but on a larger scale the plate prevents air passing straight up the chimney over the coals and compels it to find a way through the fire itself to replace the heated air rising up the chimney illustration fig 194showing how a blowerplate draws up the fire gas and gasworks a lamp is an apparatus for converting hydrocarbon mineral oil into gas and burning it efficiently the gasjet burns gases produced by driving off hydrocarbon vapours from coal in apparatus specially designed for the purpose gasmaking is now in spite of the competition of electric lighting so important an industry that we shall do well to glance at the processes which it includes coal gas may be produced on a very small scale as followsfill a tin canister the joints of which have been made by folding the metal not by soldering with coal clap on the lid and place it lid downwards in a bright fire after punching a hole in the bottom vapour soon begins to issue from the hole this is probably at first only steam due to the coal being more or less damp but if a lighted match be presently applied the vapour takes fire showing that coal gas proper is coming off the flame lasts for a long time when it dies the canister may be removed and the contents examined most of the carbon remains in the form of coke it is bulk for bulk much lighter than coal for the hydrogen oxygen and other gases and some of the carbon have been driven off by the heat the coke itself burns if placed in a fire but without any smoke such as issues from coal illustration fig 195sketch of the apparatus used in the manufacture of coal gas our homemade gas yields a smoky and unsatisfactory flame owing to the presence of certain impuritiesammonia tar sulphuretted hydrogen and carbon bisulphide a gas factory must be equipped with means of getting rid of these objectionable constituents turning to fig 195 which displays very diagrammatically the main features of a gas plant we observe at the extreme right the retorts which correspond to our canister these are usually long firebrick tubes of dsection the flat side at the bottom under each is a furnace the flames of which play on the bottom sides and inner end of the retort the outer end projecting beyond the brickwork seating has an iron airtight door for filling the retort through immediately behind which rises an iron exit pipe a for the gases tar which vaporizes at high temperatures but liquefies at ordinary atmospheric heat must first be got rid of this is effected by passing the gas through the hydraulic main a tubular vessel half full of water running the whole length of the retorts the end of pipe a dips below the surface of the water which condenses most of the tar and steam the partlypurified gas now passes through pipe b to the condensers a series of inverted upipes standing on an iron chest with vertical cross divisions between the mouths of each u these divisions dip into water so that the gas has to pass up one leg of a u down the other up the first leg of the second pipe and so on till all traces of the tar and other liquid constituents have condensed on the inside of the pipe from which they drop into the tank below the next stage is the passage of the scrubber filled with coke over which water perpetually flows the ammonia gas is here absorbed there still remain the sulphuretted hydrogen and the carbon bisulphide both of which are extremely offensive to the nostrils slaked lime laid on trays in an airtight compartment called the lime purifier absorbs most of the sulphurous elements of these and the coal gas is then fit for use on leaving the purifiers it flows into the gasometer or gasholder the huge cakelike form of which is a very familiar object in the environs of towns the gasometer is a cylindrical box with a domed top but no bottom built of riveted steel plates it stands in a circular tank of water so that it may rise and fall without any escape of gas the levity of the gas in conjunction with weights attached to the ends of chains working over pulleys on the framework surrounding the holder suffices to raise the holder illustration fig 196the largest gasholder in the world south metropolitan gas co greenwich gas works capacity 12158600 cubic feet some gasometers have an enormous

diameter and 180 feet high when fully extended it holds 12158600 cubic feet of gas owing to its immense size it is built on the telescopic principle in six lifts of 30 feet deep each the sides of each lift or ring except the topmost have a section shaped somewhat like the letter n two of the members form a deep narrow cup to hold water in which the dip member of the ring above it rises and falls

very fine photograph taken by mr f marsh of clifton we see a man engaged in drawing the retorts through the iron doors at their outer ends automatic machinery is now used in large gasworks for both operations one of the most ingenious stokers is the de brouwer shown at work in fig 198 the machine is suspended from an overhead trolley running on rails along the face of the retorts coal falls into a funnel at the top of the telescopic pipe p from hoppers in the story above which have openings h h controlled by shutters the coal as it falls is caught by a rubber belt working round part of the circumference of the large wheel w and a number of pulleys and is shot into the mouth of the retort the operator is seen pulling the handle which opens the shutter of the hopper above the feedtube and switching on the 4 hp electric motor which drives the belt and moves the machine about one of these feeders will charge a retort 20 feet long in twentytwo seconds illustration fig 198de brouwer automatic retort charger a gas governor some readers may have noticed that late at night a gasjet which a few hours before burned with a somewhat feeble flame when the tap was turned fully on now becomes more and more vigorous and finally may flare up with a hissing sound this is because many of the burners fed by the main supplying the house have been turned off and consequently there is a greater amount of gas available for the jets still burning which therefore feel an increased pressure as a matter of fact the pressure of gas in the main is constantly varying owing partly to the irregularity of the delivery from the gasometer and partly to the fact that the number of burners in action is not the same for many minutes together it must also be remembered that houses near the gasometer end of the main will receive their gas at a higher pressure than those at the other end the gas stored in the holders may be wanted for use in the street lamps a few yards away or for other lamps several miles distant it is therefore evident that if there be just enough pressure to give a good supply to the nearest lamp there will be too little a short distance beyond it and none at all at the extreme point so that it is necessary to put on enough pressure to overcome the friction on all these miles of pipe and give just enough gas at the extreme end it follows that at all intermediate points the pressure is excessive gas of the average quality is burned to the greatest advantage as regards its lightgiving properties when its pressure is equal to that of a column of water half an inch high or about 150 lb to the square inch with less it gives a smoky flickering light and with more the combustion is also imperfect illustration fig 199 every house supply should therefore be fitted with a gas governor to keep the pressure constant a governor frequently used the stott is shown in section in fig 199 gas enters from the main on the right and passes into a circular elbow d which has top and bottom apertures closed by the valves v v attached to the valve shaft is a large inverted cup of metal the tip of which is immersed in mercury the pressure at which the governor is to act is determined by the weights w with which the valve spindle is loaded at the top as soon as this pressure is exceeded the gas in c c lifts the metal cup and v v are pressed against their seats so cutting off the supply gas cannot escape from c c as it has not sufficient pressure to force its way through the mercury under the lip of the cup immediately the pressure in c c falls owing to some of the gas being used up the valves open and admit more gas when the fluctuations of pressure are slight the valves never close completely but merely throttle the supply until the pressure beyond them falls to its proper levelthat is they pass just as much gas as the burners in use can consume at the pressure arranged for governors of much larger size but working on much the same principle are fitted to the mains at the point where they leave the gasometers they are not however sensitive to local fluctuations in the pipes hence the necessity for separate governors in the house between the meter and the burners the gasmeter commonly used in houses acts on the principle shown in fig 200 the airtight casing is divided by horizontal and vertical divisions into three gaschambers b c and d gas enters at a and passes to the valve chamber b the slidevalves of this allow it to pass into c and d and also into the two circular leather bellows e f which are attached to the central division g but are quite independent of one another illustration fig 200sketch of the bellows and chambers of a dry gas meter we will suppose that in the illustration the valves are admitting gas to chamber c and bellows f the pressure in c presses the circular head of e towards the division g expelling the contents of the bellows through an outlet pipe not shown to the burners in operation within the house simultaneously the inflation of f forces the gas in chamber d also through the outlet the headplates of the bellows are attached to rods and levers not shown working the slidevalves in b as soon as e is fully in and f fully expanded the valves begin to open and put the inlet pipe in communication with d and e and allow the contents of f and c to escape to the outlet the movements of the valve mechanism operate a train of counting wheels visible through a glass window in the side of the case as the bellows have a definite capacity every stroke that they give means that a certain volume of gas has been ejected either from them or from the chambers in which they move this is registered by the counter the apparatus practically has two doubleaction cylinders of which the bellows ends are the pistons working on the same principle as the steamcylinder fig 21 the valves have three portsthe central or exhaust leading to the outlet the outer ones from the inlet the bellows are fed through channels in the division g incandescent gas lighting the introduction of the electric arc lamp and the incandescent glowlamp seemed at one time to spell the doom of gas as an illuminating agent but the appearance in 1886 of the welsbach incandescent mantle for gasburners opened a prosperous era in the history of gas lighting the luminosity of a gas flame depends on the number of carbon particles liberated within it and the temperature to which these particles can be heated as they pass through the intensely hot outside zone of the flame by enriching the gas in carbon more light is yielded up to a certain point with a flame of a given temperature to increase the heat of the flame various devices were tried before the introduction of the incandescent mantle but they were found to be too shortlived to have any commercial value inventors therefore sought for methods by which the emission of light could be obtained from coal gas independently of the incandescence of the carbon particles in the flame itself and step by step it was discovered that gas could be better employed merely as a heating agent to raise to incandescence substances having a higher emissivity of light than carbon dr auer von welsbach found that the substances most suitable for incandescent mantles were the oxides of certain rare metals thorium and cerium the mantle is made by dipping a cylinder of cotton net into a solution of nitrate of thorium and cerium containing 99 per cent of the former and 1 per cent of the latter metal when the fibres are sufficiently soaked the mantle is withdrawn squeezed and placed on a mould to dry it is next held over a bunsen gas flame and the cotton is burned away while the nitrates are converted into oxides the mantle is now ready for use but very brittle so it has to undergo a further dipping in a solution of guncotton and alcohol to render it tough enough for packing when it is required for use it is suspended over the burner by an asbestos thread woven across the top a light is applied to the bottom and the collodion burned off leaving nothing but the heatresisting oxides the burner used with a mantle is constructed on the bunsen principle the gas is mixed as it emerges from the jet with sufficient air to render its combustion perfect all the carbon is burned and the flame though almost invisible is intensely hot the mantle oxides convert the heat energy of the flame into light energy this is proved not only by the intense whiteness of the mantle but by the fact that the heat issuing from the chimney of the burner is not nearly so great when the mantle is in position as when it is absent the incandescent mantle is more extensively used every year in germany 90 per cent of gas lighting is on the incandescent system and in england about 40 per cent we may notice as an interesting example of the fluctuating fortunes of invention that the once doomed gasburner has thanks to welsbachs mantle in many instances replaced the incandescent electric lamps that were to doom it 38 if of course there is no safetyvalve in proper working order included in the installation chapter xx various

oldest device for measuring time is the sundial that of ahaz mentioned in the second book of kings is the earliest dial of which we have record the obelisks of the egyptians and the curious stone pillars of the druidic age also probably served as shadowcasters the clepsydra or waterclock also of great antiquity was the first contrivance for gauging the passage of the hours independently of the motion of the earth in its simplest form it was a measure into which water fell drop by drop hour levels being marked on the inside subsequently a very simple mechanism was added to drive a pointera float carrying a vertical rack engaging with a cog on the pointer spindle or a string from the float passed over a pulley attached to the pointer and rotated it as the float rose after the manner of the wheel barometer fig 153 in 807 ad charlemagne received from the king of persia a waterclock which struck the hours it is thus described in giffords history of francethe dial was composed of twelve small doors which represented the division of the hours each door opened at the hour it was intended to represent and out of it came a small number of little balls which fell one by one at equal distances of time on a brass drum it might be told by the eye what hour it was by the number of doors that were open and by the ear by the number of balls that fell when it was twelve oclock twelve horsemen in miniature issued forth at the same time and shut all the doors sandglasses were introduced about 330 ad except for special purposes such as timing sermons and boiling eggs they have not been of any practical value the clepsydra naturally suggested to the mechanical mind the idea of driving a mechanism for registering time by the force of gravity acting on some body other than water the invention of the weightdriven clock is attributed like a good many other things to archimedes the famous sicilian mathematician of the third century bc but no record exists of any actual clock composed of wheels operated by a weight prior to 1120 ad so we may take that year as opening the era of the clock as we know it about 1500 peter hele of nuremberg invented the mainspring as a substitute for the weight and the watch appeared soon afterwards 1525 ad the pendulum was first adopted for controlling the motion of the wheels by christian huygens a distinguished dutch mechanician in 1659 to thomas tompion the father of english watchmaking is ascribed the honour of first fitting a hairspring to the escapement of a watch in or about the year 1660 he also introduced the cylinder escapement now so commonly used in cheap watches though many improvements have been made since his time tompion manufactured clocks and watches which were excellent timekeepers and as a reward for the benefits conferred on his fellows during his lifetime he was after death granted the exceptional honour of a restingplace in westminster abbey the construction of timepieces a clock or watch contains three main elements1 the source of power which may be a weight or a spring 2 the train of wheels operated by the driving force 3 the agent for controlling the movements of the trainthis in large clocks is usually a pendulum in small clocks and watches a hairspring balance to these may be added in the case of clocks the apparatus for striking the hour the driving power weights are used only in large clocks such as one finds in halls towers and observatories the great advantage of employing weights is that a constant driving power is exerted springs occupy much less room than weights and are indispensable for portable timepieces the employment of them caused trouble to early experimenters on account of the decrease in power which necessarily accompanies the uncoiling of a woundup spring jacob zech of prague overcame the difficulty in 1525 by the invention of the fusee a kind of conical pulley interposed between the barrel or circular drum containing the mainspring and the train of wheels which the spring has to drive the principle of the drum and fusee action will be understood from fig 201 the mainspring is a long steel ribbon fixed at one end to an arbor the watchmakers name for a spindle or axle round which it is tightly wound the arbor and spring are inserted in the barrel the arbor is prevented from turning by a ratchet b and click and therefore the spring in its effort to uncoil causes the barrel to rotate illustration fig 201 a string of catgut or a very fine chain is connected at one end to the circumference of the drum and wound round it the other end being fixed to the larger end of the fusee which is attached to the drivingwheel of the watch or clock by the intervention of a ratchet and click not shown to wind the spring the fusee is turned backward by means of a key applied to the square end a of the fusee arbor and this draws the string from off the drum on to the fusee the force of the spring causes the fusee to rotate by pulling the string off it coil by coil and so drives the train of wheels but while the mainspring when fully wound turns the fusee by uncoiling the string from the smallest part of the fusee it gets the advantage of the larger radius as its energy becomes lessened the fusee is still used for marine chronometers for some clocks that have a mainspring and pendulum and occasionally for watches in the latter it has been rendered unnecessary by the introduction of the goingbarrel by swiss watchmakers who formed teeth on the edge of the mainspring barrel to drive the train of wheels this kind of drum is called going because it drives the watch during the operation of winding which is performed by rotating the drum arbor to which the inner end of the spring is attached a ratchet prevents the arbor from being turned backwards by the spring the adoption of the goingbarrel has been made satisfactory by the improvements in the various escapement actions the escapement illustration fig 202 the spring or weight transmits its power through a train of cogs to the escapement or device for regulating the rate at which the wheels are to revolve in clocks a pendulum is generally used as the controlling agent galileo when a student at pisa noticed that certain hanging lamps in the cathedral there swung on their cords at an equal rate and on investigation he discovered the principle that the shorter a pendulum is the more quickly will it swing to and fro as has already been observed huygens first applied the principle to the governing of clocks in fig 202 we have a simple representation of the deadbeat escapement commonly used in clocks the escapewheel is mounted on the shaft of the last cog of the driving train the pallet on a spindle from which depends a split arm embracing the rod and the pendulum we must be careful to note that the pendulum controls motion only it does not cause movement the escapewheel revolves in a clockwise direction the two pallets a and b are so designed that only one can rest on the teeth at one time in the sketch the sloping end of b has just been forced upwards by the pressure of a tooth this swings the pallet and the pendulum the momentum of the latter causes a to descend and at the instant when b clears its tooth a catches and holds another the lefthand side of a called the lockingface is part of a circle so that the escapewheel is held motionless as long as it touches a hence the term dead beatthat is brought to a dead stop as the pendulum swings back to the left under the influence of gravity a is raised and frees the tooth the wheel jerks round and another tooth is caught by the lockingface of b again the pendulum swings to the right and the sloping end of b is pushed up once more giving the pendulum fresh impetus this process repeats itself as long as the driving power lastsfor weeks months or years as the case may be and the mechanism continues to be in good working order compensating pendulums metal expands when heated therefore a steel pendulum which is of the exact length to govern a clock correctly at a temperature of 60 would become too long at 80 and slow the clock and too short at 40 and cause it to gain in common clocks the pendulum rod is often made of wood which maintains an almost constant length at all ordinary temperatures but for very accurate clocks something more efficient is required graham the partner of thomas tompion took advantage of the fact that different kinds of metal have different ratios of expansion to produce a selfcompensating pendulum on the principle illustrated by fig 203 he used steel for the rod and formed the bob or weighted end of a glass jar containing mercury held in a stirrup the mercury being of such a height that as the pendulum rod lengthened with a rise of temperature the mercury expanded upwards sufficiently to keep the distance between the point of suspension and the centre of gravity of the bob always the same with a fall of temperature the rod shortened while the mercury sank in the jar this device has not been improved upon and is still used in observatories and other places where timekeepers of extreme precision are required the milled nut s in fig 203 is fitted at the end of the pendulum rod to permit the exact adjustment of the pendulums length for watches chronometers and small clocks the spring balance takes the place of the pendulum we still have an escapewheel with teeth of a suitable shape to give impulses to the controlling agent there are two forms of spring escapement but as both employ a hairspring and balancewheel we will glance at these before going further illustration fig 203 the hairspring is made of very fine steel ribbon tempered to extreme elasticity and shaped to a spiral the inner end is attached to the arbor of the balancewheel the outer end to a stud projecting from the plate of the watch when the balancewheel impelled by the escapement rotates it winds up the spring the energy thus stored helps the wheel to revolve the other way during the locking of a tooth of the escapewheel the time occupied by the winding and the unwinding depends upon the length of the spring the strength of the impulse makes no difference a strong impulse causes the spring to coil itself up more than a weak impulse would but inasmuch as more energy is stored the process of unwinding is hastened to put the matter very simplya strong impulse moves the balancewheel further but rotates it quickly a weak impulse moves it a shorter distance but rotates it slowly in fact the principle of the pendulum is also that of the hairspring and the duration of a vibration depends on the length of the rod in the one case and of the spring in the other motion is transmitted to the balance by one of two methods either 1 directly by a cylinder escapement or 2 indirectly through a lever illustration fig 204cylinder watch escapement the cylinder escapement is seen in fig 204 the escapewheel has sharp teeth set on stalks one tooth is removed to show the stalk the balancewheel is mounted on a small steel cylinder with part of the circumference cut away at the level of the teeth so that if seen from above it would appear like a in our illustration a tooth is just beginning to shove its point under the nearer edge of the opening as it is forced forwards b is revolved in a clockwise direction winding up the hairspring when the tooth has passed the nearer edge it flies forward striking the inside of the further wall of the cylinder which holds it while the spring uncoils the tooth now pushes its way past the other edge accelerating the unwinding and as it escapes the next tooth jumps forward and is arrested by the outside of the cylinder the balance now reverses its motion is helped by the tooth is wound up locks the tooth and so on the lever escapement is somewhat more complicated the escapewheel teeth are locked and unlocked by the pallets p p1 projecting from a lever which moves on a pivot fig 205 the end of the lever is forked and has a square notch in it on the arbor of the balancewheel is a roller or plate r which carries a small pin i two pins b b projecting from the plate of the watch prevent the lever moving too far we must further notice the little pin c on the lever and a notch in the edge of the roller illustration fig 205lever watch escapement in the illustration a tooth has just passed under the impulse face b of p1 the lever has been moved upwards at the right end and its forked end has given an impulse to r and through it to the balancewheel the spring winds up the pin c prevents the lever dropping because it no longer has the notch opposite to it but presses on the circumference of r as the spring unwinds it strikes the lever at the moment when the notch and c are opposite the lever is knocked downwards and the tooth which had been arrested by the lockingface a of pallet p now presses on the impulse face b forcing the left end of the lever up the impulse pin i receives a blow assisting the unwinding of the spring and c again locks the lever the same thing is repeated in alternate directions over and over again compensating balancewheels the watchmaker has had to overcome the same difficulty as the clockmaker with regard to the expansion of the metal in the controlling agent when a metal wheel is heated its spokes lengthen and the rim recedes from the centre now let us suppose that we have two rods of equal weight one three feet long the other six feet long to an end of each we fasten a 2lb weight we shall find it much easier to wave the shorter rod backwards and forwards quickly than the other why because the weight of the longer rod has more leverage over the hand than has that of the shorter rod similarly if while the mass of the rim of a wheel remains constant the length of the spokes varies the effort needed to rotate the wheel to and fro at a constant rate must vary also graham got over the difficulty with a rod by means of the compensating pendulum thomas earnshaw mastered it in wheels by means of the compensating balance using the same principlenamely the unequal expansion of different metals any one who owns a compensated watch will see on stopping the tiny flywheel that it has two spokes fig 206 each carrying an almost complete semicircle of rim attached to it a close examination shows that the rim is compounded of an outer strip of brass welded to an inner lining of steel the brass element expands more with heat and contracts more with cold than steel so that when the spokes become elongated by a rise of temperature the pieces bend inwards at their free ends fig 207 if the temperature falls the spokes are shortened and the rim pieces bend outwards fig 20839 this ingenious contrivance keeps the leverage of the rim constant within very fine limits the screws s s are inserted in the rim to balance it correctly and very fine adjustment is made by means of the four tiny weights w w in ships chronometers40 the rim pieces are subcompensated towards their free ends to counteract slight errors in the primary compensation so delicate is the compensation that a daily loss or gain of only half a second is often the limit of error illustration fig 206 fig 207 fig 208 a compensating watch balance at normal supernormal and subnormal temperatures keyless winding mechanism for watches the inconvenience attaching to a keywound watch caused the swiss manufacturers to put on the market in 1851 watches which dispensed with a separate key those of our readers who carry keyless watches will be interested to learn how the winding and setting of the hands is effected by the little serrated knob enclosed inside the pendant ring there are two forms of goingbarrel keyless mechanism1 the rocking bar 2 the shifting sleeve the rocking bar device is shown in figs 209 210 the milled head m turns a cog g which is always in gear with a cog f this cog gears with two others a and b mounted at each end of the rocker r which moves on pivot s a spring s p attached to the watch plate presses against a small stud on the rocking bar and keeps a normally in gear with c mounted on the arbor of the mainspring illustration fig 209the winding mechanism of a keyless watch to wind the watch m is turned so as to give f an anticlockwise motion the teeth of f now press a downwards and keep it in gear with c while the winding is done a spring click marked solid black prevents the spring uncoiling fig 209 if f is turned in a clockwise direction it lifts a and prevents it biting the teeth of c and no strain is thrown on c to set the hands the little pushpiece p is pressed inwards by the thumb fig 210 so as to depress the righthand end of r and bring b into gear with d which in turn moves e mounted on the end of the minutehand shaft the hands can now be moved in either direction by turning m on releasing the pushpiece the windingwheels engage again the shifting sleeve mechanism has a bevel pinion in the place of g fig 209 gearing with the mainspring cog the shaft of the knob m is round where it passes through the bevel and can turn freely inside it but is square below on the square part is mounted a little sliding clutch with teeth on the top corresponding with the other teeth on the under side of the bevelwheel and teeth similar to those of g fig 209 at the end the clutch has a groove cut in the circumference and in this lies the end of a spring lever which can be depressed by the pushpiece the mechanism much resembles on a small scale the motor car changing gear fig 49 normally the clutch is pushed up the square part of the knob shaft by the spring so as to engage with the bevel and the windingwheels on depressing the clutch by means of the pushpiece it gears with the minutehand pinion and lets go of the bevel illustration fig 210the handsetting mechanism in action in one form of this mechanism the pushpiece is dispensed with and the minutewheel pinion is engaged by pulling the knob upwards the hourhand train illustration fig 211the hourhand train of a clock the teeth of the mainspring drum gear with a cog on the minutehand shaft which also carries one of the cogs of the escapement train the shaft is permitted by the escapement to revolve once an hour fig 211 shows diagrammatically how this is managed the hourhand shaft a solid black can be moved round inside the cog b driven by the mainspring drum it carries a cog c this gears with a cog d having three times as many teeth the cog e united to d drives cog f having four times as many teeth as e to f is attached the collar g of the hourhand f and g revolve outside the minutehand shaft on turning a c turns d and e e turns f and the hourhand which revolves 13 of 14 112 as fast as a41 locks on these unfortunately necessary mechanisms a great deal of ingenuity has been expended with the advance of luxury and the increased worship of wealth it becomes more and more necessary to guard ones belongings against the less scrupulous members of society illustration fig 212 the simplest form of lock such as is found in desks and very cheap articles works on the principle shown in fig 212 the bolt is split at the rear and the upper part bent upwards to form a spring the under edge has two notches cut in it separated by a curved excrescence the key merely presses the bolt upwards against the spring until the notch engaging with the frame moves it backwards or forwards until the spring drives the tail down into the other notch this primitive device affords of course very little security an advance is seen in the tumbler lock illustration fig 213 the bolt now can move only in a horizontal direction it has an opening cut in it with two notches figs 213 214 behind the bolt lies the tumbler t indicated by the dotted line pivoted at the angle on a pin from the face of the tumbler a stud s projects through the hole in the bolt this stud is forced into one or other of the notches by the spring s1 which presses on the tail of the tumbler illustration fig 214 in fig 213 the key is about to actuate the locking mechanism the next diagram fig 214 shows how the key as it enters the notch on the lower side of the bolt to move it along also raises the tumbler stud clear of the projection between the two notches by the time that the bolt has been fully shot the key leaves the under notch and allows the tumbler stud to fall into the rear lockingnotch a lock of this type also can be picked very easily as the picker has merely to lift the tumbler and move the bolt along barrons lock patented in 1778 had two tumblers and two studs and the opening in the bolt had notches at the top as well as at the bottom fig 215 this made it necessary for both tumblers to be raised simultaneously to exactly the right height if either was not lifted sufficiently a stud could not clear its bottom notch if either rose too far it engaged an upper notch the chances therefore were greatly against a wrong key turning the lock illustration fig 215the bolt of a barron lock the chubb lock is an amplification of this principle it usually has several tumblers of the shape shown in fig 216 the lock stud in these locks projects from the bolt itself and the openings or gates through which the stud must pass as the lock moves are cut in the tumblers it will be noticed that the forward notch of the tumbler has square serrations in the edges these engage with similar serrations in the bolt stud and make it impossible to raise the tumbler if the bolt begins to move too soon when a wrong key is inserted illustration fig 216tumbler of chubb lock fig 217 is a chubb key with eight steps that nearest the head 8 operates a circular revolving curtain which prevents the introduction of picking tools when a key is inserted and partly turned as the key slot in the curtain is no longer opposite that in the lock step 1 moves the bolt illustration fig 217a chubb key in order to shoot the bolt the height of the key steps must be so proportioned to the depth of their tumblers that all the gates in the tumblers are simultaneously raised to the right level for the stud to pass through them as in fig 218 here you will observe that the tumbler d on the extreme right lifted by step 2 of the key has a stud d s projecting from it over the other tumblers this is called the detector tumbler if a false key or picking tool is inserted it is certain to raise one of the tumblers too far the detector is then overlifted by the stud d s and a spring catch falls into a notch at the rear it is now impossible to pick the lock as the detector can be released only by the right key shooting the bolt a little further in the locking direction when a projection on the rear of the bolt lifts the catch and allows the tumbler to fall the detector also shows that the lock has been tampered with since even the right key cannot move the bolt until the overlocking has been performed illustration fig 218a chubb key raising all the tumblers to the correct height each tumbler step of a large chubb key can be given one of thirty different heights the bolt step one of twenty by merely transposing the order of the steps in a sixstep key it is possible to get 720 different combinations by diminishing or increasing the heights the possible combinations may be raised to the enormous total of 7776000 illustration fig 219section of a yale lock the yale lock which comes from america works on a quite different system its most noticeable feature is that it permits the use of a very small key though the number of combinations possible is still enormous several millions in our illustrations figs 219 220 221 we show the mechanism controlling the turning of the key the keyhole is a narrow twisted slot in the face of a cylinder g fig 219 which revolves inside a larger fixed cylinder f as the key is pushed in the notches in its upper edge raise up the pins a1 b1 c1 d1 e1 until their tops exactly reach the surface of g which can now be revolved by the key in fig 220 and work the bolt through the medium of the arm h the bolt itself is not shown if a wrong key is inserted either some of the lower pins will project upwards into the fixed cylinder f see fig 221 or some of the pins in f will sink into g it is then impossible to turn the key illustration fig 220yale key turning there are other wellknown locks such as those invented by bramah and hobbs but as these do not lend themselves readily to illustration no detailed account can be given we might however notice the time lock which is set to a certain hour and can be opened by the right key or a number of keys in combination only when that hour is reached another very interesting device is the automatic combination lock this may have twenty or more keys any one of which can lock it but the same one must be used to unlock it as the key automatically sets the mechanism in favour of itself with such a lock it would be possible to have a different key for every day in the month and if any one key got into wrong hands it would be useless unless it happened to be the one which last locked the lock illustration fig 221the wrong key inserted the pins do not allow the lock to be turned the cycle there are a few features of this useful and in some ways wonderful contrivance which should be noticed first the gearing of a cycle to a good many people the expression geared to 70 inches or 65 or 80 as the case may be conveys nothing except the fact that the higher the gear the faster one ought to be able to travel let us therefore examine the meaning of such a phrase before going farther the safety cycle is always geared upthat is one turn of the pedals will turn the rear wheel more than once to get the exact ratio of turning speed we count the teeth on the big chainwheel and the teeth on the small chainwheel attached to the hub of the rear wheel and divide the former by the latter to take an examplethe teeth are 75 and 30 in number respectively the ratio of speed therefore 7530 52 212 one turn of the pedal turns the rear wheel 212 times the gear of the cycle is calculated by multiplying this result by the diameter of the rear wheel in inches thus a 28inch wheel would in this case give a gear of 212 28 70 inches one turn of the pedals on a machine of this gear would propel the rider as far as if he were on a high ordinary with the pedals attached directly to a wheel 70 inches in diameter the gearing is raised or lowered by altering the number ratio of the teeth on the two chainwheels if for the 30tooth wheel we substituted one of 25 teeth the gearing would be 7525 28 inches 84 inches a handy formula to remember is gearing tt d where t teeth on large chainwheel t teeth on small chainwheel and d diameter of drivingwheel in inches two of the most important improvements recently added to the cycle are1 the free wheel 2 the changespeed gear the free wheel is a device for enabling the drivingwheel to overrun the pedals when the rider ceases pedalling it renders the drivingwheel free of the driving gear it is a ratchet specially suited for this kind of work from among the many patterns now marketed we select the micrometer freewheel hub fig 222 which is extremely simple the ratchetwheel r is attached to the hub of the drivingwheel the small chainwheel or chainring as it is often called turns outside this on a number of balls running in a groove chased in the neck of the ratchet between these two parts are the pawls of halfmoon shape the drivingwheel is assumed to be on the further side of the ratchet to propel the cycle the chainring is turned in a clockwise direction three out of the six pawls at once engage with notches in the ratchet and are held tightly in place by the pressure of the chainring on their rear ends the other three are in a midway position illustration fig 222 when the rider ceases to pedal the chainring becomes stationary but the ratchet continues to revolve the pawls offer no resistance to the ratchet teeth which push them up into the semicircular recesses in the chainring each one rises as it passes over a tooth it is obvious that driving power cannot be transmitted again to the road wheel until the chainwheel is turned fast enough to overtake the ratchet the changespeed gear a gain in speed means a loss in power and vice vers by gearingup a cycle we are able to make the drivingwheel revolve faster than the pedals but at the expense of control over the drivingwheel a highgeared cycle is fast on the level but a bad hillclimber the lowgeared machine shows to disadvantage on the flat but is a good hillclimber similarly the express engine must have large drivingwheels the goods engine small drivingwheels to perform their special functions properly in order to travel fast over level country and yet be able to mount hills without undue exertion we must be able to do what the motorist doeschange gear twospeed and threespeed gears are now very commonly fitted to cycles they all work on the same principle that of the epicyclic train of cogwheels the mechanisms being so devised that the hub turns more slowly than at the same speed as or faster than the small chainwheel42 according to the wish of the rider we do not propose to do more here than explain the principle of the epicyclic train which means a wheel on or running round a wheel lay a footrule on the table and roll a cylinder along it by the aid of a second rule parallel to the first but resting on the cylinder it will be found that while the cylinder advances six inches the upper rule advances twice that distance in the absence of friction the work done by the agent moving the upper rule is equal to that done in overcoming the force which opposes the forward motion of the cylinder and as the distance through which the cylinder advances is only half that through which the upper rule advances it follows that the force which must act on the upper rule is only half as great as that overcome in moving the cylinder the carter makes use of this principle when he puts his hand to the top of a wheel to help his cart over an obstacle illustration fig 223 illustration fig 224 illustration fig 225 now see how this principle is applied to the changespeed gear the lower rule is replaced by a cogwheel c fig 223 the cylinder by a cog b running round it and the upper rule by a ring a with internal teeth we may suppose that a is the chainring b a cog mounted on a pin projecting from the hub and c a cog attached to the fixed axle it is evident that b will not move so fast round c as a does the amount by which a will get ahead of b can be calculated easily we begin with the wheels in the position shown in fig 223 a point i on a is exactly over the topmost point of c for the sake of convenience we will first assume that instead of b running round c b is revolved on its axis for one complete revolution in a clockwise direction and that a and c move as in fig 224 if b has 10 teeth c 30 and a 40 a will have been moved 1040 14 of a revolution in a clockwise direction and c 1030 13 of a revolution in an anticlockwise direction now coming back to what actually does happen we shall be able to understand how far a rotates round c relatively to the motion of b when c is fixed and b rolls fig 225 b advances 13 of distance round c a advances 13 14 712 of distance round b the fractions if reduced to a common denominator are as 47 and this is equivalent to 40 number of teeth on a 40 30 teeth on a teeth on c to leave the reader with a very clear idea we will summarize the matter thusif t number of teeth on a t number of teeth on c then movement of a movement of b t t t here is a twospeed hub let us count the teeth the chainring a has 64 internal teeth and the central cog c on the axle has 16 teeth there are four cogs b equally spaced running on pins projecting from the hubshell between a and c how much faster than b does a run round c apply the formulamotion of a motion of b 64 16 64 that is while a revolves once b and the hub and the drivingwheel will revolve only 6480 45 of a turn to use scientific language b revolves 20 per cent slower than a this is the gearing we use for hillclimbing on the level we want the drivingwheel to turn as fast as or faster than the chainring to make it turn at the same rate both a and c must revolve together in one wellknown gear this is effected by sliding c along the spindle of the wheel till it disengages itself from the spindle and one end locks with the plate which carries a since b is now being pulled round at the bottom as well as the top it cannot rotate on its own axis any longer and the whole train revolves solidlythat is while a turns through a circle b does the same to get an increase of gearing matters must be so arranged that the drive is transmitted from the chainwheel to b and from a to the hub while b describes a circle a and the drivingwheel turn through a circle and a part of a circlethat is the drivingwheel revolves faster than the hub given the same number of teeth as before the proportional rates will be a 80 b 64 so that the gear rises 25 per cent by means of proper mechanism the power is transmitted in a threespeed gear either 1 from chainwheel to a a to b b to wheel low gear or 2 from chainwheel to a and c simultaneously solid normal or middle gear or 3 from chainwheel to b b to a a to wheel high gear in twospeed gears either 1 or 3 is omitted agricultural machines the threshingmachine bread would not be so cheap as it is were the flail still the only means of separating the grain from the straw what the cream separator has done for the dairy industry p 384 the threshingmachine has done for agriculture a page or two ought therefore to be spared for this useful invention illustration fig 226section of a threshing machine in fig 226 a very complete foreandaft section of the machine is given after the bands of the sheaves have been cut the latter are fed into the mouth of the drum a by the feeder who stands in the feedingbox on the top of the machine the drum revolves at a very high velocity and is fitted with fluted beaters which act against a steel concave or breastwork b the grain being threshed out of the straw in passing between the two the breastwork is provided with open wires through which most of the threshed grain cavings short straws and chaff passes on to a sloping board the straw is flung forward on to the shakers c which gradually move the straw towards the open end and throw it off any grain etc that has escaped the drum falls through the shakers on to d and works backwards to the caving riddles or moving sieves e the main blower by means of a revolving fan n sends air along the channel x upwards through these riddles blowing the short straws away to the left the grain husks and dust fall through e on to g over the end of which they fall on to the chaff riddle h a second column of air from the blower drives the chaff away the heavy grain seeds dust etc fall on to i j and k in turn and are shaken until only the grain remains to pass along l to the elevator bottom m an endless band with cups attached to it scoops up the grain carries it aloft and shoots it into hopper p it then goes through the shakers q r is dusted by the back end blower s and slides down t into the open end of the rotary screendrum u which is mounted on the slope so that as it turns the grain travels gradually along it the first half of the screen has wires set closely together all the small grain that falls through this called thirds passes into a hopper and is collected in a sack attached to the hopper mouth the seconds fall through the second half of the drum more widely spaced into their sack and the firsts fall out of the end and through a third spout mowingmachines illustration fig 227 the ordinary lawnmower employs a revolving reel built up of spirallyarranged knives the edges of which pass very close to a sharp plate projecting from the frame of the mower each blade as it turns works along the plate giving a shearing cut to any grass that may be caught between the two cutting edges the action is that of a pair of scissors fig 227 one blade representing the fixed the other the moving knife if you place a cylinder of wood in the scissors it will be driven forward by the closing of the blades and be marked by them as it passes along the edges the same thing happens with grass which is so soft that it is cut right through haycutter the haycutter is another adaptation of the same principle a cutterbar is pulled rapidly backwards and forwards in a frame which runs a few inches above the ground by a crank driven by the wheels through gearing to the front edge of the bar are attached by one side a number of triangular knives the frame carries an equal number of spikes pointing forward horizontally through slots in these the cutterbar works and its knives give a drawing cut to grass caught between them and the sides of the spikes some natural phenomena why sunheat varies in intensity the more squarely parallel heatrays strike a surface the greater will be the number that can affect that surface this is evident from figs 228 229 where a b is an equal distance in both cases the nearer the sun is to the horizon the more obliquely do its rays strike the earth hence midday is necessarily warmer than the evening and the tropics where the sun stands overhead are hotter than the temperate zones where even in summer at midday the rays fall more or less on the slant illustration fig 228 illustration fig 229 the atmospheric envelope which encompasses the earth tends to increase the effect of obliquity since a slanting ray has to travel further through it and is robbed of more heat than a vertical ray the tides all bodies have an attraction for one another the earth attracts the moon and the moon attracts the earth now though the effect of this attraction is not visible as regards the solid part of the globe it is strongly manifested by the water which covers a large portion of the earths surface the moon attracts the water most powerfully at two points that nearest to it and that furthest away from it as shown on an exaggerated scale in fig 230 since the earth and the water revolve as one mass daily on their axis every point on the circumference would be daily nearest to and furthest from the moon at regular intervals and wherever there is ocean there would be two tides in that period were the moon stationary as regards the earth it should be clearly understood that the tides are not great currents but mere thickenings of the watery envelope the inrush of the tide is due to the temporary rise of level illustration fig 230 illustration fig 231 why high tide varies daily the moon travels round the earth once in twentyeight days in fig 231 the point a is nearest the moon at say twelve noon at the end of twentyfour hours it will have arrived at the same position by the compass but yet not be nearest to the moon which has in that period moved on 128th of a revolution round the earth43 consequently high tide will not occur till a has reached position b and overtaken the moon as it were which takes about an hour on the average this explains why high tide occurs at intervals of more than twelve hours illustration fig 232relative positions of sun moon and earth at spring tides illustration fig 233relative positions of sun moon and earth at neap tides neap tides and spring tides the sun as well as the moon attracts the ocean but with less power owing to its being so much further away at certain periods of the month sun earth and moon are all in line sun and moon then pull together and we get the highest or spring tides fig 232 when sun and moon pull at right angles to one anothernamely at the first and third quartersthe excrescence caused by the moon is flattened fig 233 and we get the lowest or neap tides 39 in both figs 207 and 208 the degree of expansion is very greatly exaggerated 40 as the sun passes the meridian twelve oclock noon the chronometers reading is taken and the longitude or distance east or west of greenwich is reckoned by the difference in time between local noon and that of the chronometer 41 for much of the information given here about clocks and watches the author is indebted to the history of watches by mr jf kendal 42 we shall here notice only those gears which are included in the hub of the drivingwheel 43 the original
