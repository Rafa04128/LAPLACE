research during the last decade the soap industry has not remained stationary while there has not perhaps been anything of a very revolutionary character steady progress has still been made in practically all branches and the aim of the present work is to describe the manufacture of household and toilet soaps as carried out today in an uptodate and wellequipped factory in the more scientific portions of the book an acquaintance with the principles of elementary chemistry is assumed and in this we feel justified as in these days of strenuous competition no soapmaker can hope to compete successfully with his rivals unless he has a sound theoretical as well as practical knowledge of the nature of the raw materials he uses and the reactions taking place in the pan or at other stages of the manufacture we also venture to hope that the work may prove useful to works chemists and other analysts consulted in connection with this industry at the same time in the greater part of the book no chemical knowledge is necessary the subject being treated in such a way that it is hoped those who are not directly engaged in the manufacture of soap but who desire a general idea of the subject will find it of value in the sections dealing with the composition and analysis of materials temperatures are expressed in degrees centigrade these being now almost invariably used in scientific work in the rest of the book however they are given in degrees fahrenheit the degrees centigrade being also added in brackets as in the majority of factories these are still used as regards strengths of solution in some factories the use of baum degrees is preferred whilst in others twaddell degrees are the custom and we have therefore given the two figures in all cases in the chapter dealing with oils and fats their saponification equivalents are given in preference to saponification values as it has been our practice for some years to express our results in this way as suggested by allen in commercial organic analysis and all our records from which most of the figures for the chief oils and fats are taken are so stated for the illustrations the authors are indebted to messrs

of soappropertieshydrolysisdetergent action it has been said that the use of soap is a gauge of the civilisation of a nation but though this may perhaps be in a great measure correct at the present day the use of soap has not always been coexistent with civilisation for according to pliny nat hist xxviii 12 51 soap was first introduced into rome from germany having been discovered by the gauls who used the product obtained by mixing goats tallow and beech ash for giving a bright hue to the hair in west central africa moreover the natives especially the fanti race have been accustomed to wash themselves with soap prepared by mixing crude palm oil and water with the ashes of banana and plantain skins the manufacture of soap seems to have flourished during the eighth century in italy and spain and was introduced into france some five hundred years later when factories were established at marseilles for the manufacture of oliveoil soap soap does not appear to have been made in england until the fourteenth century and the first record of soap manufacture in london is in 1524 from this time till the beginning of the nineteenth century the manufacture of soap developed very slowly being essentially carried on by ruleofthumb methods but the classic researches of chevreul on the constitution of fats at once placed the industry upon a scientific basis and stimulated by leblancs discovery of a process for the commercial manufacture of caustic soda from common salt the production of soap has advanced by leaps and bounds until it is now one of the most important of british industries definition of soapthe word soap latin sapo which is cognate with latin sebum tallow appears to have been originally applied to the product obtained by treating tallow with ashes in its strictly chemical sense it refers to combinations of fatty acids with metallic bases a definition which includes not only sodium stearate oleate and palmitate which form the bulk of the soaps of commerce but also the linoleates of lead manganese etc used as driers and various pharmaceutical preparations eg mercury oleate hydrargyri oleatum zinc oleate and lead plaster together with a number of other metallic salts of fatty acids technically speaking however the meaning of the term soap is considerably restricted being generally limited to the combinations of fatty acids and alkalies obtained by treating various animal or vegetable fatty matters or the fatty acids derived therefrom with soda or potash the former giving hard soaps the latter soft soaps the use of ammonia as an alkali for soapmaking purposes has often been attempted but owing to the ease with which the resultant soap is decomposed it can scarcely be looked upon as a product of much commercial value h jackson has however recently patented eng pat 6712 1906 the use of ammonium oleate for laundry work this detergent is prepared in the washtub at the time of use and it is claimed that goods are cleansed by merely immersing them in this solution for a short time and rinsing in fresh water neither of the definitions given above includes the sodium and potassium salts of rosin commonly called rosin soap for the acid constituents of rosin have been shown to be aromatic but in view of the analogous properties of these resinates to true soap they are generally regarded as legitimate constituents of soap having been used in great britain since 1827 and receiving legislative sanction in holland in 1875 other definitions of soap have been given based not upon its composition but upon its properties among which may be mentioned that of kingzett who says that soap considered commercially is a body which on treatment with water liberates alkali and that of nuttall who defines soap as an alkaline or unctuous substance used in washing and cleansing properties of soapboth soda and potash soaps are readily soluble in either alcohol or hot water in cold water they dissolve more slowly and owing to slight decomposition due to hydrolysis vide infra the solution becomes distinctly turbid sodium oleate is peculiar in not undergoing hydrolysis except in very dilute solution and at a low temperature on cooling a hot soap solution a jelly of more or less firm consistence results a property possessed by colloidal bodies such as starch and gelatine in contradistinction to substances which under the same conditions deposit crystals due to diminished solubility of the salt at a lower temperature krafft journ soc chem ind 1896 206 601 1899 691 and 1902 1301 and his collaborators wiglow strutz and funcke have investigated this property of soap solutions very fully the researches extending over several years in the light of their more recent work the molecules or definite aggregates of molecules of solutions which become gelatinous on cooling move much more slowly than the molecules in the formation of a crystal but there is a definite structure although arranged differently to that of a crystal in the case of soda soaps the colloidal character increases with the molecular weight of the fatty acids soda soaps are insoluble in concentrated caustic lyes and for the most part in strong solutions of sodium chloride hence the addition of caustic soda or brine to a solution of soda soap causes the soap to separate out and rise to the surface addition of brine to a solution of potash soap on the other hand merely results in double decomposition soda soap and potassium chloride being formed thus c17h35cook nacl c17h35coona kcl potassium sodium sodium potassium stearate chloride stearate chloride the solubility of the different soaps in salt solution varies very considerably whilst sodium stearate is insoluble in a 5 per cent solution of sodium chloride sodium laurate requires a 17 per cent solution to precipitate it and sodium caproate is not thrown out of solution even by a saturated solution hydrolysis of soapthe term hydrolysis is applied to any resolution of a body into its constituents where the decomposition is brought about by the action of water hence when soap is treated with cold water it is said to undergo hydrolysis the reaction taking place being represented in its simplest form by the equation 2nac18h35o2 h2o naoh hnac18h35o22 sodium water caustic acid sodium stearate soda stearate the actual reaction which occurs has been the subject of investigation by many chemists and very diverse conclusions have been arrived at chevreul the pioneer in the modern chemistry of oils and fats found that a small amount of alkali was liberated as appears in the above equation together with the formation of an acid salt a very minute quantity of free fatty acid remaining in solution rotondi journ soc chem ind 1885 601 on the other hand considered that a neutral soap on being dissolved in water was resolved into a basic and an acid salt the former readily soluble in both hot and cold water the latter insoluble in cold water and only slightly soluble in hot water he appears however to have been misled by the fact that sodium oleate is readily soluble in cold water and his views have been shown to be incorrect by krafft and stern ber d chem ges 1894 1747 and 1755 who from experiments with pure sodium palmitate and stearate entirely confirm the conclusions arrived at by chevreul the extent of dissociation occurring when a soap is dissolved in water depends upon the nature of the fatty acids from which the soap is made and also on the concentration of the solution the sodium salts of cocoanut fatty acids capric caproic and caprylic acids are by far the most easily hydrolysed those of oleic acid and the fatty acids from cottonseed oil being dissociated more readily than those of stearic acid and tallow fatty acids the decomposition increases with the amount of water employed the hydrolytic action of water on soap is affected very considerably by the presence of certain substances dissolved in the water particularly salts of calcium and magnesium caustic soda exerts a marked retarding effect on the hydrolysis as do also ethyl and amyl alcohols and glycerol detergent action of soapthe property possessed by soap of removing dirt is one which it is difficult to satisfactorily explain many theories more or less complicated have been suggested but even now the question cannot be regarded as solved the explanation commonly accepted is that the alkali liberated by hydrolysis attacks any greasy matter on the surface to be cleansed and as the fat is dissolved the particles of dirt are loosened and easily washed off berzelius held this view and considered that the value of a soap depended upon the ease with which it yielded free alkali on solution in water this theory is considered by hillyer journ amer chem soc 1903 524 however to be quite illogical for as he points out the liberated alkali would be far more likely to recombine with the acid or acid salt from which it has been separated than to saponify a neutral glyceride while further unsaponifiable greasy matter is removed by soap as easily as saponifiable fat and there can be no question of any chemical action of the free alkali in its case yet another argument against the theory is that hydrolysis is greater in cold and dilute solutions whereas hot concentrated soap solutions are generally regarded as having the best detergent action rotondi journ soc chem ind 1885 601 was of the opinion that the basic soap which he believed to be formed by hydrolysis was alone responsible for the detergent action of soap this basic soap dissolving fatty matter by saponification but as already pointed out his theory of the formation of a basic soap is now known to be incorrect and his conclusions are therefore invalid several explanations have been suggested based on the purely physical properties of soap solutions most of these are probably at any rate in part correct and there can be little doubt that the ultimate solution of the problem lies in this direction and that the detergent action of soap will be found to depend on many of these properties together with other factors not yet known jevons in 1878 in some researches on the brownian movement or pedesis of small particles a movement of the particles which is observed to take place when clay iron oxide or other finely divided insoluble matter is suspended in water found that the pedetic action was considerably increased by soap and sodium silicate and suggested that to this action of soap might be attributed much of its cleansing power alder wright considered that the alkali liberated by hydrolysis in some way promoted contact of the water with the substance to be cleansed and knapp regarded the property of soap solutions themselves to facilitate contact of the water with the dirt as one of the chief causes of the efficacy of soap as a detergent another way in which it has been suggested that soap acts as a cleanser is that the soap itself or the alkali set free by hydrolysis serves as a lubricant making the dirt less adherent and thus promoting its removal the most likely theory yet advanced is that based on the emulsifying power of soap solutions the fact that these will readily form emulsions with oils has long been known and the detergent action of soap has frequently been attributed to it the explanation given being that the alkali set free by the water emulsifies the fatty matter always adhering to dirt and carries it away in suspension with the other impurities experiments by hillyer loc cit show however that while n10 solution of alkali will readily emulsify a cottonseed oil containing free acidity no emulsion is produced with an oil from which all the acidity has been removed or with kerosene whereas a n10 solution of sodium oleate will readily give an emulsion with either thus proving that the emulsification is due to the soap itself and not to the alkali plateau pogg ann 141 44 and quincke wiedmanns ann 35 592 have made very complete researches on the emulsification and foaming of liquids and on the formation of bubbles the former considers that there are two properties of a liquid which play an important part in the phenomenon 1 it must have considerable viscosity and 2 its surface tension must be low quincke holds similar views but considers that no pure liquid will foam soap solution admirably fulfils plateaus second condition its surface tension being only about 40 per cent of that of water while its cohesion is also very small and it is doubtless to this property that its emulsifying power is chiefly due so far as viscosity is concerned this can have but little influence for a 1 per cent solution of sodium oleate which has a viscosity very little different from that of pure water is an excellent emulsifying agent hillyer to whose work reference has already been made investigated the whole question of detergent action very exhaustively and as the result of a very large number of experiments concludes that the cleansing power of soap is largely or entirely to be explained by the power which it has of emulsifying oily substances of wetting and penetrating into oily textures and of lubricating texture and impurities so that these may be removed easily it is thought that all these properties may be explained by taking into account the low cohesion of the soap solutions and their strong attraction or affinity to oily matter which together cause the low surface tension between soap solution and oil chapter ii constitution of oils and fats and their

chemical reagents sulphuric acid twitchells reagent hydrochloric acid lime magnesia zinc oxide soda and potash the term oil is of very wide significance being applied to substances of vastly different natures both organic and inorganic but so far as soapmaking materials are concerned it may be restricted almost entirely to the products derived from animal and vegetable sources though many attempts have been made during the last few years to also utilise mineral oils for the preparation of soap fats readily become oils on heating beyond their melting points and may be regarded as frozen oils although scheele in 1779 discovered that in the preparation of lead plaster glycerol is liberated soap at that time was regarded as a mere mechanical mixture and the constitution of oils and fats was not properly understood it was chevreul who showed that the manufacture of soap involved a definite chemical decomposition of the oil or fat into fatty acid and glycerol the fatty acid combining with soda potash or other base to form the soap and the glycerol remaining free the reactions with stearin and palmitin of which tallow chiefly consists and with olein found largely in olive and cottonseed oils are as follows ch2ooc18h35 ch2oh chooc18h35 3naoh 3naooc18h35 choh ch2ooc18h35 ch2oh stearin sodium sodium glycerol hydroxide stearate ch2ooc16h31 ch2oh chooc16h31 3naoh 3naooc16h31 choh

subsequently confirmed chevreuls investigations by directly synthesising the fats from fatty acids and glycerol the method he adopted consisting in heating the fatty acids with glycerol in sealed tubes thus for example 3c18h35o2h c3h5oh3 c3h5c18h35o23 stearic acid glycerol tristearin since glycerol is a trihydric alcohol ie contains three hydroxyl oh groups the hydrogen atoms of which are

diglyceride ch2or ch2or alpha choh and beta chor ch2or ch2oh according to the relative proportions of fatty acid and glycerol used and the temperature to which they were heated berthelot succeeded in preparing mono di and triglycerides of various fatty acids practically all the oils and fats used in soapmaking consist of mixtures of these compounds of glycerol with fatty acids which invariably occur in nature in the form of triglycerides it was formerly considered that the three acid radicles in any naturally occurring glyceride were identical corresponding to the formula ch2or chor ch2or where r denotes the acid radicle recent work however has shown the existence of several socalled mixed glycerides in which the hydroxyls of the same molecule of glycerol are displaced by two or sometimes three different acid radicles the first mixed glyceride to be discovered was oleodistearin c3h5oc18h35ooc18h35o2 obtained by heise in 1896 mkani fat hansen has since found that tallow

also been obtained by kreis and hafner from lard while holde and stange have shown that olive oil contains from 1 to 2 per cent of oleodidaturin c3h5oc18h33ooc17h33o2 and hehner and mitchell have obtained indications of mixed glycerides in linseed oil which they consider contains a compound of glycerol with two radicles of linolenic acid and one radicle of oleic acid also in codliver cod whale and shark oils in some cases the fatty acids are combined with other bases than glycerol as examples may be cited beeswax containing myricin or myricyl palmitate and spermaceti consisting chiefly of cetin or cetyl palmitate and herein lies the essential difference between fats and waxes but as these substances are not soapmaking materials though sometimes admixed with soap to accomplish some

important from a soapmakers point of view are stearin palmitin olein and laurin as these predominate in the fats and oils generally used in that industry the presence of stearin and palmitin which are solid at the ordinary temperature gives firmness to a fat the greater the percentage present the harder the fat and the higher will be the melting point hence tallows and palm oils are solid firm fats where olein which is liquid is the chief constituent we have softer fats such as lard and liquid oils as almond olive and cottonseed stearin tristearin can be prepared from tallow by crystallisation from a solution in ether forming small crystals which have a bright pearly lustre the melting point of stearin appears to undergo changes and suggests the existence of distinct modifications when heated to 55 c stearin liquefies with increase of temperature it becomes solid and again becomes liquid at 716 c if this liquid be further heated to 76 c and allowed to cool it will not solidify until 55 c is reached but if the liquid at 716 c be allowed to cool solidification will occur at 70 c palmitin tripalmitin may be obtained by heating together palmitic acid and glycerol repeatedly boiling the resulting product with strong alcohol and allowing it to crystallise palmitin exists in scales which have a peculiar pearly appearance and are greasy to the touch after melting and solidifying palmitin shows no crystalline fracture when heated to 46 c it melts to a liquid which becomes solid on further heating again liquefying when 617 c is reached and becoming cloudy with separation of crystalline particles at 63 c it is quite clear and this temperature is taken as the true melting point it has been suggested that the different changes at the temperatures mentioned are due to varying manipulation such as rate at which the temperature is raised and the initial temperature of the mass when previously cool olein triolein is an odourless colourless tasteless oil which rapidly absorbs oxygen and becomes rancid it has been prepared synthetically by heating glycerol and oleic acid together and may be obtained by submitting olive oil to a low temperature for several days when the liquid portion may be further deprived of any traces of stearin and palmitin by dissolving in alcohol olein may be distilled in vacuo without decomposition taking place laurin trilaurin may be prepared synthetically from glycerol and lauric acid it crystallises in needles melting at 4546 c which are readily soluble in ether but only slightly so in cold absolute alcohol scheij gives its specific gravity d604 08944 laurin is the chief constituent of palmkernel oil and also one of the principal components of cocoanut oil fatty acidswhen a fat or oil is saponified with soda or potash the resulting soap dissolved in hot water and sufficient dilute sulphuric acid added to decompose the soap an oily layer gradually rises to the surface of the liquid which after clarifying by warming and washing free from mineral acid is soluble in alcohol and reddens blue litmus paper this oily layer consists of the fatty acids or rather those insoluble in water acids like acetic propionic butyric caproic caprylic and capric which are all more or less readily soluble in water remaining for the most part dissolved in the aqueous portion all the acids naturally present in oils and fats whether free or combined are monobasic in character that is to say contain only one carboxylcooh group the more important fatty acids may be classified according to their chemical constitution into

were formerly included in this series have now been shown to consist of mixtures of stearic and palmitic and stearic palmitic and oleic acids respectively the acids of this group are saturated compounds and will not combine directly with iodine or bromine the two first are liquid at ordinary temperatures distil without decomposition and are miscible with water in all proportions the next four are more or less soluble in water and distil unchanged in the presence of water as does also lauric acid which is almost insoluble in cold water and only slightly dissolved by boiling water the higher acids of the series are solid and are completely insoluble in water all these acids are soluble in warm alcohol and on being heated with solid caustic alkali undergo no change ii oleic series

behaviour with various reagents entirely different from that of the preceding series thus they readily combine with bromine or iodine to form addition compounds and the lower members of the series are at once reduced on treatment with sodium amalgam in alkaline solution to the corresponding saturated acids of series i unfortunately this reaction does not apply to the higher acids such as oleic acid but as the conversion of the latter into solid acids is a matter of some technical importance from the point of view of the candlemaker a number of attempts have been made to effect this by other methods de wilde and reychler have shown that by heating oleic acid with 1 per cent of iodine in autoclaves up to 270280 c about 70 per cent is converted into stearic acid and zrer has devised german patent 62407 a process whereby the oleic acid is first converted by the action of chlorine into the dichloride which is then reduced with nascent hydrogen more recently norman has secured a patent english patent 1515 1903 for the conversion of unsaturated fatty acids of series ii into the saturated compounds of series i by reduction with hydrogen or watergas in the presence of finely divided nickel cobalt or iron it is claimed that by this method oleic acid is completely transformed into stearic acid and that the melting point of tallow fatty acids is raised thereby about 12 c another method which has been proposed is to run the liquid olein over a series of electrically charged plates which effects its reduction to stearin stearic acid is also formed by treating oleic acid with fuming hydriodic acid in the presence of phosphorus while other solid acids are obtained by the action of sulphuric acid or zinc chloride on oleic acid acids of series ii may also be converted into saturated acids by heating to 300c with solid caustic potash which decomposes them into acids of the stearic series with liberation of hydrogen this reaction with oleic acid for example is generally represented by the equation c18h34o2 2koh kc2h3o2 kc16h31o2 h2 though it must be really more complex than this indicates for as edmed has pointed out oxalic acid is also formed in considerable quantity the process on a commercial scale has now been abandoned one of the most important properties of this group of acids is the formation of isomeric acids of higher melting point on treatment with nitrous acid generally termed the elaidin reaction oleic acid for example acted upon by nitrous acid yields elaidic acid melting at 45 and erucic acid gives brassic acid melting at 60c this reaction also occurs with the neutral glycerides of these acids olein being converted into elaidin which melts at 32c the lead salts of the acids of this series are much more soluble in ether and the lithium salts more soluble in alcohol than those of the stearic series upon both of which properties processes have been based for the separation of the solid from the liquid fatty acids iii linolic

formation of soap though generally represented by the equation already given pp 6 and 7 c3h5or 3naoh c3h5oh3 3rona is not by any means such a simple reaction in the first place though in this equation no water appears the presence of the latter is found to be indispensable for saponification to take place in fact the water must be regarded as actually decomposing the oil or fat caustic soda or potash merely acting as a catalytic agent further since in the glycerides there are three acid radicles to be separated from glycerol their saponification can be supposed to take place in three successive stages which are the converse of the formation of mono and diglycerides in the synthesis of triglycerides from fatty acids and glycerine thus the above equation may be regarded as a summary of the following three or oh i c3h5 or naoh c3h5 or rona or or oh oh ii c3h5 or naoh c3h5 or rona or oh oh oh iii c3h5 or naoh c3h5 oh rona oh oh geitel and lewkowitsch who have studied this question from the physical and chemical point of view respectively are of opinion that when an oil or fat is saponified these three reactions do actually occur side by side the soappan containing at the same time unsaponified triglyceride diglyceride monoglyceride glycerol and soap this theory is not accepted however by all investigators balbiano and marcusson doubt the validity of lewkowitschs conclusions and fanto experimenting on the saponification of olive oil with caustic potash is unable to detect the intermediate formation of any mono or diglyceride and concludes that in homogeneous solution the saponification is practically quadrimolecular kreeman on the other hand from physicochemical data supports the view of geitel and lewkowitsch that saponification is bimolecular and though the evidence seems to favour this theory the matter cannot be regarded as yet definitely settled hydrolysis can be brought about by water alone if sufficient time is allowed but as the process is extremely slow it is customary in practice to accelerate the reaction by the use of various methods which include i the application of heat or electricity ii action of enzymes and iii treatment with chemicals the accelerating effect of the two latter methods is due to their emulsifying power the most usual method adopted in the manufacture of soap is to hydrolyse the fat or oil by caustic soda or potash the fatty acids liberated at the same time combining with the catalyst ie soda or potash to form soap hitherto the other processes of hydrolysis have been employed chiefly for the preparation of material for candles for which purpose complete separation of the glycerol in the first hydrolysis is not essential since the fatty matter is usually subjected to a second treatment with sulphuric acid to increase the proportion of solid fatty acids the colour of the resulting fatty acids is also of no importance as they are always subjected to distillation during the last few years however there has been a growing attempt to first separate the glycerol from the fatty acids and then convert the latter into soap by treatment with the carbonates of soda or potash which are of course considerably cheaper than the caustic alkalies but cannot be used in the actual saponification of a neutral fat the two processes chiefly used for this purpose are those in which the reaction is brought about by enzymes or by twitchells reagent i application of heat or electricityup to temperatures of 150 c the effect of water on oils and fats is very slight but by passing superheated steam through fatty matter heated to 200300 c the neutral glycerides are completely decomposed into glycerol and fatty acids according to the equation c3h5or3 3hoh c3h5oh3 3roh the fatty acids and glycerol formed distil over with the excess of steam and by arranging a series of condensers the former which condense first are obtained almost alone in the earlier ones and an aqueous solution of glycerine in the later ones this method of preparation of fatty acids is extensively used in france for the production of stearine for candlemanufacture but the resulting product is liable to be dark coloured and to yield a dark soap to expose the acids to heat for a minimum of time and so prevent discoloration mannig has patented germ pat 160111 a process whereby steam under a pressure of 8 to 10 atmospheres is projected against a baffle plate mounted in a closed vessel where it mixes with the fat or oil in the form of a spray the rate of hydrolysis being thereby it is claimed much increased simpson fr pat 364587 has attempted to accelerate further the decomposition by subjecting oils or fats to the simultaneous action of heat and electricity superheated steam is passed into the oil in which are immersed the two electrodes connected with a dynamo or battery the temperature not being allowed to exceed 270 c ii action of enzymesit was discovered by muntz in 1871 annales de chemie xxii that during germination of castor seeds a quantity of fatty acid was developed in the seeds which he suggested might be due to the decomposition of the oil by the embryo acting as a ferment schutzenberger in 1876 showed that when castor seeds are steeped in water fatty acids and glycerol are liberated and attributed this to the hydrolytic action of an enzyme present in the seeds no evidence of the existence of such a ferment was adduced however till 1890 when green roy soc proc 48 370 definitely proved the presence in the seeds of a ferment capable of splitting up the oil into fatty acid and glycerol the first experimenters to suggest any industrial application of this enzymic hydrolysis were connstein hoyer and wartenburg who berichte 1902 35 pp 39884006 published the results of a lengthy investigation of the whole subject they found that tallow cottonseed palm olive almond and many other oils were readily hydrolysed by the castorseed ferment in the presence of dilute acid but that cocoanut and palmkernel oils only decomposed with difficulty the presence of acidity is essential for the hydrolysis to take place the most suitable strength being onetenth normal and the degree of hydrolysis is proportional to the quantity of ferment present sulphuric phosphoric acetic or butyric acids or sodium bisulphate may be used without much influence on the result butyric acid is stated to be the best but in practice is too expensive and acetic acid is usually adopted the emulsified mixture should be allowed to stand for twentyfour hours and the temperature should not exceed 40 c at 50 c the action is weakened and at 100 c ceases altogether several investigators have since examined the hydrolysing power of various other seeds notably braun and behrendt berichte 1903 36 11421145 19001901 and 30033005 who in addition to confirming connstein hoyer and wartenburgs work with castor seeds have made similar experiments with jequirity seeds abrus peccatorius containing the enzyme abrin emulsin from crushed almonds the leaves of arctostaphylos uva ursi containing the glucoside arbutin myrosin from black mustardseed gold lac cheirantus cheiri and crotin from croton seeds jequirity seeds were found to have a stronger decomposing action on lanoline and carnauba wax than the castor seed but only caused decomposition of castor oil after the initial acidity was first neutralised with alkali neither emulsin arbutin nor crotin have any marked hydrolytic action on castor oil but myrosin is about half as active as castor seeds except in the presence of potassium myronate when no decomposition occurs s fokin j russ phys chem ges 35 831835 and chem rev fett u harz ind 1904 30 et seq has examined the hydrolytic action of a large number of russian seeds belonging to some thirty different families but although more than half of these brought about the hydrolysis of over 10 per cent of fat he considers that in only two cases viz the seeds of chelidonium majus and linaria vulgaris is the action due to enzymes these being the only two seeds for which the yield of fatty acids is proportional to the amount of seed employed while in many instances hydrolysis was not produced when the seeds were old the seeds of chelidonium majus were found to have as great and possibly greater enzymic activity than castor seeds but those of linaria are much weaker twenty to thirty parts having only the same lipolytic activity as four to five parts of castor seeds the high percentage of free acids found in rice oil has led c a brown jun journ amer chem soc 1903 25 948954 to examine the rice bran which proves to have considerable enzymic activity and rapidly effects the hydrolysis of glycerides the process for the utilisation of enzymic hydrolysis in the separation of fatty acids from glycerine on the industrial scale as originally devised by connstein and his collaborators consisted in rubbing a quantity of the coarsely crushed castor seeds with part of the oil or fat then adding the rest of the oil together with acidified water n10 acetic acid the quantities employed were 612 parts of decorticated castor beans for every 100 parts of oil or fat and 50 to 60 parts of acetic acid after stirring until an emulsion is formed the mixture is allowed to stand for twentyfour hours during which hydrolysis takes place the temperature is then raised to 7080 c which destroys the enzyme and a 25 per cent solution of sulphuric acid equal in amount to onefiftieth of the total quantity of fat originally taken added to promote separation of the fatty acids in this way three layers are formed the one at the top consisting of the clear fatty acids the middle one an emulsion containing portions of the seeds fatty acids and glycerine and the bottom one consisting of the aqueous glycerine the intermediate layer is difficult to treat satisfactorily it is generally washed twice with water the washings being added to glycerine water and the fatty mixture saponified and the resultant soap utilised the process has been the subject of a considerable amount of investigation numerous attempts having been made to actually separate the active fatsplitting constituent of the seeds or to obtain it in a purer and more concentrated form than is furnished by the seeds themselves nicloux comptes rendus 1904 1112 and roy soc proc 1906 77 b 454 has shown that the hydrolytic activity of castor seeds is due entirely to the cytoplasm which it is possible to separate by mechanical means from the aleurone grains and all other cellular matter this active substance which he terms lipaseidine is considered to be not an enzyme though it acts as such following the ordinary laws of enzyme action its activity is destroyed by contact with water in the absence of oil this observer has patented eng pat 8304 1904 the preparation of an extract by triturating crushed castor or other seeds with castor oil filtering the oily extract and subjecting it to centrifugal force the deposit consists of aleurone and the active enzymic substance together with about 80 per cent of oil and one part of it will effect nearly complete hydrolysis of 100 parts of oil in twentyfour hours in a subsequent addition to this patent the active agent is separated from the aleurone by extraction with benzene and centrifugal force by the use of such an extract the quantity of albuminoids brought into contact with the fat is reduced to about 10 per cent of that in the original seeds and the middle layer between the glycerine solution and fatty acids is smaller and can be saponified directly for the production of curd soap while the glycerine solution also is purer in a further patent nicloux fr pat 349213 1904 states that the use of an acid medium is unnecessary and claims that even better results are obtained by employing a neutral solution of calcium sulphate containing a small amount of magnesium sulphate the proportion of salts not exceeding 05 per cent of the fat while in yet another patent jointly with urbain fr pat 349942 1904 it is claimed that the process is accelerated by the removal of acids from the oil or fat to be treated which may be accomplished by either washing first with acidulated water then with pure water or preferably by neutralising with carbonate of soda and removing the resulting soap lombard fr pat 350179 1904 claims that acids act as stimulating agents in the enzymic hydrolysis of oils and further that a simple method of obtaining the active product is to triturate oil cake with its own weight of water allow the mixture to undergo spontaneous proteolytic hydrolysis at 40 c for eight days and then filter the filtrate obtained being used in place of water in the enzymic process hoyer who has made a large number of experiments in the attempt to isolate the lipolytic substance from castor seeds has obtained a product of great activity which he terms fermentoil by extracting the crushed seeds with a solvent for oils the verein chem werke have extended their original patent addition dated 11th december 1905 to fr pat 328101 oct 1902 which now covers the use of vegetable ferments in the presence of water and manganese sulphate or other metallic salt it is further stated that acetic acid may be added at the beginning of the operation or use may be made of that formed during the process though in the latter case hydrolysis is somewhat slower experiments have been carried out by lewkowitsch and macleod journ soc chem ind 1903 68 and proc roy soc 1903 31 with ferments derived from animal sources viz lipase from pigs liver and steapsin from the pig or ox pancreas the former although it has been shown by kastle and loevenhart amer chem journ 1900 49 to readily hydrolyse ethyl butyrate is found to have very little fatsplitting power but with steapsin more favourable results have been obtained though the yield of fatty acids in this case is considerably inferior to that given by castor seeds with cottonseed oil 8386 per cent of fatty acids were liberated as a maximum after fiftysix days but with lard only 46 per cent were produced in the same time addition of dilute acid or alkali appeared to exert no influence on the decomposition of the cottonseed oil but in the case of the lard dilute alkali seemed at first to promote hydrolysis though afterwards to retard it fokin chem rev fett u harz ind 1904 118120 et seq has attempted to utilise the pancreatic juice on a technical scale but the process proved too slow and too costly to have any practical use ranciditythe hydrolysing power of enzymes throws a good deal of light on the development of rancidity in oils and fats which is now generally regarded as due to the oxidation by air in the presence of light and moisture of the free fatty acids contained by the oil or fat it has long been known that whilst recently rendered animal fats are comparatively free from acidity freshly prepared vegetable oils invariably contain small quantities of free fatty acid and there can be no doubt that this must be attributed to the action of enzymes contained in the seeds or fruit from which the oils are expressed hence the necessity for separating oils and fats from adhering albuminous matters as quickly as possible decomposition of fats by bacteriathough this subject is not of any practical interest in the preparation of fatty acids for soapmaking it may be mentioned in passing that some bacteria readily hydrolyse fats schriber arch f hyg 41 328347 has shown that in the presence of air many bacteria promote hydrolysis under favourable conditions as to temperature and access of oxygen the process going beyond the simple splitting up into fatty acid and glycerol carbon dioxide and water being formed under anrobic conditions however only a slight primary hydrolysis was found to take place though according to rideal journ soc chem ind 1903 69 there is a distinct increase in the amount of free fatty acids in a sewage after passage through a septic tank experiments have also been made on this subject by rahn centralb bakteriol 1905 422 who finds that penicillium glaucum and other penicillia have considerable action on fats attacking the glycerol and lower fatty acids though not oleic acid a motile bacillus producing a green fluorescent colouring matter but not identified had a marked hydrolytic action and decomposed oleic acid the name lipobacter has been proposed by de kruyff for bacteria which hydrolyse fats iii use of chemical reagentsamong the chief accelerators employed in the hydrolysis of oils are sulphuric acid and twitchells reagent benzene or naphthalenestearosulphonic acid while experiments have also been made with hydrochloric acid journ soc chem ind 1903 67 with fairly satisfactory results and the use of sulphurous acid or an alkaline bisulphite as catalyst has been patented in germany to this class belong also the bases lime magnesia zinc oxide ammonia soda and potash though these latter substances differ from the former in that they subsequently combine with the fatty acids liberated to form soaps sulphuric acidthe hydrolysing action of concentrated sulphuric acid upon oils and fats has been known since the latter part of the eighteenth century but was not applied on a practical scale till 1840 when gwynne patented a process in which sulphuric acid was used to liberate the fatty acids the latter being subsequently purified by steam distillation by this method sulphocompounds of the glyceride are first formed which readily emulsify with water and on treatment with steam liberate fatty acids the glycerol remaining partly in the form of glycerosulphuric acid the process has been investigated by fremy geitel and more recently by lewkowitsch j soc of arts cantor lectures 1904 795 et seq who has conducted a series of experiments on the hydrolysis of tallow with 4 per cent of sulphuric acid of varying strengths containing from 58 to 90 per cent sulphuric acid h2so4 acid of 60 per cent or less appears to be practically useless as a hydrolysing agent while with 70 per cent acid only 477 per cent fatty acids were developed after twentytwo hours steaming and with 80 and 85 per cent acid the maximum of 899 per cent of fatty acids was only reached after fourteen and fifteen hours steaming respectively using 98 per cent acid 93 per cent of fatty acids were obtained after nine hours steaming and after another seven hours only 06 per cent more fatty acids were produced further experiments have shown that dilute sulphuric acid has also scarcely any action on cottonseed whale and rape oils according to lant carpenter some 75 per cent of solid fatty acids may be obtained from tallow by the sulphuric acid process owing to the conversion of a considerable quantity of oleic acid into isoleic acid vide p 12 but in the process a considerable proportion of black pitch is obtained c dreymann has recently patented eng pat 10466 1904 two processes whereby the production of any large amount of hydrocarbons is obviated in the one case after saponification with sulphuric acid the liberated fatty acids are washed with water and treated with an oxide carbonate or other acidfixing body eg sodium carbonate prior to distillation in this way the distillate is much clearer than by the ordinary process and is almost odourless while the amount of unsaponifiable matter is only about 12 per cent the second method claimed consists in the conversion of the fatty acids into their methyl esters by treatment with methyl alcohol and hydrochloric acid gas and purification of the esters by steam distillation the pure esters being subsequently decomposed with superheated steam in an autoclave with or without the addition of an oxide eg 01 per cent zinc oxide to facilitate their decomposition twitchells reagentin twitchells process use is made of the important discovery that aqueous solutions of fatty aromatic sulphuric acids such as benzene or naphthalenestearosulphonic acid readily dissolve fatty bodies thereby facilitating their dissociation into fatty acids and glycerol these compounds are stable at 100 c and are prepared by treating a mixture of benzene or naphthalene and oleic acid with an excess of sulphuric acid the following reaction taking place c6h6 c18h34o2 h2so4 c6h4so3hc18h35o h2o on boiling the resultant product with water two layers separate the lower one consisting of a clear aqueous solution of sulphuric acid and whatever benzenesulphonic acid has been formed while the upper layer which is a viscous oil contains the benzenestearosulphonic acid this after washing first with hydrochloric acid and then rapidly with petroleum ether and drying at 100 c is then ready for use the addition of a small quantity of this reagent to a mixture of fat previously purified and water agitated by boiling with open steam effects almost complete separation of the fatty acid from glycerol the process is generally carried out in two wooden vats covered with closely fitting lids furnished with the necessary drawoff cocks the first vat containing a lead coil and the other a brass steam coil in the first vat the fat or oil is prepared by boiling with 1 or 2 per cent of sulphuric acid 141 tw or 60 b for one or two hours and allowed to rest preferably overnight by this treatment the fat is deprived of any dirt lime or other impurity present after withdrawing the acid liquor the fat or oil is transferred to the other vat where it is mixed with onefifth of its bulk of water condensed or distilled and open steam applied as soon as boiling takes place the requisite amount of reagent is washed into the vat by the aid of a little hot water through a glass funnel and the whole is boiled continuously for twelve or even twentyfour hours until the free fatty acids amount to 8590 per cent the amount of reagent used varies with the grade of material the smaller the amount consistent with efficient results the better the colour of the finished product with good material from 12 to 34 per cent is sufficient but for materials of lower grade proportionately more up to 2 per cent is required the reaction appears to proceed better with materials containing a fair quantity of free acidity when the process has proceeded sufficiently far the boiling is stopped and free steam allowed to fill the vat to obviate any discoloration of the fatty acids by contact with the air whilst the contents of the vat settle the settled glycerine water which should amount in bulk to 50 or 60 per cent of the fatty matter taken and have a density of 712 tw 5 b is removed to a receptacle for subsequent neutralisation with milk of lime and after the separation of sludge is ready for concentration the fatty acids remaining in the vat are boiled with a small quantity 005 per cent or 110 of the twitchell reagent requisite of commercial barium carbonate previously mixed with a little water the boiling may be prolonged twenty or thirty minutes and at the end of that period the contents of the vat are allowed to rest the water separated should be neutral to methylorange indicator it is claimed that fatty acids so treated are not affected by the air and may be stored in wooden packages hydrochloric acidlewkowitsch journ soc chem ind 1903 67 has carried out a number of experiments on the accelerating influence of hydrochloric acid upon the hydrolysis of oils and fats which show that acid of a specific gravity of 116 has a very marked effect on most oils cocoanut cottonseed whale and rape oils tallow and lard being broken up into fatty acid and glycerol to the extent of some 8296 per cent after boiling 100 grams of the oil or fat with 100 cc of acid for twentyfour hours the maximum amount of hydrolysis was attained with cocoanut oil probably owing to its large proportion of the glycerides of volatile fatty acids castor oil is abnormal in only undergoing about 20 per cent hydrolysis but this is attributed to the different constitution of its fatty acids and the ready formation of polymerisation products experiments were also made as to whether the addition of other catalytic agents aided the action of the hydrochloric acid mercury copper sulphate mercury oxide zinc zinc dust aluminium chloride nitrobenzene and aniline being tried in the proportion of 1 per cent the experiments were made on neutral lard and lard containing 5 per cent of free fatty acids but in no case was any appreciable effect produced so far this process has not been adopted on the practical scale its chief drawback being the length of time required for saponification undoubtedly the hydrolysis would be greatly facilitated if the oil and acid could be made to form a satisfactory emulsion but although saponin has been tried for the purpose no means of attaining this object has yet been devised sulphurous acid or bisulphitethe use of these substances has been patented by stein berge and de roubaix germ pat 61329 the fat being heated in contact with the reagent for about nine hours at 175180 c under a pressure of some 18 atmospheres but the process does not appear to be of any considerable importance limethe use of lime for the saponification of oils and fats was first adopted on the technical scale for the production of candlemaking material by de milly in 1831 the insoluble lime soap formed is decomposed by sulphuric acid and the fatty acids steam distilled the amount of lime theoretically necessary to hydrolyse a given quantity of a triglyceride ignoring for the moment any catalytic influence can be readily calculated thus with stearin the reaction may be represented by the equation ch2ooc18h35 ch2oh 2chooc18h35 3caoh2 3caooc18h352 2choh ch2ooc18h35 ch2oh stearin milk of lime calcium stearate glycerol in this instance since the molecular weight of stearin is 890 and that of milk of lime is 74 it is at once apparent that for every 1780 parts of stearin 222 parts of milk of lime or 168 parts of quicklime cao would be required it is found in practice however that an excess of 35 per cent above the theoretical quantity of lime is necessary to complete the hydrolysis of a fat when carried on in an open vessel at 100105 c but that if the saponification be conducted under pressure in autoclaves the amount of lime necessary to secure almost perfect hydrolysis is reduced to 23 per cent on the fat the treatment of fats with 3 per cent of lime under a pressure of 10 atmospheres producing a yield of 95 per cent of fatty acids in seven hours the lower the pressure in the autoclave the lighter will be the colour of the resultant fatty acids magnesiait has been proposed to substitute magnesia for lime in the process of saponification under pressure but comparative experiments with lime and magnesia using 3 per cent of lime and 27 per cent of magnesia journ soc chem ind xii 163 show that saponification by means of magnesia is less complete than with lime and moreover the reaction requires a higher temperature and therefore tends to darken the product zinc oxidethe use of zinc oxide as accelerating agent has been suggested by two or three observers poullain and michaud in 1882 were granted a patent for this process the quantity of zinc oxide recommended to be added to the oil or fat being 02 to 05 per cent rost in 1903 obtained a french patent for the saponification of oils and fats by steam under pressure in the presence of finely divided metals or metallic oxides and specially mentions zinc oxide for the purpose it has also been proposed to use zinc oxide in conjunction with lime in the autoclave to obviate to some extent the discoloration of the fatty acids other catalytic agents have been recommended from time to time including strontianite lead oxide caustic baryta aluminium hydrate but none of these is of any practical importance soda and potashunlike the preceding bases the soaps formed by soda and potash are soluble in water and constitute the soap of commerce these reagents are always used in sufficient quantity to combine with the whole of the fatty acids contained in an oil or fat though doubtless by the use of considerably smaller quantities under pressure complete resolution of the fatty matter into fatty acids and glycerol could be accomplished they are by far the most important saponifying agents from the point of view of the present work and their practical use is fully described in chapter v chapter iii raw materials used in soapmaking

due to the decomposition of the glyceride and does not always denote rancidity is undesirable in soapmaking material rancidity of fats and oils is entirely due to oxidation in addition to free acid aldehydes and ketones being formed and it has been proposed to estimate rancidity by determining the amount of these latter produced it is scarcely necessary to observe how very important it is that the sampling of fats and oils should be efficiently performed so that the sample submitted to the chemist may be a fairly representative average of the parcel in the following short description of the

carried on in conjunction with soapmaking but of late years it has become more general for the soap manufacturer to buy his caustic soda or carbonated alkali from the alkalimaker although there are some alkalimakers who invoice caustic soda and soda ash in terms of actual percentage of sodium oxide na2o it is the trade custom to buy and sell on what is known as the english degree which is about 1 per cent higher than this the english degree is a survival of the time when the atomic weight of sodium was believed to be twentyfour instead of twentythree and since the error on 76 per cent na2o due to this amounts to about 1 per cent may be obtained by adding this figure to the sodium oxide really present caustic soda sodium hydrate comes into commerce in a liquid form as 90 tw and even as high as 106 tw and other degrees of dilution and also in a solid form in various grades as 60 70 7677 7778 these degrees represent the percentage of sodium oxide na2o present plus the 1 per cent the highest grade containing as it does more available caustic soda and less impurities is much more advantageous in use carbonate of soda or soda ash 58 also termed light ash and refined alkali this is a commercially pure sodium carbonate containing about 05 per cent salt nacl the 58 represents the english degrees and corresponds to 99 per cent sodium carbonate na2co3 soda ash 48 sometimes called caustic soda ash often contains besides carbonate of soda 4 per cent caustic soda sodium hydrate and 10 per cent salt sodium chloride together with water and impurities the 48 degrees refers to the amount of alkali present in terms of sodium oxide na2o but expressed as english degrees caustic potash potassium hydrate is offered as a liquid of 5052 b 98103 tw strength and also in solid form as 7580 and 8892 the degrees in the latter case refer to the percentage of potassium hydrate kho actually present carbonate of potashthe standard for refined carbonate of potash is 9092 per cent of actual potassium carbonate k2co3 present although it can be obtained testing 9598 per cent other materials waterwater intended for use in soapmaking should be as soft as possible if the water supply is hard it should be treated chemically the softening agents may be lime and soda ash together soda ash alone or caustic soda there are many excellent plants in vogue for water softening which are based on similar principles and merely vary in mechanical arrangement the advantages accruing from the softening of hard water intended for steamraising are sufficiently established and need not be detailed here salt sodium chloride or common salt nacl is a very important material to the soapmaker and is obtainable in a very pure state brine or a saturated solution of salt is very convenient in soapmaking and if the salt used is pure will contain 264 per cent sodium chloride and have a density of 416 tw 248 b the presence of sulphates alters the density and of course the sodium chloride content salt produced during the recovery of glycerine from the spent lyes often contains sulphates and the density of the brine made from this salt ranges higher than 42 tw 25 b soapstockthis substance is largely imported from america where it is produced from the darkcoloured residue termed mucilage obtained from the refining of crude cottonseed oil mucilage consists of cottonseed oil soap together with the colouring and resinous principles separated during the treatment of the crude oil the colouring matter is removed by boiling the mucilage with water and graining well with salt this treatment is repeated several times until the product is free from excess of colour when it is converted into soap and a nigre settled out from it soapstock is sold on a fatty acid basis the colour is variable footnotes 1 calculated by us from saponification value 2 calculated by us from saponification value 3 calculated by us from saponification value 4 calculated by us from

bleaching and treatment of raw materials intended for soapmaking palm oilcottonseed oilcottonseed footsvegetable oilsanimal fatsbone fatrosin having described the most important and interesting oils and fats used or suggested for use in the manufacture of soap let us now consider briefly the methods of bleaching and treating the raw materials prior to their transference to the soappan crude palm oilof the various methods suggested for bleaching palm oil the bichromate process originated by watts is undoubtedly the best the reaction may be expressed by the following equation though in practice it is necessary to use twice the amount of acid required by theory k2cr2o7 14hcl 2kcl cr2cl6 7h2o 6cl 6cl 3h2o 6hcl 3o the palm oil freed from solid impurities by melting and subsidence is placed in the bleaching tank and washed with water containing a little hydrochloric acid having allowed it to rest and drawn off the liquor and sediment chiefly sand the palm oil is ready for treatment with the bleaching reagent which consists of potassium bichromate and commercial muriatic acid for every ton of oil 22 to 28 lb potassium bichromate and 45 to 60 lb acid will be found sufficient to produce a good bleached oil the best procedure is to act upon the colouring matter of the oil three successive times using in the first two treatments onethird of the average of the figures just given and in the final treatment an appropriate quantity which can be easily gauged by the appearance of a cooled sample of the oil the potassium bichromate is dissolved in hot water and added to the crude palm oil previously heated to 125 f 52 c the requisite amount of muriatic acid being then run in and the whole well agitated by means of air the bright red colour of the oil gradually changes to dark brown and soon becomes green the action having proceeded for a few minutes agitation is stopped and after allowing to settle the green liquor is withdrawn when sufficiently bleached the oil is finally washed without further heating with hot water which may contain salt to remove the last traces of chrome liquor if the above operation is carried out carefully the colouring matter will be completely oxidised it is important however that the temperature should not be allowed to rise above 130 f 54 c during the bleaching of palm oil otherwise the resultant oil on saponification is apt to yield a soap of a foxy colour the bleached oil retains the characteristic violet odour of the original oil it has been suggested to use dilute sulphuric acid or a mixture of this and common salt in the place of muriatic acid in the above process crude cottonseed oilthe deep colouring matter of crude cottonseed oil together with the mucilaginous and resinous principles are removed by refining with caustic soda lye the chief aim of the refiner is to remove these impurities without saponifying any of the neutral oil the percentage of free fatty acids in the oil will determine the quantity of caustic lye required which must only be sufficient to remove this acidity having determined the amount of free acidity the quantity of caustic soda lye necessary to neutralise it is diluted with water to 12 or 15 tw 8 or 10 b and the refining process carried out in three stages the oil is placed in a suitable tank and heated by means of a closed steam coil to 100 f 38 c a third of the necessary weak caustic soda lye added in a fine stream or by means of a sprinkler and the whole well agitated with a mechanical agitator or by blowing a current of air through a pipe laid on the bottom of the tank prolonged agitation with air has a tendency to oxidise the oil which increases its specific gravity and refractive index and will be found in the soappan to produce a reddish soap as the treatment proceeds the temperature may be carefully raised by means of the steam coil to 120 f 49 c the first treatment having proceeded fifteen minutes the contents of the tank are allowed to rest the settling should be prolonged as much as possible say overnight to allow the impurities to precipitate well and carry down the least amount of entangled oil having withdrawn these coloured foots the second portion of the weak caustic soda solution is agitated with the partially refined oil and when the latter is sufficiently treated it is allowed to rest and the settled coloured liquor drawn off as before the oil is now ready for the final treatment which is performed in the same manner as the two previous ones on settling a clear yellow oil separates if desired the oil may be brightened and filtered after refining to produce a marketable article but if it is being refined for own use in the soaphouse this may be omitted the residue or foots produced during the refining of crude cottonseed oil known in the trade as mucilage may be converted into soapstock as mentioned in the preceding chapter or decomposed by a mineral acid and made into black grease ready for distillation by superheated steam vegetable oilsthe other vegetable oils come to the soapmakers hand in a refined condition occasionally however it is desirable to remove a portion of the free fatty acids which treatment also causes the colouring matter to be preciptated this is effected by bringing the oil and a weak solution of caustic lye into intimate contact cocoanut oil is often treated in this manner sometimes it is only necessary to well agitate the oil with 112 per cent of its weight of a 12 tw 8 b solution of caustic soda and allow to settle the foots are utilised in the soappan animal fatstallows are often greatly improved by the above alkaline treatment at 165 f 73 c it is one of the best methods and possesses advantages over acid processesthe caustic soda removes the free acid and bodies of aldehyde nature which are most probably the result of oxidation or polymerisation whereas the neutral fat is not attacked and further the alkaline foots can be used in the production of soap bone fat often contains calcium lime salts which are very objectionable substances in a soappan these impurities must be removed by a treatment with hydrochloric or sulphuric acid the former acid is preferable as the lime salt formed is readily soluble and easily removed the fat is agitated with a weak solution of acid in a leadlined tank by blowing in steam and when the treatment is complete and the waste liquor withdrawn the last traces of acid are well washed out of the liquid fat with hot water rosinseveral methods have been suggested for bleaching rosin in some instances the constitution of the rosin is altered and in others the cost is too great or the process impracticable the aim of these processes must necessarily be the elimination of the colouring matter without altering the original properties of the substance this is best carried out by converting the rosin into a resinate of soda by boiling it with a solution of either caustic soda or carbonated alkali the process is commenced by heating 37 cwt of 17 tw 11 b caustic soda lye and adding 20 cwt of rosin broken into pieces and continuing the boiling until all the resinate is homogeneous when an addition of 112 cwt of salt is made and the boiling prolonged a little on resting the coloured liquor rises to the surface of the resinate and may be siphoned off or pumped away through a skimmer pipe and the resinate further washed with water containing a little salt the treatment with carbonated alkali is performed in a similar manner a solution consisting of 234 cwt of soda ash 58 in about four times its weight of water is heated and 20 cwt of rosin broken into small pieces added the whole is heated by means of the open steam coil and care must be taken to avoid boiling over owing to the liberation of co2 gas frothing takes place a large number of patents have been granted for the preparation of resinate of soda and many methods devised to obviate the boiling over some suggest mixing the rosin and soda ash or only a portion of the soda ash prior to dissolving in water others saponify in a boiler connected with a trap which returns the resinate to the pan and allows the carbonicacid gas to escape or to be collected with due precaution the method can be easily worked in open vessels and using the above proportions there will be sufficient uncombined rosin remaining to allow the resultant product to be pumped into the soap with which it is intended to intermix it where it will be finally saponified thoroughly the salt required which in the example given would be 112 cwt may be added to the solution prior to the addition of rosin or sprinkled in towards the finish of the boiling when the whole has been sufficiently boiled and allowed to rest the liquor containing the colouring matter will float over the resinate and after removal may be replaced by another washing many other methods have been suggested for the bleaching refining and treatment of materials intended for saponification but the above practical processes are successfully employed all fats and oils after being melted by the aid of steam must be allowed to thoroughly settle and the condensed water and impurities withdrawn through a trap arrangement for collecting the fatty matter the molten settled fatty materials en route to the soappan should be passed through sieves sufficiently fine to free them from suspended matter chapter v

of the deglycerised products mentioned in chapter ii section 2 and of carbonated alkalies or caustic soda or potash fatty acids are readily saponified with caustic soda or caustic potash of all strengths the saponification by means of carbonated alkali may be performed in an open vat containing a steam coil or in a pan provided with a removable agitator it is usual to take soda ash 58 amounting to 19 per cent of the weight of fatty acids to be saponified and dissolve it in water by the aid of steam until the density of the solution is 53 tw 30 b then bring to the boil and whilst boiling add the molten fatty acids slowly but not continuously combination takes place immediately with evolution of carbonic acid gas which causes the contents of the vat or pan to swell and frequently to boil over the use of the agitator or the cessation of the flow of fatty acids will sometimes tend to prevent the boiling over it is imperative that the steam should not be checked but boiling continued as vigorously as possible until all the alkali has been absorbed and the gas driven off the use of air to replace steam in expelling the carbonic acid gas has been patented fr pat 333974 1903 a better method of procedure however is to commence with a solution of 64 tw 35 b density made from half the requisite soda ash 912 per cent and when this amount of alkali has all been taken up by the fatty acids which have been added gradually and with continuous boiling the remaining quantity of soda ash is added in a dry state being sprinkled over each further addition of fatty acid this allows the process to be more easily controlled and boiling over is avoided it is essential that the boiling by steam should be well maintained throughout the process until all carbonic acid gas has been thoroughly expelled when that point is reached the steam may be lessened and the contents of the vat or pan gently boiled on strength with a little caustic lye until it ceases to absorb caustic alkali the soap being finished in the manner described under d it is extremely difficult to prevent discoloration of fatty acids hence the products of saponification in this way do not compare favourably in appearance with those produced from the original neutral oil or fat b treatment of fat with definite amount of alkali and no separation of waste lyecoldprocess soap is a type of this class and its method of production is based upon the characteristic property which the glycerides of the lower fatty acids members of the cocoanutoil class possess of readily combining with a strong caustic soda solution at a low temperature and evolving sufficient heat to complete the saponification sometimes tallow lard cottonseed oil palm oil and even castor oil are used in admixture with cocoanut oil the process for such soap is the same as when cocoanut oil is employed alone with the slight alteration in temperature necessary to render the fats liquid and the amount of caustic lye required will be less soaps made of these blends closely resemble in appearance milled toilet soaps in such mixtures the glycerides of the lower fatty acids commence the saponification and by means of the heat generated induce the other materials which alone would saponify with difficulty or only with the application of heat to follow suit it is necessary to use high grade materials the oils and fats should be free from excess of acidity to which many of the defects of coldprocess soaps may be traced owing to the rapidity with which free acidity is neutralised by caustic soda granules of soap are formed which in the presence of strong caustic lye are grained out and difficult to remove without increasing the heat the soap will thus tend to become thick and gritty and sometimes discoloured the caustic lye should be made from the purest caustic soda containing as little carbonate as possible the water used for dissolving or diluting the caustic soda should be soft ie free from calcium and magnesium salts and all the materials carefully freed from particles of dirt and fibre by straining the temperature which of course must vary with the season should be as low as is consistent with fluidity and for cocoanut oil alone may be 75 f 24 c but in mixtures containing tallow 100 to 120 f 38 to 49 c the process is generally carried out as follows the fluid cocoanut oil is stirred in a suitable vessel with half its weight of 714 tw 38 b caustic soda lye at the same temperature and when thoroughly mixed the pan is covered and allowed to rest it is imperative that the oils and fats and caustic lye should be intimately incorporated or emulsified the agitating may be done mechanically there being several machines specially constructed for the purpose in one of the latest designs the caustic lye is delivered through a pipe which rotates with the stirring gear and the whole is driven by means of a motor the agitation being complete chemical action takes place with the generation of heat and finally results in the saponification of the fats at first the contents of the pan are thin but in a few hours they become a solid mass as the process advances the edges of the soap become more transparent and when the transparency has extended to the whole mass the soap is ready after perfuming to be framed and crutched the admixture of a little caustic potash with the caustic soda greatly improves the appearance of the resultant product which is smoother and milder the glycerine liberated during the saponification is retained in the soap although it is possible with care to produce neutral soaps of good appearance and firm touch by this method coldprocess soaps are very liable to contain both free alkali and unsaponified fat and have now fallen considerably into disrepute saponification under increased or diminished pressuresoaps made by boiling fats and oils under pressure and in vacuo with the exact quantity of caustic soda necessary for complete combination belong also to this class amongst the many attempts which have at various times been made to shorten the process of soapmaking may be mentioned haywoods patent no 759 1901 and jourdans french patent no 339154 1903 in the former saponification is carried out in a steamjacketed vacuum chamber provided with an elaborate arrangement of stirrers in the other process fat is allowed to fall in a thin stream into the amount of lye required for saponification previously placed in the saponification vessel which is provided with stirring gear when the quantities have been added steam is admitted and saponification proceeds c treatment of fat with indefinite amount of alkali and no separation of waste lyesoft soap is representative of this class the vegetable fluid oils linseed olive cottonseed maize are for the most part used in making this soap though occasionally bone fats and tallow are employed rosin is sometimes added the proportion ranging according to the grade of soap required from 5 to 15 per cent of the fatty matter the soft soap manufacturers convention of holland stipulate that the materials used in softsoap making must not contain more than 5 per cent rosin it is also interesting to note that a patent has been granted eng pat 17278 1900 for the manufacture of soft soap from material containing 50 per cent rosin fish or marine animal oilswhale seal etc once largely used as raw material for soft soap have been superseded by vegetable oils the materials must be varied according to the season during hot weather more body with a less tendency to separate is given by the introduction of oils and fats richer in stearine these materials also induce figging the most important material however is the caustic potash lye which should average 40 tw 24 b ie if a weak solution is used to commence saponification a stronger lye must be afterwards employed to avoid excess of water in the soap and these average 40 tw 24 b the potash lye must contain carbonates which help to give transparency to the resultant soap if the lye is somewhat deficient in carbonates they may be added in the form of a solution of refined pearl ash potassium carbonate caustic soda lye is sometimes admixed to the extent of onefourth with potash lye to keep the soap firmer during hot weather but it requires great care as a slight excess of soda gives soft soap a bad appearance and a tendency to separate the process is commenced by running fatty matter and weak potash lyes into the pan or copper and boiling together whilst the introduction of oil and potash lye is continued the saponification commences when an emulsion forms and the lye is then run in more quickly to prevent the mass thickening having added sufficient strength for complete saponification the boiling is continued until the soap becomes clear the condition of the soap is judged by observing the behaviour of a small sample taken from the pan and dropped on glass or iron if the soap is satisfactory it will set firm have a short texture and slightly opaque edge and be quite clear when held towards the light if the cooled sample draws out in threads there is an excess of water present if an opaque edge appears and vanishes the soap requires more lye if the sample is turbid and somewhat white the soap is too alkaline and needs more oil the glycerine liberated during saponification is contained in the soap and no doubt plays a part in the production of transparency hydrated soaps both smooth and marbled are included in this classification but are soda soaps soap made from cocoanut oil and palmkernel oil will admit of the incorporation of large quantities of a solution of either salt carbonate of soda or silicate of soda without separation and will retain its firmness these materials are therefore particularly adapted for the manufacture of marine soaps which often contain as much as 80 per cent of water and being soluble in brine are capable of use in seawater for the same reason cocoanut oil enters largely into the constitution of hydrated soaps but the desired yield or grade of soap allows of a variation in the choice of materials whilst marine soap for example is usually made from cocoanut oil or palmkernel oil only a charge of 23 cocoanut oil and 13 tallow or even 23 tallow and 13 cocoanut oil will produce a paste which can carry the solutions of silicate carbonate and salt without separation and yield a smooth firm soap the fatty materials carefully strained and freed from particles of dirt and fibre are boiled with weak caustic soda lye until combination has taken place saponification being complete the solution of salt is added then the carbonate of soda solution and finally the silicate of soda solution after which the soap is boiled when thoroughly mixed steam is shut off and the soap is ready for framing the marbled hydrated soap is made from cocoanut oil or a mixture of palmkernel oil and cocoanut oil with the aid of caustic soda lye 3212 tw 20 b as soon as saponification is complete the brine and carbonate of soda solution are added and the pan allowed to rest the soap is then carefully tasted as to its suitability for marbling by taking samples and mixing with the colouring solution ultramarine mixed with water or silicate of soda solution if the sample becomes blue throughout the soap is too alkaline if the colour is precipitated the soap is deficient in alkali the right point has been reached when the marbling is distributed evenly having thus ascertained the condition of the pan and corrected it if necessary the colour mixed in water or in silicate of soda solution is added and the soap framed d treatment of fat with indefinite amount of alkali and separation of waste lyethis is the most general method of soapmaking the various operations are a pasting or saponification b graining out or separation c boiling on strength and in the case of milling soap base and household soaps d fitting a pasting or saponificationthe melted fats and oils are introduced into the soappan and boiled by means of open steam with a caustic soda lye 14 to 235 tw 10 to 15 b whether the fatty matters and alkali are run into the pan simultaneously or separately is immaterial provided the alkali is not added in sufficient excess to retard the union the commencement of the saponification is denoted by the formation of an emulsion sometimes it is difficult to start the saponification the presence of soap will often assist this by emulsifying the fat and thus bringing it into intimate contact with the caustic soda solution when the action has started caustic soda lye of a greater density 29 to 33 tw 18 to 20 b is frequently added with continued boiling in small quantities as long as it is being absorbed which is ascertained by taking out samples from time to time and examining them there should be no greasiness in the sample but when pressed between finger and thumb it must be firm and dry boiling is continued until the faint caustic taste on applying the cooled sample to the tongue is permanent when it is ready for graining out the pasty mass now consists of the soda salts of the fat as imperfect soap probably containing emulsified diglycerides and monoglycerides together with water in which is dissolved the glycerine formed by the union of the liberated glyceryl radicle from the fat with the hydroxyl radicle of the caustic soda and any slight excess of caustic soda and carbonates the object of the next operation is to separate this water spent lye from the soap b graining out or separationthis is brought about by the use of common salt in a dry form or in solution as brine or by caustic soda lye whilst the soap is boiling the salt is spread uniformly over its surface or brine 40 tw 24 b is run in and the whole well boiled together the soap must be thoroughly boiled after each addition of salt and care taken that too large a quantity is not added at once as the soap is gradually thrown out of solution it loses its smooth transparent appearance and becomes opaque and granular when a sample taken out on a wooden trowel consists of distinct grains of soap and a liquid portion which will easily separate sufficient salt or brine has been added the boiling is stopped and the spent lye allowed to settle out whilst the soap remains on the surface as a more or less thick mass the separated spent lye consists of a solution of common salt glycerine and alkaline salts the preparation of crude glycerine therefrom is considered in chapter ix the degree of separation of water spent lye depends upon the amount of precipitant used the aim is to obtain a maximum amount of spent lye separated by the use of a minimum quantity of salt the amount of salt required for graining out varies with the raw material used a tallow soap is the most easily grained more salt is required for cottonseed oil soap whereas soaps made from cocoanut and palmkernel oils require very large amounts of salt to grain out thoroughly owing to the solubility in weak brine of these latter soaps it is preferable to grain them with caustic soda lye this is effected by adding during boiling sufficient caustic lye 3212 tw 20 b to produce the separation of the granules of soap the whole is allowed to rest the separated halfspent lye is withdrawn and may be used for the pasting of fresh materials after the removal of the settled lye the grained mass is boiled with sufficient water to dissolve the grain and make it smooth close it and is now ready for the next operation of boiling on strength c boiling on strength or clear boilingthis is the most important operation and is often termed making the soap the object is to harden the soap and to ensure complete saponification caustic soda lye 3212 tw 20 b is gradually added until the soap is again opened or grained and boiling continued by the use of the dry steam coil as soon as the caustic soda lye is absorbed another portion is slowly added and this is continued until the caustic soda or strength remains permanent and the soapy mass refusing to absorb more is thrown out of solution and grained the granular mass will boil steadily and the boiling should be prolonged as the last traces of neutral oil are difficult to completely saturate with alkali thorough saponification takes place gradually and the operation cannot be hurried special care has to be bestowed upon this operation to effect the complete combination of fat and alkali after resting for several hours halfspent lye settles to the bottom of the pan in the case of yellow soaps or milling bases the settled lye is removed to a suitable receptacle and reserved for use in the saponification of other material and the soap is then ready for the final operation of fitting d fittingif the operations just described have been properly performed the fitting should present no difficulty the soap is boiled with open steam and water added until the desired degree of closing is attained as the water is thoroughly intermixed throughout the mass the thick paste gradually becomes reduced to a smooth thin consistence samples are tested from time to time as to their behaviour in dropping off a hot trowel held sideways the thin layer should drop off in two or three flakes and leave the surface of the trowel clean and dry the soap is then in a condition to allow the impurities to gravitate according to the required soap the fit may be coarse open when the flakes drop off the trowel readily or fine close when the flakes only leave the trowel with difficulty if the dilution with water has been allowed to proceed too far and too fine a fit is produced which would be denoted by the layer of soap not leaving the trowel a little caustic lye or brine may be very carefully added and the whole well boiled until the desired condition is obtained a good pressure of steam is now applied to the pan causing the contents to swell as high as possible this greatly facilitating the settling of impurities steam is then turned off the pan covered and the boil allowed to rest for several days the art of fitting consists in leaving the contents of the pan in such a condition that on standing all the impurities precipitate and the settled soap containing the correct amount of water is clear and bright the above is a general practical outline of the ordinary soapboiling process it may be modified or slightly altered according to the fancy of the individual soapmaker or the particular material it is desired to use fats and oils not only vary in the amount of alkali they absorb during saponification but also differ in the strength of the alkali they require tallow and palm oil require lye of a density of 15 to 18 tw 10 to 12 b but cocoanut oil alone would not saponify unless the lye was more concentrated 33 to 42 tw 20 to 25 b cottonseed oil requires weak lyes for saponification and being difficult to saponify alone even with prolonged boiling is generally mixed with animal fat when fats are mixed together however their varying alkali requirements become modified and once the saponification is begun with weak lye other materials are induced to take up alkali of a strength with which alone they would not combine it is considered the best procedure to commence the pasting or saponification with weak lye in order to economise tank space it is the general practice to store strong caustic lye 60 to 70 tw 33 to 37 b and to dilute it as it is being added to the soappan by the simultaneous addition of water many manufacturers give all their soap a brine wash to remove the last traces of glycerine and free the soap from carbonates this operation takes place prior to fitting sufficient water is added to the boiling soap to close it and then brine is run in to grain it after resting the liquor is withdrawn having described the necessary operations in general we will now consider their application to the preparation of various kinds of hard soap curd soapstallow is largely used in the manufacture of white curd soaps but cocoanut oil sometimes enters into their composition the first three operations above described viz pasting graining out and boiling on strength are proceeded with the clear boiling by means of a closed steam coil is continued until the head is boiled out and the soap is free from froth a sample taken and cooled should be hard boiling is then stopped and after covering the pan is allowed to rest for eight to ten hours when the soap is ready for filling into frames where it is crutched until perfectly smooth curd mottled is usually made from melted kitchen stuff and bone grease its preparation is substantially the same as for curd soap but the clear boiling is not carried so far the art of curd mottled soapmaking lies in the boiling if boiled too long the mottling will not form properly and on the other hand insufficient boiling will cause the soap to contain an excess of entangled lye having boiled it to its correct concentration the pan is allowed to rest about two hours after which the soap is ready for framing which should be done expeditiously and the frames covered up some lye containing the impurities from the fats used remains in the interstices of the curd unable to sink and as the soap cools it is enclosed and forms the mottling the mottling may therefore be considered as a crystallisation of the soap in which the impurity forms the colour blue and grey mottled soapsthese are silicated or liquored soaps in which the natural mottling due to the impure materials used in the early days of soapmaking is imitated by artificial mottling and are consequently entirely different to curd mottled soaps the materials employed in making mottled soap comprise bleached palm oil tallow bone fat cocoanut oil palmkernel oil cottonseed oil and in some instances rosin the choice of a charge will naturally depend upon the cost the property of absorbing a large amount of liquor which is characteristic of soaps made from cocoanut oil and palmkernel oil is taken advantage of as are also the physical properties of the various fats and oils with a view to the crystallisation of the resultant soap and the development of the mottle the fat is saponified grained and boiled on strength as previously described after withdrawing the halfspent lye the soap is just closed by boiling with water and is then ready for the silicate or other saline additions soap intended to be liquored with silicate of soda should be distinctly strong in free alkali the crystalline nature of the soap is increased thereby and the mottled effect intensified some makers however fit the soap coarsely and allow a nigre to deposit then after removing the nigre or transferring the settled soap to another copper containing scraps of mottled soap get the soap into a condition for mottling and add the silicate of soda solution to every 1 cwt of soap 28 lb of silicate of soda solution 3212 tw 20 b is added whilst boiling the strength of the silicate solution however will depend upon the proportion of cocoanut oil and palmkernel oil present in the charge many soapmakers use 20 tw 13 b cold silicate solution whilst others prefer 140 tw 595 b with the gradual addition of water to the soap kept boiling until the product is in the correct mottling condition and others again use bleach liquor soda crystals pearl ash and salt together with silicate solution considerable skill and experience is necessary to discern when the soap acquires the correct mottling state it should drop off the spatula in large thick flakes take considerable time to set and the surface should not be glossy when this mottling condition has been obtained the colouring matter which would be ultramarine for the blue mottled and manganese dioxide for the grey mottled soap 34 lb ultramarine or 13 lb manganese dioxide being sufficient for 1 ton of soap is mixed with a little water and added to the boiling soapthe boiling is continued until all is thoroughly amalgamated and when the steam is shut off the contents of the pan are ready for cleansing mottled soap is run into wooden frames which when full are covered over and allowed to cool very gradually on cooling slowly large crystals are produced which result in a distinct bold mottle if the cooling is too rapid a small crystal is obtained and the mottle is not distributed resulting in either a small mottle or no mottle at all and merely a general coloration in fact the entire art of mottling soap consists in properly balancing the saline solutions and colouring matter so that the latter is properly distributed throughout the soap and does not either separate in coloured masses at the bottom of the frame or uniformly colour the whole mass a sample of the soap should test 45 per cent fatty acids and the amount of salt would range from 12 to 1 per cent some of the english mottled soaps especially those made from materials which give a yellowcoloured ground are bleached by soaking in brine or pickling in brine containing 2 per cent of bleach liquor the resultant soap has a white ground and is firm the bleach liquor may be made by mixing 1 cwt bleaching powder with 10 cwts of soda ash solution 15 tw 10 b allowing to settle and using the clear liquid or by mixing 2 parts soda ash solution with 1 part of bleaching powder solution both solutions being 30 tw 188 b millingbasethe materials generally used are tallows and cocoanut oils of the finest quality the tallow is thoroughly saponified first and the graining is performed by the aid of caustic soda lye in preference to salt the halfspent lyes are withdrawn and the cocoanut oil added to the pan this is saponified and when the saponification is complete boilingonstrength is proceeded with special care should be devoted to the boilingonstrength operationits value in good soapmaking cannot be overratedand perfect saponification must be ensured the halfspent lyes are allowed to deposit during the night and the soap must be carefully examined next morning to ascertain if any alkali has been absorbed if the caustic taste is permanent the strengthening operation is complete but should any caustic have been absorbed further addition of alkali must be made and the boiling continued these remarks apply equally to all soaps the soap when ready is fitted bleached palm oil olive oil castor oil and lard are also employed in the production of special milling soap bases a palm oil soap being specially suitable for the production of a violetscented toilet soap yellow household soaps a bar soapsthese are made from tallow with an admixture of from 1525 per cent rosin the best quality is known in the south and west of england as primrose soap but is designated in the north of england by such names as golden pale imperial pale gold medal pale etc tallow alone produces a very hard soap of inferior lathering qualities but rosin combines with alkali to form a soft body which although not a soap in the strict sense of the term is readily soluble in water and in admixture with the durable tallow soap renders it more soluble in water and thereby increases its lathering properties the rosin may be added to the soappan after a previous partial saponification with soda ash and removal of colouring matter and finally saponified with caustic soda lye or as is more generally adopted as a rosin change the pan is opened with caustic soda lye and saturation of the rosin takes place rapidly when completely saponified it is grained with salt and the coloured lye allowed to deposit and finally withdrawn the four operations already detailed apply to this soap cheaper pale soaps may be made from lower grades of tallow and rosin and are generally silicated b tablet or washer typea demand has arisen for soap of free lathering qualities which has become very popular for general household use this soap is usually made from a mixture of cottonseed oil tallow and cocoanut oil with a varying amount of rosin the tallow yields firmness and durability whilst the other constituents all assist in the more ready production of a copious lather as to what amount of rosin can be used to yield a finished soap of sufficient body and satisfactory colour this naturally depends upon the grade of raw material at the soapmakers disposal those fats and oils which yield firm soaps will of course allow a greater proportion of rosin to be incorporated with them than materials producing soaps of less body rosin imparts softness to a soap and also colour this is a fitted soap and full details of manufacture have already been given cheaper soaps are produced from lower grade materials hardened with alkaline solutions resting of pans and settling of soapthe fitted soap is allowed to settle from four to six days the period allowed for resting is influenced however not only by the size of the boil and the season but also by the composition of the soap for if the base has been made from firm stock it is liable to cool quicker than a soap produced from softbodied materials on subsidence the contents of the pan will have divided into the following first on top a thin crust of soap with perhaps a little light coloured fob which is returned to the pan after the removal of the good soap second the good settled soap testing 6263 per cent fatty acids the subject of removing and treatment of this layer is fully dealt with in the next chapter third a layer of darker weak soap termed nigre which on an average tests 33 per cent fatty acids and according to the particular fit employed will amount to from 1520 per cent of the total quantity of soap in the pan the quantity of nigre may vary not only with the amount of water added during finishing but is also influenced by the amount of caustic alkali remaining in the soap paste prior to fitting if the free caustic alkalicontent is high the soap will require a large amount of water to attain the desired fit this water renders the caustic into a lye sufficiently weak to dissolve a quantity of soap consequently as the nigre is a weak solution of soap together with any excess of alkali caustic or carbonate and salt which gravitates during the settling the quantity is increased fourth a solution containing alkaline salts mostly carbonates and chlorides with a little caustic the amount of the layer is very variable and doubtless under certain physical conditions this liquor has separated from the nigre utilisation of nigresthe nigres are boiled and the liquor separated by graining with salt nigre may be utilised in various ways 1 it may be used several times with new materials this particularly refers to soaps of the washer type the colour of the nigre will determine the number of times it can be employed 2 it may be incorporated with a soap of a lower grade than the one from which it was obtained in this case a system is generally adopted for example soap of the best quality is made in a clean pan the nigre remaining is worked up with fresh material for soap of the next quality the nigre from that boil in its turn is admixed with a charge to produce a batch of third quality and the deposited nigre from this is again used for a fourth quality soapthe nigre obtained from this latter boil would probably be transferred into the cheapened washer or perhaps if it was dark in colour into the brown soappan 3 the nigre may be fitted and produce a soap similar to the original soap from which it was deposited it is advisable to saponify a little fat with it 4 nigres from several boils of the same kind of soap can be collected boiled and fitted the settled portion may be incorporated with a new charging to keep the resultant soap uniform in colourunless this is done the difference in colour between boils from new materials alone and those containing nigre is very noticeable the nigre settled from this fitted nigre boil would be utilised in brown soap 5 according to its colour and consistence a nigre may be suitable for the production of disinfectant or coldwater soaps 6 nigre may be bleached by treatment with a 20 per cent solution of stannous chloride1 cwt of this solution previously heated is sufficient to bleach 20 tons of nigre transparent soapsthe production of transparent soaps has recently been fully studied from a theoretical point of view by richardson j amer chem soc 1908 pp 41420 who concludes that the function of substances inducing transparency is to produce a jelly and retard crystallisation the oldfashioned transparent soap is prepared by dissolving previously dried genuine yellow soap in alcohol and allowing the insoluble saline impurities to be deposited and removed the alcoholic soap solution is then placed in a distillation apparatus or the pan containing the solution is attached by means of a still head to a condenser and the alcohol distilled condensed and regained the remaining liquid soap which may be coloured and perfumed is run into frames and allowed to solidify the resultant mass is somewhat turbid but after storage in a room at 95 f 35 c for several months becomes transparent the formation of the transparency is sometimes assisted and hastened by the addition of glycerine or a solution of canesugar a patent has been granted to a ruch fr pat 327293 1902 for the manufacture of transparent glycerine soap by heating in a closed vessel fatty acids together with the requisite quantity of alcoholic caustic soda solution necessary for saponification and cooling the resultant soap it is also proposed to add sugar solution cheaper qualities of transparent soaps are made by the cold process with or without the aid of alcohol and castor oil and with the assistance of glycerine or canesugar with the continual demand for cheaper production sugar solution has gradually in conjunction with castor oil which produces transparency superseded the use of alcohol and glycerine for a small batch 56 lb cochin cocoanut oil and 56 lb sweet edible tallow may be taken melted at 130 f 54 c and carefully strained into a small steamjacketed pan it is imperative that the materials should be of the highest quality and perfectly clean twentythree lb of pure glycerine and 56 lb of bright caustic soda solution made from high grade caustic and having a density of 72 tw 38 b are crutched into the fat the alcohol which would be 45 lb in this example is then added the whole must be most intimately incorporated and the pan covered and allowed to rest for one hour or one and a half hours saponification should ensue to produce a transparent glycerine soap with the aid of castor oil and with or without the use of alcohol the following is the procedure cochin cocoanut oil sweet edible tallow and castor oil of each 56 lb are taken warmed to 130 f 54 c and carefully strained into the jacketed pan if it is desired to use glycerine and cane sugar solution and no alcohol the glycerine 25 lb is now stirred into the fats together with the requisite 83 lb caustic soda solution 72 tw 38 b if it is intended to use alcohol and sugar and no glycerine the latter is replaced by 47 lb of alcohol and added after the incorporation of the caustic soda lye the whole being thoroughly crutched the pan is covered and saponification allowed to proceed for one hour or one and a half hours should the saponification for some reason be retarded a little steam may be very cautiously admitted to the jacket of the pan the mass well crutched until the reaction commences and the whole allowed to rest the specified time whilst saponification is proceeding the sugar solution is prepared by dissolving 50 lb cane sugar in 50 lb water at 168 f 76 c to which may be added 5 lb soda crystals and any necessary colouring matter the water used for this solution should be as soft as possible as hard water is liable to produce opaque streaks of lime soap it is absolutely necessary before proceeding further to ensure that saponification is complete a greasy soft feel and the presence of strength caustic would denote incomplete saponificationthis can only be remedied by further heating and crutching deficiency of caustic alkali should also be avoided and if more lye is required great care must be exercised in its addition saponification being completed the sugar solution is carefully and gradually crutched into the soap when the contents of the pan have become a homogeneous and syrupy mass the crutching is discontinued and the pan is covered for one hour the heat of the soap in the pan should not exceed 170 f 77 c having rested the necessary period the soap will have a slight froth on the surface but will be clear underneath and appear dark samples may now be withdrawn cooled and examined prior to framing if the process has been successfully performed the soap will be firm and transparent of uniform colour and possess only a faintly alkaline taste if the sample be firm but opaque more sugar solution is required this should be added very carefully whilst crutching an excess being specially guarded against if the sample be soft although transparent and the alkaline taste not too pronounced the soap evidently contains an excess of water which may be remedied by the addition of a small quantity of soda ash too much soda ash carbonates must be avoided lest it should produce efflorescence having examined the soap and found it to be correct or having remedied its defects the soap in the pan is allowed to cool to 145 f 63 c and perfume added the soap is now quickly filled into narrow frames and allowed to cool rapidly the blocks of soap should not be stripped until quite cold throughout and they should be allowed to stand open for a while before slabbing when freshly cut into tablets the soap may appear somewhat turbid but the brightness comes with the exposure it will receive prior to stamping and wrapping saponifying mineral oilthis sounds somewhat incongruous as mineral oil is entirely unsaponifiable most of the suggestions for this purpose consist of the incorporation of mineral oil or mineral oil emulsified by aid of quillaia bark with a cocoanut oil soap and in all these instances the hydrocarbon merely exists in suspension g reale fr pat 321510 1902 however proposes to heat mineral oil together with spermaceti and strong alkali and states that he transforms the hydrocarbons into alcohols and these absorbing oxygen become fatty acids which are converted into soap by means of the alkali in this connection may be quoted the interesting work of zelinsky russ phys chem ges zeits angew chem 1903 37 he obtained substances by acting with carbon dioxide upon magnesia compounds of chlorinated fractions of petroleum which when decomposed by dilute sulphuric acid yielded various organic acids one of these acids on heating with glycerine formed trioctin which had the properties of a fat dr engler in confirmation of the theory of the animal origin of some petroleums obtained what might be described

directly into wheelframes placed underneath the outlet of the pan it is important that the blades or worm of the agitating gear be covered with soap to avoid the occlusion of air and to prevent the soap becoming soft and spongy illustration fig 8wooden soap spout liquoring of soapsthis consists of the addition of various alkaline solutions to soap to produce different qualities and is best performed in the crutching machines although it is in some instances carried out in the frames in the history of soapmaking a large number and variety of substances have been suggested for the purpose of accomplishing some real or supposed desirable effect when added to soap many of these have had only a very short existence and others have gradually fallen out of use amongst the more practical additions most frequently adopted may be mentioned carbonate of soda silicate of soda and pearl ash impure carbonate of potash the carbonate of soda may be used in the form of soda crystals which containing 629 per cent of water dissolves in its own water of crystallisation on heating and is in that manner added to the hot soap in the case of weakbodied soap this addition gives firmness and tends to increase the detergent qualities the soda carbonate may also be added to soap as a solution of soda ash 58 alkali either concentrated 62 tw 34 b or of various strengths from 25 tw 16 b upwards this solution stiffens and hardens soap and the addition which must not be excessive or efflorescence will occur is generally made at a temperature of 140 f 60 c care should always be taken in the choice of solutions for liquoring strong soda ash solution with a firm soap will result in a brittle product whereas the texture of a weak soap would be greatly improved by such addition a slight addition of a weak solution of pearl ash 48 tw 2754 b improves the appearance of many soaps intended for household purposes for yellow soaps containing a low percentage of fatty acids solutions of silicate of soda of varying strengths are generally used it is always advisable to have a test sample made with the soap to ascertain what proportion and what strength of sodium silicate solution is best suited for the grade of soap it is desired to produce it is important that the soap to be silicated should be distinctly alkaline ie have a distinct caustic taste or the resultant soap is liable to become like stone with age the alkaline silicate of soda 140 tw 595 b is the quality most convenient for yellow soaps this may be diluted to the desired gravity by boiling with water for a reduction of 34 per cent fatty acids content a solution of 6 tw 4 b boiling is most suitable and if the reduction desired is greater the density of the silicate solution should be increased for example to effect a reduction of 20 per cent fatty acids content a solution of 18 tw 12 b boiling would probably be found to answer in some instances 140 tw 595 b silicate may be added experiment alone will demonstrate the amount which can be satisfactorily incorporated without the soap becoming open but 110 of the quantity of soap taken is practically a limit and it will be found that the temperature should be low the same quantity of silicate at different temperatures does not produce the same result various other strengths of sodium silicate are employed depending upon the composition and body of the soap baseneutral silicate 75 tw 394 b also finds favour with some soapmakers mixtures of soda crystals or soda ash solution with silicate of soda solution are used for a certain grade of soap which is crutched until smooth and stiff glaubers salt sodium sulphate produces a good smooth surface when added to soap but owing to its tendency to effloresce more quickly than soda carbonate it is not so much used as formerly common salt sometimes forms an ingredient in liquoring mixtures potassium chloride and potassium silicate find a limited use for intermixing with soft soaps it will be readily understood that hard and fast rules cannot be laid down for liquoring soap and the correct solution to be employed can only be ascertained by experiment and experience but the above suggestions will prove useful as a guide towards good results a smooth firm soap of clear bright glossy appearance is what should be aimed at fillingsome lowgrade soaps contain filling which serves no useful purpose beyond the addition of weight talc is the most frequently used article of this description it consists of hydrated silicate of magnesium and when finely ground is white and greasy to the touch the addition of this substance to the hot soap is made by suspending it in silicate of soda solution whatever filling material is used it is important that the appearance of the soap should not be materially altered neutralising colouring and perfumingthe free caustic alkali in soap intended for toilet or laundry purposes is usually neutralised during the cleansing although some soap manufacturers prefer to accomplish this during the milling operation various materials have been recommended for the purpose those in most general use being sodium bicarbonate boric acid cocoanut oil stearic acid and oleic acid the best method is the addition of an exact quantity of sodium bicarbonate acid sodium carbonate which converts the caustic alkali into carbonate the reaction may be expressed by the equation naoh nahco3 na2co3 h2o caustic soda bicarbonate of soda carbonate of soda water boric acid in aqueous or glycerine solutions and borax biborate of soda are sometimes used but care is necessary in employing these substances as any excess is liable to decompose the soap the addition of cocoanut oil is unsatisfactory the great objection being that complete saponification is difficult to ensure and further there is always the liability of rancidity developing stearic and oleic acids are more suitable for the purpose but oleic acid has the disadvantage that oleates are very liable to go rancid a large number of other substances have been proposed and in many instances patented for neutralising the free caustic alkali among these may be mentionedalder wrights method of using an ammoniacal salt the acid radicle of which neutralises the caustic alkali ammonia being liberated the use of sodium and potassium bibasic phosphate eng pat

crutching pan and further crutching may be given by hand in the frames framingthe object of framing is to allow the soap to solidify into blocks the frames intended for mottled soaps which require slow cooling are constructed of wood often with a well in the base to allow excess of lye to accumulatefor other soaps iron frames are in general use the frame manufactured by h d morgan of liverpool is shown in fig 9 as soon as the frame is filled or as soon as the crutching in the frame is finished the soap is smoothed by means of a trowel leaving in the centre a heap which slopes towards the sides next day the top of the soap is straightened or flattened with a wooden mallet this treatment assisting in the consolidation illustration fig 9soap frame illustration fig 10slabbing machine the length of time the soap should remain in frames is dependent on the quality quantity and season or temperature and varies usually from three to seven days when the requisite period has elapsed the sides and ends of the frames are removed and there remains a solid block of soap weighing from 10 to 15 cwt according to the size of frame used the blocks after scraping and trimming are ready for cutting into slabs slabbingthis may be done mechanically by pushing the block of soap through a framework containing pianoforte wires fixed at equidistances fig 10 which shows a machine designed by e forshaw son ltd or the soap may be out by hand by pulling a looped wire through the mass horizontally along lines previously scribed or for a standard sized slab the wire may be a fixture in a boxlike arrangement which is passed along the top of the soap and the distance of the wire from the top of the box will be the thickness of the slab fig 11 illustration fig 11banjo slabber all tallow soaps should be slabbed whilst still warm cut into bars and openpiled immediately if this type of soap is cold when slabbed its appearance will be very much altered barringthe slabs are out transversely into bars by means of the looped wire or more usually by a machine fig 12 the lower framework of which containing wires is drawn through the soap placed on the baseboard the framework is raised and the bars fall upon the shelf ready for transference into piles it has long been the custom in england to cut bars of soap 15 inches long and weighing 3 lb each or 3712 bars of soap to the cwt but in recent years a demand has arisen for bars of so many various weights that it must be sometimes a difficult matter to know what sizes to stock in another type of barring machine portions of the slab previously cut to size are pushed against a framework carrying wires and the bars slide along a table ready for handling fig 13 in cutting machines through which washer household soap is being passed the bar is pushed at right angles through another frame containing wires which divides it into tablets these may be received upon racks and are ready for drying and stamping it is needless to say that the slabs and tablets are cut with a view to reducing the amount of waste to the lowest possible limit such a machine made by e forshaw son ltd is shown in fig 14 illustration fig 12barring machine

remain for two or three weeks when they will be in perfect condition for packing into boxes ready for distribution illustration fig 15soap stamp dryingoil soaps as soaps of the washer type are termed do not skin sufficiently by the openpiling treatment and are generally exposed on racks to a current of hot air in a drying chamber in order to produce the skin which prevents evaporation of water and allows of an impression being given by the stamp without the soap adhering to the dies it is of course understood that heavily liquored soaps are as a rule unsuitable for the drying treatment as the bars become unshapely and lose water rapidly stampingbar soaps are usually stamped by means of a handstamp containing removable or fixed brass letters fig 15 with a certain brand or designation of quality and the name of the manufacturer or vendor and are now ready for packing into boxes a very large bulk of the soap trade consists of the household quality in tablet form readily divided into

tablets being conveyed to and from the dies by means of endless belts such a machine is shown in the accompanying illustration fig 18 if necessary the soap is transferred to racks and exposed to the air after which it is ready for wrapping which is generally performed by manual labour although in some instances automatic wrapping machines are in use cardboard cartons are also used for encasing the wrapped tablets the object being that these are more conveniently handled by tradesmen and may be advantageously used to form an attractive window display coolingmany attempts have been made to shorten the time required for the framing and finishing of soap by cooling the liquid soap as it leaves the pan illustration fig 17soapstamping machine showing box mould with milling base this is successfully accomplished in the cressonnires plant by allowing the hot soap to fall upon the periphery of a revolving drum which can be cooled internally by means of water illustration fig 18automatic stamper in the case of household soaps where the resultant product must be of good appearance and have a firm texture the difficulty is to produce a bar fit for sale after the cooling has been performed as soap which has been suddenly chilled lacks the appearance of that treated in the ordinary way several patents have been granted for various methods of moulding into bars in tubes where the hot soap is cooled by being either surrounded by running water in a machine of similar construction to a candle machine or rotated through a cooling medium and numerous claims have been made both for mechanical appliances and for methods of removing or discharging the bars after cooling in many instances these have proved unsatisfactory owing to fracture of the crystalline structure moreover in passing through some of the devices for solidification after chilling the soap is churned by means of a worm or screw and this interferes with the firmness of the finished bar for as is well known soap which has been handled too much does not regain its former firmness and its appearance is rendered unsatisfactory a form of apparatus which is now giving satisfactory results is the leimdoerfer continuous cooler fig 19 this consists of a fixed charging hopper a a portable tank b containing tubes and a detachable box c which can be raised or lowered by means of a screw d the bottom of the hopper is fitted with holes corresponding with the cooling tubes e and closed by plugs c attached to a frame b which terminates above in a screw spindle a by means of which the frame and plugs can be raised and lowered so as to permit or stop the outflow of soap into the cooling tubes the tubes are closed at the bottom by slides d and the box b in which they are mounted is carried on a truck running on rails the charging hopper can be connected with the soappan by a pipe and when the hopper is filled with liquid soap the plugs c are raised and the air in the box c exhausted thus causing the soap to descend into the cooling tubes illustration fig 19leimdoerfer cooler the slides d are closed the screw d released and the box b moved away to make room for another at the end of the rail track is an ejecting device which pushes the cooled soap out of the tubes and the truck is run back on a side track to the machine for use over again in this way the apparatus can be worked

cotton and silk industriespatent textile soapsmiscellaneous soaps toilet soapsby the term toilet soap is inferred a soap specially adapted for toilet use by reason not only of its good detergent and lathering qualities but also on account of its freedom from caustic alkali and any other ingredient likely to cause irritation or injury to the skin toilet soaps may be simply classified according to their method of preparation into the following four classes 1 cold process soaps 2 settled boiled soaps 3 remelted soaps 4 milled soaps soaps of the first class are of comparatively trifling importance having been superseded by the other qualities details of the cold process have already been given on page 46 it is only necessary to add the desired perfume and colouring matter to the soap the second class consists of good quality settled soaps direct from the copper to which have been added prior to framing suitable perfume and colouring matter also if necessary dealkalising materials the third class is represented by soaps made by the old english method of remelting which are often termed perfumers or little pan soaps the soapbase or mixture of various kinds of soap is remelted in a steamjacketed pan or pan provided with steam coils and agitated the agitation must not be too vigorous or lengthy or the soap will become aerated when all the soap is molten additions of pearl ash solution are made to give it a finer and smoother texture render it more transparent and increase its lathering properties the necessary colour in a soluble form is well incorporated and lastly the perfume owing to volatilisation much of the perfume is lost when added to hot soap and it is necessary to add a large quantity to get the desired odour hence the cheaper essential oils have to be used so that the perfume of this class of soap is not so delicate as that of milled soaps although it is quite possible to produce remelted soaps as free from uncombined alkali as a milled toilet soap palmoil soap often forms the basis for yellow and brown toilet soaps of this class the oldfashioned brown windsor soap was originally a curd soap that with age and frequent remelting had acquired a brown tint by oxidation of the fatty acidsthe oftener remelted the better the resultant soap medicaments are sometimes added to these soaps eg camphor borax coaltar or carbolic oatmeal and bran have been recommended in combination with soap for toilet purposes and a patent eng pat 26396 1896 has been granted for the use of these substances together with woodfibre impregnated with boric acid after cooling in small frames the soap is slabbed and cut into blocks and finally into portions suitable for stamping in a press hand or steam driven with a design or lettering on each side milled toilet soapspractically all highclass soaps now on the market pass through the french or milling process this treatment as its name implies was first practised by the french who introduced it to this country and consists briefly of i drying ii milling and incorporating colour perfume or medicament iii compressing and iv cutting and stamping the advantages of milled soap over toilet soap produced by other methods are that the former containing less water and more actual soap is more economical in use possesses a better appearance and more elegant finish does not shrink or lose its shape is more uniform in composition and essential oils and delicate perfumes may be incorporated without fear of loss or deterioration only soap made from best quality fats is usually milled a suitable base being that obtained by saponifying a blend of the finest white tallow with a proportion not exceeding 25 per cent of cocoanut oil and prepared as described in chapter v the first essential of a milling base is that the saponification should be thorough and complete if this is not ensured rancidity is liable to occur and a satisfactory toilet soap cannot be produced the soap must not be short in texture or brittle and liable to split but of a firm and somewhat plastic consistency i dryingthe millingbase after solidification in the frames contains almost invariably from 28 to 30 per cent of water and this quantity must be reduced to rather less than half before the soap can be satisfactorily milled cutting the soap into bars or strips and open piling greatly facilitates the drying which is usually effected by chipping the soap and exposing it on trays to a current of hot air at 95105 f 3540 c there are several forms of drying chambers in which the trays of chips are placed upon a series of racks one above another and warm air circulated through and fig 21 shows a soap drying apparatus with fan made by w j fraser co ltd london the older method of heating the air by allowing it to pass over a pipe or flue through which the products of combustion from a coke or coal fire are proceeding under the floor of the drying chamber to a small shaft has been superseded by steam heat the air is either drawn or forced by means of quickly revolving fans through a cylinder placed in a horizontal position and containing steam coils or passed over steampipes laid under the iron grating forming the floor of the chamber illustration fig 21soapdrying apparatus it will be readily understood that in the case of a bad conductor of heat like soapchippings it is difficult to evaporate moisture without constantly moving them and exposing fresh surfaces to the action of heat in the cressonnires system where the shavings of chilled soap are dried by being carried through a heated chamber upon a series of endless bands the first discharging the contents on to a lower belt which projects at the end and is moving in the opposite direction and so on this is performed by intercepting milling rollers in the system of belts eng pat 4916 1898 whereby the surfaces exposed to the drying are altered and it is claimed that the formation of hardened crust is prevented in the ordinary methods of drying the chips are frequently moved by hand to assist uniform evaporation the degree of saturation of the air with moisture must be taken into consideration in regulating the temperature and flow of air through the drying chamber and for this purpose the use of a hygrometer is advantageous it is very important that the correct amount of moisture should be left in the soap not too much nor too little the exact point can only be determined by judgment and experience and depends to a considerable extent upon the nature of the soap and also on the amount of perfume or medicament to be added but speaking generally a range of 11 to 14 per cent gives good results if the soap contains less than this amount it is liable to crumble during the milling will not compress satisfactorily and the finished tablet may have a tendency to crack and contain gritty particles so objectionable in use if on the other hand the soap is left too moist it is apt to stick to the rollers and mill with difficulty and during compression the surface assumes a blistered and sticky appearance ii milling and incorporation of colour perfume or medicamentthe object of milling is to render the soap perfectly homogeneous and to reduce it to a state in which colour perfume or any necessary neutralising material or other substance may be thoroughly incorporated the milling machine consists of smooth granite rollers fitted with suitable gearing and working in an iron framework fig 22 the rollers are connected in such a manner that they rotate at different speeds and this increases the efficiency of the milling and ensures that the action of the rollers is one of rubbing rather than crushing by means of suitably arranged screws the pressure of the rollers on one another can be adjusted to give the issuing soap any desired thickness care should be taken that the sheets of soap are not unnecessarily thick or the colour and odour will not be uniform the soap in the form of chips is introduced on to the rollers through a hopper and after one passage through the mill from bottom to top one of the serrated knife edges is applied and the ribbons of the soap are delivered into the top of the hopper where the colour perfume and any other desired admixture is added and the milling operation repeated three or four times when the incorporation is complete the other scraper is fixed against the top roller and the soap ribbon passed into the receptacle from which it is conveyed to the compressor a better plan however especially in the case of the best grade soaps where the perfumes added are necessarily more delicate and costly is to make the addition of the perfume when the colour has been thoroughly mixed throughout the mass another method is to mill once and transfer the mass to a rotary mixing machine fitted with internal blades of a peculiar form which revolve in opposite directions one within the other as the mixer is rotated the perfume colouring matter etc are added and the mixer closed and set in motion when after a short time the soap is reduced to a fine granular condition with the colour and perfume evenly distributed throughout the whole by the use of such machines the loss of perfume by evaporation which during milling is quite appreciable is reduced to a minimum and the delicacy of the aroma is preserved unimpaired illustration fig 22milling machine prolonged milling especially with a suitable soap base tends to produce a semitransparent appearance which is admired by some but the increased cost of production by the repeated milling is not accompanied by any real improvement in the soap perfumethe materials used in perfuming soap will be dealt with fully in the next chapter the quantity necessary to be added varies considerably with the nature of the essential oils and also the price at which the soap is intended to be sold in the cheaper grades of milled soaps the quantity will range from 1030 fluid ozs per cwt and but rarely exceeds 1820 ozs whereas in more costly soaps as much as 4050 fluid ozs are sometimes added to the cwt colouring matterduring recent years an outcry has been made against highly coloured soaps and the highest class soaps have been manufactured either colourless or at the most with only a very delicate tint it is obvious that a white soap guarantees the use of only the highest grade oils and fats and excludes the introduction of any rosin and so far the desire for a white soap is doubtless justified many perfumes however tend to quickly discolour a soap hence the advantage of giving it a slight tint for this purpose a vegetable colouring matter is preferable and chlorophyll is very suitable illustration fig 23compressor a demand still exists for brightly coloured soaps and this is usually met by the use of coaltar dyes the quantity required is of course extremely small so that no harm or disagreeable result could possibly arise from their use neutralising and superfatting materialif desired the final neutralisation of free alkali can be carried out during the milling process any superfatting material being added at the same time the chief neutralising reagents have already been mentioned in chapter vi with regard to superfatting material the quantity of this should be very small not exceeding 68 ozs per cwt the most suitable materials are vaseline lanoline or spermaceti illustration fig 24hand soapstamping press iii compressingthe next stage is the compression and binding of the soap ribbons into a solid bar suitable for stamping and the plant used fig 23 for this purpose is substantially the same in all factories the soap is fed through a hopper into a strong metal conicalshaped tube like a cannon which tapers towards the nozzle and in which a single or twin screw is moving and the soap is thereby forced through a perforated metallic disc subjected to great pressure and compressed the screws must be kept uniformly covered with shavings during compression to obviate air bubbles in the soap illustration fig 25screw press the soap finally emerges through the nozzle to which is attached a cutter of suitable shape and size according to the form it is intended the final tablet to take as a long polished solid bar which is cut with a knife or wire into lengths of 2 or 3 feet and if of satisfactory appearance is ready for cutting and stamping the nozzle of the plodder is heated by means of a bunsen burner to about 120 or 130 f 4955 c to allow the soap to be easily forced out and this also imparts a good gloss and finish to the ejected barif the nozzle is too hot however the soap will be blistered whereas insufficient heat will result in streaky soap of a poor and dull appearance iv cutting and stampingin cutting the soap into sections for stamping the cutter should shape it somewhat similar to the required finished tablet many manufacturers cut the soap into sections having concave ends and in stamping the corners are forced into the concavity with the result that unsightly markings are produced at each end of the tablet it is preferable to have a cutter with convex ends and if the stamping is to be done in a pin mould the shape should be a trifle larger than the exact size of the desired tablet illustration fig 26pin mould the stamping may be performed by a hand stamper fig 24 a screw press fig 25 or by a steam stamper the screw press works very satisfactorily for toilet soaps there are two kinds of moulds in use for milled soaps a pin moulds in which tablets of one size and shape only can be produced fig 25 the edges of the mould meet very exactly the upper part of the die carries two pins attached to the shoulder and these are received into two holes in the shoulder of the bottom plate the superfluous soap is forced out as the dies meet b band or collar mouldsin this form fig 27 the mould may be adjusted to stamp various sized tablets say from 2 ozs to 513 ozs and different impressions given by means of removable die plates the band or collar prevents the soap squeezing out sideways we are indebted to r forehaw son ltd for the loan of this illustration it is usual to moisten the soap or mould with a dilute solution of glycerine if it should have a tendency to stick to the die plates the soap is then ready for final trimming wrapping and boxing illustration fig 27band mould medicated soaps the inherent cleansing power of soap renders it invaluable in combating disease while it also has distinct germicidal properties a 2 per cent solution proving fatal to b coli communis in less than six hours and even a 1 per cent solution having a marked action on germs in fifteen minutes many makers however seek more or less successfully to still further increase the value of soap in this direction by the incorporation of various drugs and chemicals and the number of medicated soaps on the market is now very large such soaps may consist of either hard or soft soaps to which certain medicaments have been added and can be roughly divided into two classes a those which contain a specific for various definite diseases the intention being that the remedy should be absorbed by the pores of the skin and thus penetrate the system and b those impregnated with chemicals intended to act as antiseptics or germicides or generally as disinfectants the preparation of medicinal soaps appears to have been first taken up in a scientific manner by unna of hamburg in 1886 who advocated the use of soap in preference to plasters as a vehicle for the application of certain remedies theoretically he considered a soapstock made entirely from beef tallow the most suitable for the purpose but in practice found that the best results were obtained by using a superfatted soap made from a blend of one part of olive oil with eight parts of beef tallow saponified with a mixture of two parts of soda to one part of potash sufficient fat being employed to leave an excess of 3 or 4 per cent unsaponified recent researches have shown however that even if a superfatted soapbase is beneficial for the preparation of toilet soaps a point which is open to doubt it is quite inadmissible for the manufacture of germicidal and disinfectant soaps the bactericidal efficiency of which is much restricted by the presence of free fat many of the medicaments added to soaps require special methods of incorporation therein as they otherwise react with the soap and decompose it forming comparatively inert compounds this applies particularly to salts of mercury such as corrosive sublimate or mercuric chloride and biniodide of mercury both of which have very considerable germicidal power and are consequently frequently added to soaps if simply mixed with the soap in the mill reaction very quickly takes place between the mercury salt and the soap with formation of the insoluble mercury compounds of the fatty acids a change which can be readily seen to occur in such a soap by the rapid development on keeping of a dull slatygreen appearance numerous processes have been suggested and in some cases patented to overcome this difficulty in the case of corrosive sublimate geissler suggested that the soap to which this reagent is to be added should contain an excess of fatty acids and would thereby be rendered stable this salt has also been incorporated with milled soap in a dry state in conjunction with ammoniomercuric chloride betanaphthol methyl salicylate and eucalyptol it is claimed that these bodies are present in an unchanged condition and become active when the soap is added to water as in washing ehrhardt eng pat 2407 1898 patented a method of making antiseptic mercury soap by using mercury albuminatea combination of mercuric chloride and casein which is soluble in alkali and added to the soap in an alkaline solution with biniodide of mercury the interaction can be readily obviated by adding to the biniodide of mercury an equal weight of potassium iodide this process devised and patented by j thomson in 1886 has been worked since that time with extremely satisfactory results strengths of 12 1 and 3 per cent biniodide are sold but owing to the readiness with which it is absorbed by the skin a soap containing more than 12 per cent should only be used under medical advice a similar combination of bromide of mercury with potassium sodium or ammonium bromide has recently been patented by cooke for admixture with liquid hard or soft soaps zinc and other metallic saltsat various times salts of metals other than mercury have been added to soap but owing to their insolubility in water their efficiency as medicaments is very trifling or nil compounds have been formed of metallic oxides and other salts with oleic said and mixtures made with vaseline and lanoline and incorporated with soap but they have not met with much success another chemical commonly added to soap is borax in view of its alkaline reaction to litmus turning red litmus blue this salt is no doubt generally regarded as alkaline and as such without action on soap on the contrary however it is an acid salt containing an excess of boric acid over the soda present hence when it is added to soap fatty acids are necessarily liberated causing the soap to quickly become rancid as a remedy for this it has been proposed to add sufficient alkali to convert the borax into neutral monoborate of soda which is then added to the soap this process is patented and the name kastilis has been given to the neutral salt the incorporation of borax with the addition of gum tragasol forms the subject of two patents eng pats 4415 1904 and 25425 1905 increased detergent and lasting properties are claimed for the soap another patented process eng pat 17218 1904 consists of coating the borax with a protective layer of fat or wax before adding to the soap with the idea that reaction will not take place until required boric acid possesses the defects of borax in a greater degree and would of course simply form sodium borate with liberation of fatty acids so should never be added to a neutral soap salicylic acid is often recommended for certain skin diseases and here again the addition of the acid to soap under ordinary conditions results in the formation of sodium salicylate and free fatty acids to overcome this a process has recently been patented for rubbing the acid up with vaseline before addition to soap but the simplest way appears to be to add the soda salt of the acid to soap amongst the more common milled medicated toilet soaps may be mentioned in addition to the above birch tar soap containing 5 or 10 per cent birch tar which has a characteristic pungent odour and is recommended as a remedy for eczema and psoriasis carbolic soapa toilet soap should not contain more than 3 per cent of pure phenol for with larger quantities irritation is likely to be experienced by susceptible skins coal tarthese soaps contain in addition to carbolic acid and its homologues naphthalene and other hydrocarbons derived from coal naphthol bases etc various blends of different fractions of coal tar are used but the most valuable constituents from a disinfectant point of view are undoubtedly the phenols or tar acids though in this case as with carbolic and cresylic soaps the amount of phenols should not exceed 3 per cent in a toilet soap an excess of naphthalene should also be avoided since on account of its strong odour soaps containing much of it are unpopular the odour of coal tar is considerably modified by and blends well with a perfume containing oils of cassia lavender spike and red thyme formaldehydethis substance is one of the most powerful disinfectants known and it may be readily introduced into soap without undergoing any decomposition by milling in 23 per cent of formalin a 40 per cent aqueous solution of formaldehyde which is a gas white soaps containing this chemical retain their whiteness almost indefinitely new combinations of formaldehyde with other bodies are constantly being brought forward as disinfectants among others the compound resulting from heating lanoline with formaldehyde has been patented eng pat 7169 1898 and is recommended as an antiseptic medicament for incorporation with soap glycerinenearly all soaps contain a small quantity of this body which is not separated in the lyes in some cases however a much larger quantity is desired up to some 6 or 8 per cent to mill this in requires great care otherwise the soap tends to blister during compression the best way is to dry the soap somewhat further than usual till it contains say only 9 or 10 per cent moisture and then mill in the glycerine ichthyol or ammoniumichthyolsulphonate is prepared by treating with sulphuric acid and afterwards with ammonia the hydrocarbon oil containing sulphur obtained by the dry distillation of the fossil remains of fish and seaanimals which form a bituminous mineral deposit in germany this product has been admixed with soap for many years the quantity generally used being about 5 per cent the resultant soap is possessed of a characteristic

almost completely soluble in water and stronger in odour than formerly iodinea soap containing iodine is sometimes used in scrofulous skin diseases it should contain some 3 per cent iodine while potassium iodide should also be added to render the iodine soluble lysolthis name is applied to a soap solution of cresol lysol soap being simply another form of coaltar soap the usual strength is 10 per cent lysol and constitutes a patented article fr pat 359061 1905 naphtholbetanaphthol also a coaltar derivative is a good germicide and incorporated in soap to the extent of 3 per cent together with sulphur is recommended for scabies eczema and many other cutaneous affections sulphursince sulphur is insoluble in water its action when used in conjunction with soap can be but very slow and slight sulphur soaps are however very commonly sold and 10 per cent is the strength usually advocated though many socalled sulphur soaps actually contain very little sulphur they are said to be efficacious for acne and rosacea sulphur soaps when dissolved in water gradually generate sulphuretted hydrogen which although characteristic makes their use disagreeable and lessens their popular estimation terebenethe addition of this substance to soap though imparting a very refreshing and pleasant odour does not materially increase the disinfectant value of the soap a suitable strength is 5 per cent thymolthis furnishes a not unpleasant and very useful antiseptic soap recommended especially for the cleansing of ulcerated wounds and restoring the skin to a healthy state the normal strength is 3 per cent it is preferable to replace part of the thymol with red thyme oil the thymene of which imparts a sweeter odour to the soap than if produced with thymol alone a suitable blend is 212 per cent of thymol crystals and 112 per cent of a good red thyme oil of the vast number of less known proposed additions to toilet soaps mention may be made in passing of fluoridesthese have been somewhat popular during recent years for the disinfection of breweries etc and also used to some extent as food preservatives of course only neutral fluorides are available for use in soap acid fluorides and soap being obviously incompatible in the authors experience however sodium fluoride appears to have little value as a germicide when added to soap such soaps being found to rapidly become rancid and change colour albumenthe use of albumenegg milk and vegetablein soap has been persistently advocated in this country during the past few years the claims attributed to albumen are that it neutralises free alkali causes the soap to yield a more copious lather and helps to bind it more closely and a further inducement held out is that it allows more water to be left in the soap without affecting its firmness experiments made by the authors did not appear to justify any enthusiasm on the subject and the use of albumen for soapmaking in this country appears to be very slight however popular it may be on the continent numerous other substances have been proposed for addition to soaps including yeast tar from peat sphagnol swedish wood tar permanganate of potash perborates and percarbonates of soda and ammonia chlorine compounds but none of these has at present come much into favour and some had only ephemeral existence of the many drugs that it has been suggested to admix in soap for use in allaying an irritable condition of the skin the majority are obviously better applied in the form of ointments and we need not consider them further ether soapanother form of medicated soap made by a few firms is a liquid ether soap containing mercuric iodide and intended for surgeons use this as a rule consists of a soap made from olive oil and potash dissolved in alcohol and mixed with ether the mercuric iodide being dissolved in a few drops of water containing an equal weight of potassium iodide and this solution added to the alcoholether soap floating soapsattempts have been made to produce tablets of soap that will float upon the surface of water by inserting cork or floats or a metallic plate in such a manner that there is an air space between the metal and the soap the more usual method is to incorporate into hot soap sufficient air by means of a specially designed selfcontained jacketed crutcher in which two shafts carrying small blades or paddles rotate in opposite directions to reduce the density of the soap below that of water and so enable the compressed tablet to float the difference in weight of a tablet of the same size before and after aerating amounts to 10 per cent ordinary milling soap is used as a basis for this soap the settled soap direct from the copper at 170 f 77 c is carefully neutralised with bicarbonate of sodium oleic or stearic acids or boroglyceride perfumed and aerated floating soap which is usually white some are of a cream tint cannot be recommended as economical whilst its deficiency in lathering properties owing to occluded air is a serious drawback to its popularity as a toilet detergent shaving soapsthe first essential of a shaving soap apart from its freedom from caustic alkali or any substance exerting an irritating effect upon the skin is the quick production of a profuse creamy lather which is lasting gum tragacanth is used in some cases to give lasting power or durability but is not necessary as this property is readily attained by the use of a suitable proportion of potash soap the best shaving soaps are mixtures of various proportions of neutral soda and potash soaps produced by the combination of ordinary milling base with a white potash soap either melted or milled together glycerine is sometimes added and is more satisfactorily milled in every precaution should be taken to ensure thorough saponification of the soaps intended for blending in shaving soap otherwise there will be a tendency to become discoloured and develop rancidity with age shaving soaps are delicately perfumed and are placed on the market either in the form of sticks which are cut from the bar of soap as it leaves the compressor or stamped in flat cakes shaving creams and pastes are of the same nature as shaving soaps but usually contain a larger proportion of superfatting material and considerably more water textile soaps in the woollen cloth and silk textile industries the use of soap for detergent and emulsifying purposes is necessary in several of the processes and the following is a brief description of the kinds of soap successfully employed in the various stages 1 woollen industrythe scouring of wool is the most important operationit is the first treatment raw wool is subjected to and if it is not performed in an efficient manner gives rise to serious subsequent troubles to manufacturer dyer and finisher the object of scouring wool is to remove the woolfat and wool perspiration exuded from the skin of sheep consisting of cholesterol and isocholesterol and potassium salts of fatty acids together with other salts such as sulphates chlorides and phosphates this is effected by washing in a warm dilute soap solution containing in the case of low quality wool a little carbonate of soda the fatty matter is thereby emulsified and easily removed soap to be suitable for the purpose must be free from uncombined caustic alkali unsaponified fat silicates and rosin wool can be dissolved in a moderately dilute solution of caustic soda and the presence of this latter in soap even in small quantities is therefore liable to injure the fibres and make the resultant fabric possess a harsh feel and be devoid of lustre unsaponified fat denotes badly made soapbesides reducing the emulsifying power of the liberated alkali this fat may be absorbed by the fibres and not only induce rancidity but also cause trouble in dyeing soaps containing silicates may have a deleterious action upon the fibres causing them to become damaged and broken by general consent soaps containing rosin are unsuitable for use by woollen manufacturers as they produce sticky insoluble lime and magnesia compounds which are deposited upon the fibres and give rise to unevenness in the dyeing a neutral oliveoil soft soap is undoubtedly the best for the purpose of wool scouring as owing to its ready solubility in water it quickly penetrates the fibres is easily washed out and produces a good feel so essential in the best goods and tends to preserve the lustre and pliability of the fibre the high price of oliveoil soap however renders its use prohibitive for lower class goods and in such cases no better soap can be suggested than the oldfashioned curd mottled or curd soaps boiled very dry as free as possible from uncombined caustic alkali the raw wool after this cleansing operation is oiled with olive oil or oleine prior to spinning after spinning and weaving the fabric in the form of yarn or cloth has to be scoured to free it from oil the soap in most general use for scouring woollen fabrics is neutral oleinesoda soap some manufacturers prefer a cheap curd soap such as is generally termed second curd and in cases where lower grades of wools are handled the user is often willing to have soap containing rosin owing to its cheapness and considers a little alkalinity desirable to assist in removing the oil another operation in which soap is used is that of milling or fulling whereby the fabric is made to shrink and thus becomes more compact and closer in texture the fabric is thoroughly cleansed for which purpose the soap should be neutral and free from rosin and silicates otherwise a harsh feeling or stickiness will be produced curd soaps or finelyfitted soaps made from tallow or bleached palm oil with or without the addition of cocoanut oil give the best results all traces of soap must be carefully removed if the fabric is to be dyed the woollen dyer uses soap on the dyed pieces to assist the milling and finds that a good soap made from either olive oil bleached palm oil or tallow is preferable and although it is generally specified to be free from alkali a little alkalinity is not of consequence for the woollen goods are as a rule acid after dyeing and this alkalinity would be instantly neutralised 2 cotton industrycotton fibres are unacted upon by caustic alkali so that the soap used in cleaning and preparing cotton goods for dyeing need not be neutral in fact alkalinity is a distinct advantage in order to assist the cleansing any curd soap made from tallow with or without the addition of a small quantity of cocoanut oil may be advantageously used for removing the natural oil in cotton dyeing additions of soap are often made to the bath and in such cases the soap must be of good odour and neutral lest the colours should be acted upon and tints altered soaps made from olive oil and palm oil are recommended the same kind of soap is sometimes used for soaping the dyed cotton goods the calicoprinter uses considerable quantities of soap for cleansing the printedcloths the soap not only cleanses by helping to remove the gummy and starchy constituents of the adhering printing paste but also plays an important part in fixing and brightening the colours soaps intended for this class of work must be quite neutral to obviate any possible alteration in colour by the action of free alkali free from objectionable odour and rosin and readily soluble in water these qualities are possessed by oliveoil soaps either soft or hard a neutral oliveoil soft soap owing to its solubility in cold water may be used for fibres coloured with most delicate dyes which would be fugitive in hot soap solutions and this soap is employed for the most expensive work oliveoil curd soda soaps are in general use those made from palm oil are also recommended although they are not so soluble as the oliveoil soaps tallow curd soaps are sometimes used but the difficulty with which they dissolve is a drawback and renders them somewhat unsuitable 3 silk industrysilk is secured to remove the sericin or silkglue and adhering matter from the raw silk producing thereby lustre on the softened fibre and thus preparing it for the dyer the very best soap for the purpose is an oliveoil soft soap oliveoil and oleine hard soaps may also be used the soap is often used in conjunction with carbonate of soda to assist the removal of the sericin but whilst carbonates are permissible it is necessary to avoid an excess of caustic soda tallow soaps are so slowly soluble that they are not applicable to the scouring of silk the dyer of silk requires soap which is neutral and of a pleasant odour the preference is given to neutral oliveoil soft soap but hard soaps made from olive oil oleine or palm oil are used chiefly on account of cheapness it is essential however that the soap should be free from rosin on account of its frequent use and consequent decomposition in the acid dye bath when any liberated rosin acids would cling to the silk fibres and produce disagreeable results patent textile soapsstockhausen eng pat 24868 1897 makes special claim for a soap termed monopole soap to be used in place of turkeyred oils in the dyeing and printing of cotton goods and finishing of textile fabrics the soap is prepared by heating the sulphonated oil obtained on treatment of castor oil with sulphuric acid with alkali and it is stated that the product is not precipitated when used in the dyebath as is ordinary soap nor is it deposited upon the fibres another patent eng pat 16382 1897 has for its object the obviating of the injurious effects upon wool of alkali liberated from a solution of soap it is proposed to accomplish this by sulphonating part of the fat used in making the soap miscellaneous soapsunder this heading may be classed soaps intended for special purposes and consisting essentially of ordinary boiled soap to which additions of various substances have been made with additions of naphtha fractions of petroleum and turpentine the detergent power of the soap is increased by the action of these substances in removing grease amongst the many other additions may be mentioned oxgall or derivatives therefrom for carpetcleaning soap alkali sulphides for use of leadworkers aniline colours for homedyeing soaps pumice and tripoli motorists soaps pineneedle oil in some instances together with lanoline for massage soaps pearlash for soap intended to remove oil and tar stains magnesia rouge ammonium carbonate chalk silversmiths soap powdered orris precipitated chalk magnesium carbonate tooth soaps soap powders or dry soaps are powdered mixtures of soap soda ash or soda crystals and other chemicals whilst polishing soaps often contain from 85 to 90 per cent siliceous matter and can scarcely be termed soap chapter viii soap perfumes essential oilssource and preparationpropertiesartificial and synthetic perfumes the number of raw materials both natural and artificial at the disposal of the perfumer has increased so enormously during recent years that the scenting of soaps has now become an art requiring very considerable skill and a thorough knowledge of the products to be handled not only does the allimportant question of odour come into consideration but the action of the perfumes on the soap and on each other has also to be taken into account thus many essential oils and synthetic perfumes cause the soap to darken rapidly on keeping eg clove oil cassia oil heliotropin vanillin further some odoriferous substances from their chemical nature are incompatible with soap and soon decompose any soap to which they are added while in a few cases the blending of two unsuitable perfumes results by mutual reaction in the effect of each being lost in the case of oils like bergamot oil the odour value of which depends chiefly on their ester content it is very important that these should not be added to soaps containing much free alkali as these esters are readily decomposed thereby some perfumes possess the property of helping the soap to retain other and more delicate odours considerably longer than would otherwise be possible such perfumes are known as fixing agents or fixateurs and among the most important of these may be mentioned musk both natural and artificial civet the oils of peru balsam sandalwood and patchouli and benzyl benzoate the natural perfumes employed for addition to soaps are almost entirely of vegetable origin and consist of essential oils balsams and resins animal perfumes such as musk civet and ambergris being reserved principally for the preparation of extraits as would be expected with products of such diverse character the methods employed for the preparation of essential oils vary considerably broadly speaking however the processes may be divided into three classes1 expression used for orange lemon and lime oils 2 distillation employed for otto of rose geranium sandalwood and many other oils and 3 extraction including enfleurage by which the volatile oil from the flowers is either first absorbed by a neutral fat such as lard and then extracted therefrom by maceration in alcohol or directly extracted from the flowers by means of a volatile solvent such as benzene petroleum ether or chloroform the last process undoubtedly furnishes products most nearly resembling the natural floral odours and is the only one which does not destroy the delicate fragrance of the violet and jasmine the yield however is extremely small and concrete perfumes prepared in this way are therefore somewhat costly the essential oils used are derived from upwards of twenty different botanical families and are obtained from all parts of the world thus from africa we have geranium and clove oils from america bay bois de rose canadian snake root cedarwood linaloe peppermint petitgrain and sassafras from asia camphor cassia cinnamon patchouli sandalwood star anise ylangylang and the grass oils viz citronella lemongrass palmarosa and vetivert from australia eucalyptus while in europe there are the citrus oils bergamot lemon and orange produced by sicily aspic lavender neroli petitgrain and rosemary by france caraway and clove by holland anise by russia and otto of rose by bulgaria attempts have been made to classify essential oils either on a botanical basis or according to their chemical composition but neither method is very satisfactory and in describing the chief constituents and properties of the more important oils we have preferred therefore to arrange them alphabetically as being simpler for reference it is a matter of some difficulty to judge the purity of essential oils not only because of their complex nature but owing to the very great effect upon their properties produced by growing the plants in different soils and under varying climatic conditions and still more to the highly scientific methods of adulteration adopted by unscrupulous vendors

and a few drops of ferrous sulphate solution containing ferric salt after thoroughly shaking acidulate with dilute hydrochloric acid when a blue coloration will be produced if prussic acid is present the natural oil may frequently be differentiated from artificial benzaldehyde by the presence of chlorine in the latter as there is now on the market however artificial oil free from chlorine it is no

calculated as linalyl benzoate 2745 per cent occasionally up to 50 per cent usually soluble in 12 volume of 90 per cent alcohol the composition of the oil is qualitatively the same as that of cananga oil but it is considerably more expensive and therefore can only be used in the highest grade soaps artificial and synthetic perfumes during the past few years the constitution of essential oils has been studied by a considerable number of chemists and the composition of many oils has been so fully determined that very good imitations can often be made at cheaper prices than those of the genuine oils rendering it possible to produce cheap soaps having perfumes which were formerly only possible in the more expensive article there is a considerable distinction however often lost sight of between an artificial and a synthetic oil an artificial oil may be produced by separating various constituents from certain natural oils and so blending these with or without the addition of other substances as to produce a desired odour the perfume being at any rate in part obtained from natural oils a synthetic perfume on the other hand is entirely the product of the chemical laboratory no natural oil or substance derived therefrom entering into its composition the following are among the most important bodies of this class amyl salicylate the ester prepared from amyl alcohol and

from the natural flowers possibly due to the extreme delicacy of the odour and its consequent slight decomposition during preparation from the flowers the chemical composition of the floral perfume has been very exhaustively studied and the artificial article now on the market may be described as a triumph of synthetical chemistry among its constituents are benzyl acetate linalyl acetate benzyl alcohol indol methyl anthranilate and a ketone jasmone linalol the alcohol forming the greater part of linaloe and bois de rose oils and found also in lavender neroli petitgrain bergamot and many other oils the article has the specific gravity at 15 c 08700876 optical rotation 12 to 14 refractive index at 20 c 14631464 and when estimated by acetylation yields about 70 per cent of alcohols linalyl acetate or artificial bergamot oil is the ester formed when linalol is treated with acetic anhydride it possesses a bergamotlike odour but it is doubtful whether its value is commensurate with its greatly increased price over that of ordinary bergamot oil it has the specific gravity at 15 c 0912 musk artificialseveral forms of this are to be obtained practically all of which are nitroderivatives of aromatic hydrocarbons the original patent of baur obtained in 1889 covered the trinitroderivative of tertiary butyl xylene the melting point of the pure article usually lies between 108 and 112 c and the solubility in 95 per cent alcohol ranges from 1 in 120 to 1 in 200 though more soluble forms are also made an important adulterant which should always be tested for is acetanilide antifebrin which may be detected by the characteristic isocyanide odour produced when musk containing this substance is boiled with alcoholic potash and a few drops of chloroform added acetanilide also increases the solubility in 95 per cent alcohol neroli oil artificiallike jasmine oil the chemistry of neroli oil is now very fully known and it is therefore possible to prepare an artificial product which is a very good approximation to the natural oil and many such are now on the market which on account of their comparative cheapness commend themselves to the soapperfumer

geraniol linalol phenyl ethyl alcohol and citral in some cases stearopten or other wax is added to render the oil more similar in appearance to the natural article but as these are inodorous no advantage is gained in this way and there is further the inconvenience in cold weather of having to first melt the oil before use safrol an ether which is the chief constituent of sassafras oil and also found in considerable quantity in camphor oil it is sold as an artificial sassafras oil and is very much used in perfuming cheap toilet or household soaps its specific gravity at 15 c is 11031106

manufacture and purification treatment of lyesevaporation to crude glycerinedistillationdistilled and dynamite glycerinechemically pure glycerineanimal charcoal for decolorisationglycerine obtained by other methods of saponificationyield of glycerine from fats and oils as pointed out in chapter ii the fatty acids which combined with soda or potash form soap occur in nature almost invariably in the form of glycerides ie compounds of fatty acids with glycerol and as the result of saponification of a fat or oil glycerine is set free in chapter v processes of soapmaking are described in which 1 the glycerine is retained in the finished soap and 2 the glycerine is contained in the lyes in very dilute solution contaminated with salt and other impurities these lyes though now constituting the chief source of profit in the manufacture of cheap soaps were till early in last century simply run down the drains as waste liquor much attention has been devoted to the purification and concentration of glycerine lyes and elaborate plant of various forms has been devised for the purpose treatment of lyesthe spent lyes withdrawn from the soappans are cooled and the soap which has separated during the cooling is carefully removed and returned to the soaphouse for utilisation in the manufacture of brown soap spent lyes may vary in their content of glycerol from 3 to 8 per cent and this depends not only upon the system adopted in the working of the soappans but also upon the materials used although in these days of pure caustic soda spent lyes are more free from impurities than formerly the presence of sulphides and sulphites should be carefully avoided if it is desired to produce good glycerine the lyes are transferred to a leadlined tank of convenient size and treated with commercial hydrochloric acid and aluminium sulphate sufficient being added of the former to neutralise the free alkali and render the liquor faintly acid and of the latter to completely precipitate the fatty acids the acid should be run in slowly and the point when enough has been added is indicated by blue litmus paper being slightly reddened by the lyes the whole is then agitated with air when a sample taken from the tank and filtered should give a clear filtrate having obtained this clear solution agitation is stopped and the contents of the tank passed through a filter press the scum which accumulates on the treatment tank may be transferred to a perforated box suspended over the tank and the liquor allowed to drain from it the filtered liquor is now rendered slightly alkaline by the addition of caustic soda or carbonate and after filtering is ready for evaporation the acid and alum salt used in the above treatment must be carefully examined for the presence of arsenic and any deliveries of either article which contain that impurity rejected lime bog ore and various metallic salts such as ferric chloride barium chloride and copper sulphate have been suggested and in some instances are used instead of aluminium sulphate but the latter is generally employed evaporation to crude glycerinethe clear treated lyes being now free from fatty resinous and albuminous matter and consisting practically of an aqueous solution of common salt sodium chloride and glycerine is converted into crude glycerine by concentration which eliminates the water and causes most of the salt to be deposited this concentration was originally performed in open pans heated by fire or waste combustible gases in the bottom of each pan was placed a dish in which the salt deposited and this dish was lifted out periodically by the aid of an overhead crane and the contents emptied and washed concentration was continued until the temperature of the liquor was 300 f 149 c when it was allowed to rest before storing this liquor on analysis gave 80 per cent glycerol and from 9 to 1012 per cent salts ash hence the present standard for crude glycerine concentration in open pans has now been superseded by evaporation in vacuo the subject of the gradual development of the modern efficient evaporating plant from the vacuum pan originated and successfully applied by howard in 1813 in the sugar industry is too lengthy to detail here suffice it to say that the multiple effects now in vogue possess distinct advantagesthe greatest of these being increased efficiency combined with economy the present type of evaporator consists of one or more vessels each fitted with a steam chamber through which are fixed vertical hollow tubes the steam chamber of the first vessel is heated with direct steam or with exhaust steam supplied from the exhaust steam receiver into which passes the waste steam of the factory the treated lyes circulating through the heated tubes is made to boil at a lower temperature with the reduced pressure than is possible by heating in open pans the vapour given off by the boiling liquor is conveyed through large pipes into the steam chamber of the second vessel where its latent heat is utilised in producing evaporation the pressure being further reduced as this second vessel is under a greater vacuum than no 1 thus we get a double effect as the plant consisting of two pans is termed the vapours discharged from the second vessel during boiling are passed through pipes to the steam chamber of the third vessel in a triple effect and there being condensed create a partial vacuum in the second vessel the third vessel may also be heated by means of live steam the vapours arising from the last vessel of the evaporating plant or in the case of a single effect from the vessel are conveyed into a condenser and condensed by injection water which is drawn off by means of the pump employed for maintaining a vacuum of 28 inches in the vessel in the most recent designs of large evaporative installations the vapours generated from the last vessel are drawn through a device consisting of a number of tubes enclosed in a casing and the latent heat raises the temperature of the treated lyes proceeding through the tubes to supply the evaporator it will thus be observed that the object of multiple effects is to utilise all the available heat in performing the greatest possible amount of work special devices are attached to the plant for automatically removing the condensed water from the steam chambers without the loss of useful heat and as a precaution against splashing over and subsequent loss of glycerine through conveyance to the steam chamber dash plates and catchalls or savealls of various designs are fitted on each vessel in working the plant the liquor in each vessel is kept at a fairly constant level by judicious feeding from one to the other the first vessel is of course charged with treated lyes as the liquor acquires a density of 42 tw 25 b salt begins to deposit and may be withdrawn into one of the many patented appliances in which it is freed from glycerine washed and dried ready for use at the soap pans difficulty is sometimes experienced with the tubes becoming choked with salt thereby diminishing and retarding evaporation it may be necessary to dissolve the encrusted salt with lyes or water but with careful working the difficulty can be obviated by washing out with weak lyes after each batch of crude glycerine has been run away or by increasing the circulation it is claimed that by the use of the revolving heater designed by lewkowitsch the salting up of tubes is prevented the salt having been precipitated and removed evaporation is continued until a sample taken from the last vessel has a density of 60 tw 333 b at 60 f 155 c when this point is reached the crude glycerine is ready to be withdrawn into a tank and after allowing the excess of salt to deposit may be transferred to the storage tank the colour of crude glycerine varies from light brown to dark brown almost black and depends largely on the materials used for soapmaking the organic matter present in good crude glycerine is small in amount often less than 1 per cent arsenic sulphides and sulphites should be absent crude glycerine is refined in some cases by the producers themselves others sell it to firms engaged more particularly in the refined glycerine trade distillationcrude glycerine is distilled under vacuum with the aid of superheated steam the still is heated directly with a coal or coke fire and in this fire space is the superheater which consists of a coil of pipes through which high pressure steam from the boiler is superheated the distillation is conducted at a temperature of 356f 180 c to prevent the deposition and burning of salt on the stillbottom during the distillation a false bottom is supported about 1 foot from the base of the still with the same object in view it has been suggested to rotate the contents with an agitator fixed in the still every care is taken that the still does not become overheated this precaution not only prevents loss of glycerine through carbonisation but also obviates the production of tarry and other bodies which might affect the colour taste and odour of the distilled glycerine the vacuum to be used will of course depend upon the heat of the fire and still but as a general rule good results are obtained with an 18 inch vacuum there are quite a large number of designs for still heads and catchalls having for their object the prevention of loss of glycerine the distillate passes into a row of condensers to each of which is attached a receptacle or receiver it is needless to state that the condensing capacity should be in excess of theoretical requirements the fractions are of varying strengths and quality that portion with a density less than 14 tw 194 b is returned to the treatedlyes tank the other portion of the distillate is concentrated by means of a dry steam coil in a suitable vessel under a 28 inch vacuum when sufficiently concentrated the glycerine may be decolorised if necessary by treating with 1 per cent animal charcoal and passing through a filter press from which it issues as dynamite glycerine the residue in the still consisting of 5060 per cent glycerine and varying proportions of various sodium saltseg acetate chloride sulphate and combinations with nonvolatile organic acidsis generally boiled with water and treated with acid the tar which is separated floats on the surface as the liquor is cooling and may be removed by ladles or the whole mixed with waste charcoal and filtered the filtrate is then evaporated when the volatile organic acids are driven off the concentrated liquor is finally mixed with crude glycerine which is ready for distillation or it may be distilled separately distilled glycerinethis class of commercial glycerine although of limited use in various other branches of industry finds its chief outlet in the manufacture of explosives specifications are usually given in contracts drawn up between buyers and sellers to which the product must conform the chief stipulation for dynamite glycerine is its behaviour in the nitration test when glycerine is gradually added to a cold mixture of strong nitric and sulphuric acids it is converted into nitroglycerine which separates as an oily layer on the surface of the acid the more definite and rapid the separation the more suitable is the glycerine for dynamitemaking dynamite glycerine should be free from arsenic lime chlorides and fatty acids the inorganic matter should not amount to more than 01 per cent and a portion diluted and treated with nitrate of silver solution should give no turbidity or discoloration in ten minutes the specific gravity should be 1262 at 15 c 59 f and the colour somewhat yellow chemically pure glycerine or double distilled glycerine is produced by redistilling once distilled glycerine every care is taken to avoid all fractions which do not withstand the nitrate of silver test the distillation is very carefully performed under strict supervision the distillate is concentrated and after treatment with animal charcoal and filtration should conform to the requirements of the british pharmacopoeia these are specified as follows specific gravity at 155 c 1260 it should yield no characteristic reaction with the tests for lead copper arsenium iron calcium potassium sodium ammonium chlorides or sulphates it should contain no sugars and leave no residue on burning animal charcoal for decolorisationthe application of animal charcoal for decolorising purposes dates back a century and various are the views that have been propounded to explain its action some observers base it upon the physical condition of the socalled carbon present and no doubt this is an important factor coupled with the porosity others consider that the nitrogen which is present in all animal charcoal and extremely difficult to remove is essential to the action animal charcoal should be freed from gypsum sulphate of lime lest in the burning sulphur compounds be formed which would pass into the glycerine and contaminate it the char should be well boiled with water then carbonate of soda or caustic soda added in sufficient quantity to give an alkaline reaction and again well boiled the liquor is withdrawn and the charcoal washed until the washings are no longer alkaline the charcoal is then separated from the liquor and treated with hydrochloric acid opinions differ as to the amount of acid to be used some contend that phosphate of lime plays such an important part in decolorising that it should not be removed but it has however been demonstrated that this substance after exposure to heat has very little decolorising power animal charcoal boiled with four times its weight of a mixture consisting of equal parts of commercial hydrochloric acid free from arsenic and water for twelve hours then washed free from acid dried and burned in closed vessels gives a product possessed of great decolorising power for use with glycerines a good animal charcoal will have a dull appearance and be of a deep colour it should be used in fine grains and not in the form of a powder the charcoal from the filter presses is washed free from glycerine which is returned to the treated lyes cleansed from foreign substances by the above treatment and revivified by carefully heating in closed vessels for twelve hours glycerine obtained by other methods of saponificationfrench saponification or candle crude glycerine is the result of concentration of sweet water produced in the manufacture of stearine and by the autoclave process it contains 8590 per cent glycerol possesses a specific gravity of 12401242 and may be readily distinguished from the soapcrude glycerine by the absence of salt sodium chloride this glycerine is easily refined by treatment with charcoal the glycerine water resulting from acid saponification methods requires to be rendered alkaline by the addition of limethe sludge is separated and the liquor evaporated to crude the concentration may be performed in two stagesfirst to a density of 32 tw 20 b when the calcium sulphate is allowed to deposit and the separated liquor concentrated to 48 tw 28 b glycerine testing 85 per cent glycerol and upwards yield of glycerine from fats and oilsthe following represent practicable results which should be obtained from the various materials tallow 9 per cent of 80 per cent glycerol cottonseed oil 10 cocoanut oil 12 palmkernel oil 18 olive oil 10 palm oil 6 greases bone fats 68 the materials vary in glycerol content with the methods of preparation especially is this the case with tallows and greases every care should be taken that the raw materials are fresh and they should be carefully examined to ascertain if any decomposition has taken place in the glyceridesthis would be denoted by the presence of an excess of free acidity and the amount of glycerol obtainable from such a fat would be correspondingly reduced chapter x analysis of raw materials soap and glycerine fats and oilsalkalies and alkali saltsessential oilssoaplyescrude glycerine raw materialsaverage figures have already been given in chapters iii and viii for the more important physical and chemical characteristics of fats and oils also of essential oils the following is an outline of the processes usually adopted in their determination for fuller details textbooks dealing exhaustively with the respective subjects should be consulted fats and oils it is very undesirable that any of these materials should be allowed to enter the soap pan without an analysis having first been made as the oil may not only have become partially hydrolysed involving a loss of glycerine or contain albuminous matter rendering the soap liable to develop rancidity but actual sophistication may have taken place thus a sample of tallow recently examined by the authors contained as much as 40 per cent of an unsaponifiable wax which would have led to disaster in the soap pan had the bulk been used without examination after observing the appearance colour and odour of the sample noting any characteristic feature the following physical and chemical data should be determined specific gravity at 15 c this may be taken by means of a westphal balance or by using a picnometer of either the ordinary gravity bottle shape with perforated stopper or the sprengel utube the picnometer should be calibrated with distilled water at 15 c the specific gravity of solid fats may be taken at an elevated temperature preferably that of a boiling water bath free acidity is estimated by weighing out from 2 to 5 grammes of the fat or oil dissolving in neutral alcohol purified methylated spirit with gentle heat and titrating with a standard aqueous or alcoholic solution of caustic soda or potash using phenolphthalein as indicator the contents of the flask are well shaken after each addition of alkali and the reaction is complete when the slight excess of alkali causes a permanent pink coloration with the indicator the standard alkali may be n2 n5 or n10 it is usual to calculate the result in terms of oleic acid 1 cc n10 alkali 00282 gramme oleic acid and express in percentage on the fat or oil example18976 grammes were taken and required 52 cc of n10 koh solution for neutralisation 52 00282 100 772 per cent free fatty acids 18976 expressed as oleic acid the free acidity is sometimes expressed as acid value which is the amount of koh in milligrammes necessary to neutralise the free acid in 1 gramme of fat or oil in the above example 52 561 153 acid value 18976 the saponification equivalent is determined by weighing 24 grammes of fat or oil into a widenecked flask about 250 cc capacity adding 30 cc neutral alcohol and warming under a reflux condenser on a steam or waterbath when boiling the flask is disconnected 50 cc of an approximately seminormal alcoholic potash solution carefully added from a burette together with a few drops of phenolphthalein solution and the boiling under a reflux condenser continued with frequent agitation until saponification is complete usually from 3060 minutes which is indicated by the absence of fatty globules the excess of alkali is titrated with n1 hydrochloric or sulphuric acid the value of the approximately n2 alkali solution is ascertained by taking 50 cc together with 30 cc neutral alcohol in a similar flask boiling for the same length of time as the fat and titrating with n1 hydrochloric or sulphuric acid the saponification equivalent is the amount of fat or oil in grammes saponified by 1 equivalent or 561 grammes of caustic potash example18976 grammes fat required 1895 cc n1 acid to neutralise the unabsorbed alkali fifty cc approximately n2 alcoholic potash solution required 256 cc n acid 256 1895 665 cc n1 koh required by fat 18976 1000 665 2853 saponification equivalent the result of this test is often expressed as the saponification value which is the number of milligrammes of koh required for the saponification of 1 gramme of fat this may be found by dividing 56100 by the saponification equivalent or by multiplying the number of cc of n1 alkali absorbed by 561 and dividing by the quantity of fat taken thus in the above example 665 561 18976 1966 saponification value the ester or ether value or number of milligrammes of koh required for the saponification of the neutral esters or glycerides in 1 gramme of fat is represented by the difference between the saponification and acid values in the example given the ester value would be 1966 153 1813 unsaponifiable matterthe usual method adopted is to saponify about 5 grammes of the fat or oil with 50 cc of approximately n2 alcoholic potash solution by boiling under a reflux condenser with frequent agitation for about 1 hour the solution is then evaporated to dryness in a porcelain basin over a steam or waterbath and the resultant soap dissolved in about 200 cc hot water when sufficiently cool the soap solution is transferred to a separating funnel 50 cc of ether added the whole well shaken and allowed to rest the ethereal layer is removed to another separator more ether being added to the aqueous soap solution and again separated the two ethereal extracts are then washed with water to deprive them of any soap separated transferred to a flask and the ether distilled off upon a waterbath the residue dried in the oven at 100 c until constant is the unsaponifiable matter which is calculated to per cent on the oil in this method it is very frequently most difficult to obtain a distinct separation of ether and aqueous soap solutionan intermediate layer of emulsion remaining even after prolonged standing and various expedients have been recommended to overcome this such as addition of alcohol when petroleum ether is used glycerine more ether water or caustic potash solution or by rotatory agitation a better plan is to proceed as in the method above described as far as dissolving the resulting soap in 200 cc water and then boil for twenty or thirty minutes slightly cool and acidify with dilute sulphuric acid 1 to 3 boil until the fatty acids are clear wash with hot water free from mineral acid and dry by filtering through a hot water funnel two grammes of the fatty acids are now dissolved in neutral alcohol saturated with some solvent preferably a light fraction of benzoline a quantity of the solvent added to take up the unsaponifiable matter and the whole boiled under a reflux condenser after cooling the liquid is titrated with n2 aqueous koh solution using phenolphthalein as indicator this figure giving the amount of the total fatty acids present the whole is then poured into a separating funnel when separation immediately takes place the alcoholic layer is withdrawn the benzoline washed with warm water about 32 c followed by neutral alcohol previously saturated with the solvent and transferred to a tared flask which is attached to a condenser and the benzoline distilled off the last traces of solvent remaining in the flask are removed by gently warming in the wateroven and the flask cooled and weighed thus giving the amount of unsaponifiable matter constitution of the unsaponifiable matterunsaponifiable matter may consist of cholesterol phytosterol solid alcohols cetyl and ceryl alcohols or hydrocarbons mineral oil cholesterol is frequently found in animal fats and phytosterol is a very similar substance present in vegetable fats solid alcohols occur naturally in sperm oil but hydrocarbons which may be generally recognised by the fluorescence or bloom they give to the oil are not natural constituents of animal or vegetable oils and fats the presence of cholesterol and phytosterol may be detected by dissolving a small portion of the unsaponifiable matter in acetic anhydride and adding a drop of the solution to one drop of 50 per cent sulphuric acid on a spot plate when a characteristic blood red to violet coloration is produced it has been proposed to differentiate between cholesterol and phytosterol by their melting points but it is more reliable to compare the crystalline forms the former crystallising in lamin while the latter forms groups of needleshaped tufts another method is to convert the substance into acetate and take its melting point cholesterol acetate melting at 11431148 c and phytosterol acetate at 1256137 c additional tests for cholesterol have been recently proposed by lifschtz ber deut chem ges 1908 252255 and golodetz chem zeit 1908 160 in that due to the former which depends on the oxidation of cholesterol to oxycholesterol ester and oxycholesterol a few milligrammes of the substance are dissolved in 23 cc glacial acetic acid a little benzoyl peroxide added and the solution boiled after which four drops of strong sulphuric acid are added when a violetblue or green colour is produced if cholesterol is present the violet colour being due to oxycholesterol ester the green to oxycholesterol two tests are suggested by golodetz 1 the addition of one or two drops of a reagent consisting of five parts of concentrated sulphuric acid and three parts of formaldehyde solution which colours cholesterol a blackishbrown and 2 the addition of one drop of 30 per cent formaldehyde solution to a solution of the substance in trichloracetic acid when with cholesterol an intense blue coloration is produced waterfrom 5 to 20 grammes of the fat or oil are weighed into a tared porcelain or platinum dish and stirred with a thermometer whilst being heated over a gas flame at 100 c until bubbling or cracking has ceased and reweighed the loss in weight representing the water in cases of spurting a little added alcohol will carry the water off quietly to prevent loss by spurting davis j amer chem soc 23 487 has suggested that the fat or oil should be added to a previously dried and tared coil of filter paper contained in a stoppered weighing bottle which is then placed in the oven and dried at 100 c until constant in weight of course this method is not applicable to oils or fats liable to oxidation on heating dregs dirt adipose tissue fibre etcfrom 10 to 15 grammes of the fat are dissolved in petroleum ether with frequent stirring and passed through a tared filter paper the residue retained by the filter paper is washed with petroleum ether until free from fat dried in the wateroven at 100 c and weighed if the amount of residue is large it may be ignited and the proportion and nature of the ash determined the amount of impurities may also be estimated by tates method which is performed by weighing 5 grammes of fat into a separating funnel dissolving in ether and allowing the whole to stand to enable the water to deposit after six hours rest the water is withdrawn the tube of the separator carefully dried and the ethereal solution filtered through a dried tared filter paper into a tared flask well wash the filter with ether and carefully dry at 100 c the ether in the flask is recovered and the flask dried until all ether is expelled and its weight is constant the amount of fat in the flask gives the quantity of actual fat in the sample taken the loss represents the water and other impurities and these latter may be obtained from the increase of weight of the filter paper starch may be detected by the blue coloration it gives with iodine solution and confirmed by microscopical examination or it may be converted into glucose by inversion and the glucose estimated by means of fehlings solution iodine absorptionthis determination shows the amount of iodine absorbed by a fat or oil and was devised by hbl the reagents required being as follows 1 solution of 25 grammes iodine in 500 cc absolute alcohol 2 solution of 30 grammes mercuric chloride in 500 cc absolute alcohol these two solutions being mixed together and allowed to stand at least twelve hours before use 3 a freshly prepared 10 per cent aqueous solution of potassium iodide and 4 a n10 solution of sodium thiosulphate standardised just prior to use by titrating a weighed quantity of resublimed iodine dissolved in potassium iodide solution in the actual determination 02 to 05 gramme of fat or fatty acids is carefully weighed into a wellfitting stoppered 250 cc bottle dissolved in 10 cc chloroform and 25 cc of the hbl reagent added the stopper being then moistened with potassium iodide solution and placed firmly in the bottle which is allowed to stand at rest in a dark place for four hours a blank experiment is also performed using the same quantities of chloroform and hbl reagent and allowing to stand for the same length of time after the expiration of four hours 20 cc of 10 per cent solution of potassium iodide and 150 cc water are added to the contents of the bottle and the excess of iodine titrated with n10 sodium thiosulphate solution the whole being well agitated during the titration which is finished with starch paste as indicator the blank experiment is titrated in the same manner and from the amount of thiosulphate required in the blank experiment is deducted the number of cc required by the unabsorbed iodine in the other bottle this figure multiplied by the iodine equivalent of 1 cc of the thiosulphate solution and by 100 dividing the product by the weight of fat taken gives the iodine number example1 cc of the n10 sodium thiosulphate solution is found equal to 00126 gramme iodine 03187 gramme of fat taken blank requires 485 cc thiosulphate bottle containing oil requires 400 cc thiosulphate 485 400 85 and the iodine absorption of the fat is 85 00126 100 336 03187 wijs showed that by the employment of a solution of iodine monochloride in glacial acetic acid reliable iodine figures are obtained in a much shorter time thirty minutes being sufficient and this method is now in much more general use than the hbl wijs iodine reagent is made by dissolving 13 grammes iodine in 1 litre of glacial acetic acid and passing chlorine into the solution until the iodine is all converted into iodine monochloride the process is carried out in exactly the same way as with the hbl solution except that the fat is preferably dissolved in carbon tetrachloride instead of in chloroform bromine absorption has now been almost entirely superseded by the iodine absorption although there are several good methods the gravimetric method of hehner analyst 1895 49 was employed by one of us for many years with very good results whilst the brominethermal test of hehner and mitchell analyst 1895 146 gives rapid and satisfactory results more recently macilhiney jour amer chem soc 1899 10841089 drew attention to bromine absorption methods and tried to rewaken interest in them the refractive index is sometimes useful for discriminating between various oils and fats and in conjunction with other physical and chemical data affords another means of detecting adulteration where a great number of samples have to be tested expeditiously the abb refractometer or the zeiss butyrorefractometer may be recommended on account of the ease with which they are manipulated the most usual temperature of observations is 60 c the titre or setting point of the fatty acids was devised by dalican and is generally accepted in the commercial valuation of solid fats as a gauge of firmness and in the case of tallow has a considerable bearing on the market value one ounce of the fat is melted in a shallow porcelain dish and 30 cc of a 25 per cent caustic soda solution added together with 50 cc of redistilled methylated spirit the whole is stirred down on the water bath until a pasty soap is obtained when another 50 cc of methylated spirit is added which redissolves the soap and the whole again stirred down to a solid soap this is then dissolved in distilled water a slight excess of dilute sulphuric acid added to liberate the fatty acids and the whole warmed until the fatty acids form a clear liquid on the surface the water beneath the fatty acids is then syphoned off more distilled water added to wash out any trace of mineral acid remaining and again syphoned off this process being repeated until the washings are no longer acid to litmus paper when the fatty acids are poured on to a dry filter paper which is inserted in a funnel resting on a beaker and the latter placed on the waterbath where it is left until the clear fatty acids have filtered through about 1015 grammes of the pure fatty acids are now transferred to a test tube 6 1 warmed until molten and the tube introduced through a hole in the cork into a flask or widemouthed bottle a very accurate thermometer graduated into fifths of a degree centigrade previously standardised is immersed in the fatty acids so that the bulb is as near the centre as possible and when the fatty acids just begin to solidify at the bottom of the tube the thermometer is stirred round slowly the mercury will descend and stirring is continued until it ceases to fall further at which point the thermometer is very carefully observed it will be found that the temperature will rise rapidly and finally remain stationary for a short time after which it will again begin to drop until the temperature of the room is reached the maximum point to which the temperature rises is known as the titre of the sample alkalies and alkali salts care should be bestowed upon the sampling of solid caustic soda or potash as the impurities during the solidification always accumulate in the centre of the drum and an excess of that portion must be avoided or the sample will not be sufficiently representative the sampling should be performed expeditiously to prevent carbonating and portions placed in a stoppered bottle the whole should be slightly broken in a mortar and bright crystalline portions taken for analysis using a stoppered weighing bottle caustic soda and caustic potashthese substances are valued according to the alkali present in the form of caustic hydrate and carbonate about 2 grammes of the sample are dissolved in 50 cc distilled water and titrated with n1 sulphuric acid using phenolphthalein as indicator the alkalinity so obtained representing all the caustic alkali and onehalf the carbonate which latter is converted into bicarbonate one cc n1 acid 0031 gramme na2o or 0040 gramme naoh and 0047 gramme k2o or 0056 gramme koh after this first titration the second half of the carbonate may be determined in one of two ways either 1 by adding from 35 cc of n10 acid and well boiling for five minutes to expel carbonicacid gas after which the excess of acid is titrated with n10 soda solution or 2 after adding two drops of methyl orange solution n10 acid is run in until the solution acquires a faint pink tint in the calculation of the caustic alkali the number of cc of acid required in the second titration divided by 10 is subtracted from that used in the first and this difference multiplied by 0031 or 0047 gives the amount of na2o or k2o respectively in the weight of sample taken whence the percentage may be readily calculated the proportion of carbonate is calculated by multiplying the amount of n10 acid required in the second titration by 2 and then by either 00031 or 00047 to give the amount of carbonate present expressed as na2o or k2o respectively an alternative method is to determine the alkalinity before and after the elimination of carbonate by chloride of barium about 78 grammes of the sample are dissolved in water and made up to 100 cc and the total alkalinity determined by titrating 20 cc with n1 acid using methyl orange as indicator to another 20 cc is added barium chloride solution 10 per cent until it ceases to give a precipitate the precipitate allowed to settle and the clear supernatant liquid decanted off the precipitate transferred to a filter paper and well washed and the filtrate titrated with n1 acid using phenolphthalein as indicator the second titration gives the amount of caustic alkali present and the difference between the two the proportion of carbonate when methyl orange solution is used as indicator titrations must be carried out cold reference has already been made p 39 to the manner in which the alkali percentage is expressed in english degrees in the case of caustic soda chlorides are estimated by titrating the neutral solution with n10 silver nitrate solution potassium chromate being used as indicator one cc n10 agno3 solution 000585 gramme sodium chloride the amount of acid necessary for exact neutralisation having already been ascertained it is recommended to use the equivalent quantity of n10 nitric acid to produce the neutral solution sulphides may be tested for qualitatively with lead acetate solution aluminates are determined gravimetrically in the usual manner 2 grammes are dissolved in water rendered acid with hcl excess of ammonia added and the gelatinous precipitate of aluminium hydrate collected on a filter paper washed burnt and weighed carbonated alkali soda ashthe total or available alkali is of course the chief factor to be ascertained and for this purpose it is convenient to weigh out 31 grammes of the sample dissolve in 50 cc water and titrate with n1 sulphuric or hydrochloric acid using methyl orange as indicator each cc of n1 acid required represents 1 per cent na2o in the sample under examination a more complete analysis of soda ash would comprise insoluble matter remaining after 10 grammes are dissolved in warm water this is washed on to a filterpaper dried ignited and weighed the filtrate is made up to 200 cc and in it may be determined caustic soda by titrating with n1 acid the filtrate resulting from the treatment of 20 cc equal to 1 gramme with barium chloride solution carbonatetitrate 20 cc with n1 acid and deduct the amount of acid required for the caustic chloridestwenty cc are exactly neutralised with nitric acid titrated with n10 agno3 solution using potassium chromate as indicator sulphatestwenty cc are acidulated with hcl and the sulphates precipitated with barium chloride the precipitate is collected on a filter paper washed dried ignited and weighed the result being calculated to na2so4 sulphides and sulphitesthe presence of these compounds is denoted by the evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen and sulphurous acid respectively when the sample is acidulated sulphides may also be tested for qualitatively with lead acetate solution or testpaper of sodium nitroprusside the total quantity of these compounds may be ascertained by acidulating with acetic acid and titrating with n10 iodine solution using starch paste as indicator one cc n10 iodine solution 00063 gramme na2so3 the amount of sulphides may be estimated by titrating the hot soda solution to which ammonia has been added with an ammoniacal silver nitrate solution 1 cc of which corresponds to 0005 gramme na2s as the titration proceeds the precipitate is filtered off and the addition of ammoniacal silver solution to the filtrate continued until a drop produces only a slight opacity the presence of chloride sulphate hydrate or carbonate does not interfere with the accuracy of this method the ammoniacal silver nitrate solution is prepared by dissolving 13345 grammes of pure silver in pure nitric acid adding 250 cc liquor ammoni fortis and diluting to 1 litre carbonate of potash pearl ashthe total or available alkali may be estimated by taking 69 grammes of the sample and titrating with n1 acid directly or adding 100 cc n1 sulphuric acid boiling for a few minutes and titrating the excess of acid with n1 caustic soda solution using litmus as indicator in this case each cc n1 acid required is equivalent in the absence of na2co3 to 1 per cent k2co3 carbonate of potash may be further examined for the following moisturefrom 23 grammes are heated for thirty minutes in a crucible over a gas flame and weighed when cold the loss in weight representing the moisture insoluble residue remaining after solution in water filtering and well washing potassium may be determined by precipitation as potassium platinochloride thusdissolve 05 gramme in a small quantity say 10 cc of water and carefully acidulate with hydrochloric acid evaporate the resultant liquor to dryness in a tared platinum basin and heat the residue gradually to dull redness cool in a desicator weigh and express the result as mixed chlorides ie chlorides of soda and potash to the mixed chlorides add 10 cc water and platinic chloride in excess the quantity may be three times the amount of the mixed chlorides and evaporate nearly to dryness add 15 cc alcohol and allow to stand three hours covered with a watchglass giving the dish a gentle rotatory movement occasionally the clear liquid is decanted through a tared filter and the precipitate well washed with alcohol by decantation and finally transferred to the filter dried and weighed from the weight of potassium platinochloride k2ptcl6 is calculated the amount of potassium oxide k2o by the use of the factor 944882 or 019254 chlorides determined with n10 silver nitrate solution and calculated to kcl sulphates estimated as barium sulphate and calculated to k2so4 sodium carbonate found by deducting the k2co3 corresponding to the actual potassium as determined above from the total alkali iron precipitated with excess of ammonia filtered ignited and weighed as fe2o3 sodium chloride common salt this should be examined for the following actual chloride either titrated with n10 silver nitrate solution using neutral potassium chromate solution as indicator or preferably estimated gravimetrically as silver chloride by precipitation with silver nitrate solution the precipitate transferred to a tared filter paper washed dried and weighed insoluble matter remaining on dissolving 5 grammes in water and filtering this is washed dried ignited and weighed moisture5 grammes are weighed into a platinum crucible and heat gently applied the temperature is gradually increased to a dull red heat which is maintained for a few minutes the dish cooled in a desicator and weighed sulphates are estimated by precipitation as barium sulphate and calculated to na2so4 sodiumthis may be determined by converting the salt into sodium sulphate by the action of concentrated sulphuric acid igniting to drive off hydrochloric and sulphuric acids and fusing the mass until constant in weight weighing finally as na2so4 potassium chloride this should be examined in the same way as sodium chloride for chloride insoluble matter moisture and sulphate the potassium may be determined as potassium platinochloride as described under carbonate of potash silicates of soda and potash the most important determinations for these are total alkali and silica total alkali is estimated by dissolving 2 grammes in distilled water and titrating when cold with n1 acid using methyl orange as indicator silica may be determined by dissolving 1 gramme in distilled water rendering the solution acid with hcl and evaporating to complete dryness on the waterbath after which the residue is moistened with hcl and again evaporated this operation being repeated a third time the residue is then heated to about 150 c extracted with hot dilute hcl filtered thoroughly washed dried ignited in a tared platinum crucible and weighed as sio2 essential oils as already stated these are very liable to adulteration and an examination of all kinds of oil is desirable while in the case of the more expensive varieties it should never be omitted specific gravityas with fats and oils this is usually taken at 15 c and compared with water at the same temperature in the case of otto of rose and guaiac wood oil however which are solid at this temperature it is generally observed at 30 c compared with water at 15 c the specific gravity is preferably taken in a bottle or utube but if sufficient of the oil is available and a high degree of accuracy is not necessary it may be taken either with a westphal balance or by means of a hydrometer optical rotationfor this purpose a special instrument known as a polarimeter is required details of the construction and use of which would be out of place here suffice it to mention that temperature plays an important part in the determination of the optical activity of certain essential oils notably in the case of lemon and orange oils for these gildemeister and hoffmann give the following corrections lemon oil below 20 c subtract 9 for each degree below above 20 c add 8 for each degree above orange oil below 20 c subtract 14 for each degree below above 20 c add 13 for each degree above refractive indexthis figure is occasionally useful and is best determined with an abb refractometer at 20 c solubility in alcoholthis is found by running alcohol of the requisite strength from a burette into a measured volume of the oil with constant agitation until the oil forms a clear solution with the alcohol having noted the quantity of alcohol added it is well to run in a small further quantity of alcohol and observe whether any opalescence or cloudiness appears acid ester and saponification values are determined exactly as described under fats and oils instead of expressing the result as saponification value or number the percentage of ester calculated in the form of the most important ester present may be obtained by multiplying the number of cc of n1 alkali absorbed in the saponification by the molecular weight of the ester thus to find the percentage as linalyl acetate the number of cc absorbed would be multiplied by 0196 and by 100 and divided by the weight of oil taken alcoholsfor the estimation of these if the oil contains much ester it must first be saponified with alcoholic potash to liberate the combined alcohols and after neutralising the excess of alkali with acid the oil is washed into a separating funnel with water separated dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate and is then ready for the alcohol determination if there is only a small quantity of ester present this preliminary saponification is unnecessary the alcohols are estimated by conversion into their acetic esters which are then saponified with standard alcoholic potash thereby furnishing a measure of the amount of alcohol esterified ten cc of the oil is placed in a flask with an equal volume of acetic anhydride and 2 grammes of anhydrous sodium acetate and gently boiled for an hour to an hour and a half after cooling water is added and the contents of the flask heated on the waterbath for fifteen to thirty minutes after which they are cooled transferred to a separating funnel and washed with a brine solution until the washings cease to give an acid reaction with litmus paper the oil is now dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate filtered and 12 grammes weighed into a flask and saponified with alcoholic potash as in the determination of ester or saponification value the calculation is a little complicated but an example may perhaps serve to make it clear a geranium oil containing 269 per cent of ester calculated as geranyl tiglate was acetylated after saponification to liberate the combined geraniol and 23825 grammes of the acetylated oil required 91 cc of n1 alkali for its saponification now every 196 grammes of geranyl acetate present in the acetylated oil correspond to 154 grammes of geraniol so that for every 196 grammes of ester now present in the oil 42 grammes have been added to its weight and it is therefore necessary to make a deduction from the weight of oil taken for the final saponification to allow for this and since each cc of n1 alkali absorbed corresponds to 0196 gramme of geranyl acetate the amount to be deducted is found by multiplying the number of cc absorbed by 0042 gramme the formula for the estimation of total alcohols thus becoming in the example given 91 0154 100 per cent of geraniol 702 23825 91 0042 the percentage of combined alcohols can be calculated from the amount of ester found and by subtracting this from the percentage of total alcohols that of the free alcohols is obtained in the example quoted the ester corresponds to 176 per cent geraniol and this deducted from the total alcohols gives 526 per cent free alcohols calculated as geraniol this process gives accurate results with geraniol borneol and menthol but with linalol and terpineol the figures obtained are only comparative a considerable quantity of these alcohols being decomposed during the acetylation the aldehyde citronellal is converted by acetic anhydride into isopulegol acetate so that this is also included in the determination of graniol in citronella oil phenolsthese bodies are soluble in alkalies and may be estimated by measuring 5 cc or 10 cc of the oil into a hirschsohn flask a flask of about 100 cc capacity with a long narrow neck holding 10 cc graduated in tenths of a cc adding 25 cc of a 5 per cent aqueous caustic potash solution and warming in the waterbath then adding another 25 cc and after one hour in the waterbath filling the flask with the potash solution until the unabsorbed oil rises into the neck of the flask the volume of this oil being read off when it has cooled down to the temperature of the laboratory from the volume of oil dissolved the percentage of phenols is readily calculated aldehydesin the estimation of these substances use is made of their property of combining with sodium bisulphite to form compounds soluble in hot water from 510 cc of the oil is measured into a hirschsohn flask about 30 cc of a hot saturated solution of sodium bisulphite added and the flask immersed in a boiling water bath and thoroughly shaken at frequent intervals further quantities of the bisulphite solution are gradually added until after about one hour the unabsorbed oil rises into the neck of the flask where after cooling its volume is read off and the percentage of absorbed oil or aldehydes calculated in the case of lemon oil where the proportion of aldehydes though of great importance is relatively very small it is necessary to first concentrate the aldehydes before determining them for this purpose 100 cc of the oil is placed in a ladenburg fractional distillation flask and 90 cc distilled off under a pressure of not more than 40 mm and the residue steam distilled the oil so obtained is separated from the condensed water measured dried and 5 cc assayed for aldehydes either by the process already described or by the following process devised by burgess analyst 1904 78 five cc of the oil are placed in the hirschsohn flask about 20 cc of a saturated solution of neutral sodium sulphite added together with a few drops of rosolic acid solution as indicator and the flask placed in a boiling waterbath and continually agitated the contents of the flask soon become red owing to the liberation of free alkali by the combination of the aldehyde with part of the sodium sulphite and this coloration is just discharged by the addition of sufficient 10 per cent aceticacid solution the flask is again placed in the waterbath the shaking continued and any further alkali liberated neutralised by more acetic acid the process being continued in this way until no further red colour is produced the flask is then filled with the sodium sulphite solution the volume of the cooled unabsorbed oil read off and the percentage of aldehydes calculated as before solidifying point or congealing pointthis is of some importance in the examination of anise and fennel oils and is also useful in the examination of otto of rose a suitable apparatus may be made by obtaining three test tubes of different sizes which will fit one inside the other and fixing them together in this way through corks the innermost tube is then filled with the oil and a sensitive thermometer similar to that described under the titre test for fats suspended with its bulb completely immersed in the oil with anise and fennel the oil is cooled down with constant stirring until it just starts crystallising when the stirring is interrupted and the maximum temperature to which the mercury rises noted this is the solidifying point in the case of otto of rose the otto is continually stirred and the point at which the first crystal is observed is usually regarded as the congealing point melting pointthis is best determined by melting some of the solid oil or crystals and sucking a small quantity up into a capillary tube which is then attached by a rubber band to the bulb of the thermometer immersed in a suitable bath water glycerine oil etc and the temperature of the bath gradually raised until the substance in the tube is sufficiently melted to rise to the surface the temperature at which this takes place being the melting point the melting point of otto of rose is usually taken in a similar tube to the setting point and is considered to be the point at which the last crystal disappears iodine absorptionin the authors opinion this is of some value in conjunction with other data in judging of the purity of otto of rose it is determined by hbls process as described under fats and oils except that only 01 to 02 gramme is taken and instead of 10 cc of chloroform 10 cc of pure alcohol are added the rest of the process is identical soap in the analysis of soap it is a matter of considerable importance that all the determinations should be made on a uniform and average sample of the soap otherwise very misleading and unreliable figures are obtained soap very rapidly loses its moisture on the surface while the interior of the bar or cake may be comparatively moist and the best way is to carefully remove the outer edges and take the portions for analysis from the centre in the case of a household or unmilled toilet soap it is imperative that the quantities for analysis should all be weighed out as quickly after each other as possible fatty acidsfive grammes of the soap are rapidly weighed into a small beaker distilled water added and the beaker heated on the water bath until the soap is dissolved a slight excess of mineral acid is now added and the whole heated until the separated fatty acids are perfectly clear when they are collected on a tared filter paper well washed with hot water and dried until constant in weight the result multiplied by 20 gives the percentage of fatty acids in the sample a quicker method and one which gives accurate results when care is bestowed upon it is to proceed in the manner described above as far as the decomposition with mineral acid and to then add 5 or 10 grammes of stearic acid or beeswax to the contents of the beaker and heat until a clear layer of fatty matter collects upon the acid liquor cool the beaker and when the cake is sufficiently hard remove it carefully by means of a spatula and dry on a filtering paper add the portions adhering to the sides of the beaker to the cake and weigh the weight less the amount of stearic acid or beeswax added multiplied by 20 gives the percentage of fatty acids care must be taken that the cake does not contain enclosed water the results of these methods are returned as fatty acids but are in reality insoluble fatty acids the soluble fatty acids being generally disregarded however in soaps made from cocoanut and palmkernel oils which contain an appreciable quantity of soluble fatty acids the acid liquor is shaken with ether and after evaporation of the ethereal extract the amount of fatty matter left is added to the result already obtained as above or the ether method described below may be advantageously employed where the soap under examination contains mineral matter the separated fatty acids may be dissolved in ether this is best performed in an elongated graduated stoppered tube the total volume of the ether after subsidence carefully read and an aliquot part taken and evaporated to dryness in a tared flask which is placed in the oven at 100 c until the weight is constant in a complete analysis the figure for fatty acids should be converted into terms of fatty anhydrides by multiplying by the factor 09875 in this test the resin acids contained in the soap are returned as fatty acids but the former can be estimated as described later and deducted from the total total alkalithe best method is to incinerate 5 grammes of the soap in a platinum dish dissolve the residue in water boil and filter making the volume of filtrate up to 250 cc the solution being reserved for the subsequent determination of salt silicates and sulphates as detailed below fifty cc of the solution are titrated with n1 acid to methyl orange and the result expressed in terms of na2o number of cc required 0031 100 per cent na2o the total alkali may also be estimated in the filtrate from the determination of fatty acids if the acid used for decomposing the soap solution has been measured and its strength known by titrating back the excess of acid with normal soda solution when the difference will equal the amount of total alkali in the quantity taken the total alkali is usually expressed in the case of hard soaps as na2o and in soft soaps as k2o free caustic alkali is estimated by dissolving 2 grammes of the soap in neutral pure alcohol with gentle heat filtering well washing the filter with hot neutral spirit and titrating the filtrate with n10 acid to phenolphthalein number of cc required 00031 50 per cent free alkali na2o as caustic free carbonated alkalithe residue on the filter paper from the above determination is washed with hot water and the aqueous filtrate titrated with n10 acid using methyl orange as indicator the result is generally expressed in terms of na2o number of cc required 00031 50 per cent free alkali na2o as carbonate free alkalisome analysts determine the alkalinity to phenolphthalein of the alcoholic soap solution without filtering and express it as free alkali caustic carbonates or any salt having an alkaline reaction combined alkalithe difference between total alkali and free alkali caustic and carbonate together represents the alkali combined with fatty acids this figure may also be directly determined by titrating with n2 acid the alcoholic solution of soap after the free caustic estimation using lacmoid as indicator the potash and soda in soaps may be separated by the method described for the estimation of potassium in pearl ash page 126 the potassium platinochloride k2ptcl6 is calculated to potassium chloride kcl by using the factor 03052 and this figure deducted from the amount of mixed chlorides found gives the amount of sodium chloride nacl from which the sodium oxide na2o is obtained by multiplying by 052991 the potassium chloride kcl is converted into terms of potassium oxide k2o by the use of the factor 063087 salt may be determined in 50 cc of the filtered aqueous extract of the incinerated soap by exactly neutralising with normal acid and titrating with n10 silver nitrate solution using a neutral solution of potassium chromate as indicator the final reaction is more distinctly observed if a little bicarbonate of soda is added to the solution number of cc required 000585 100 per cent of common salt nacl chlorides may also be estimated by volhards method the aqueous extract being rendered slightly acid with nitric acid a measured volume of n10 silver nitrate solution added and the excess titrated back with n10 ammonium thiocyanate solution using iron alum as indicator silicatesthese are estimated by evaporating 50 cc of the filtered extract from the incinerated soap in a platinum dish with hydrochloric acid twice to complete dryness heating to 150 c adding hot water and filtering through a tared filter paper the residue is well washed ignited and weighed as sio2 and from this silica is calculated the sodium silicate sulphates may be determined in the filtrate from the silica estimation by precipitation with barium chloride solution and weighing the barium sulphate after filtering and burning expressing the result in terms of na2so4 by the use of the factor 06094 moisturethis is simply estimated by taking a weighed portion in small shavings in a tared dish and drying in the oven at 105 c until it ceases to lose weight from the loss thus found is calculated the moisture percentage free or uncombined fatthis is usually determined by repeated extraction of an aqueous solution of the soap with petroleum ether the ethereal solution after washing with water to remove traces of soap is evaporated to dryness and the residue weighed a good method which can be recommended for employment where many determinations have to be performed is to dissolve 10 grammes of soap in 50 cc neutral alcohol and titrate to phenolphthalein with n1 acid add 35 drops hcl and boil to expel carbonic acid neutralise with alcoholic koh solution and add exactly 10 cc in excess boil for fifteen minutes under a reflux condenser and titrate with n1 acid the difference between this latter figure and the amount required for a blank test with 10 cc alcoholic koh denotes the amount of alkali absorbed by the uncombined fat examination of the fatty acids as a guide to the probable composition of the soap from the data obtained by estimating the titre iodine number and saponification equivalent of the mixed fatty and rosin acids and the rosin content a fairly good idea of the constitution of the soap may be deduced the titre iodine number and saponification equivalent are determined in exactly the same manner as described under fats and oils the presence of rosin may be detected by the liebermannstorch reaction which consists in dissolving a small quantity of the fatty acids in acetic anhydride and adding to a few drops of this solution 1 drop of 50 per cent sulphuric acid a violet coloration is produced with rosin acids the amount of rosin may be estimated by the method devised by twitchell journ soc chem ind 1891 804 which is carried out thus two grammes of the mixed fatty and rosin acids are dissolved in 20 cc absolute alcohol and dry hydrochloric acid gas passed through until no more is absorbed the flask being kept cool by means of cold water to prevent the rosin acids being acted upon the flask after disconnecting is allowed to stand one hour to ensure complete combination when its contents are transferred to a philips beaker well washed out with water so that the volume is increased about five times and boiled until the acid solution is clear a fragment of granulated zinc being added to prevent bumping the heat is removed and the liquid allowed to cool when it is poured into a separator and the beaker thoroughly rinsed out with ether after shaking the acid liquor is withdrawn and the ethereal layer washed with water until free from acid fifty cc neutral alcohol are added and the solution titrated with n1 koh or naoh solution the percentage of rosin being calculated from its combining weight twitchell suggests 346 as the combining weight of rosin but 330 is a closer approximation the method may be also carried out gravimetrically in which case petroleum ether boiling at 74 c is used for washing out the beaker into the separator the acid liquor is run off and the petroleum ether layer washed first with water and then with a solution of 12 gramme koh and 5 cc alcohol in 50 cc water and agitated the rosin is thus saponified and separated the resinate solution is withdrawn acidified and the resin acids collected dried and weighed halphens reactionthis is a special test to determine the presence or absence of cottonseed oil fatty acids in mixtures equal parts of the fatty acids amyl alcohol and a 1 per cent solution of sulphur in carbon bisulphide are heated in a testtube placed in a waterbath until effervescence ceases then in boiling brine for one hour or longer when only small quantities are present the presence of cottonseed oil is denoted by a pink coloration the reaction is rendered much more rapid according to rupp z untersuch nahr genussm 1907 13 74 by heating in a stoppered flask other bodies which it is occasionally necessary to test for or determine in soap include carbolic acidfifty grammes of the soap are dissolved in water and 20 cc of 10 per cent caustic potash added the solution is treated with an excess of brine the supernatant liquor separated and the precipitate washed with brine the washings being added to the liquor withdrawn this is then evaporated to a small bulk placed in a muters graduated tube and acidified with mineral acid the volume of separated phenols is observed and stated in percentage on the soap taken or the alkaline layer may be rendered acid and steam distilled the distillate is made up to a known volume and a portion titrated by the koppeschaar method with standard bromine water glycerinefive grammes of soap are dissolved in water decomposed with dilute sulphuric acid and the clear fatty acids filtered and washed the filtrate is neutralised with barium carbonate evaporated to 50 cc and the glycerol estimated by the bichromate method detailed under crude glycerine starch or gum may be detected by dissolving the soap in alcohol filtering and examining the residue on the filter paper starch is readily recognised by the blue coloration it gives with a solution of iodine in potassium iodide sugars are tested for by means of fehlings solution in the liquor separated from the fatty acids after first boiling with dilute acid to invert any cane sugar mercury will be revealed by a black precipitate produced when sulphuretted hydrogen is added to the liquor separated from the fatty acids and may be estimated by filtering off this precipitate on a tared goochs crucible which is then dried and weighed borax or borates are tested for in the residue insoluble in alcohol this is dissolved in water rendered faintly acid with dilute hydrochloric acid and a strip of turmeric paper immersed for a few minutes in the liquid this is then dried in the wateroven when if any boric acid compound is present a bright reddishpink stain is produced on the paper which is turned blue on moistening with dilute alkali the amount of the boric acid radicle may be determined by incinerating 510 grammes of soap extracting with hot dilute acid filtering neutralising this solution to methyl orange and boiling to expel carbon dioxide after cooling sufficient pure neutralised glycerine is added to form onethird of the total volume and the liquid titrated with n2 caustic soda solution using phenolphthalein as indicator each cc of n2 naoh solution corresponds to 0031 gramme crystallised boric acid h3bo3 or 00477 gramme crystallised borax na2b4o710h2o lyes the amounts of caustic alkali if any carbonated alkali and salt present are determined in the manner already described under alkali and alkali salts the glycerol content is ascertained by taking 25 grammes adding lead subacetate solution and filtering without increasing the bulk more than is absolutely necessary the solution is concentrated to about 25 cc and the oxidation with bichromate and sulphuric acid conducted as described in the examination of crude glycerine the solution after oxidation is made up to 250 cc and titrated against standard ferrous ammonium sulphate solution the formula for the calculation being 025 25 per cent of glycerol 40 n where n equals the number of cc of oxidised lyes required to oxidise the ferrous ammonium sulphate solution the estimation of actual glycerol in this is necessarily a matter of considerable importance and a very large number of processes which are constantly being added to have been suggested for the purpose hitherto however only two methods have been generally adopted viz the acetin and the bichromate processes unfortunately the results obtained by these do not invariably agree the latter which includes all oxidisable matter as glycerol giving sometimes considerably higher results and it has been suggested that a determination should be made by both methods and the average of the two results considered the true value this involves a considerable amount of time and trouble and it will generally be found sufficient in a works laboratory to determine the glycerol by one method only in the ordinary course reserving the other process for use as a check in case of dispute or doubt acetin methodthis consists in converting the glycerol into its ester with acetic acid the acetic triglyceride or triacetin being formed this is then saponified with a known volume of standard alkali the excess of which is titrated with acid and the percentage of glycerol calculated from the amount of alkali absorbed from 1 to 15 grammes of the glycerine is weighed into a conical flask of about 150 cc capacity 7 or 8 cc of acetic anhydride added together with about 3 grammes of anhydrous sodium acetate and the whole boiled on a sandbath under a reflux condenser for one to one and a half hours after which it is allowed to cool 50 cc water added and the ester dissolved by shaking and gently warming the reflux condenser still being attached as the acetin is very volatile the solution is then filtered from a white flocculent precipitate which contains most of the impurities into a larger conical flask of some 500600 cc capacity and after cooling rendered just neutral to phenolphthalein by means of n2 caustic soda solution the exact point being reached when the solution acquires a reddishyellow tint 25 cc of a strong caustic soda solution is then added and the liquid boiled for about fifteen minutes the excess of alkali being titrated after cooling with n1 or n2 hydrochloric acid a blank experiment is carried out simultaneously with another 25 cc of the soda solution and the difference in the amounts of acid required by the two furnishes a measure of the alkali required to saponify the acetin formed and hence the amount of glycerol in the crude glycerine may be calculated example14367 grammes crude glycerine after treatment with acetic anhydride and neutralising was saponified with 25 cc of a 10 per cent caustic soda solution the blank experiment required 11105 cc n1 hydrochloric acid flask containing acetin 753 cc 3575 cc hence the acetin formed from the glycerol present in 14367 grammes of the crude glycerine required 3575 cc n1 caustic alkali for its saponification so that the percentage of glycerol may be calculated from the following formula 3575 003067 100 per cent glycerol 763 14367 bichromate methodthis process was originally devised by hehner journ soc chem ind 1889 49 but the modification suggested by richardson and jaffe ibid 1898 330 is preferred by the authors and has been practised by them for several years with perfectly satisfactory results twentyfive grammes of the crude glycerine are weighed out in a beaker washed into a 250 cc stoppered flask and made up to the graduation mark with water twentyfive cc of this solution are then measured from a burette into a small beaker a slight excess of basic lead acetate solution added to precipitate organic matter the precipitate allowed to settle and the supernatant liquid poured through a filter paper into another 250 cc flask the precipitate is washed by decantation until the flask is nearly full then transferred to the filter and allowed to drain a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid being added to precipitate the slight excess of basic lead acetate solution and the contents of the flask made up with water to 250 cc this solution is filtered 20 cc measured from a burette into a conical flask of about 150 cc capacity 25 cc of a standard potassium bichromate solution containing 7486 grammes bichromate per litre added together with 50 cc of 50 per cent sulphuric acid and the whole placed in a boiling waterbath for one hour after which it is allowed to cool diluted with water to 250 cc and this solution run in to 20 cc of a 3 per cent ferrous ammonium sulphate solution until the latter is completely oxidised as shown by no blue coloration being produced when one drop is brought into contact with one drop of a freshly prepared solution of potassium ferricyanide on a spotplate the ferrous ammonium sulphate solution is previously standardised by titration with a potassium bichromate solution of onetenth the above strength made by diluting 10 cc of the strong solution to 100 cc with water the reaction taking place in the oxidation may be represented by the equation 3c3h5oh3 7k2cr2o7 28h2so4 9co2 40h2o 7k2so4 7cr2so43 now the strong potassium bichromate solution above mentioned is of such a strength that 1 cc will oxidise 001 gramme glycerine and 20 cc of the ferrous ammonium sulphate solution should require about 10 cc of the onetenth strength bichromate in the blank experiment if it requires more or less than this then the amount of ferrous ammonium sulphate solution which would require exactly 10 cc corresponding to 001 gramme glycerine is calculated and the oxidised glycerine solution run into this until oxidation is complete the formula for the calculation of the percentage of glycerol then becomes 025 250 001 per cent of glycerol 500 n where n equals the number of cc of oxidised glycerine solution required to oxidise the ferrous ammonium sulphate solution example in the blank experiment 20 cc ferrous ammonium sulphate solution required 98 cc onetenth strength bichromate solution so that 204 cc ferrous solution would equal 10 cc bichromate 204 cc ferrous solution required 278 cc of oxidised glycerine solution before it ceased to give a blue coloration with potassium ferricyanide 025 250 001 therefore per cent of glycerol 500 278 8004 per cent other methods have been suggested for the preliminary purification eg silver oxide silver carbonate and lead subacetate and copper sulphate and caustic potash but the lead subacetate alone with care gives satisfactory results other determinations include those of specific gravity alkalinity proportion of salts and chloride and tests for metals arsenic sulphur compounds sugar and fatty acids specific gravity is determined at 15 c and may be taken in specific gravity bottle or with a westphal balance or hydrometer it usually ranges from 13 to 131 alkalinity which is usually sodium carbonate and may be somewhat considerable if the soap has been grained with caustic alkali is determined after dilution with water by titrating with n2 acid using methyl orange as indicator saltsthese may be determined by gently incinerating 56 grammes of the glycerine extracting the carbonaceous mass with distilled water filtering and evaporating the filtrate on the water bath the dried residue represents the salts in the weight taken chloride of sodium common salt may be estimated by dissolving the total salts in water adding potassium chromate and titrating with n10 silver nitrate solution copper lead iron magnesium and calcium may also be tested for in the salts by ordinary reactions arsenic is best tested for by the gutzeit method about 5 cc is placed in a testtube a few fragments of granulated zinc free from arsenic and 10 cc dilute hydrochloric acid added and the mouth of the tube covered with a small filter paper moistened three successive times with an alcoholic solution of mercury bichloride and dried after thirty minutes the filter paper is examined when a yellow stain will be observed if arsenic is present sulphatesthese may be precipitated with barium chloride in acid solution in the usual way dried ignited and weighed sulphites give with barium chloride a precipitate soluble in hydrochloric acid if the precipitate is well washed with hot water and a few drops of iodine solution together with starch paste added the presence of sulphites is proved by the gradual disappearance of the blue starchiodine compound first formed thiosulphates are detected by precipitating any sulphite and sulphate with barium chloride filtering acidifying and adding a few drops of potassium permanganate solution when in the presence of a mere trace of thiosulphate the solution becomes cloudy sulphideslewkowitsch recommends testing for these by replacing the mercury bichloride with lead acetate paper in the gutzeit arsenic test any sulphide causes a blackening of the lead acetate paper sugars may be tested for both before and after inversion by boiling with fehlings solution when no reduction should take place if pure fatty acids are detected by the turbidity they produce when the diluted glycerine is acidified chapter xi statistics of the soap industry until the year 1853 the amount of
