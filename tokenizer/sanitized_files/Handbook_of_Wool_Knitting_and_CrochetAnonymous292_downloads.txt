needles the first thing to be done in knitting is to cast on or as it is sometimes called to set up the foundation figure 1 there are several methods for this the following being that preferred and generally used by the writer leave a spare end of thread sufficient for the number of stitches you wish to cast on lying toward the left the spool or ball from which the workingthread is drawn being at the right lay the thread between the little finger and the third of the left hand bring the workingthread across the palm of the hand around the thumb and back between the forefinger and second finger bend the forefinger over this thread which passes between it and the second finger pass it under the thread which crosses the palm of the hand and then draw the forefinger back or straighten it which will give you a loop with crossed threads put the needle under the lower part of this loop which draws from the ball bring the workingthread or ballthread around the point of needle from right to left as in plain knitting draw it back through the loop slip off the latter and draw up the left thread then proceed to make the crossed loop and knit it off in the same way for the next and following stitches the whole operation is very simple although the instructions seem long because explicit take your needle and yarn or thread and follow them through carefully and you will very soon master the crossed casting on another method preferred by many and practically the same in effect except that the edge is not quite so firm is as follows loop the thread around the left forefinger holding the spare end between thumb and second finger pass the needle upward through the loop pass the thread around the point draw back through the loop slip off the latter and pull up the spare thread by passing the needle under the loop or lower thread instead of through it bringing it back through and then knitting off you will really get the crossed loop and many find this method easier than the first the thread used in casting on may be doubled particularly for beginning a stocking mitten or any article where much wear comes casting on may also be done with two needles and many like this method when there are many stitches twist a loop around the needle held in the left hand bring the end of thread or spare thread to the front crossing the workingthread to hold it in placeor if preferred simply tie a slipknot and put the loop on the left needle insert the right needle through this loop from left to right put thread around point of right needle and draw through the loop bringing the right needle again in front of left thus far the process is quite like that of plain knitting keeping the right needle still in the new stitch or loop transfer the stitch to the left needle by bringing the latter in front and putting the point through the loop from front to back leaving the right needle in place for the next stitch the loops are not slipped off as in knitting plain but transferred so that all are kept on the needle a little practise will enable one to cast on thus very rapidly and evenly illustration figure 2 knitting plain the plain knitting figure 2 is done as follows having cast on the requisite number of stitches insert the right needle through the front of left needle from left to right the right needle passing behind the left carry the thread around point of right needle and bring it down between the two needles then draw the point of right needle back and through the stitch forming the new stitch on right needle and letting the other slip off the left pushing down the point of left needle to facilitate this process repeat until all the stitches are knitted off and the row is complete where there are edges to be joined as in knitting back and fronts of a sweater it is a good plan to slip the first stitch of each row right here a suggestion about the method of holding the thread may be of value by the first method the thread is carried over the little finger of right hand under second and third fingers and over the tip of the forefinger which should be held close to the work it is this finger which passes the thread over point of right needle for the new stitch by another method the thread is carried over the left forefinger under second and third and over the little finger exactly as it is held for crocheting insert the right needle through 1st stitch on left needle in usual way push it over the thread on left forefinger and draw this back through the stitch with the point of right needle only the needle is held in the right hand and many workers claim that the work is much more rapidly done illustration figure 3 purling the purl or seamstitch figure 3 is the exact reverse of plain knitting both as to method of work and appearance being in reality the wrong side of plain knitting in the latter the thread is kept at the back of the work for purling bring it to the front between the two needles put the point of right needle through the front of 1st stitch on left needle from right to left the right needle being thus brought in front of the left pass the thread around the front of right needle from right to left and back between needles then push down the point and draw the loop backward through the stitch instead of forward as in plain knitting the right needle being thus brought behind the left slip off the old stitch as usual and take care to return the thread to its place at the back before beginning to knit plain again illustration figure 4 garterstitch or ridgestitch garterstitch so called figure 4 is simply plain knitting back and forth which gives the effect of ridges one row knit the next purled this is a stitch much used for sweaters and other knitted garments if one wishes to have the right side appear as in plain knitting the 1st row must be knitted plain the next purled since one is the reverse of the other the right side will be plain knitting the wrong side purled illustration figure 5 the double rib the ribstitch is alternately plain and purled to knit the single rib knit 1 purl 1 repeat for double rib figure 5 knit 2 purl 2 repeat and for triplerib knit 3 purl 3 repeat any width of rib may be made that is liked always taking careunless knitting in rounds as a wristlet mitten or stockingto knit the stitches purled on the preceding row and purl the knitted ones there are a large variety of fancy patterns made by combining plain knitting and purling such as the basketstitch and others of even or broken check there are many variations of the simplest stitches for example the common garterstitch gives a particularly good effect if knitted from the back put the needle in from right to left through the back part of the stitch to be knitted leave the thread behind the needle then pass it from right to left over the needle and draw it through the stitch allowing the latter to slip off as in plain knitting in this stitch the two threads of the loop are crossed instead of lying side by side as in plain knitting illustration figure 6 making overs overs figure 6 are used in all lace patterns and many times in fancy designs for wool knitting to make an over bring the thread before the needle as if to purl then knit the next stitch plain as usual this brings a loop over the needle which in the next row is to be knitted as any stitch thus increasing the number of stitches in the row in case it is not desired to increase the stitches one must narrow by knitting two stitches together once for every over if a larger hole is wanted the thread is put twice over the needle and in the following one of these loops is knitted the other purled to purlnarrow or purl two together bring the thread to the front as for purling then to form the extra stitch carry the thread back over the needle and to the front again then insert the right needle through two stitches instead of one and knit them as one stitch fagot is an abbreviation frequently used for this illustration figure 7 binding off to slip and bind slip 1st stitch from left needle to the right needle without knitting it knit next stitch then draw the stitch on right needle over the knitted one letting it fall between needles to slip narrow and bind slip first stitch knit next two together and draw the slipped stitch over to cast off or bind off figure 7 slip 1st stitch knit next draw slipped stitch over knit next stitch draw the previous knitted stitch over and continue taking care that the chain of stitches thus cast off be neither too tight nor too loose but just as elastic as the remainder of the work a sleeveless sweater illustration a sleeveless sweater a sleeveless sweater as pretty as it is comfortable requires six skeins of shetland floss and a pair of no 5 amber needles pink floss was chosen for the model but any preferred color may be substituted cast on 85 stitches knit in basketstitch as follows 1 knit 5 purl 5 repeat across ending

work the shells around front of hood and finish with the shells of gray as for jacket run in the cord with balls of the two colors of yarn the cords may be done in plain crochet the ordinary chain or as preferred because stronger knotted by what is called the fools delight method although why named thus it is impossible to say surely it seems a very sensible way take a length of yarn six times as long as the cord is wanted make a slip or half knot at one end and pass the other end down through it to form a loop then tie the ends of yarn together hold this knot between thumb and forefinger of one hand say the right with the yarn which pulls through the knot under the same hand and the loop which was formed held on the forefinger hold the yarn which does not pull in the left hand pass the forefinger of the left hand through the loop on right forefinger from front to back catch up and pull through the nonpulling or lefthand threadexactly as you would make a chainstitch in crochettransfer the knot which ties the two ends together to the thumb and forefinger of left hand keeping the loop over forefinger and draw up the pulling yarn now the position of the loop pulling yarn and knot is exactly the same in the left hand as formerly in the right continue by passing the forefinger of right hand through the loop catching up the nonpulling thread and drawing it through to form the new loop on right hand again transfer the knot and pull up this is really a sort of double chain and when one has learned to make it evenly and well it will be found superior for bags lingerie and many other articles requiring a drawstring or cord a serviceable sweater illustration a serviceable sweater use fourfold germantown zephyr and a pair of no 5 needles with one pair two sizes smaller as the sizes or numbers of needles vary and also do methods of knitting it is a good plan to work a little block before beginning the pattern cast on say 12 stitches knit across and purl back repeating these two rows until you have a square there should be 5 stitches to the inch in width and seven rows should make an inch in length if you get less use larger needles say no 6 it is also a good plan to practise on the pattern a little so that you will become familiar with it and can narrow or widen and still keep the ridge cast on any number of stitches divisible by four with one stitch over knit 2 purl 2 until but one stitch remains and knit that all rows are the same the odd stitch breaking the rib and making a ridge when you come to the decreasing later you can tell whether you are keeping the pattern correct by watching the knitted stitch which forms a sort of chain right on top of the ridge and must be kept throughout left front cast on 65 stitches on the larger needles and knit 12 rows plain for the band at lower edge 13 knit 10 these stitches are for the plain border up the front purl 2 knit 2 repeat from knitting last stitch 14 slip 1 purl 1 knit 2 purl 2

needle from this point work until you have completed the 183d row increasing at beginning of 172d 176th and 180th rows by knitting in the back then in the front of the 2d stitch you should then have

until you have 32 rows in pattern then knit 10 rows plain for top of pocket and bind off to make up the coat first press the border of fronts stretch into shape pin to an ironingboard cover with a damp cloth and press with a fairly hot iron until the cloth is dry this will prevent the coat from drawing up as the ribs are inclined to do for sewing use a bluntpointed needle to avoid splitting the wool sew up the side and shoulderseams taking a stitch from each edge and keeping the edges perfectly even being careful not to draw the sewingyarn so tightly as to pucker the seam in the least sew up the sleeves and place the sleeveseam an inch to the front of the sideseam easing in any fulness there is around the top place the center of collar at center of back before sewing on this must be done on right side of coat and the collar turned over sew on the pockets matching the ridges and sew on five pearl or bone buttons about threefourths of an inch in diameter to correspond with the buttonholes placing a small pearl button at the back of the larger one on wrong side of coat and sewing through both together this coat measures twentysix inches from shoulder to hem it may easily be made longer if desired but the model is an excellent one for ordinary wear and very natty and it has the merit of being quickly knitted as has been suggested a good way to do when knitting a sweater in any stitch is to have a pattern and work to fit that first have a coat cut from any old cloth and of any style desired seam it up and try it on having it fitted nicely then cut along the seam and take apart fasten the different parts on a smooth surface by means of thumbtacks and knit to measure without stretching your work ladies sweater illustration ladies sweater this sweater requires five

cast on 7 stitches or one third the number widened for the thumb continue knitting the hand to the tip of the little finger then commence narrowing the manner in which this is done depends on the

2d stitch and knit twice around then narrow knit 1 repeat around knit once around narrow every stitch draw yarn through and darn the end neatly and securely it is an excellent plan to run the tip of a mitten on the wrong side as you do the heel of a stocking since it makes it wear longer especially if intended for rough usage the narrowing of a childs mitten may begin with every 4th stitch also if the hand is long and slender an additional row may be knitted between the widenings for the thumb take the stitches off the thread on 2 needles and with the 3d pick up and knit the stitches across the hand which were cast on when knitting around the first time narrow once each end of the pickedup stitches even the stitches on the needles and knit around in pattern until you reach the base of the

and finish with ties and bows of ribbon by adding extra stitches to the front and making the crown proportionately larger these directions will be found to serve admirably for babys first hood or as large a hood as wanted a lesson in crochet the stitches and terms given herewith are such as are in general use and were taught the writer by an english teacher of crocheting herself a professional in the art in some periodicals and books the real slipstitch is omitted and the single is called slipstitch the double is called single the treble is called double the double treble is called treble and so on there are different ways of holding the crochetneedle and carrying the thread and many consider one way as good as another unless as is usually the case ones own method is thought a little the best the following instructions were given by the english teacher in question and are those commonly accepted hold the needle in the right hand very much as you hold a pen when writing letting the handle extend between the forefinger and thumb which rest on and hold the needle hold nothing but the latter in the right hand not allowing the fingers of that hand to so much as rest on the work hold work with thumb and second finger of left hand letting the thread pass over the forefinger slightly raised or held up from the work under the second over the third and under the little finger these instructions are especially good for using yarns when it is desirable to keep the work as soft and fluffy as possible illustration figure 1 the chainstitch the chain figure 1 make a loop of thread around the needle take up the thread and draw through this loop that is push the hook under the thread that passes over the forefinger draw it back catching the thread and pull this through the loop on the needle forming a new stitch or loop take up the thread and draw through this and so continue until the chain is of the length required tightening each loop as drawn through so that all will be of uniform size and smoothness after a little practise one does this without thought when abbreviations are used that for chain is ch the slipstitch is properly a close joining stitch drop the stitch on the needle insert hook through the stitch of work to which you wish to join take up the dropped stitch and pull through thus making a close fastening this stitch is sometimes used to slip along certain portions of the work from one to another point but single crochet is more often employed for this the abbreviation is slst illustration figure 2 single crochet single crochet figure 2 frequently called slipstitch and sometimes mittenstitch is made thus having a stitch on needle insert hook in work take up the thread and draw it through the work and the stitch on the needle at the same time the abbreviation is s c illustration figure 3 double crochet double crochet figure 3 having a stitch on needle insert hook in work take up thread and draw through giving you two stitches on the needle take up thread and draw through the two stitches the abbreviation is d c there are many variations of the doublecrochet stitch the slipperstitch or ribbed stitch is formed by taking up the back horizontal loop or vein of each stitch in preceding row a quite different effect is given when the hook is inserted under both loops illustration figure 4 treble crochet treble crochet figure 4 having a stitch on the needle take up the thread as if to make a stitch insert hook in work take up thread and draw through making three stitches or loops on the needle take up thread and draw through two again and draw through two the abbreviation of treble crochet is t c it will be noted that the single crochet has one draw the double two and the treble three from which these stitches take their names illustration figure 5 halftreble crochet halftreble or shorttreble crochet like treble to then take up thread and draw through all three stitches at once illustration figure 6 doubletreble crochet doubletreble crochet figure 6 having a stitch on the needle take up the thread twice or put it twice over the needle insert hook in work take up thread and draw through making four stitches to

three times insert hook in work take up thread and draw through making five stitches on needle work these off two at a time as in double treble the abbreviation is t t c one sometimes has occasion to use other extralong stitches such as quadruple crochet over four times before insertion of hook in work quintuple crochet over five times and so on which are worked off two at a time exactly as in treble or double treble in turning one chainstitch corresponds to a double two chainstitches to a half or short treble three chain to a treble four to a double treble five to a triple treble and so on adding one chain for each extra draw parentheses and asterisks or stars are used to prevent the necessity of repetition and save space they indicate repeats of like directions thus chain 3 miss 3 1 treble in next three times is equivalent to chain 3 miss 3 1 treble in next chain 3 miss 3 1 treble in next chain 3 miss 3 1 treble in next or to chain 3 miss 3 1 treble in next repeat from twice the worker should be careful in the selection of a hook it should be well made and smooth and of a size to carry the wool smoothly without catching in and roughening it if too large on the other hand the work is apt to be sleazy needles that have been used for some time work more easily than new ones if all makes of crochetneedles were numbered in the same way the size might be easily designated but it happens that no two manufacturers use like numbers for the same sizes hence the rule given is the best that can be crocheted jacket illustration crochet jacket one color or two may be used for making this pretty jacket which is extremely modish and very comfortable for the cool days and evenings sure to be experienced during summer outings six skeins of fourfold germantown will be

work once around without widening slip in the mold miss 1 a double in next and repeat until the cover is closed for the edge of the button and the cord around top of band either the double chain may be made an ordinary chain filled with double crochet orbetter stillthe cord may be knotted by what is called the fools delight methodwhich seems a very sensible method indeed take a length of the angora wool six times as long as the cord is wanted to be indeed it will be better to start with a longer piece for fear it may take up more rapidly than anticipated make a slip or half knot at one end of the yarn pass the other end down through this to form a loop then tie the ends of the yarn together hold this knot between thumb and forefinger of one hand say the right with the yarn which pulls through the half knot under the same hand and the loop which was formed held on the forefinger holding the yarn which does not pull in the left hand pass the forefinger of left hand through the loop on right forefinger from front to back catch up and draw through the nonpulling or lefthand threadexactly as you would make a chainstitch in crochettransfer the knot which ties the two ends together to thumb and forefinger of left hand keeping the loop over forefinger and draw up the pulling yarn or that passed originally through the half knot now the position of the loop pulling yarn and knot is exactly the same in the left hand as formerly in the right continue by passing forefinger of right hand through the loop on left forefinger catching up the nonpulling thread and drawing it through to form the new loop on right forefinger again transfer the knot from left hand to right and pull up repeating the process from beginning this is really a sort of double chain and when one has learned to make it evenly and wellas may be done with a little practiseit will be found superior for bags lingerie and many other articles requiring a drawstring or a cord sew this cord evenly around
