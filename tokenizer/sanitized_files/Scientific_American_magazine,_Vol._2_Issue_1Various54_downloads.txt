washington by marshall s pike of the harmoneons descriptive opposite harpers ferrywhich is situated on a pleasant elevation at the junction of the potomac and shenandoah riversa few rods north of pinnacle bluff a flighty eminence on the blue ridge mountains stands a most singular formation of rock known as washingtons face and which to a casualist void of imaginative powers is easily recognized if pointed out by a guide but to a close observer however with common discernable perception it presents at first sight a most striking and correct resemblance of the great original from midway the bridge which crosses the potomac the countenance and contour of the face to me appeared discriminatingly perfect and constrained me to look upon it as one of the most wonderful and the noblest work of revealed nature in the high barren cliffs of the blue mountain ridge that frightfully hang oer the trestlebuilt bridge juts out into space a huge rocky bluff which the elements rudely left broken and rough near this stands a bust so exquisitely fair that the chisel of art would be uselessness there for nature wrought well till the model was done an impress on stone of our great washington the earth born from chaos at some mighty shock left the image to rest on the high mountain rock on a turretlike peak in the heavens above as a sentinel over the country we love where the sunbeam could linger till daylight had fled where the bright stars of night form a crown oer its head and where through the greenwood the faintest breeze creeps to sigh for the hero who deathlessly sleeps there it stands like a giant in storm and in calm like the hero in battle no foeman could harm and commandingly looks with a patriots pride on the wild mountain stream of potomacs fast tide whose waters swell on in the valley between through the vast hilly regions and forests of green oer a rockbottomed track to the bluebosomed sea from its struggles to rest like our sire of the free stand up there in might till the bright sun shall die till the stars glimmer out their light in the sky and the moon shall no longer lend beauty or light but all shall again be dark chaos and night till then let its base be the tall craggy steep where rocks are oer mossgrown and ivyvines creep with the heavens wide canopy over its head an immortal image of greatness thats dead illustration the viol seraphine introductionthe clear tones of a viol or bass viol are generally admitted to be more melodious than those produced by other kinds of instruments and many have expressed a desire to see an instrument so constructed as to be played with keys like the organ or piano forte and give the tones of the violin this is the character of the instrument here introduced it is elegant in appearance occupies less than half the space of a piano forte and is so light and portable that a ladyperformer may readily place it before her and thus avoid the necessityunpleasant to all partiesof turning her back on the company we do not say that an instrument of this kind has been as yet constructed complete but the principle has been proved and it may and probably will be soon offered to the public at a cost not exceeding sixty dollars explanationin the engraving a side view elevation only is represented showing only one string and one key of a series of twenty or more of each the body of the machine a b is a light hollow chest about three feet square and six inches deep supported by four posts or legs with castors two bridges c and d extend across the breadth of the chest the bridge d is supported by a cleat e in which is inserted the pin f to which is attached one end of the string c d f the other end of the string is simply attached to the bridge c a keylever g h passes through the bridge and is mounted on a pivot therein the front end of the key g is held in its ordinary position by a small spring thereunder and may be easily depressed by the finger of the performer the other end of the key serves as the bearing of the pivot of a delicate arbor the opposite pivot of which has its bearing in the bridge d on the front end of this arbor is a wheel threefourths of an inch in diameter with its periphery smooth and polished with rosin or rosin varnish and so adjusted that by the depression of the key this wheel is brought up in contact with the string whereby if in motion rotarily a full sound is produced as if a violin bow was drawn across the string on the other end of the arbor is a grooved pulley over which passes a silken cord which also passes round a delicate bandwheel i below and by which motion is communicated to the arbor and sounding wheel the bandwheel is mounted on a shaft i j which has its bearings in two small head blocks which project from two crossbars and from the block j is suspended a vertical rod to the bottom of which is attached a treadle k l and from which a curved ratch l m extends upward and takes to a small ratchet on the shaft i j so that by the horizontal motion of the treadle the motion is communicated to the wheel c the teeth of the ratch and ratchet have so gentle an inclination on one side of each that although the ratch applies force to the ratchet in the upward direction they slide freely over in their return it may be understood that the machine is to have two treadles and two ratches which move forward alternately and that twenty or more arbors pulleys strings and keys are arranged in series although only one of each is represented in the engraving the cord applies to each pulley in the series by passing over the first under the second and over the third and so on descending from the last of the series to the bandwheel each arbor is placed directly under its respective string and it is also proposed to place moveable stops under the strings at equal distances from the key bridge and to regulate the tones by adjusting the stops without depending on the pins at the ends for that purpose we shall employ a competent mechanic to construct one or more of these instruments as soon as convenient and give due notice accordingly an eclipse in arabia casting my eyes over the bright full moon i perceived that an eclipse was just coming upon it what astronomer had calculated this eclipse for arabia it was indeed a privilege to witness one in the bright sky that overspread the lonely mountains of seir soon we were seated in a circle with our arabs round their watchfire enquiring of them their views of an eclipse and explaining to them ours they appeared to have no idea of its real cause regarding it as a judgment from god a sign of a bad season and little camel feed when we undertook to explain to them the theory of the earth being round turning over every day sometimes getting between the sun and moon they seemed to look upon us as telling very strange tales the eclipse was nearly total i gazed upon it with interest and then eyed the strange scene around me the wild lonely landscape of rock and sandthe camels kneeling round the bivouacthe wild faces of the arabs reflecting the red light of the fire round which they were seatedtheir wild voices and strange guttural language all combined to produce an effect so startling that i felt till then i had never been thoroughly sensible of our complete separation from the civilized world giving credit one of our exchange says one of our exchanges came to us this week with four of our editorials not credited a frivolous complaint not a week passes but we find in some of our exchanges from ten to twenty of our editorials and instead of complaining we are thankful for being thus complimented the bowie knife and its inventor this instrument was devised by col james bowie an american and a man of desperate valor he considered and apparently with justice too that in close fighting a much shorter weapon than the sword ordinarily in use but still heavy enough to give it sufficient force and at the same time contrive to cut and thrust would be far preferable and more advantageous to the wearer he accordingly invented the short sword or knife which has since gone under his name it is made of various sizes but the best i may say is about the length of a carving knifecase perfectly straight in the first instance but greatly rounded at the end on the edge side the upper edge at the end for the length of about two inches is ground into the small segment of a circle and rendered sharp thus leaving an apparent curve of the knife although in reality the upturned point is not higher than the line of the back the back itself gradually increases in weight of metal as it approaches the hilt on which a small guard is placed the bowie knife therefore has a curved keen point is double edged for the space of about a couple of inches of its length and when in use falls with the weight of a bill hookbowie went to texas during the troubles which preceded the independence of that countryand was lying sick in bed at the fortress of the alamo when on the 6th of march 1836 it was stormed by santa anna and taken bowie was murdered there upon his pillow the hand that formed the dreadful knife could no longer wield it forests and streams that remarkable man humbolt has reduced it almost to a demonstration that the streams of our country fail in proportion to the destruction of its timber and of course if the streams fail our seasons will be worse it must get drier and drier in proportion humbolt speaking of the valley of araguay in venezuela says that the lake receded as agriculture advanced until the beautiful plantations of sugarcane banana and cottontrees were established on its banks which banks year after year were farther from them after the separation of that province from spain and the decline of agriculture amid the desolating wars which swept over this beautiful region the process of clearing was arrested and old lands grew up in trees with that rapidity common to the tropics and in a few years the inhabitants were alarmed by a rise of the waters and an inundation of their choice plantations prussian music the boston brigade band has been presented with a copy of the collection of the celebrated martial music of the prussian army prussia has long been famous for the excellence of its military bands and the music which they have produced is of the highest order we hope this attempt to introduce it into our city will improve the style of martial music here philosophy uncle jo said an observing little boy our folks always put up the window when the room is filled with smoke and the wind always blows in so as to prevent the smoke from going out that way now where does the smoke go it goes into the peoples eyes was uncle jos philosophic answer polite

frequently heard of singular and unaccountable reports as of explosion in deerfield but nothing so definite as the following statement by a correspondent of the portsmouth journal mr editorduring the last twelve years certain curious not to say alarming phenomena in the town of deerfield n h have excited the fears of the inhabitants and we think should ere this have attracted the attention of the scientific these are reports of explosions in the ground apparently of a volcanic or gaseous nature when first heard they were attributed to the blasting of rocks in manchester a new town some ten miles distant but from the frequency of the reports at all hours in the night as well as the day from the consideration that they were so loud and were heard in all seasons winter as well as summer it was soon concluded that they had some other origin the explosions if they may be so called commenced on a ridge of land running s e and n w some five miles in length and principally on that portion called the south road they have however extended and arc now heard in a northerly direction the sounds have become louder and during the last fall and the present spring or summer as many as twenty have been heard in one night many of them jar the houses and ground perceptibly so much so that a child whose balance is not steady will roll from one side to the other they are as loud as a heavy cannon fired near the house with no reverberation and little roll last fall some of the inhabitants were riding in a wagon when an explosion was heard and they saw the stone wall which was apparently quite compact fall over on one side of the way and a second after upon the other the stone wall of an unfinished cellar also fell in this can be attested by many witnesses there is no regularity in these reports as they are heard at intervals of a day a week and sometimes of months but for the last year they have become very common and are heard almost every week more or less extraordinary instance of gambling it is well known upon the western waters that the firemen and other hands employed upon the boats spend much of their idle time in playing cards of the passion for gaming thus excited an instance has been narrated to us upon the most credible authority which surpasses the highest wrought fictions of the gamblers fate a colored fireman on board a steamboat running between saint louis and neworleans had lost all his money at poker with his companions he then staked his clothing and being still unfortunate pledged his own freedom for a small amount losing this the bets were doubled and he finally at one desperate hazard ventured his full value as a slave and laid down his free papers to represent the stake he lost suffered his certificates to be destroyed and was actually sold by the winner to a slave dealer who hesitated not to take him at a small discount upon his assessed value when last heard of by one who knows him and informed us of the fact he was still paying in servitude the penalty of his criminal folly gen taylors patriotism in answer to the complimentary resolutions passed at a meeting in this city some weeks since gen taylor says it is a source

labor the workmen says a paris paper are still busily engaged in excavating montmartre in quest of holy vases and other riches said to have been deposited there in early days of the french revolution by the orders of lady superior of the abbey of montmartre two workmen who were at the time charged with transporting the wealth to the place designated were never seen and it is supposed that they were sacrificed to the necessity of the secret the superior at her death bequeathed the secret to a lady friend who in turn on her death bed divulged it to her daughter then 13 years of age the child

company have laid down a section of their road with cast iron rails of a new construction invented by mr imley these rails are highly approved and are expected to supersede the common wrought rails to a considerable extent it is reported that mr isaac fisk of massachusetts spells his name eyzurk physque well what if he does sageisms he who is passionate and hasty is generally honest its your cool dissembling smiling hypocrite of whom you should beware there is no deceit about a bull dog its only the cur that sneaks up and bites you when your backs turned again we say beware of a man who has psalmody in his looks if a person is bent on quarrelling with you leave the whole of it to himself and he will soon become weary of his unencouraged occupation even the most malicious ram will soon cease to butt against a disregarding object and will usually find his own head more injured than the object of his blind animosity so let them kick an easy flow of words is no sign of an abundance of

your heart we have been forcibly reminded of an interesting anecdote of the revolution while witnessing so many young men in the ranks of the volunteer companies in connection with the highly praiseworthy resolution of the nashville young mens bible society to present a copy of the new testament to each officer and private constituting the regiment quartered here the fondhearted mother had assisted in adjusting upon her son the tow frock and trowsers had tightly secured the knapsack canteen and cartridge box in the strings twisted with her own fingers from the same material as his clothes as he turned on opening the door to speak the manly goodbye she suppressed the parting tear lest it might damp the flame of freedom which fired his noble soul and echoed the goodbye with a forced smile as she went to the window to take another look she discovered the testament had been forgotten she caught it in her hand ran to the doorcalled him loudly holding the book in her uplifted hand in order to show him why she stopped and soon stood by his side without uttering a word she put the book in its place grasped his hand looked him full in the face and with quivering lips heart big with emotion checks bedewed with tears of maternal affection she spoke my son i would not have you stay your country has the first claim upon you be true to that as you have been dutiful to me and heaven will protect youkeep that testament in your vest pocket over your heart after faithfully serving the term of his enlistment he returned to his home before he uttered a word he took from his vest pocket the old testament and there lay british bullet snugly imbedded where the force of the powder had driven it and this was the only shot he had received while fighting for his countrynashville union temperance in the army we are gratified to learn that gen taylor has totally prohibited the traffic in intoxicating liquors in the vicinity of the army one fellow persisting in the trade was put in the guard house by capt miles and when liberated on going to gen taylors tent with a complaint was kicked out he finally took marching orders tother way modes of raising ponderous articles a wedge is considered to be the most simple of mechanical powers and is often used in cases where no other apparatus can be made to apply as in splitting logs and other adhesive articles if a massive rock is to be elevated from the ground a wedge must first be driven between that and its foundation preparatory to the application of levers yet the wedge is in most cases objectionable on account of the friction with which its use is attended the next and most common power applied for elevating buildings on large rocks is the simple lever commonly called a pry this usually consists of a long straight beam or pole one end of which is placed under the object to be raised while a fulcrum consisting of a stone or block of wood is placed under the lever at a short distance from the object to be raised the opposite extremity then being forced down by the weight of one or more of the workmen a force is applied to the object to be raised bearing the same proportion to that applied to the lever that the distance between the fulcrum and the extreme end of the lever does to that between the fulcrum and the object levers made of iron and simply denominated iron bars are commonly used in raising and removing rocks a machine called a bedscrew is frequently used for elevating buildings it originally consisted principally of a large vertical screw which was placed on a foundation called the bed and was turned by levers but many improvements and variations have been added till in some instances the screw has been dispensed with and a rack and pinion have been substituted some of the best in use consist of a vertical iron rack which is occasionally forced upward by the teeth of a pinion a geer wheel on the same axle with the pinion being driven by the thread of a horizontal screw to the head of which is attached a crank by a machine of this construction properly proportioned one man may raise about twenty tons weight vertical screws turned by levers have been frequently used for the purpose of raising vessels to repair but in these cases a large portion of the power applied is lost in the friction of the screw and the process is laborious and tedious this is probably the most awkward and injudicious method that has been applied to that purpose another method which has been applied to the purpose of elevating vessels is decidedly ridiculous although less laborious than the former it is called the hydraulic power and consists in forcing water into large cylinders by forcing pumps which are operated by steam power while the water thus forced into the cylinder moves a piston and pistonrod to which is connected several stout chains which passing over corresponding pulleys descend to a platform on which rests the vessel to be raised an expensive apparatus called the marine railway constructed on the principle of the inclined plane with a huge and complicated carriage to travel thereon has been extensively used for taking vessels out of the water to repair this plan is objectionable however on several accounts it requires the application of a great quantity of power to overcome the friction of its many axles and machinery in addition to what is requisite to overcome the gravity of the vessel it is moreover injurious to the vessels which are taken up thereby on account of its elevating the forward part before the centre and stern become seated on the carriage the most judicious mode in present use for raising vessels to repair and which must be preferred to all others where there is a supply of water from an elevated reservoir is on the principle of locks the vessel being floated into one apartment is elevated by the induction of water from above till it can be floated over an elevated platform where it is left at rest while the water is allowed to pass off below the sides of this upper box or apartment are moveable being attached to the bottom or platform by hinge joints so that they may be let down to a horizontal position thus giving the workmen the advantage of light and convenience the dry dock in the navy yard at charlestown mass is constructed awkwardly enough but as the vessels at that place are not raised it does not come under this head the massive stones which were used in the construction of some of the ancient edifices were evidently raised by inclined planes a huge mound of earth was built up round the building completely enclosing it and the elevation of the mound kept pace with that of the edifice thus giving the laborers a chance to roll up the stones to their places they used no other mechanical power than the simple windlass and lever and no other carriage than a drag under which was placed rollers when the building was completed the earth was taken away and levelled about the vicinity the modern method of raising stones for building and which is now used in the building of heavy stone edifices is by the use of a set of stout tackle blocks the fall rope of which is taken up by a geered windlass operated by a steam engine the upper block being of course attached to an elevated shears or derick vessels and other bodies which have been sunk in the ocean have been sometimes raised by means of airtight sacks attached to different parts of the object by means of diving bells been inflated with air forced down through hollow tubes by pumps till they thus acquired a buoyancy sufficient for the purpose the power of buoyancy has also been applied for elevating vessels above water by placing hollow trunks filled with water under the keel of the vessel and then pumping them out one of the best methods that has ever yet been proposed for raising vessels to repair is to place under the keel a horizontal platform to which is attached four large hollow trunks under its four corners the trunks to be filled with water and to have open apertures in the bottom of each then by allowing a stream of atmospheric air to rush by its own expansive force from the reservoirs in which it had been previously compressed through suitable pipes or hose into each trunk the water is expelled through the apertures in the bottom and the vessel is elevated immediately and without loss of time in this case the reservoirs iron cylinders of compressed air may be recharged by steam or other power during the process of repairing one vessel and be thus in readiness for another a patent has been granted for this invention but it has not yet been put in operation on a scale of practical use though the patentee would willingly give the right of the patent to any person or company who should be disposed to construct the apparatus on a large scale we have recently given a description of mr spencers plan for elevating vessels and some other modes have been recently projected which we may describe in a future number information to persons having business to transact at the patent office sec 1 the existing laws relating to patents are those approved july 4 1836 march 3 1837 and march 3 1839 all former acts having been repealed by the act of 1836 sec 2 patents are granted for any new and useful art machine manufacture or composition of matter or any new and useful improvement

be applicable to themact of 1836 sec 10 sec 10 the patent office will be open for examination during office hours and applicants can personally or by attorney satisfy themselves on inspection of models and specifications of the expediency of filing an application for a patent sec 11 all fees received are paid into the treasury and the law has required the payment of the patent fee before the application is considered twothirds of which fee is refunded on withdrawing the application but no money is refunded on the withdrawal of an application after an appeal has been taken from the decision of the commissioner of patents and no part of the fee paid for caveats and on applications for the addition of improvements reissues and appeals can be withdrawn sec 12 it is a frequent practice for inventors to send a description of their inventions to the office and inquire whether there exists any thing like it and whether a patent can be had therefor as the law does not provide for the examination of descriptions of new inventions except upon application for a patent no answer can be given to such inquiries a sentimental writer says it is astonishing how much light a man may radiate upon the world around him especially when the body he admires is beside him among the persons who recently laid in the boston jail over sunday and were fined monday morning for intemperance or rowdyism were a member of the bar and a clergy man said a bishop to a rough wagoner you seem better fed than taught of course replied the fellow for we feed ourselves but for teaching we depend on you illustration the regulator the use of a pair of conical drums in reversed position and connected by a band as shown in the cut has been known for several years to a few but yet are not extensively known and but a few of them have been seen in operation in this country it will be seen that if the band be removed laterally either to the right or left the relative motion of drums will be materially varied these drums being arranged to constitute a connection of motion between the driving power and driven machine may be made to render the motion of the latter either regular or irregular at the option of the operator if the band connecting the drums is governed by a shifting lever connected with a governor it may be so adjusted as to keep the motion of the machine regular although the driving power should be irregular in its motion as is the case with a windwheel but if the operator is engaged requires a move rapid motion at one time than at another he can accommodate himself by shifting the position of the coneband to the right or left as occasion may require this is very convenient for turners whose business requires at some times a rapid speed of the mandrill and at other times a slow or gentle motion these drums as represented must be swelled in the centre that the band may be kept uniformly straight a remarkable mineral spring it may not perhaps be generally known even to our own citizens that there is in the town of riga ny one mile east of churchville on the farm of linus pierson a mineral spring the gases from which are sufficiently combustible to burn as clear and brightly as a lamp at all times of the day and night and which is never exhausted the spring is located near the bathinghouse on the farm and a tube has been constructed leading from the spring to the rooms by means of which the house is made sufficiently light without the use of lamps some time ago the state geological surveyors paid this spring a visit and analyzed the gas which was found to be composed of sulphurated and carbonated hydrogen the water is strongly impregnated with iron cool forethought one of the most admirable instances of prudential forethought we have ever heard of occurred in boston a few days since three irishmen were engaged in taking down a wall in mount vernon street the wall fell upon and buried them a lady from the opposite side of the street rushed out and calling to those who were rescuing the poor fellows said bring them in here bring them in here i have been expecting this all day the men were carried into her house and true enough she had every thing ready bandages lint laudanum and all if this be not an instance of cool forethought we know not what is it may be so it is stated in a cincinnati paper that the body of a drowned child has been discovered by means of a loaf of bread in which was deposited a quantity of quicksilver the loaf was sent afloat in the canal and after floating some distance remained stationary and beneath the spot thus indicated the child was found that mercury may have a natural attraction towards a human body is possible but the use of the loaf of bread in combination indicate a superstitious faith rather than real science several rich lead mines have recently been discovered on the mississippi river a few miles above bellevue the unusual low state of the river lead to the discovery new inventions howes sewing machine we have heretofore noticed the extraordinary invention by mr elias howe jr of cambridge massa machine that sews beautiful and strong seams in cloth as rapid as nine tailors we are not yet prepared to furnish a full description of this machine but the following claims in the words of the patentee may give some idea of the various parts in combination this machine was patented september 10th i claim the lifting of the thread that passes through the needle eye by the lifting rod for the purpose of forming a loop of loose thread that is to be subsequently drawn in by the passage of the shuttle said lifting rod being furnished with a lifting pin and governed in its motions by the guide pieces and other devices i claim the holding of the thread that is given out by the shuttle so as to prevent its unwinding from the shuttle bobbin after the shuttle has passed through the loop said thread being held by means of the lever or clipping piece i claim the manner of arranging and combining the small lever with the sliding box in combination with the spring piece for the purpose of tightening the stitch as the needle is retracted i claim the holding of the cloth to be sewn by the use of a baster plate furnished with points for that purpose and with holes enabling it to operate as a rack thereby carrying the cloth forward and dispensing altogether with the necessity of basting the parts together steering apparatus mr r c holmes says the united states gazette has invented a new application of the tiller rope to the wheel for steering vessels and has prepared a model of the whole application tillerframe wheel and rope so that the properties of the invention can be easily discovered the advantages are that there is no slack made and consequently there is no chafing and a single hand at the wheel will do the ordinary work of two men electromagnetic boat it is stated in some of our exchanges that dr page of washington has perfected a boat to be propelled by the electromagnetic power we know of no man better qualified to produce and introduce successfully such an invention and we feel assured that whatever enterprise dr page undertakes in that line will be very apt to go ahead we hope soon to obtain further intelligence on the subject it is reported that the british government has granted 100000 per annum to the royal company of atlantic steamers for the establishment of a post route to the pacific across the isthmus of panama improvement in boats there is a model of a steamboat to be seen on the chesapeake invented and constructed by cyrus williams esq which is exciting considerable interest among steamboat men it is in the usual form of a boat but more flatbottomed and much longer in proportion to its width than the boats now in use giving it a greater surface to the water and of course a lighter draught the improvement is in applying the bridge principle of bearers in supporting length of boats it looks perfectly feasible mr williams thinks it will be a great saving of expense as it takes much less timber and all of it can be sawed in a mill being straight stuff he offers to build a boat on this model furnishing one third of the stock and if it does not make 25 miles to the hour he will forfeit his share casting iron cannon by a galvanic process a hoaxical looking article under the above caption is going the rounds and represents that successful experiments on this subject have been recently made at berlin as no description or illustration of the process or principle is given we leave the subject for those who are ever ready to swallow whatever appears in a newspaper without regard to probability new shingle machine among the patents particularly noticed in the commissioners report is one for a shingle machine which cuts the shingles in a peculiar form the shingles cut by this machine does not taper from one extremity to the other but the taper is confined to about half the length of it at one end the faces of the remaining half being parallel to each other this shape of the shingle avoids the bending which is incidental to those of the ordinary form when nailed upon the roofan object well worthy of attainment improvement in blacksmiths forges this invention was entered at the patent office on the 15th instant by james k hobbs the improvement consists in the placing of gratebars at the bottom of the fire chamber below which is an open air chamber into which the cinders and ashes fall through the grate instead of accumulating and clogging the fire chamber the cinders may be drawn out of the air chamber by an opening at the side of the forge the blast is admitted above the grate and the mouth of the air chamber being ordinarily closed the blast is not affected by the grate we think it must prove a useful invention improved fire engine this improvement consists in part in the arrangement of two sets of levers and hand poles on each side in such a manner that when force is applied to the handpoles of the outside levers in a reverse direction to that which is applied to the hand poles of the inside levers both powers will agree in forcing the pistons of the pumps in one and the same direction while the reverse motion of the levers will prevent the engine from rocking entered at the patent office on the 10th instant by barton button a simple cheesepress illustration an ingenious mechanic not long since hearing some persons conversing on the ordinary cost of cheesepresses which is generally from three to six dollars boldly averred that he could build a cheesepress in one hour which would answer a good purpose as such and which might be afforded for fifty cents being bantered on the subject he went to work and by means of a good lathe and boring machine he actually produced his cheesepress within the hour though not very smoothly finished we give a sketch of it at the head of this articletoo plain to require explanation subsequently several others were made on the same plan cast iron roofing a specimen of castiron plates for roofing of buildings says the philadelphia ledger has been exhibited at the exchange in philadelphia by the inventor and patentee mr wm beach the plates are about a foot square and are made to fit one into another so as to render the roof perfectly watertight with the application of white lead to the joints in every respect this material for roofing is preferable to any other description now in use as to its durability there can be no doubt that it would remain perfectly whole for ages if covered occasionally with a coat of paint and even without that preservative rust would not affect it materially for a period of fifty years at least as compared with copper the cost would be nearly one half as it is expected the iron can be furnished at 16 cents per square foot while copper would at the most moderate estimate cost 28 cents as regards the weight of an iron roof which at first sight would appear an objection it is far less than one formed of slate and does not much exceed one of copper the iron plates weigh three and a half pounds per square foot a slate roof would cost about eight cents per square foot but for durability and the ease with which it can be put on and made water tight the iron roofing would appear to be far preferable the plates exhibited were cast at troy new york and are of the very best quality the patent for the eastern states is now owned by mr hiram hemmistone of troy in which neighborhood the adaptation of such a durable material for roofing is rapidly attracting public attention there starbucks machine shop and foundry at troy has been covered on this plan and it has also been adopted for the roofing of an arsenal at west point the new and wonderful pavement we presented in a late number a brief extract from an article on this subject from the eureka and should have thought no more of it had we not observed the following notice editorial in the n y farmer and mechanic we copy the article entire that our readers may judge for themselves whether the style and statements savor most of reality or humbug new pavementsa new system of making streets has been made known to usbut as it will be the subject of patents here and in europe we can only give some of its most prominent features a material or composition of a very cheap character has been invented as hard strong and compact as flint it is formed into any desirable shape in the course of manufacture from this streets of any grade may be formed and in such a way as to entirely secure a permanent and level surface to its proper arch it can be taken up in five minutes so as to get at the water pipes and on being replaced will from necessity resume its first position in durability it will last ten times as long as granite and twenty times as long as the common paving without liability to require repair it is so laid that frost and storms cannot affect it but we shall have occasion to refer to it againpersons wishing information may inquire of kingsley pirsson no 5 wall street to render shingles durable one of our exchanges mentions an experiment which was made twentyseven years ago of dipping shingles into hot linseed oil prior to nailing them on the roof and although they have not been painted they are said to continue perfectly sound as when first put on they were of the common pine and as much exposed as roofs in general this instance may be sufficient to establish the fact that shingles thus prepared will last longer without painting than they could possibly be preserved by painting in the usual way as a security against fire however we should recommend that they be first dipped in a hot solution of common salt and afterward when dry be dipped in the hot oil the expense will be trifling and there can be no doubt of their durability and there will be no danger of their taking fire from sparks or cinders best plan of a barn perhaps no building on the farm in the northern states is of more importance than the barn those who have had the charge of cattle during our long winters can at once see that much time and hard labor could be saved by a judicious arrangement of stalls and bay or bay lots granaries c so that every creature could be fed by taking as few steps as possible one very important thing to be considered is the best mode of preserving as well as collecting manure so that it shall retain all its valuable properties in the spring and be easily got out we like the plan of having a barn on the side of a hill and so arranged that you may drive your cart load in pretty near the ridge pole and thus pitch most of your hay down instead of up having your stalls under the hay you can continue to pitch the hay down and if you have a cellar beneath you can throw the manure down also and thus make the attraction of gravitation perform much of the labor of transportation from the mow to the manure cart the westfield mass newsletter states that there are between 25 and 30 manufacturers of whips in that town who employ not less than 1000 braiders beside their shop hands robert fulton robert fulton a celebrated engineer whose name is connected with steamboat navigation was born in the town of little britain in the state of pennsylvania in 1765 his genius disclosed itself at an early period he was attracted to the shops of mechanics and at the age of seven he painted landscapes and portraits in philadelphia thus he was enabled in part to purchase a small farm for his widowed mother at the age of twentyone he by the advice of his friends repaired to london to place himself under guidance of mr west the painter and by him was kindly received and admitted as an inmate of his house for several years prosecuting his business as painter he spent two years in devonshire where he became acquainted with the duke of bridgewater and with lord stanhope well known for his attachment to the mechanic arts in 1793 he engaged in the project of improving inland navigation and in 1796 obtained patents for a double inclined plane and for machines for spinning flax and making ropes the subject of canals now chiefly occupied his attention and at this period in 1796 his work on canals was published in his profession of civil engineer he was greatly benefitted by his skill in drawing and painting he went to paris in 1797 and being received into the family of joel barlow he there spent seven years studying chemistry physics and mathematics and acquiring a knowledge of the french italian and german languages in dec 1797 he made his first experiment on submarine explosion in the seine but without success his plan for a submarine boat was afterwards perfectedin 1801 while he was residing with his friend mr barlow he met in paris chancellor livingston the american minister who explained to him the importance in america of navigating boats by steam mr fulton had already conceived the project as early as 1793 as appears by his letter to lord stanhope he now engaged anew in the affair and at the common expense of himself and mr livingston built a boat on the seine in 1803 and successfully navigated the river the principles of the steam engine he did not invent he claimed only the application of that machine to water wheel for propelling vessels in 1806 he returned to america he and mr livingston built in 1807 the first boat the clermont 130 feet in length which navigated the hudson at the rate of five miles an hour nothing could exceed the surprise and admiration of all who witnessed the experiment the minds of the most incredulous were changed in a few minutes before the boat had made the progress of a quarter of a mile the greatest unbeliever must have been converted the man who while he looked on the expensive machine thanked his stars that he had more wisdom than to waste his money on such idle schemes changed the expression of his features as the boat moved from the wharf and gained her speed and his complacent expression gradually softened into one of wonder the jeers of the ignorant who had neither sense nor feeling to suppress their contemptuous ridicule and rude jokes were silenced for a moment by a vulgar astonishment which deprived them of the power of utterance till the triumph of genius extorted from the incredulous multitude which crowded the shores shouts and acclamations of congratulation and applause in february 1809 he took out his first patent in 1811 and 1812 he built two steam ferry boats for crossing the hudson he contrived also a very ingenious floating dock for the reception of those boats in 1813 he obtained a patent for a submarine battery conceiving the plan of a steam manofwar the government in march 1814 appropriated 320000 for constructing it and appointed him the engineer in about four months she was launched with the name of fulton the first but before this frigate was finished fulton had paid the debt of nature the population of great britain for the last ten years shows an average annual increase of 230000 the population of london has increased 27 per cent within fifteen years within the last 16 years 612 steamboats have been built in pittsburgbesides 31 the present year introduction to volume ii with our best bow we present ourselves before our friends and the public in a new dress from head to foot and though conscious of appearing rather plain and quakerlike we can assure our friends that in this we conform to the newest fashion and have no doubt of being treated civilly by as large a portion of the public as if we had appeared with more gay feathers in our cap with starched ruffles and gilt buttons and trimmings in this however we would not be understood to boast of any peculiar evidence of taste of our own as we have been induced in this instance to submit wholly to that of our tailors who it must be conceded understand these things much better while we have only to regard alertness and independence of movement with a little vivacity and intelligence of conversationour general principles and rules of selfgovernment will continue according to our original pledge and the policy pursued in our first volume we shall endeavor to encourage and excite a spirit of enterprise and emulation in artists manufactures and mechanics while we present such instruction and useful intelligence in arts and trades practical science and new discoveries inventions and improvements as will add to the facilities of enterprise and conduce to the prosperity and independence of the working class in particular and that we may furnish an acceptable family newspaper we shall continue to give in a brief and condensed form the most useful and interesting intelligence of passing eventsnot omitting a small portion of serious matter suitable for sunday reading but avoiding the disgusting and pernicious details of crime with which too many of our public journals abound and which evidently produces a deleterious effect on the morals of the community with regard to political and sectarian subjects however we feel much inclined to change our style of neutrality so far as to advocate all parties sects and denominations each in its turn which course may be more in accordance with our own maxim of enlightening and pleasing than either growling policy or the affected indifference and cold inattention which tends to produce a reciprocity of coldness and pleases none on the subject of policy and rules we might say more but having already said twice as much as we at first intended and finding ourselves near the bottom of the scrap on which we scribble we have only to find some suitable form of sentence wherewith to round off this subject and for this purpose without wishing to be suspected of any motives of interest we would gently and respectfully suggest to our readers the propriety of advancing the intelligence enterprise and consequent prosperity of the community by introducing and recommending to the patronage of all this same scientific american advantage of low fares during the month of july 1845 when the fare between new york and boston was reduced to the ruinous rates of only two dollars the receipts on the different routes were 45208 but during the corresponding month of the present year with the fare up to four dollars the receipts have been only 35963 being nine thousand two hundred and fortyfive dollars less for a single month than when the fares were at halfprice avalon railroad iron

havana illustration havana harbor our engraving represents a view of the harbor of havana which is one of the most commodious in the world communicating with the sea by a channel little more than half a mile in length and from 300 to 350 yards wide its depth varying from eight to ten fathoms the harbor itself is an oblong basin surrounded by heights which usually shelter it from the wind havana is a place of considerable strength and besides the walls and ditches which surround it the city is defended by six strongholds called the moro the cobanas no 4 the atares the principie and the putna the first and last serve to protect the entrance of the harbor the second is a sort of citadel and the others are so placed as to cover the approaches by land the line of fortification embraces a sort of irregular polygon of an eliptical form the greatest diameter of which is 2100 yards and the smallest 1200 yards in extent the entrance between the moro and putna castles is about 1500 yards long and in its narrowest part 350 yards wide in the arsenal of the havana there have been built 49 ships of the line 22 frigates 7 packet ships 9 brigs of war and 15 schooners of war the town is built on the western side of the basin near the channel on a kind of promontory the suburbs or barrios esta muros cover more ground and contain a larger population than the city itself and yet they are so intimately connected with it that the first of the houses in the suburban street stands on the very edge of the glacis the streets are narrow crooked and generally unpaved but they contain some wellbuilt houses there are too several good buildings among the churches one of which contains the remains of christopher columbus the other large edifices as the palace of the government shown to the right of the engraving that of the commandant of the marine the arsenal the postoffice and the building used for the manufacture of tobacco are less remarkable for their architecture than for their solidity besides these the city contains nine parish churches six other churches connected with hospitals and military orders five chapels or hermitages the caza cuna a foundling hospital and eleven convents four for women and seven for men the other public establishments are the university the colleges of san carlos and san francisco de soles the botanic garden the anatomical museum and lecture rooms the academy of painting and design a school of navigation and seventyeight common schools for both sexes these places of education are all under the protection of the patriotic society and the municipal authorities the charitable institutions consist of the caza de beneficiencia for both sexes a penitentiary a magdalen asylum and seven hospitalsone of them contains a lunatic asylum there are besides three theatres an amphitheatre for bull fights plaza de toros and several public promenades such as the alameda and the paseo nuevo in turnbulls travels in cuba published by longman co london 1840 the city is said to contain 3671 houses within the walls all built of stone and in the suburbs 7968 of various materials the number of private carriages for hire amounted in 1827 to 2651 and they are certainly now more numerous in the same year the population was 122023the whites were 46621 the free negroes 15347 the free mulattoes 8215 the negro slaves 22830 and the mulatto slaves 1010 turnbull speaking of the real caza de beneficencia says girls are not admitted to the institution after 10 years of age and being entirely supported there they are completely separated from their parents and their families until the time of their final removal from the establishment has arrived they are taught the various branches of needlework and dressmaking and receive such other instruction as may sufficiently qualify them for becoming domestic servants housemaids cooks or washerwomen they are not suffered by the regulations to remain in the house after the age of twentyone but before that time it is the duty of the junta or committee of management to endeavor to procure employment for them earlier in a private family or in some house of business should the circumstances of the parents have improved during the stay of their daughter at the institution they are not suffered to take her away until they have paid her previous board and education at the rate of fifteen dollars a month but if the girl herself has acquired property by inheritance or is able to improve her condition by marriage or otherwise independent of her parents she is suffered to leave the house without any payment and in the event of her marriage to the satisfaction of the junta a little dowry is provided for her amounting to 500 from a fund created from prizes in the lottery the produce of tickets presented to the institution six such marriages had taken place and dowries bestowed from this fond in the course of a single year this lottery business shows the spirit of gambling so largely

up the appearance of many things and circumstances like the above cut depends on the view we take of them and be it remembered that when a mans head is inverted to him all appear wrong side up hence arises most of the complaints grumbling and murmurings about the times the weather the government the people c to one who possesses or is possessed of a malignant peevish disposition himself most of the conduct of others and the times and circumstances in general will to him appear wrong side up and he will not infrequently find his own calculations up side down could we at once view each circumstance in all its different bearings we should generally see some things that would paliate others and thus render the whole at least tolerable and most of the jarring and clashing in the world would thus be avoided but by far the better way is to take of each and every thing a view the most favorable this course is evidently peaceable else politicians and sectarians could not so uniformly applaud every act of their favorite sect or party and as uniformly oppose and deprecate those of their opponents every man who habituates himself to viewing things in the most favourable light will find this course the most conducive to his own happiness while it contributes much to that of his neighbors and associates look at the bright side of every thing and hold every picture right side up importance of humility dr franklin once received a very useful lesson from the excellent dr cotton mather which he thus relates in a letter to his sonthe last time i saw your father was in 1724 on taking my leave he showed me a shorter way out of the house by a narrow passage which was crossed by a beam over head we were still talking and as i withdrew he accompanying me behind and i turning towards him he said hastily stoop stoop i did not understand him till i felt my head hit against the beam he was a man who never missed an opportunity of giving instruction and upon this he said to me you are young and have the world before you learn to stoop as you go through it and you will miss many hard thumps this advice thus beat into my head has frequently been of use to me and i often think of it when i see pride mortified and misfortune brought upon people by their carrying their heads too high an ambassador is defined as a man sent abroad to lie for the good of his country to

inventors we had not intended to say any thing on the subject of the eureka in this number nor until the second number of the work should have been issued but finding that a great degree of dissatisfaction exists in the minds even of those who are represented in that paper to be the supporters and conductors thereof and having received an implied request for the insertion of the following communication we would not refuse it although we doubt whether the eureka will ever reach its third number whether its contents are subjected to public criticism or not mr editor i had a little curiosity to hear what the press said of this periodical but as yet i have not seen any notice except the brief one in your columns as a general rule it is inexpedient for an association to publish a periodical instead of being an expression of the society it almost unavoidably becomes the organ of a clique and renders the patronage of an otherwise liberal organization subservient to private interest in the columns of the n york farmer was first advocated the formation of the n y state agricultural society among the first acts of this society was the issuing of an agricultural paper at twentyfive cents per annum this was scattered over the whole country to the injury of those who had been pioneers in publishing agricultural papers the society could not sustain it without loss it was sold to an individual on condition that he would publish the proceedings of the society the price was quadrupled it was soon found that a periodical having a general circulation could not devote much space to a local society however noble and prosperous necessity led to the columns of the daily press and to the issuing of a yearly volume of transactions this will be the result of every prosperous association if the proceedings are worth publishing the press will spread them over the whole face of the civilized world a collection of the most important and welldigested papers in a yearly volume is more in accordance with the dignity and usefulness of a national association besides the injustice done to other periodicals previously in existence the association adds nothing to its reputation by the undertaking there are three or four individuals at the american institute who have a hankering for the control of a paper it is very easy to see that the publishing of a weekly paper by the institute would be a suicidal act all the institute has to do is to make its proceedings interesting and the widest publicity will be given as a matter of course it was natural to suppose that with such an array of editors editorial committee and of associate professors the eureka would have done credit to the age and claimed a rank in point of literature with other monthlies but candor leads me to say i do not recollect of having read a select journal with so many violations of correct writing with the exception of two or three articles the whole number abounds with schoolboy violations of the english language redundancy and the want of appropriateness in the use of words are the most common errors circumlocution and want of precision are common and in many sentences all these and other violations occur rendering it almost impossible to guess at the meaning independent of inflexibly in advance on the cover the first sentence in the announcement on the first page is an instance of ambiguity and careless construction in the first article on the same page are several sentences indicating the same carelessness the article describing hoes cylinder press is a collection

after these details reached the u states by professor s f b morse of new york who was at the time of the discovery residing in paris this committee give their services for the promotion of good to the cause of invention and science without any consideration other than this almost all other branches of knowledge have their magazines and journals and other means of diffusing information so that in their departments hardly a desideratum is left to be supplied while the inventor as such has almost no channel through which he may legitimately appear before the public an editorial committee was accordingly appointed for the supervision of this department and to whose inspection all matter of the journal previous to publication will be submitted all the previous articles have been descriptive we now come to our argumentative on novelty in inventions the reasoning powers of the writer may be learned from the following thus we conclude that the novelty of an invention consists in making something useful to society and that in an original and novel way so as to embody the great principle of invention or as far as the writer has informed us the novelty is the useful the useful is the original and novel and the original and novel are the great principle and the great principle is the novelty or something else we offer an explanation not an apology for the want of a more full

apartmentwhere to their astonishment they found four girls of uncommon beauty richly dressed in company not with four gentlemen but with four enormous bearswhich after the first outbreak of music began to dance with the girls all the figures of french quadrilles with the utmost accuracy and with as much ease as if they were highly educated gentlemen at first the guests were alarmed but seeing the extra ordinary tameness of the beasts struck with amazement they seemed to have been pleased with this extraordinary sight after the dance was over their bearships conducted themselves with the

person and all around her at length that curiosity which is the moving spring of womans actions could be no longer resisted by her female admirers who at the close of the ball instituted a rigid examination of the nature of those incomparable brilliants when to their astonishment they found that they were no more or less than so many fire flies which the envy of the ballroom had secured in

consisting of three parts of rosepink with one of vermillion ground in a mixture of oil japan and spirits of turpentine is applied with a common flat graining brush fancy boxes and cabinet furniture are painted by a different process by which a better imitation is produced the ground is prepared by one or more coats of white lead changed two or three shades with yellow ochre when dry a thin staining of burnt terradesienna ground in water containing a very little sugar or gumarabic is laid on the work and while this continues moist and flowing the graining is applied the graining should consist of a mixture of black and rose pink ground in the staining compound this must be varnished when dry with copal varnish some prefer however to grind the staining and graining in oil diluted with spirits of turpentine the learner must have some sample pieces of varnished rosewood before him when graining india rubber the substance called india rubber or caoutchouc was not known in europe until the beginning of the eighteenth century it was originally brought as a great curiosity from south america europeans continued ignorant of its origin until a deputation of the french academicians undertook a voyage to south america in 1735 for the purpose of obtaining the correct admeasurement of a degree of the meridian these philosophers did not confine their attention to the one great object of their pursuit but among other interesting discoveries made themselves acquainted with that peculiar substancecaoutchouc these academicians discovered at emeralds in brazil trees called by the natives heve whence flowed a juice which when dried proved to be what is called india rubber the heve was also found growing in cayenne and on the banks of the amazon river it has since been discovered that caoutchouc may be obtained from another species of tree growing in south america called jatropha elastica if these trees are punctured a milky juice flows out which on exposure to the air thickens into a substance of a pure white color having neither taste nor smell the hue of the caoutchouc of commerce is black in consequence of the method employed in drying it the usual manner of performing this operation is to spread a thin coating of the milky juice upon the moulds made of clay and fashioned into a variety of figures these are then dried by exposure to the heat of a smokefire another layer is then spread over the first and dried by the same means and thus layer after layer is put on until the whole is of the required thickness while yet soft it will receive and retain any impression that may be given to if on the outside when perfectly dry the clay within is broken into small fragments by percussion and the pieces are drawn out through the aperture which is always left fur the purpose the common bottle of india rubber therefore consists of numerous layers of pure caoutchouc alternating with as many layers of soot the natives of those parts of south america to which these trees are indigenous convert the juice to a variety of purposes they collect it chiefly in the rainy season because though it will exude at all times it flows then most abundantly boots are made of it by the indians through which water cannot penetrate and the inhabitants of quito prepare a kind of cloth with it which they apply to the same purposes as those for which oilcloth or tarpaulin it used here this no doubt is similar to the cloth now prepared with this substance in america the use of which yields so many important advantagesyouths gazette communication on atmospheric resistance the following letter has been on hand several weeks but deferred on account of a constant press of matter by which the limited space in our former small sheet was crowded our respected correspondent has consented to excuse the delay providence 1846 friend porter in january last i addressed a few lines to you asking information in regard to an article entitled atmospheric resistance in the new york mechanic of december 11 1841 in your answer you say if the full surface is 30000 square feet to each wing which makes 60000 square feet only about half of one horse power would be required to sustain this weight and i understand you virtually to say that they must be ten times as large in order that the strength of one man be sufficient to work this and elevate himself together with the apparatus if it were not too heavy now this makes 600000 square feet this is rather more than 774 feet square rather large sized wings one would suppose that they might lift rather heavy if they were very light being 387 by 774 feet each now to me this is entirely incomprehensible and i should like an explanation if this calculation is correct how it is that an eagle which sometimes weighs nearly thirty pounds can elevate himself with so much ease and even carry with him nearly his own weight using a pair of wings which if they were five feet long and two feet wide each would make but twenty feet of surface thus you will see is no where in proportion to the weight even of the eagle alone which we will suppose to weigh twenty pounds that the wings bears to the 150 pounds while on the other hand it is near in proportion to the surface of the wings of a pidgeon and its weight nor can i comprehend why it would require so much power the eagle though he exerts himself considerable in rising no doubt does not seem to use power any where in the proportion that you have thought would be required supposing the wings to be made in the same proportion to the 150 pounds that his wings are to his weight his beats are not so quick but what they can be very easily counted by answering you will much oblige your friend yankee in answer to the foregoing we would remind our correspondent that in his former communication he proposed a limited weight of apparatus and in our answer it was far from our intention to allow an additional weight on account of the requisite extent of surface with regard to the philosophy of the flight of the eagle it must be borne in mind that atmospheric resistance is as the square of the velocity downward and the only way in which the phenomenon of the flight of the eagle can be reconciled with the laws of mechanical science as established by experiment is by supposing the velocity of the wing downward to be equal to 70 feet per second whereby a resistance would be encountered equal to 12 pounds per square foot of surface to the wings it is a fact however that kites and hawks are often seen to continue suspended in the air several minutes without any apparent motion of the wings but by what law or theory the feat is accomplished natural philosophy has ventured no other conjecture than that the bird is endowed with the faculty of suspending occasionally its ordinary subjection to the laws of gravity if any observing theorist will give any more rational conjecture on the subject we should be glad to have him examine it it is proposed and urged by the papers in several states to have a thanksgiving day throughout the union on the 26th of november as dull as a hoe is a very common phrase and implies that hoes are necessarily or ordinarily dull but it is advisible for farmers to keep their hoes sharp as they regard a saving of labor illustration the conical windlass the conical windlass various methods have been heretofore described for raising heavy bodies or producing for other purposes a great forceusually miscalled powerby the application of a comparatively small force but no method is known more unlimited in its effect or more simple in construction than the conical windlass it consists of a simple horizontal windlass with a crank at one end as shown in the engraving the windlass is made in a conical form being a little larger at one end than at the other and if the friction of its bearings be relieved by the ordinary friction rollers it will so far multiply the force applied as to break a double inchrope by the power of one man at the crank an endless rope or one of which the two ends are spliced together is passed five or six times round the small end of the windlass and down under a single pulley below then as the windlass is turned by the crank the rope is constantly given off from one part while the circumference is greater now it is plain that if the windlass is onefifth of an inch larger in circumference at the point at which the rope is taken up than at the place where it is given off to the pulley that whatever may be appended thereto will be raised one tenth of an inch by each revolution then if we suppose the crank lever to be fifteen inches the handle will travel about 100 inches in each revolution which gives a power or increase of force of 1000 to one therefore if 100 pounds of power be applied to the crank handle it will be sufficientminus frictionto raise a weight of 100000 lbs the only inconvenience in this apparatus and which prevents its coming into more general use is that it is too limited in the extent of its motion in consequence of the travelling of the rope from one end of the windlass to the other thus if the windlass be but twentyfive inches long and the rope one inch in diameter it will admit only twenty revolutions without renewing yet in many cases in which an article in required to be raised or moved but a few inches the conical windlass will be found preferable to any other method requisite strength of steam boilers our correspondent s b cannot comprehend that the strength of iron for a cylindrical boiler should be in direct proportion to the diameter thereof in order to sustain an equal pressure per square inch wherefore we must reason with him on the long scale the cohesive strength of good iron is 64000 lbs per square inch and of course a strip of boileriron plate 18th inch thick will sustain 8000 lbs if a boiler made of thin iron is 14 inches in diameter or 44 inches in circumference each inch of its length will contain 44 square inches and either half thereof will contain 22 inches and as the pressure on this portion is sustained by at least two inches of width of plateone inch on each sideit follows that it will sustain a pressure of at least 700 lbs per square inch in the direction of circumference if the diameter is double the number of square inches will be double and will require double the thickness to sustain equal pressure with regard to the pressure endwise the area of a cylinder head 14 inches in diameter is 154 inches and the strength of the 44 inches of circumference would be sufficient to sustain 352000 lbs which divided by the area is 2275 lbs per square inch if the diameter is 56 inches the circumference being 172 would sustain a pressure endwise of 555 lbs per inch thus it will be seen that if the cylinder were even 20 feet in diameter the iron would better sustain the pressure on the head that on the periphery with regard to the requisite strength of the cylinders head if they are made in a semispherical convex form they will require no more thickness of plate than the cylinder but if they consist of plane disks the thickness thereof should bear the same proportion to that of the periphery that the area in square inches does to three times the circumference but in general no other rule is observed for the thickness of the heads than to make them extravagantly heavy without much regard to theoretic calculation bagleys gold pens do our readers wish to hear any thing more about them if so they have only to inquire of any one of

overhung with thick vines he was actually startled by the immense numbers of humming birds which hovered over and about him they hovered about him as if actuated by curiosity alone they were of various kinds and colors some of them being nearly as large as sparrows while others were but little larger than a bee some were of a dingy green or a light brown while others seemed gaudily arrayed in plumage as brilliant and variegated as the rainbow they would approach within arms length of his face and pausing in their flight with their little wings in rapid motion would stare at him as if they wondered what possible business he could have in those remote wilds but they exhibited no symptoms of terror not having been taught by experience to fear the cruelty of man the new york
