is available for work in mines tunnels or quarries for driving rock drills coal cutters and hauling and pumping engines working mining pumps for use in factories and in fact for all service where a safe and efficient power is required the construction of the machine the capacity of which differs according to the amount of power required will readily be understood from the illustration above the air cylinder are two distinct air chambers each having two induction or receiving valves which cushion on rubbers with the movement of the piston these chambers alternately receive and force the compressed air through check valves placed in the upper part of the air compartment both compartments being connected with one pipe conveying the air to the ordinary air receiver these check valves lift alternately and cushion on water and as the compressed air is forced into the pipe connecting with the receiver without a possibility of any of it escaping back into the receiving chambers it is claimed that there is the smallest possible loss of power and that the machine will give fully 90 per cent of steam power expended in the shape of compressed air the compressor is compact in form strongly made simple in construction and not liable to get out of order one peculiarity in its construction is that no water jacket or hollow piston is used yet under any of the extreme pressures to which the machine has been tested no inconvenience we are informed from heat has been perceptible in connection with the compressor receivers of various sizes are used into which the air is pumped and thence conveyed by pipe to the location where required even if it be a mile or more the loss by friction between receiver and point of utilization of the air being it is claimed under 2 lbs of the pressure the manufacturers also build waterpower compressors one of which driven by 75 to 100 horse power they have recently shipped to utah the machine is intended to convey the air through iron tubes 5000 feet to the mouth of a silver mine where a 50 horse power hoisting and a 25 horse power pumping engine will be driven by air instead of steam and a tube will be extended into the mine 1000 feet deep where the power drills and small pumps will be operated by air also the manufacturers submit a number of excellent testimonials from parties using the machine from one we learn that at the antelope and prince of wales mine near alta city utah the compressor runs 10 hours per day and supplies compressed air to two 3 inch drills used in running levels the distribution terminates at distances of from 1000 to 2000 feet from the compressor the machine also drives one hoisting engine and ventilates the lower part of the mine the main supply pipe is three inches in diameter 2300 feet long and is tapped by two inch pipe wherever power is required the expenditure of fuel is one cord of green pine wood and 600 lbs of bituminous coal per 10 hours air pressure in receiver 100 lbs this pressure is reported to be obtained by 70 lbs of steam as indicated by the gauges for further particulars address the manufacturers messrs griffith and wedge zanesville ohio illustration bowers air compressor death of professor santini a cable dispatch announces the death of the italian astronomer giovanni santini the professor was born at tuscany june 30 1786 and was in the ninetyfirst year of his age he graduated at the university of pisa he soon devoted himself to a study of the exact sciences and in 1814 he had achieved so much distinction that he was appointed to a professorship in the padowa observatory in place of vincenzo cheminello in 1825 he was appointed rector of the university and up to the time of his death he held the position of professor of astronomy and director of mathematical studies he was generally esteemed by the learned societies of europe and held a number of honorary titles and degrees from various leading universities he was also a correspondent of the french academy the principal books published by him are strictly scientific such as decimal arithmetic 1808 elements of astronomy 1820 logarithms and trigonometry and optical problems 182123 some of his elementary works on astronomy for beginners are the best ever published in italy john yule the death is announced of mr john yule of the hutchestown engine works rutherglen n b at the age of 66 during early life mr yule went the round of the best engineers shops in scotland and england and became one of the recognized leaders in engineering progress his inventiveness took various directions amongst other fruits being an improved rotary engine a compensating governor for the steam engine and a screw tap drill and mandrel for the latter he was awarded the silver medal of the scottish society of arts for some years mr yule acted as the manager of the boiler department of messrs robert napier sons establishment but eventually resumed business at the hutchestown works and devoted attention amongst other matters to the improvement of swing bridges and steam cranes and hammers in the former line two of his most important works are the plate girder bridge over the entrance to one of the docks at port glasgow for the caledonian railway erected from plans by messrs bell and miller ce glasgow and a lattice girder bridge over the entrance to kingston dock glasgow harbor owing to the angle at which this last bridge crosses the dock great difficulties were experienced in working out the mechanical details so as to admit of easy motion these were skillfully overcome and the bridge was as finally erected a monument of his design as well as workmanship the blackhill incline on the monkland canal constructed nearly a quarter of a century ago is a sample of mr yules mechanical powers of late years he was largely engaged as a professional valuator business prospects we have recently taken the pains to make inquiries from the more eminent bankers and merchants in the chief cities of the interior and the results of our inquiries have tended to confirm the belief we have more than once expressed in this journal that although from various causes there is overhanging a portion of our american industries a cloud of gloom and depression still throughout the nation at large there is going on a process of growth and recovery from which the best results are anticipated how long we shall have to wait before the life which is at work silently and secretly beneath the surface will put forth its full power in the full harvest of productive activity is of course impossible to foretell what is chiefly important for us to know however is that the progress we are making tends upwards and not downwards and that it promises to lead our industry and commerce

episode in africas experiences of that nature on one of the earlier monuments of egypt there is figured a slavehunters raid upon an ethiopian village the horrid details of which are said by travelers to be an accurate picture of a slave raid of today the same murderous work has been going on incessantly for at least 4000 years how much longer there is no telling for all these ages the african borders have known war and war only and of the most destructive and barbarizing nature recently under the influence of sir samuel baker colonel gordon and the civilized world in general the khedive of egypt has carried war into the interior in the interests of peace a conquest in a measure justified by the suppression of intertribal war for the filling of slave pens and the abolition of the slave trade down the nile a similar reform has been effected on the east coast by the pressure of english power on the sultan of zanzibar and the immediate effect of these two movements has been to prevent the butchery or enslavement of not less than half a million negroes annually a still more promising invasion of africa has just been decided upon in the international geographical conference in brussels an invasion wholly in the interests of peace and civilization at the meeting a year ago it was declared advisable to establish by international effort a line of permanent commercial stations from bagomoyo on the coast of zanzibar to st paul de loanda on the opposite atlantic coast the first stations to be at ujiji where stanley found livingstone on the eastern shore of lake tanganyika at nyangwe livingstones furthest point northward on the lualaba and at some point further west on the route of cameron to be fixed in the dominions of muata yamvo one of the most powerful chiefs of central africa at the second conference which ended june 24 arrangements were made for sending out the first expedition toward tanganyika the object of the proposed stations is the development of civilization by commerce not by religious propaganda primarily they will serve as bases of operation for explorers of the interior a sort of entrepts where the explorer may supply himself with provisions instruments and goods and thus save the cost and embarrassment of an army of porters from the coast they will also serve as places of refuge for explorers in times of sickness and other reverses which have hitherto so terribly hampered explorers the heads of these pioneer establishments are to be men of scientific training and proved executive ability and each will be aided by a physiciannaturalist and a few skilled artisans the points thus far chosen are on a line regularly traveled by the caravans of arab traders carrying coffee tea sugar arms and woven goods to permanent arab residences and trading stations in the interior an agent of the london missionary society has already begun the survey of a route for ox teams as far as lake tanganyika and cameron has expressed the opinion that a light narrowgauge railway could be constructed from the coast to the lake at a cost not exceeding four thousand dollars a mile the traffic along such a road he thinks would soon pay interest on the outlay the unexplored region thus to be opened up to civilization and commerce other than in human beings is larger than the united states east of the mississippi around it is a still larger region of partially explored country of unequalled fertility abounding in great lakes and navigable rivers and for the most part so high above the sea that the products of the tropics mingle with those of the temperate zone the cereals durah maize rice sugar cane starchyielding roots and tubers cotton coffee tobacco spices gums and caoutchouc dyestuffs and medicinal plants the banana fig date orange and the vine are among the known products of this region and all are capable of becoming important staples of foreign commerce the country is not less rich in coal iron copper gold and other valuable minerals the climate though moist from abundant rain is less debilitating than india or brazil and everywhere away from the miasmatic coast regions and the marshes of the lower river courses european explorers have found small cause for complaining of excessive heat or unhealthiness on the elevated plateaus which cover so large a part of central africa the climate is like that of the sanitariums of india while among the mountains the finest climates of the world are fairly rivalled stanley found in the mountainous region between the great lakes and within a degree of the equator every climatic condition and every element of landscape beauty that could attract and delight a white colony it was a perfect alpine country with mountains rising from twelve to fifteen thousand feet yet free from alpine cold and snow countless torrents from the hills watered eververdant valleys as beautiful as those of tyrol lying under a brilliant equatorial sun yet with a climate as cool and equable as any european might desire further south among the mountains about lake nyassa the same features are presented on a grander scale a country aptly described as a second switzerland of gigantic proportions there can be no question of the ability of europeans to sustain themselves in the greater part of the interiorcertainly on all the higher plateausnor of the possibility of building up in central africa a great civilized empire nature offers every facility and the native population seem to be well fitted for productive industry in every respect they are physically and morally superior to the negroes of the coast and only need protection and the encouragement of legitimate commerce to weld them into a great nation already they stand on the borders of civilization they are intelligent industrious and not unskillful in the manufacture of iron and copper ornaments utensils and weapons the arts of tanning spinning weaving dyeing matmaking etc are widely diffused among them and many of their products are remarkable for their fineness and strength they carry on agriculture with considerable success and notwithstanding the chronic state of insecurity incident to slavehunting their wealth in cattle is very great as soon as the disturbing and impoverishing influence of the slave traffic is abated and a market provided for the products of peace the advancement of the people in civilization is likely to go on with great rapidity as the source of raw materials which we need and as a market for the surplus manufactures of europe and america the country offers to say the least many attractions and it will not be surprising if within fifty years thriving commercial stations will be founded on all its great lakes and rivers and connected with the outer world by telegraphy railways and steamship lines address of clarence king on catastrophism mr clarence king lately delivered an interesting address before the sheffield scientific school of yale college new haven conn under the title of catastrophism or the evolution of environment which promises to evoke considerable discussion we subjoin an abstract of the principal features of the address which is quite lengthy the full text will be found in our supplements nos 80 81 mr king refuted the doctrine of slow evolution as taught by huxley and darwin and declared that the surface of the earth and climate had been subject to sudden and catastrophic mutation which included in its environment all types of life he reasoned that marine fossils are found entombed in rocky beds far remote from present seas and that these beds were once sea bottoms that have been upheaved by convulsions of nature the earliest history of mankind is pregnant with catastrophe and we have historic story and biblical record of its sudden and destructive energy he called to mind the vast and massive eruptions of the pliocene basalt as seen upon our own continent the great obvious changes in the rocky crust were referred to a few processes the subaerial decay of continents delivery by streams of landdetritus into the sea the spreading out of these comminuted materials upon a pelagic floor and lastly upheaval by which oceanic beds were lifted up into subsequent land masses all these processes he declared to have been more rapid in the past than now suddenness worldwide destructiveness were the characteristics of geological changes periods of calm like the present are suddenly terminated by brief catastrophic epochs successive faunas and floras were created only to be extinguished by general cataclysms he believed in recurrent abrupt accelerations of crust change so violent as to destroy all life on the globe he declared the idea to be the survival of a prehistoric terror and was backed up by breaks in the great palontological record of the geologic features of our continent he said that beneath our america lies buried another distinct continent which he called archan america which was made up of what was originally ocean beds lifted into the air and locally crumpled into vast mountain chains which were in turn eroded by torrents into mountain peaks the original coast lines of this continent we may never be able fully to survey but its great features the lofty chains of the mountains which made its bones were very nearly coextensive with our existing systems the appalachians and cordilleras the caoncutting rivers of the present western mountains have dug out the peaks and flanks of those underlying primeval uplifts and developed an astonishing topography peaks rising in a single sweep 30000 feet from their bases precipices lifting bold solid fronts 10000 feet into the air and profound mountain valleys the work of erosion which has been carried on by torrents of the quaternary age brings to light buried primeval chains loftier than any of the present heights of the globe at the close of the palzoic age two enormous masses of what probably were then continents began to sink and as they disappeared the present atlantic and pacific oceans appeared while the seafloor of a then ocean emerged and became the new continent of america dividing this new continent was a sea but catastrophe removed this sea and resulted in the folding up of mountain ranges 20000 and 40000 feet in height thereby essentially changing the whole climate of the continent of the land life of the mesozoic age we have abundant remains the wonderful reptilian and avian fauna of the mesozoic age is now familiar to all but after the catastrophe and the change of climate which must necessarily have ensued this fauna totally perished after criticising the opinions of huxley lyell hutton darwin and others he recurred to the effects of sudden terrestrial or cosmical changes and conceived that the effects of these changes would be first extermination secondly destruction of the biological equilibrium and thirdly rapid morphological change on the part of plastic species when catastrophic change burst in upon the ages of uniformity and sounded in the ear of every living thing the words change or die plasticity became the sole principle of salvation and plasticity is the key to survival and prosperity mr king remarked in conclusion of his address he who brought to bear that mysterious energy we call life upon primeval matter bestowed at the same time a power of development by change arranging that the interaction of energy and matter which make up environment should from time to time burst in upon the current of life and sweep it onward and upward to ever higher and better manifestations moments of great catastrophe thus translated into the language of life become moments of creation when out of plastic organisms something newer and nobler is called into being duplex education the age in which we live is a fast one and he who does not move with equal celerity and keep pace with those around him is ruthlessly thrust to the wall and remains there unless he has strength and will to regain the lost position we call to our aid every force of nature and invoke the assistance of every appliance with which we are cognizant we call our fathers slow and to us they were so but there was the same need of celerity in their everyday life as today there is in ours while calling to our aid the elements of nature and adapting thousands of mechanical appliances to our wants do we not often feel that there is beyond all these a something that may be invoked and trained to help us on in the race of life occasionally we find dim glimmerings of this something that we believe will eventually grow to be one of the prominent sciences physiologists tell us that the human brain is double that the right and left lobes act in a degree independent of each otherthe right lobe of the brain controlling the physiology of the left side of the individual from head to heel while the left lobe exercises a like dominion on the opposite side grant this to be true then can be explained the idiosyncrasy that is occasionally seen in individuals of which we may instance that of writing at the same time with both hands and again we have heard of telegraph operators sending and receiving two messages at the same time operating with both hands and independent of each other it is said that nasmyth the inventor of the steam hammer could actually produce two sketches or drawings in this way and at the same time it is also affirmed that sir charles fox the architect of the exhibition building of 1851 could write upon two ideas at the same time and transfer these ideas simultaneously to paper with right and left hand the mechanic can often be found who can operate upon one piece of mechanism while at the same time his brain is busy upon the study of some unborn idea foreign to that work upon which he is laboring writers can be found who can write out one train of ideas while ideas entirely different are being cogitated upon somewhere in their craniums we have even heard it affirmed that an indistinct glimmering of a third idea would occasionally peep around the corner of the caputs of these favored ones why not educate this why not form schools and institutions to bring it out and lead the brain to perform this double function it can certainly be done the world wants it surely the age demands it individuals need it if these individuals can succeed and become experts in this method of double work will not double compensation and a greater remuneration be their reward this certainly will be an incentive to its acquirement go to the apprentice when first he takes position beside the vise with chipping chisel in one hand and hammer in the other the injunction he mentally receives as he raises the hammer is that to miss the chisel is to hit his knuckles after a few demonstrative blows he knows what it means and therefore chisel and hammer soon come by some strange process to harmonize in action so that in whatever position the head of the chisel may be the blow is sure to be properly received and that too without any sensible effort on his part in this illustration both right and left hand are taught to act by brain dictation in a certain concerted manner again we find that mutes have been learned to articulate words and sentences by proper education they being taught to imitate the motions of the mouth and labial organs as by their tutors directed education can do much and these are some of its results can we not by proper teaching produce all the results as shown in the case of nasmyth and fox the first lessons must necessarily be simple for instance two things done at the same time with both hands giving expression at this time to ideas connected therewith but distinct from each other from this simple lesson we progress and as the ultimatum we may arrive at greater achievements than nasmyth or fox ever dreamed of we may find that we can so divide our entity that we can be conscious of a doublebrain existence in a dual action the carrigeen crop to the great majority of people carrigeen under the more familiar name of irish moss is known chiefly as the basis of a pleasant and wholesome drink for the sick room or as an article of use in the preparation of delicacies for the table comparatively few are aware of its wide and varied use in the arts or that the thousands of barrels of it employed annually by our manufacturers of paper cloth felt and straw hats etc and by brewers is not an irish but an american product and speaking strictly is not a moss but a seaweed carrigeen chondrus crispus is to be found more or less abundantly all along our northern coast ranging between the low water line and the depth of forty feet or so but as a rule its fronds which correspond to the leaves of air plants are so numerously inhabited by small mollusca that they are spoiled for other use the cleangrowing article seems to be limited almost wholly to certain ledges in the neighborhood of scituate massa section of coast guarded by the celebrated minot ledge lighthouse and famous for its danger to shipping here where the waves of the atlantic dash with full force upon the rocky coast the carrigeen grows to perfection and wherever it escapes the spawn of mussels and other shellfish is gathered during the summer season in vast quantities the harvest begins in may and ends about the first of september the gathering is made in two waysby handpicking during exceptionally low tides and by means of longhandled irontoothed rakes at ordinary tides of course the work cannot be carried on except during fair weather handpulling is possible only during the bimonthly periods of spring tides that is when the moon is full and again at new moon at such times high tide occurs about midday and midnight and the ledges are exposed for moss gathering morning and evening the mossers boats are rowed to the rocks where the finest grades abound and the gatherers select with great care the growths that are freest from minute shells and other foreign matter this portion of the crop if properly handled afterwards generally goes to the apothecary and fetches a price two or three times that of the common grade as the tide rises the pickers are driven to their boats and proceed to the outer mossbearing rocks where the rake is used as it also is during ordinary low tides moss taken in this way is not so clean as the handpicked and is always mixed with tape grass which must be removed during the process of curing and packing the curing of the moss is the most critical part of this peculiar farming on being brought to the shore the moss is black and unsightly it must be bleached as well as dried the bleaching is effected by repeated wetting and drying in the sun and as the moss is readily soluble in fresh water the bleaching beds are situated near the banks of the salt creeks that abound along the shore after drying the moss is packed in tubs and rolled to the water where it is thoroughly washed then rolled back to the bleaching bed to be dried again in the sun five or six such exposures are usually sufficient on the bleaching ground the moss is carefully spread and turned and watchfully guarded against wetting by rain in this process it turns from black to red then to the yellowishwhite of the perfected article when properly cured the moss is stored in bulk in shanties where as time permits it is picked over and packed in barrels the crop averages about half a million pounds a year and thanks to the brighter and more abundant sunshine of our coast the moss has a brighter color and is of finer quality than the irish product catastrophism in geology mr clarence king was probably not a little surprised to learn from the tribune that in his most suggestive address on catastrophism and the evolution of environment he had turned the guns of geology upon biology and that in calling attention to the influence of periods of accelerated change in environment upon exposed types of life he had swept away the fundamental doctrines upon which has been built the scheme of development by natural selection and the survival of the fittest certainly nothing in the address betrays any consciousness of possible effects of that sort and it is quite probable also that mr king will have to suffer some annoyance from seeing his name set up at gaze like joshuas moon in ajalon by the unscientific press generally as that of the newest champion of orthodoxy against the leaders of modern scientific thought a penalty which scientific men always have to pay for emphasizing neglected truths mr king certainly deals some telling blows against the position of the stricter school of uniformitarians in geology and brings into prominence a much neglected element in the struggle for existence but there is no scientific revolution threatened nor are any crumbs of comfort spread for those endeavoring to arrest the natural drift of scientific progress the issue between mr king and the sticklers for uniformity in rates of geological change is simply this in the reaction against the sweeping cataclysms the sudden wipings out of whole creations and the sudden introductions of new worlds of life believed in by earlier geologists the modern english school has come to look upon time and the slower modifications of the earths surface now observable with the struggle for existence under easy conditions as the chief factors in geological change and its accompanying variations in the forms of life mr king on the other hand insists that in so doing they have taken too little account of catastrophic changes that is widespread and sudden movements of sea and land in other words he raises rapid change of environment from the subordinate place it has hitherto occupied in the scheme of historical development and gives special emphasis to the grand geologic movements which have to do with such changes in this mr king has unquestionably rendered good service to the science he has done so much to extend and honor in the field while the illustrations from american geology which he brings to bear on the subject are as likely as his sturdy opinions to attract attention yet we are inclined to think that in some things he has allowed his enthusiasm to run away with him the stolid selfconfidence of extreme uniformitarians has tempted him to exaggerate the periodic accelerations of geologic and biologic movement and to overstate their effects quite as much as others have underestimated them and when he charges the followers of lyell with intellectual nearsightedness and a lack of the very mechanism of imagination they may possibly be able to retort not unjustifiably that he has mistaken the natural foreshortening of the geological vista due to distance for actual brevity and that his belief in the abruptness and suddenness of the great changes which the earths strata record may be due to his own lack of sustained imaginative power for grasping and interpreting all the evidences of the enormous time really involved but this is a question not of imaginative capacity but of logical deduction from observed facts and however abrupt the beginning of some of the great geologic movements may have been their subsequent progress cannot in all cases have been so rapid as to allow of their being called catastrophic in any ordinary acceptation of the term take for example the alleged catastrophe which marked the close of the mesozoic age in the west of this movement mr king remarks in a quasiuniformitarian way 20000 or 30000 feet of sediment had accumulated in the pacific and 14000 in the american mediterranean sea when these regions which during the reception of sediment had been areas of subsidence suddenly upheaved the doming up of the middle of the continent quite obliterating the mediterranean sea and uniting the two land masses into one the catastrophe which removed this sea resulted in the folding up of mountain ranges 20000 and 40000 feet in height thereby essentially changing the whole climate of the continent that this great change occurred and was attended with an obliteration of the wonderful reptilian and avian fauna of the mesozoic age is most true that it occurred suddenly does not appear on the contrary there is evidence to show that the prodigious folding up of mountain ranges involved could not have proceeded with sufficient rapidity to turn the course of a stream of water it happened that one of those foldsone which had no denudation been going on meanwhile would have lifted its crest higher than the highest peak of the himalayaslay directly across the course of the colorado river the river held its course uninterruptedly sawing its way through the uplift until six vertical miles of rocky strata had risen past it at no time therefore could the rapidity of motion in the bulging strata have exceeded the capacity of the river to wear away the obstruction and the bulge was fifty miles across we do not know how rapidly a river may sink its channel through such a rising barrier but we do know that a process of that nature cannot legitimately be described as swift or sudden and surely it requires not less intellectual farsightedness and imaginative faculty to carry the mind across the enormous stretch of time involved in such a change slowly wroughta period during which at least three vertical miles of the rising mountain fold was worn down by rain and atmospheric abrasionas to mass the continental doming the mountain folding and the attendant life changes together as a convulsive catastrophe mr king however is not a catastrophist of a very violent sort he shelves among the errors of the past the belief in such cataclysms as cuvier believed in involving worldwide destruction of all lifethe mere survival of a prehistoric terror backed up by breaks in the palontological record and protected within those safe cities of refuge the cosmogonies though he rejects as equally unsatisfactory the mild affirmations of the uniformitarians that existing rates of change and indefinite time are enough to account for all the geological record with our present light he holds geological history seems to be a dovetailing together of the two ideas the ages have had their periods of geological serenity when change progressed in the still unnoticeable way and life through vast lapses of time followed the stately flow of years drifting on by insensible gradations through higher and higher forms and then all at once a part of the earth suffered short sharp destructive revolution unheralded as an earthquake or volcanic eruptions thus stated his position does not seem to be radically different from that of the broader uniformitarians except that he marks the periods of accelerated physical change and not those of comparative quiescence as the dominant ones in their influence on lifechange he takes high and strong ground too in insisting that it is the business of geology not simply to decipher and map out the changes which have taken place in the configuration of the globe and in its climatic conditions but also to investigate and fix the rates of change and when the evolution of environment takes form as a distinct branch of geology he expects to witness a marked modification in the dominant views of biologists its few broad laws will include neither the absolute uniformitarianism of lyell and hutton darwin and haeckel nor the universal catastrophism of cuvier and the majority of teleogists huxley alone among prominent evolutionists opens the door for a union of the residue of truth in the two schools fusing them in his proposed evolutional geology so on looking back over a trail of thirty thousand miles of geological travel mr king is impelled to say that mr huxleys farsighted view perfectly satisfies his interpretation of the broad facts of the american continent of mr kings observations in regard to plasticity of physical structure in connection with rapidly changing environment and the struggle for existence we propose to speak at

miliaria a fact which has previously been noticed utilization of tin scrap messrs charles a catlin and george f wilson of providence r i have patented may 8 1877 a new process of utilizing tin scrap whereby they claim the tin is recovered either as a valuable salt of that metal or in the metallic form and the iron or other metal is left as a scrap at once available for reworking illustration callin and wilsons process of utilizing tin scrap in any suitable building a crane a is erected and placed in the sweep of that crane in any convenient order are a boiler d two tanks b and c an evaporating pan f and an additional tank e from the crane is suspended a wire basket to contain the scrap to be treated so perforated as to admit of the ready entrance of the liquid when submerged in and its ready escape when withdrawn from the boiler d in which boiler is put a sufficient quantity of the solution of caustic soda or potash to allow of a complete submersion therein of the basket and its contents the basket g is then filled with the material to be treated sprinkling in during the filling the requisite quantity of common salt or other chloride and nitrate of soda or other nitrate using these dry not in solution either previously mixed or shaken in together in the proportion of from three to five pounds each to every hundred pounds of scrap the requisite quantity depending upon the thickness of the thin tin plate to be removed the loaded basket being elevated by the crane a is then swung round and by lowering submerged in the hot or boiling solution of caustic soda or potash in the iron boiler d which may hold in solution a further proportion of the chloride and nitrate used the heat of which solution is maintained by a fire beneath the boiler or in any other and ordinary way in the ensuing reaction the oxygen of the nitrate combines with the tin to form stannic acid and this in turn combining with the alkali present forms a stannate of that base which entering into solution leaves the beforeplated metal tinfree the chloride present assisting in the reaction a further and more complex reaction takes place by which copious fumes of ammonia are evolved which may be utilized by proper appliances when the reaction is complete the basket containing the now tinfreed scrap is withdrawn from the boiler and suspended above it long enough to drain it is then swung over the tank c containing water in which it is washed by submerging and withdrawing several times and in like manner the washing completed in the water of the tank b the contents of the basket being now discharged it is again filled with fresh scrap in the manner already described and the process repeated the loss by evaporation from the boiler d is supplied by the wash water in the tank c this in turn being supplied by the wash water in the tank b to which fresh water is supplied as required when the caustic solution is sufficiently charged with the tin salt it is allowed to deposit the impure crystals which being removed and drained are redissolved in water in the iron tank e this solution in the iron tank e after filtration or decantation is again concentrated in the evaporating pan f the crystals of stannate being removed from time to time drained and dried or the impure crystals obtained in the boiler d may be mixed with fine charcoal or other reducing agent and subjected to the requisite heat for the reduction of the tin to the metallic form new alloy a very beautiful new alloy intended to replace brass in various ornamental uses especially in window and door furniture has been invented by w a hopkins of paris the alloy is composed of copper tin spelter or zinc and lead which metals are manipulated a crucible is placed in the furnace and fired to red heat and into the crucible thus heated the metals are placed in the proportions oftin 118 say 1 oz spelter or zinc oz lead 516 of an ounce these are the proportions he prefers to use as he has found them to give excellent and satisfactory results but he does not intend to confine himself rigidly to the precise proportions named as they may perhaps be slightly varied in some particulars without materially detracting from the beautiful color of the alloy which it is intended to produce the molten metals are kept well stirred and any impurities therein should be removed when thoroughly mixed this alloy which is termed the first alloy is poured off into ingot moulds and left to cool copper in the proportion of eight parts to one of this first alloy is then placed in the crucible and brought to melting heat when the tin or first alloy is added and intimately mixed with the copper for which purpose the molten mass must be well stirred for several minutes it is then poured into ingot moulds for sale in the form of ingots or it may be poured into pattern moulds so as to produce the articles required this is the mode of manipulation which it is preferred to employ as an opportunity is thus afforded of removing any impurities from the first alloy before mixing it with the copper but all the metals may if preferred be mixed together in the proportions given and melted at one operation by this means an alloy is obtained of great strength and of a very beautiful appearance and which is particularly suitable for small work such for instance as window and door furniture and other house furniture which is usually made in brass or other alloy of copper though it is not intended to confine its use to such articles sebastinan improved explosive in the manufacture of the explosive known as dynamite an infusorial earth is used which is filled with or made to absorb nitroglycerin as compared with certain kinds of charcoal however the absorptive and retentive power of infusorial earth in small changes of temperature unfavorably affect the common dynamite and cause a separation of the nitrogylcerin from the infusorial earth the improvement we now refer to is the invention of g fahnehjelm of stockholm sweden and consists in the substitution of a highly porous and absorptive species of wood charcoal in place of the earth heretofore employed the author designates his production as sebastin and gives a number of interesting particulars as follow in order to produce a charcoal having the required quantities the carbonization or coking must be done in such a manner as to completely destroy the organic substances and to produce as porous a charcoal as possible for this he selects by preference young trees or striplings or branches of poplar hazelwood or alder tree and he burns them in an open fire when the wood has been consumed he does not put out the fire by means of water but leaves it to go out of itself in this way he obtains a very inflammable and very porous charcoal which can absorb more than five and approaching six times its weight of nitroglycerin without any risk of the separation of the oil the charcoal is pulverized in a wooden mortar but it should not be reduced to too fine a powder else it will not so completely absorb the nitroglycerin the charcoal produced in the ordinary way or by closed fire is quite different as regards absorbing power charcoal of fir trees may however be used and may acquire nearly the same qualities that is if charred a second time in a special oven by mixing the different kinds of charcoal a material may be obtained possessing the required absorbing qualities and an explosive compound may then be obtained of the required power without loss of the necessary consistencythat is without being too dry which is not desirable the charcoal not only serves as the best absorbent for the nitroglycerin but it plays also an important part in the combustion the nitroglycerin in exploding decomposes into steam carbonic acid nitrogen and oxygen in the explosion of dynamite with inert base the oxygen goes away without being utilized but in the explosion of this new compound the new sebastin as he calls it a part of the absorbent charcoal is burnt by means of the liberated oxygen the quantity of gas is thus augmented and also the development of heat whereby again the tension of this gas is augmented as however the quantity of charcoal necessary for the complete absorption of the nitroglycerin is in all cases much larger than that which can reduce the excess of oxygen produced at the explosion into carbonic acid he adds to the compound a salt which also by the combustion gives an excess amount of oxygen which may contribute to burn the rest of the charcoal for this purpose he uses by preference nitrate of potassa which may be added without any risk and which gives the explosive compound a very much greater rapidity or vehemence and consequent force of explosion the composition of the new sebastin depends upon the objects for which it is to be used and the effects intended to be produced the strongest compound and even in this there is stated to be no risk of the separation of the nitroglycerin is composed of 78 parts by weight of nitroglycerin 14 of the wood charcoal and 8 of nitrate of potassa and when less power is required the proportions are varied the second quality consisting of 68 per cent by weight of nitroglycerin 20 of the charcoal and 12 of nitrate of potassa to show the relative strength of the compounds the inventor says let the dynamic force of pure nitroglycerin be represented by the number 28840436 then the dynamic force of the sebastin no 1 as above will be indicated by 2416575 and of the sebastin no 2 by 19330794 while that of dynamite no 1 consisting of 75 per cent of nitroglycerin and 25 per cent of infusorial earth will be represented by 674694 for the above qualities of sebastin the increased effect produced by the greater rapidity of the explosion must be taken into account also the increase has not yet been measured but is estimated at 10 per cent the sebastin may also be compounded in other proportions of the constituent parts but the object being to produce explosive compounds of the greatest force which it is possible to employ without danger he merely mentions that the proportion by weight may vary from 50 to 80 per cent of nitroglycerin 15 to 35 per cent of the prepared charcoal and 5 to 20 per cent of the nitrate of potassa the parts being taken by weight as above stated a new method of bookbinding the annexed engravings represent a new system of binding books for which a number of important advantages are claimed it obviates stitching allows of each leaf being firmly secured and hence is especially well suited for singleleaved books it admits of plates and maps being bound in their proper places instead of being pasted in and renders the book much stronger and more durable the inventor claims a saving of 40 to 75 per cent of the time required for stitching and of 50 per cent of the time needed in ordinary rebinding work illustration bookbinding fig 1 2 3 4 the mode of operation is as follows on receiving the sheets the binder folds them and places them in consecutive order according to the printers signature the front and bottom edges of the book are then trimmed so as to obtain two straight sides and the backs of the sheets are cut off transforming them into single leaves horizontal lines are now marked with pencil across the back of the book for the saw cuts and a diagonal line a b fig 2 is drawn to serve as a guide in replacing the leaves in their proper places a thin coat of glue is next applied to the back and when this is dry the book is divided into sections of from four to eight leaves without counting them entirely disregarding the printers signatures but placing the sheets in their original order the binder places the first section removed at his right hand the next at his left and so on forming two piles each pile is then straightened and in the back of each a little below the transverse lines are made bevel cuts with the saw said cuts are 18 inch in length inclined at an angle of 45 and so placed that one half their length is above and the other half below the marked line when one pile of sheets is thus sawn the other pile is similarly treated but the corresponding cuts are made at relatively opposite angles this will be understood from fig 1 in which c represents the edge of the right hand pile for example and d that of the left hand pile the sections of each pile are now returned in their regular order according to the printers signatures should a section have been misplaced the diagonal line being thus broken will show the fact it will be seen however that this arrangement involves the alternate use of sheets from each pile so that when all are put together the beveled cuts will cross or form dovetails as shown in fig 3 half inch strips of white paper muslin e fig 4 are next pasted around the back edges of the first and last sections this is done to strengthen the hold of the twines in the back of the book said sections necessarily bearing the whole strain of the covers the twine used corresponds in size to the holes made by the coincidence of the beveled saw cuts this twine is passed through the holes by means of a blunt darning needle the back of the book is shown in fig 2 and in fig 4 the twines are represented as passed nothing further remains to be done but to paste in the flyleaves and lining and finish the book in the usual manner it is evident that this a very much stronger method of securing the leaves than that in which the twine is simply laid and glued in a straight cut each leaf is independently fastened and the thread is prevented from cutting through as is commonly the case when the book has been used to any great extent books can be bound to open more or less as desired and in rebinding instead of taking the book apart and cutting threads a thin shaving is sliced off the back and the leaves are treated in the manner already described patented march 20 1877 by mr florenz

every operation in the complex process of evolving finished boots from the plain skins of leather is the object of a special class of machinery and for several years past we have weekly chronicled the patenting of several improvements in the devices for effecting some of the numerous operations we present herewith a series of eight laborsaving machines of the most approved construction which we select from knights american mechanical dictionary1 footnote 1 published in numbers by messrs hurd houghton new york city fig 1 is a shoeedge trimmer in which the shoe is mounted on a jack the carriage of which has a motion of translation and rotation communicated to it so that while the side of the sole is being trimmed the shoe is fed longitudinally against the knife but at the toe and heel is rotated beneath it the knife is universally jointed to permit the hands of the operator to determine the different bevels cut illustration boot and shoe machinery fig 2 fig 2 is an ingenious little machine for placing the eyelets of the lace holes in position and fastening them the eyelets are fed one by one from the reservoir at the top down the inclined ways and are seized at the foot between the plunger and anvil and they are riveted in their proper places in the shoe or strip of leather which is held and fed by the operator illustration boot and shoe machinery fig 3 fig 3 is a machine in which a shoe or boot is chucked and revolved against a burnishing tool to impart a smooth and elegant finish to the heel our engraving shows a machine with what is called in the trade a hot kit a heated burnishing tool with a flexible gas pipe of sufficient length which follows the oscillations of the burnishing stock a and which conveys gas to the interior of the tool where it is burnt in a jet the tool is made to reciprocate over the surface of the heel passing from breast to breast at each oscillation with an elastic pressure illustration boot and shoe machinery fig 4 fig 4 is a machine for pressing together the lifts which compose a boot or shoe heel thus dispensing with the handiwork of the hammer and lapstone the bed is adjusted vertically by a screw to any thickness to which the blank heel may be built and the plunger is brought down by the depression of the treadle with such force as to compact the lifts together fig 5 shows a heelpricking machine when the lifts of the heel are fairly pressed together by the appliance shown in fig 4 the pricking machine pierces the necessary holes through all the lifts at once by a gang of awls the compressed heels are first secured together by tacking and then placed on the platen and the plunger with its gang of awls descends with great force fig 6 is a heel trimmer known in the trade as the cot trimmer the shoe is held stationary by the treadle clamp and the knife stock which is centrally pivoted to the outer plate or jaw bearing upon the tread lift is then grasped in the hands of the operator and moved to give a sweeping cut to trim the heel fig 7 is a machine for pressing boot soles beneath the crosshead of the press is a swinging bed on each end of which is a form in order that a shoe may remain under pressure upon one while the operator is placing another shoe on the other the pressure is given by the treadle which brings down the upper platen on the channeled sole illustration boot and shoe

this subject attention was directed to the state of the tongue in dyspepsia a deeply fissured tongue often meant little whereas a thin white fur composed of minute dots was generally found along with pain immediately after food pain after a longer interval was accompanied by a pale flabby tongue with reddish tip and center the treatment of dyspepsia consisted of two parts that of food and that of drugs the latter was the principal part with patients applying for gratuitous relief the pain occurring immediately after food was usually relieved by alkalies whereas acids were indicated where suffering was not experienced until an hour or two after the commencement of the digestive act for the relief of the nausea and sickness remaining after the bowels were thoroughly cleansed nothing was so effectual as hourly drop doses of ipecacuanha wine nux vomica was also a valuable remedy pain might be but the protest of the stomach against an overload or be the result of deficient tone from general nervous exhaustion in some cases each meal was followed by diarrhoea and for these cases attention was directed to ringers plan of minute doses of the liquor hydrargyri perchloridi in speaking of diet dr farquharson pointed out that there are three forms of dyspepsia 1 the dyspepsia of fluids as it is called where the stomach seems intolerant of all forms of fluid 2 the digestive derangement following intemperance in the matter of animal food and 3 the dyspepsia connected with indulgence in tea or other warm and weak infusions of tannin the destructive effects of lightning the amount of destruction of life and property by lightning or rather electrical discharges has been very great throughout the world it is estimated that at least 45 persons are killed annually by lightning in this country the average number of deaths by lightning has been 22 in england 9 in switzerland 3 in belgium and 75 in france in france alone during a period of thirty years over 10000 persons were smitten of which 2252 were instantly killed eighty were wounded and 9 killed during one thunderstorm at chteauneuf les montiers in 1861 and within one week when the air was highly charged with electricity thirtythree fearful flashes of lightning were observed each bringing death to some victims during the sixteen years between 1799 and 1816 156 vessels of the british navy were struck by lightning 73 men were killed and 138 injured and the loss of materials amounted to over a million dollars but since the system of metallic conductors adapted for vessels devised by sir w snow harris has been applied to the vessels in that navy the losses and damages by lightning have almost entirely ceased although the number of vessels has been greatly increased in fullers church history it is stated that scarcely a great abbey in england exists which once at least was not burned down by lightning from heaven on the night of april 1718 twentyfour steeples were struck along the coast of brittany and on the 11th of january 1815 twelve steeples suffered a similar fate in the rhenish provinces on the 27th of july 1759 lightning burnt all the woodwork of the great cathedral at strasbourg and on the 14th of august 1833 it was struck three times within a quarter of an hour and so much damaged that the repairs cost about 6000000 in 1835 lightning conductors were placed upon the building and steeple and since then it has not been damaged whatever by lightning although discharges have on several occasions occurred in line with the top of the steeple which is 437 feet above the ground on the 18th of august 1769 the tower of st nazaire at brescia was struck and the subterranean powder magazine containing 2076000 lbs of powder belonging to the republic of venice was exploded one sixth of the whole town was laid in ruins and the rest very much injured and about 3000 persons killed on the 26th of june 1807 the powder magazine of luxembourg containing 28000 lbs was struck and besides about 30 persons killed and 200 injured the town was ruined explosions and large fires involving a great loss have become rather frequent in this country owing to the iron tanks used for the storage of petroleum being struck by lightning from march to august in 1876 over 10000000 gallons and on april 19 1877 over 2000000 gallons of oil and the village of troutman were destroyed in the oil regions of pennsylvania some of the thunderstorms which have prevailed in this country have been very terrific and destructive during august 14th 15th and 16th 1872 portions of new york state and the new england states were visited by some of the most terrific thunderstorms ever experienced during which over 200 dwellings were struck and damaged about 10 persons were instantly killed and 160 stunned quite a number of barns with their contents hay and cattle were also struck fired and consumed cars while running on some of the railroads were surrounded by a vivid electric light but no passengers were injured although they were greatly alarmed telegraph wires were melted by the half mile telegraph instruments broken and poles shattered in all directions one of these storms occurred at midnight at arlington mass august 14th in which brilliant streams of electricity darted across the sky in every direction and the thunder which followed was constant for a period of thirteen minutes without the intermission of an instant of silence three hundred and thirtyone discharges were counted in seven minutes by an observer and each discharge was followed by loud and sometimes rattling reports whose reverberations rolled through the heavens in an endless procession of majestic and terrific sounds during this scene the moon which was about half an hour above the western horizon was visible but so magnified through the haze and vapor as to appear like a brilliant flame suspended in the sky for a period of twenty minutes the scene was one of grandeur and sublimity rarely witnessed in the states of illinois and iowa and the prairie country west of the mississippi river thunderstorms are generally more terrific and more lives have been lost there from the effects of lightning than in any other section of this country owing to the said country being level and devoid of trees the equilibrium between the electricity of the atmosphere and that of the earth is principally restored by disruptive dischargesspangs treatise on lightning protection a tooth of a mastodon has been dug up near the ashley river in south carolina it is 11 inches long 6

monday june 11 has forwarded an official report to the admiralty through the commanderinchief admiral sir george elliot kcb respecting a sea monster which she encountered during her homeward voyage at about 5 oclock in the afternoon of june 2 the sea being exceptionally calm while the yacht was proceeding round the north coast of sicily toward cape vito the officer on the watch observed a long ridge of fins each about 6 feet long moving slowly along he called for a telescope and was at once joined by other officers the osborne was steaming westward at ten and a half knots an hour and having a long passage before her could not stay to make minute observations the fins were progressing in a eastwardly direction and as the vessel more nearly approached them they were replaced by the foremost part of a gigantic monster its skin was so far as it could be seen altogether devoid of scales appearing rather to resemble in sleekness that of a seal the head was bulletshaped with an elongated termination being somewhat similar in form to that of a seal and was about six feet in diameter its features were only seen by one officer who described them as like those of an alligator the neck was comparatively narrow but so much of the body as could be seen developed in form like that of a gigantic turtle and from each side extended two fins about fifteen feet in length by which the monster paddled itself along after the fashion of a turtle the appearance of the monster is accounted for by a submarine volcano which occurred north of galita in the gulf of tunis about the middle of may and was reported at the time by a steamer which was struck by a detached fragment of submarine rock the disturbance below water it is thought probable may have driven up the monster from its native element as the site of the eruption is only one hundred miles from where it was reported to have been seenportsmouth eng times sunstroke the sudden accession of heat has already produced one fatal and more than one severe case of sunstroke in the metropolis probably the affection so designated is not the malady to which the term coup de soleil can be properly applied the condition brought about is an exaggerated form of the disturbance occasioned by entering too suddenly the hot room of a turkish bath the skin does not immediately perform its function as an evaporating and therefore cooling surface and an acute febrile state of the organism is established with a disturbed balance of circulation and more or less cerebral irritation as a prominent feature of the complaint death may suddenly occur at the outset of the complaint as it has happened in a turkish bath where the subject labors under some predisposition to apoplexy or has a weak or diseased heart it should suffice to point out the danger and to explain by way of warning that although the degrees of heat registered by the thermometer or the power of the suns rays do not seem to suggest especial caution all sudden changes from a low to a high temperature are attended with danger to weak organisms the avoidance of undue exercisefor example persistent trotting or cantering up and down the rowis an obvious precaution on days marked by a relatively if not absolutely high temperature we direct attention to this matter because it is obvious the peculiar peril of overheating the body by exertion on the first burst of fine weather is not generally realized it is forgotten that the increased temperature must be measured by the elevation which has recently taken place not the number of degrees of heat at present recorded the registered temperature may be more or less than that which occurred a year ago but its immediate effects on the organism will be determined by the conditions which have preceded it and the violence of the changelancet dead horses standing erect the danville advertiser of the 7th inst says mr smith was in town on saturday with his hired man and the two tell a singular story about a lightning stroke mr smith was on a grain drill in a field and his hired man was about 12 rods from him dragging suddenly smith heard the noise of thunder and became unconscious the man also heard the noise but neither of them saw any flash of lightning the man went to smith and in about twenty minutes he was restored to consciousness then attention was given to the horses one of them was standing erect with one foot lifted a little way from the earth and the other was kneeling with his nose in the earth and both were stone dead and retained their positions until they were pushed over the supposition is that in this case the electricity went from the earth to the sky the berlin correspondent of the london times states that general berdan of the united states has invented an instrument which will greatly improve the art of killing he calls his invention a rangefinder it consists of a telescope and other instruments all of which can be carried on a dogcart and which enable the engineers to measure with perfect accuracy up to 2000 metres or 1500 yards the time needed to ascertain distances is only two minutes and the general believes that his invention will double the accuracy of artillery fire and quadruple that of infantry setting locomotive slide valves by joshua rose e g asks how can i set the slide valves of a locomotive when she is on the road j h s asks what is the method of setting locomotive slide valves from marks on the slide spindle and f o asks how are the valves of inside cylinder locomotives set since the back ports are out of sight and you cannot measure the lead our correspondent will find these questions answered in full below it is presumed that the lengths of the eccentric rod reverse rod and other parts are correct and they are properly connected and oiled so as to be in working order the first thing to do is to place the reverse lever in the forward fullgear notch of the quadrants or sectors as they are sometimes called the next procedure is to place the crank on its forward dead center as near as can be ascertained by the eye and loosening the set screw of the forward eccentric that is to say the eccentric which connects with the upper end of the link move that eccentric round on the shaft until the valve leaves the port at the front end of the cylinder open to the amount of whatever lead it is desired to give the valve in moving the eccentric round on the shaft it is necessary to move it in the direction in which it will turn when in operation this is done in order to take up any lost motion there may be in the eccentric straps in the eccentric rod eyebolts or other working parts or joints between the eccentric and the slide valve rod or spindle if the eccentric was turned backward instead of forward all the lost motion would operate to vitiate the set of the valve because when the eccentric begins to move its motion will have no effect in moving the slide valve spindle until all the lost motion in the various parts is taken up by the eccentric movement in considering this part of the operation we must bear in mind that to set the valve we must move the wheels of the engine it being impracticable to move the piston itself now in moving the wheels we are confronted with the fact that the crank pin is pulling the connecting rod hence if there is any lost motion in the brasses at either end of the connecting rod the piston will not be at the end of its stroke when the crank is on its dead center suppose for instance that we have moved the driving wheel forward until the crank stands upright at a right angle to the bore of the cylinder the resistance to motion of the piston and crosshead has caused the crank pin to bed against the halfbrass nearest to the cylinder all the play or lost motion is then between the other halfbrass and the crank pin when however the engine is at work and the piston is driving the crank pin instead of being driven by it the lost motion will exist between the crank pin and the halfbrass nearest to the cylinder and the contact will exist between the crank pin and the other brass the difference in the position of the piston caused by this lost motion may be ascertained by moving the piston back and forth until the crank pin contacts with first one and then the other halfbrass it is sometimes attempted to remedy the defect due to this lost motion by moving the crank pin past the dead center and then moving it back to the dead center so that while on that center the play or lost motion in the connecting rod is taken up this is all very well so far as the connecting rod and piston is concerned and will cause them both to stand on their respective dead centers with the lost motion taken up but in moving the wheel back to the dead center we have given full liberty to all the lost motion in the various parts of the valve motion or gear as already explained in reference to moving the eccentric upon the shaft as there are so many more parts in the valve gear in which lost motion may occur it is manifestly preferable to take up that play by moving the driving wheel in a continuous direction rather than to move the latter back to accommodate any play there may be in the connecting rod the crank being placed by the eye upon its forward dead center and the eccentric connected to the top of the link being moved round on the axle in the direction in which the wheels will run when the engine is going forward until the steam port at the front end of the cylinder is open to the amount of the lead we fasten the eccentric to hold in that position we then throw the reverse lever over into the last notch at the other end of the sector lifting the link up so that the eccentric connected to the lower end of the link may be approximately adjusted which is done by moving the eccentric round upon the axle in the direction in which the axle will revolve when the engine is running backward until the crank stands upon the same dead center and the front port is open to the amount of the lead this being done we have the eccentrics approximately adjusted and may proceed to the final adjustment in which the first thing to do is to find the exact dead centers of the crank it is obvious that a line drawn through the center of the crank pin and the center of the wheel axle will stand horizontally true and level when the crank is on either of the dead centers but the presence of the crank pin makes it impracticable to draw such a line we can therefore draw one which will be parallel to those centers and to do this we draw a circle upon the end of the wheel axle and from its center of the same diameter as that of the crank pin and then resting a straightedge upon the bearing of the crank pin taking care to avoid the round corner upon the pin if there is one we place the other end of the straightedge even with the top of the circle drawn upon the axle and then using the straightedge as a guide we draw a line across the end of the axle and the wheel face when this line is level the crank will be upon its dead center this plan is sometimes employed but is not a very accurate one because the length of the line is very short as compared to the circumference of the driving wheel hence an error of the thickness of the line becomes one equal to several thicknesses of the line when carried out to the wheel circumference furthermore if the line of the cylinder does not stand horizontally level as is sometimes the case the result of the whole proceeding will be inaccurate again the connecting rod end and the coupling rod is in the way rendering it awkward to both draw and level the line a better and more accurate method to find the dead centers is as follows place the reverse lever into the end notch of the sector at the forward end and then move the driving wheel forward until the guide block is within about a quarter of an inch of the end of its travel then place a straightedge against the end of the guide block and draw on the outside face of the guide bar a line even with the end of the guide block bend a piece of wire pointed at both ends to a right angle make a center punch mark either in the rail under the driving wheel or in some stationary solid part contiguous to the wheel or at such distance from it that when one end of the bent wire is placed in the center punch mark the operator with the other end will be able to draw a line across the rim of the driving wheel here however arises another consideration that it is better to set the valves with the wheel axle in its proper position in the pedestal shoes and in order to do this the wheel should rest upon the rail with its proper proportion of the weight of the engine resting upon it the springs will then be deflected to their proper amount and the axle box will have passed its proper distance up the pedestals it is obvious that if the engine is blocked up so that the driving wheels clear the rails which is done in order to avoid having the weight of the engine to move while setting the valve the axle boxes will drop in the pedestal and the valve will be set incorrectly as the wheels are in a wrong position to avoid this and at the same time to avoid having to move the whole engine while setting the valve the engine is blocked up from the rails and the axle boxes of the driving wheels are wedged up so as to be lifted up into their proper position in this case there is no very accurate means of ascertaining what is the exact proper height save it be by first marking upon the outside faces of the shoes or pedestal a line even with the top of the axle box when the load is upon the wheels and then after blocking up the engine from the rails wedging up the axle boxes till the face again comes even with the line whatever plan is pursued one end of the piece of wire is rested in the fixed center punch mark and with the other a line is drawn across the outside face of the wheel rim the driving wheel is then revolved forward until the guide block returns having passed to the end of its travel when its end again stands exactly even with the mark made upon the guide bar the piece of wire is again brought into requisition one end being rested in the fixed center punch mark as before and with the other end another line is drawn across the outside rim of the wheel it is obvious that by taking a pair of compasses and finding a point exactly equidistant between the two lines thus marked upon the wheel rim and then marking that point with a center punch mark the crank will be upon its exact dead center when one end of the piece of bent wire rests in the fixed center punch mark the other end rests in the center punch mark upon the wheel rim to find the other dead center the wheel must be moved about halfway round and the process repeated with the motion block at the other end of the guide bars thus whenever the piece of wire will stand with one end resting in the fixed center punch mark and the other end in either of the center punch marks upon the wheel run the crank is upon a dead center having thus placed the crank upon either dead center we measure the valve lead and if in temporarily fixing our eccentrics we gave it too much lead we mark where it stands upon the shaft by means of a line drawn on the axle and carried up on the side face of the eccentric then move the eccentric back some little distance more than is necessary to make the adjustment and then move it forward again a little at a time noting when the valve has the proper amount of lead and thus fasten the eccentric upon the axle by means of the set screw the object of moving the eccentric too far back and then moving it forward is to make the adjustment so that the latter may be made with the lost motion of the valve gear all taken up the next proceeding is to move the driving wheel halfway round and try the lead at that end of the stroke if the lead at the two ends is not equal it shows that either the slide valve spindle or the eccentric rods are not of the proper length and must be rectified this being done the crank must be again placed upon first one and then the other dead center the valve lead being measured at each end when the lead is equal at each end the rods are of correct length and the amount of the lead must be regulated by moving the eccentrics as already directed if the link block does not come opposite the end of the eccentric rod when the reverse lever is in the end notch of the sector the length of the reverse rod is wrong and should be corrected if the link block comes right under the above conditions for the forward but not for the backward eccentric rod the notches in the sector are not cut in their proper positions or the link hanger is not of the proper length in either case the error may be remedied by altering the length of the latter but as doing this would alter the amount of the valve lead it is well if there is any prospect of such errors to correct them before setting the valves instead of measuring the lead of the valve with a rule or by a wedge the following plan is very often adopted after the valve and spindle are in position the valve is placed with the proper amount of lead upon the front port a center punch mark is then made upon the face of the steam chest a piece of quarter inch iron wire is then bent at right angles and each end filed to a point one end of this wire is placed in the fixed center punch mark in the steam chest and with the other a mark is made upon the slide spindle upon this latter mark a center punch mark is also made sufficiently deep to be very plainly visible when the burr raised by center punching is filed off which is necessary to prevent this burr from cutting the packing it follows that whenever the bent piece of wire will rest with one end in the center punch mark in the steam chest and the other end in the center punch mark in the slide spindle the valve is in its proper position when the crank is on the corresponding dead center this plan is a very old one and possesses the advantage that the valve may be set without seeing it that is to say with the steam chest cover on if the length of the piece of wire measured direct from point to point is known the valve may be set when the engine is upon the road without taking off the steam chest cover the center punch mark upon the steam chest should however always be placed in about the same spot so as to avoid mistakes in case of there being other similar marks upon the chest it should always be made deep so as not to get filled up with paint and be difficult to find in course of time the mark upon the slide valve spindle is apt to disappear from the wear of the spindle hence the center punch with which it is made should have a long conical point to mark the position of the eccentric upon the axle it is an excellent plan after the eccentrics are finally adjusted to take a chisel with the cutting end ground to the form of a fiddle drill one cutting edge being at a right angle to the other the chisel must be held so that while one edge rests upon the axle the other edge will bear against the radial face of the eccentric a sharp blow with a hammer upon the chiselhead will make a clean indented cut upon the axle and the eccentric the two cuts exactly meeting at their junction and denoting the position of the eccentrics in setting the valves of inside cylinder locomotives the back ports being out of sight the amount of lead is ascertained by making a wooden wedge about three inches long a thirtysecond of an inch thick at one end and three eighths of an inch thick at the other end the faces of this wedge are chalked and the lead is measured by inserting it between the edge of the valve and the edge of the port until its thickness just fills the space and then moving it edgeways so that the valve and port edges will just mark it by measuring the thickness of the wedge at the mark the amount of lead is ascertained after the valves are set it is still desirable to mark the position by center punch marks upon the outside of the steam chests and upon the valve spindles as already described if an eccentric should slip when the engine is upon the road and there are no marks whereby to readjust them it may be done approximately as follows put the reverse lever in the end notch of the forward gear then place the crank as nearly on a dead center as the eye will direct and open both the cylinder cocks then disconnect the slide valve spindle from the rocker arm and move the valve spindle until the opening of the port corresponding to the dead center on which the crank stands will be shown by steam blowing through the cylinder cock the throttle valve being opened a trifle the position of the valve being thus determined the eccentric must be moved upon the shaft until the valve spindle will connect with the rocker arm without being moved at all the throttle valve should be very slightly opened otherwise so much steam will be admitted into the cylinder that it will pass through any leak in the piston and blow through both cylinder cocks before there is time to ascertain which cock gives first exit to the steam new steamer a new steamer for the mallory line between new york and texas was lately launched from the yard of roach co chester pa

that his system has been approved by the french government and that they have decided to adopt his cannon collenders improved billiard table in the accompanying engravings we illustrate two important improvements in the construction of billiard tables which have recently been devised by mr h w collender the well known billiard table manufacturer of this city the first which is represented in fig 1 relates to the construction of the bedsupporting frame and aims to render the same stronger while cheapening its manufacture in putting together the body and framework of the table the usual practice is to cut away the stock of the cross beam and longitudinal beam and halve them together longitudinal grooves are also formed on the inner surface of the side and broad rails to accommodate tenons on the ends of the cross beams and the latter are secured in place by bolts fastening their ends to the broad rails mr collender claims that by this mode of construction not only are the cross beams weakened by being halved together but the broad rails are also weakened by the cutting away of this stock near the middle to effect the framing into them of the ends of the cross beams illustration fig 1 billiard table support frame from fig 1 it will be seen that the cross beam a is combined with the side broad rails in the following manner upon the inner face of each broad rail is secured a cast iron socket piece b into which fits one end of the cross beam a from said beam the bolt c passes through the shoe b and is secured by a nut d let into the stock of the broad rail the shoe b has lugs which enter the broad rail and the aperture in it through which the bolt passes is made oblong to admit of the drawing of the parts together after the insertion of the bolt upon the sides of the cross beam near the middle and directly opposite each other are two shoes e these have no bolt holes in them are placed the adjacent ends of the longitudinal beams f the other extremities of which are seated in shoes on the broad rails the shoes e have their lugs of such a length compared with the thickness of cross beam a that when put in place on said beam said lugs will come together the advantage of this is that should the beam a shrink in width the shoes on each side of it will still maintain their proper relation to form immovable abutments for the ends of pieces f this construction allows of shorter stuff being used in the manufacture and renders the framework stronger illustration figure 2 billiard table frame corner in fig 2 is illustrated a new method of forming the corners of the table hitherto it has been customary to use corner blocks of various sizes according to the dimensions of the table located one at each corner into these the broad rails were framed and secured to this arrangement mr collender adduces a long category of objections based on the possibility of the weight of the bed being thrown on these blocks in case of shrinkage of the frame on the fact that the corner of the table bed must necessarily be left without any support where it extends over the upper end of the corner block and also that in a bevel table in which the area of the top of the corner block is unavoidably much greater than that of the top of the corner block of a verticalsided table a large portion of the table bed will be left without any support the new device consists of a cast iron union plate g which is bolted to the leg as shown the broad rails and casting are securely fastened by the bolt h it will be seen that this bolt passing through the end of one broad rail and into a nut let into the other rail will securely draw and hold together the ends of said rails and the interposed metal plate clamped between them and that as the plain ends of the wooden rails just fit widthwise between the projecting heads on the edges of said interposed plate the latter will form a sort of housing for the ends of the rails and it will be understood that in this construction not only does the bead on the outer edge of the plate overlap the edges of the rails and form a neat and durable corner finish to the body but the broad rails being bolted together in the direction of the grain of the wood with only an interposed metal plate there will be no tendency to a loosening of the union of the parts of the frame the main importance of this invention rests in the idea of dispensing with the usual corner blocks and thus permitting the top edges of the broad rails on which the bed rests to practically come together and afford a perfect support to the bed clear out to the corners of the latter at the same time the whole structure is rendered stronger and more durable with less weight of material these inventions are the subject of separate patents that of the first being dated april 4 1876 and of the second november 16 1875 for further information address the manufacturer and patentee mr h w collender 738 broadway new york city coating engraved copper plates with steel in order to render copper plates which are used in printing more durable they can be covered with an electrolytic deposit of iron which possesses an unusual degree of hardness almost superior to steel the salt usually employed has been the double sulphate of iron and ammonia professor bttger who first invented this process has recently devised an improvement in the bath employed he dissolves 10 parts of ferrocyanide of potassium yellow prussiate of potash and 20 parts of the double tartrate of soda and potash rochelle salts in 200 parts of water and to this he adds 3 parts of persulphate of iron dissolved in 50 parts of water a large precipitate of prussian blue is formed to the whole is added drop by drop with constant stirring a solution of caustic soda until the blue precipitate entirely disappears leaving a perfectly clear light yellow liquid which is now ready for use professor bttger also claims that this solution can be employed with advantage for dyeing cotton yarn and fabrics a beautiful blue without the use of a mordant for this purpose the goods are put into the bath that has previously been slightly warmed until they are saturated through and through and then dried in the air after which they are immersed in extremely dilute sulphuric acid 1 to 50 which neutralizes the alkali and after washing and drying again they are permanently dyed a fine blue color test for sulphur in organic compounds h vohl recommends the following as the best method of detecting sulphur in organic compounds the substance to be tested is heated in a solution of caustic lime and oxide of lead in glycerin the latter is prepared as follows one volume of distilled water is mixed with 2 volumes of pure glycerin and heated to boiling freshly prepared slaked lime is added little by little until it is saturated freshly precipitated hydrated oxide of lead or moist litharge is added in excess and the liquid allowed to boil gently for a few minutes then tightly corked and left to cool after which the clear liquid is decanted from the sediment into a glass vessel that can be tightly corked if into this solution be introduced and heated any organic which contains sulphur like hair feathers horn albumen and the like it will at once turn black from the formation of sulphide of lead the great delicacy of this test is evident from the fact that when pure wheat bread is boiled with this reagent it turns yellow at first and then dark gray in consequence of the presence of sulphur in the gluten of the bread improved billiard ball holder the usual receptacle for the fourth ball when only three balls are used in the game of billiards is placed at the side of the table as this is both inconvenient and unsightly a neat device clearly shown in the annexed illustration has been invented which is intended to be attached to a gas fixture over the table a plate or sign is also added on which the number of a tablein case several

which is so constructed that it will not become loose sag down mar the table or jar when the ball strikes the cushion it may be adjusted to remain in any desired position the shank is pivoted in a metallic frame which is secured to the table the rear end of the shank works against a spring on the upper portion of the shank is a projection which embraces a horizontal flange to sustain the box against being forced downward the arrangement is very similar to the ordinary window catch the player has only to start the box from its position under the table when the spring carries it out at right angles to the rail a touch is sufficient to cause the spring to carry the box back to its former position the device is very simple and its advantages will be evident to all billiard players

city curious carnivorous plants the arum dracunculus is one of the most curious of that wonderful series of carnivorous plants which at the present time are engaging the closest scrutiny of naturalists it is a true trap in one senseinasmuch as it captures the victim which ventures near it but it relies on little or no mechanical means for securing its prey but stupefies the living insect by its odor the flower is hornshaped about 11 inches in length with an opening some 5 inches in diameter the color within is a dull dark violet while the interior of the spathe is lined with black hooked bristles the whole appearance of the flower being thoroughly repulsive the illustrations herewith presented figs 1 and 2 represent it at one third its natural size fig 2 showing a section of the flower it is not certain what attracts the insects which are usually of the species known as the meat fly and the common house fly they do not seem to seek for the small quantity of nectar concealed and yet they cluster about the fatal opening as if drawn by some overpowering fascination overcome by lethargy they fall inert upon the flower are lightly held by the bristles and finally die asphyxiated by the carbonic acid which the plant disengages in large quantities during its inflorescence strange as is the action of the arum the method whereby the mentzelia takes its prey is even more wonderful to illustrate on a magnified scale let the reader imagine a surface thickly covered with strong iron posts on the sides of which are numerous keen barbs pointing downward then between these posts suppose that jars overflowing with honey are placed an elephant let it be imagined attracted by the profusion of sweetness inserts his trunk between the posts and finds easy access to the honey but while he can force his proboscis downward past the barbs turned in that direction when he attempts to withdraw it he finds the keen points catch in the flesh and render it impossible to do so a terrible struggle follows the unfortunate animal twisting and writhing in every direction until finally by an herculean effort the head is torn from the body and the latter becomes digested by some potent gastric juice exuding from the colossal organism of which the trap forms but a portion of course this is vastly exaggerated and it would puzzle an elephant to pull his own head off but if for the post studded trap we substitute the surface of a flower and if we replace the elephant by a fly we shall have conceived an accurate picture of what takes place in the peculiar receptacle with which nature has provided the mentzelia ornata this is very beautifully shown in fig 3 and at a in same figure is represented the barbed bristles grasping the highly magnified proboscis of the fly between the barbed bristles are mushroomshaped projections from the summits of which a viscous nectar exudes this is the honey bait which induces the insect to insert his trunk between the fatal barbs there is still another plant physianthus albens which captures butterflies by grasping the proboscis the construction of the flower is quite complicated so that the insects are compelled to insert their trunks through a narrow and winding passage in order to reach the nectar the organ then necessarily comes in contact with an adhesive substance which prevents its removal the gronovia scandens fig 4 is another plant trap which catches no flies nor possesses any such wonderfully adapted devices as the plants already described it simply has its branches covered with double barbed bristles of great strength which attach themselves to anything brought in contact with them the bristles are strong enough to hold lizards as represented by our engraving the points inserting themselves in the interstices of the scaly covering of the reptile of course the lizard thus held starves to death and small birds often follow a like fate we are indebted to la nature for the

multitudes of persons who are sickly or of weak constitutions consequently by avoiding the night air and damp weather and changeable weather and weather that is considered too hot or too cold they are kept within doors the much largest portion of their time and as a matter of course continue invalids more and more ripening for the grave every hour the reason is they are breathing an impure atmosphere nineteentwentieths of their whole existence as nothing can wash us clean but pure water so nothing can cleanse the blood nothing can make healthgiving blood but the agency of pure air so great is the tendency of the blood to become impure in consequence of waste and useless matters mixing with it as it passes through the body that it requires a hogshead of air every hour of our lives to unload it of these impurities but in proportion as this air is vitiated in such proportion does it infallably fail to relieve the blood of these impurities and impure blood is the foundation of all disease the great fact that those who are out of doors most summer and winter day and night rain or shine have the best health the world over does of itself falsify the general impression that night air or any other outdoor air is unhealthy as compared with indoor air at the same time air is the great necessity of life so much so that if deprived of it for a moment we perish and so constant is the necessity of the blood for contact with the atmosphere that every drop in the body is exposed to the air through the medium of the lungs every two minutes and a half of our existence whatever may be the impurity of the outdoor air of any locality the indoor air of that locality is still more impure because of the dust and decaying and odoriferous matters which are found in all dwellings besides how can indoor air be more healthy than the outdoor air other things being equal when the dwelling is supplied with air from without to this very general law there is one exception which it is of the highest importance to note when the days are hot and the nights cool there are periods of time within each twentyfour hours when it is safest to be indoors with doors and windows closed that is to say for the hour or two including sunrise and sunset because about sunset the air cools and the vapors which the heats of the day have caused to ascend far above us condense and settle near the surface of the earth so as to be breathed by the inhabitants as the night grows colder these vapors sink lower and are within a foot or two of the earth so they are not breathed as the sun rises these same vapors are warmed and begin to ascend to be breathed again but as the air becomes warmer they are carried so far above our heads as to be innocuous thus it is that the old citizens of charleston s c remember that while it was considered important to live in the country during the summer the common observation of the people originated the custom of riding into town not in the cool of the evening or of the morning but in the middle of the day they did not understand the philosophy but they observed the fact that those who came to the city at midday remained well while those who did so early or late suffered from it all strangers at rome are cautioned not to cross the pontine marshes after the heat of the day is over sixteen of a ships crew touching at one of the west india islands slept on shore several nights and thirteen of them died of yellow fever in a few days while of two hundred and eighty who were freely ashore during the day not a single case of illness occurred the marshes above named are crossed in six or eight hours and many travelers who do it in the night are attacked with mortal fevers this does at first sight seem to indicate that night air is unwholesome at least in the locality of virulent malarias but there is no direct proof that the air about sunrise and sunset is not that which is productive of the mischief for the sake of eliciting the observations of intelligent men we present our theory on this subject a person might cross these marshes with impunity who would set out on his journey an hour or two after sundown and finish it an hour or two before sunup especially if he began that journey on a hearty meal because in this way he would be traveling in the cool of the night which coolness keeps the malaria so near the surface of the earth as to prevent its being breathed to a hurtful extent but if it is deadly to sleep out of doors all night in a malarial locality would it be necessarily fatal to sleep in a house in such a locality it would not it would be safer to sleep in the house especially if the windows and doors were closed the reason is that the house has been warmed during the day and if kept closed it remains much warmer during the night indoors than it is outdoors consequently the malaria is kept by this warmth so high above the head and so rarefied as to be comparatively harmless this may seem to some too nice a distinction altogether but it will be found throughout the world of nature that the works of the almighty are most strikingly beautiful in their minut and these minut are the foundation of his mightiest manifestations thus it is too that what we call fever and ague might be banished from the country as a general disease if two things were done 1 have a fire kindled every morning at daylight from spring to fall in the family room to which all the family should repair from their chambers and there remain until breakfast is taken 2 let a fire be kindled in the family room a short time before sundown let every member of the family repair to it and there remain until supper is taken in both cases the philosophy of the course marked out consists in two things first the fire rarefies the malaria and causes it to ascend above the breathing point second the food taken into the stomach creates an activity of circulation which repels diseasehalls journal of health the extension of the plague our recent english medical exchanges mention with undisguised apprehension the fact that already early this spring authentic observers state that the plague has broken out in bagdad and is rapidly increasing there and information from other sources renders it probable that the disease has shown itself in other places in the vicinity of that city some of which have not suffered before since the new development of the disease in mesopotamia three or four years ago the progress of the epidemic in and about bagdad last year shows that each year since its reappearance in that district it has covered a wider area and it will be remembered that last year it crossed the turcopersian frontier and broke out at shuster in khuzistan from the phenomena of the epidemic to this period it was feared especially by the physicians on the spot that if it should recur in the present year it must be expected to extend over a still wider area and show itself in even a more aggravated form than had yet been observed this opinion is concurred in by surgeonmajor colville the medical officer attached to the british embassy at bagdad and is expressed in his official report on the subject of the last and previous years outbreak the turcorussian struggle in asia minor and the massing of persian troops on the western frontier of that country add an additional and most grave factor to this ominous intelligence it has been so long since christian europe has suffered from this terrible disease that most medical men have never seen a case and indeed for awhile epidemiologists flattered themselves it had died out they yet say that a thorough system of sanitation will certainly check its advance let us hope so for of all pestilences which have ever scourged humanity and desolated empires none approach in magnitude those of the plague under the name of the black death it fills as hirsch remarks one of the darkest pages in the history of the human race it devastated every known country of the earth and penetrated to the remotest mountain hamlets and granges sometimes sweeping away in a few days every inhabitant leaving not one to remember the name or to inherit the goods of the family or the village long years afterward travelers would come upon these unknown villages the houses rotting the bones of the plaguestricken owners bleaching in the rooms and streets and no one to say who they had been as an epidemic disease it no doubt spreads from india that mother of pestilence where in the province of kutch and guzerat it is found as an endemic of great malignancy far more fatal in its historical appearance than the cholera it is well that the medical mind of europe is on the alert to meet its approach with the most energetic measures and should they fail it will devolve upon us to lose no time in taking up the defensive in the most energetic mannermedical and surgical reporter education in germany the compulsory school laws of prussia are frequently pointed to as models for similar laws perhaps with the hope that by imitating her lower schools we can bring up our high schools to an equal rank with hers and place our universities on a level with those which are producing the most finished scholars the deepest thinkers and the greatest investigators we are likely to forget that the conditions are different and especially that nascitur non fit is as true of a chemist as of a poet the state of popular education in germany is however a matter of interest and is best illustrated by the following table showing the percentage of

introduced and the bath kept at a temperature of 86 fah to 194 fah for two hours silk from wild silkworms requiring a higher temperature than wool goats hair and the like it is then taken out and washed put into an acid bath then washed again if necessary the barium bath is repeated as also the subsequent washings if this second bath of binoxide of barium does not produce the requisite whiteness it is introduced into a solution of permanganic acid or permanganate of magnesia before the last washing binoxide of barium bao2 is made by subjecting the oxide or caustic baryta bao to a stream of oxygen or common air at a high temperature its bleaching action is probably due to the formation of peroxide of hydrogen in solution in the bath an alloy of tin and phosphorus at the graupen tin works in bohemia an alloy of tin and phosphorus is made containing the greatest possible quantity of phosphorus which the tin is able to retain without losing any of it upon repeated meltings this compound which is neither entitled to the name of alloy nor is it a phosphide of tin is employed in the manufacture of phosphorusbronze in the manufacture of phosphorusbronze by alloying copper with phosphorustin no other precautions require to be observed than in the preparation of common bronze as the different properties of phosphorusbronze depend upon the proportions of phosphorus and of tin two kinds of phosphorustin are prepared no 0 contains 5 per cent and no 1 2 per cent of phosphorus these two kinds suffice to make the greater part of all the desired mixtures for special purposes the graupen works make to order phosphorustin with any desired quantity of phosphorus not exceeding 5 per cent which is the highest possible limit it is claimed that phosphorusbronze may be manufactured by the use of this phosphorustin as much as 40 per cent cheaper than that now in the market while it will only cost 8 per cent more than the ordinary tin and copper bronze no details are given of the method employed to make the phosphorus combine with tin but the low melting point of tin as compared with that of copper would indicate that this would lead to the great saving promised above american institute exhibition the fortysixth exhibition of this institute will open september 12 in this city parties having novelties which they intend to bring to public notice should at once address the general superintendent for blanks and information the medals it is said have been increased and special awards will be made upon a number of articles american inventions for new south wales writing from sydney under date of april 14 the times correspondent thus refers to the supply of locomotives and carriages from america our appearance at philadelphia has drawn the attention of american manufacturers to us in a most marked and unexpected degree a country that like new south wales is rolling in wealth must be a country that is able to buy and a country that is able to buy is exactly the country that american manufacturers have been anxiously looking out for our representatives at philadelphia have come back strongly impressed with the fact that there are many things that the americans can supply us with advantage our government has an offer from messrs baldwin co to furnish a locomotive engine for about 1000 less than the cost of an english engine and to leave the payment open until the engine has been thoroughly proved and approved a pullmans sleeping car and an ordinary passenger car have already been ordered and american wheels axles rails and brakes are strongly pressed on our acceptance as our government engineers are all of the english school american novelties will have a hard battle to fight to win official acceptance but the demand for economy in railway construction and working is so great that people and parliament will press on the minister for public works a fair trial for any american novelties that may seem to be suited to our wants the english manufacturers therefore who have hitherto supplied us must look to their laurelscapital and labor mans place in nature concerning mans true place in nature haeckel says whatever part of the body we consider we find upon the most exact examination that man is more nearly related to the highest apes than are the latter to the lowest apes it would therefore be wholly forced and unnatural to regard man in the zoological system as constituting a distinct order and thus to separate him from the true ape rather is the scientific zoologist compelled whether it is agreeable to him or not to rank man within the order of the true ape simi to whatever minuti of detail the comparison is carried we reach in every case the same result between man and the anthropoid apes there are the closest anatomical and physiological resemblances in form and function there is the most exact agreement between all the corresponding bones of the skeleton of each the same arrangement and structure of the muscles nerves and entire viscera and of the spleen liver and lungsthe latter being a matter of especial significance for between the manner of breathing and the process of nutrition there is the closest relation the brain also is subject to the same laws of development and differs only with regard to size the minute structure of the skin nails and even the hair is identical in character although man has lost the greater part of his hairy covering as darwin thinks in consequence of sexual selection yet the rudimentary hairs upon the body correspond in many respects to those of the anthropoids the formation of the beard is the same in both cases while the face and ears remain bare anthropoids and men become grayhaired in old age but the most remarkable circumstance is that upon the upper arm the hairs are in both cases directed downward and upon the lower arm upward while in the case of the halfapes it is different and not as soft as that of man and the anthropoids the eye on account of its delicate structure is peculiarly suitable for comparisons of this kind and we find here the greatest similarity even inflammation and green cataract occur under the same circumstances in both see also darwin upon this point there is no more striking proof that man and the anthropoid apes have the same anatomical and physiological nature and require the same food than the similarity of their blood under the microscope the blood corpuscles are identical in form and appearance while those of the carnivora are clearly different from them it may now be interesting in confirmation of what has been said to refer to the family life and if one may so speak to the mental and moral life of the anthropoids like man the ape provides with exceeding care for its young so that its parental affection has become proverbial connubial fidelity is a general and well known virtue the mother ape leads its young to the water and washes its face and hands in spite of its crying wounds are also washed out with water the ape when in distress will weep like a human being and in a manner that is said to be very affecting young apes manifest the same tendencies as human children when domesticated they are in youth docile and teachable and also at times like all children disobedient in old age they often become morose and capricious most apes construct huts or at least roofs as a protection from the weather and sleep in a kind of bed one peculiarity is alone common to them and man and this is the habit of lying upon the back in sleep in battle they defend themselves with their fists and long sticks and under otherwise like circumstances they manifest like passions and emotions with man as joy and sorrow pain and envy revenge and sympathy in death especially the ape face assumes a peculiarly humanlike and spiritual expression and the sufferer is the object of as genuine compassion as exists in the case of man it is also well known that apes bury their dead laying the body in a secluded spot and covering it with leaves regarding the domestic life of the ape darwin says in his descent of man vol 1 p 39 we see maternal affection manifested in the most trifling details thus rengger observed an american monkey a cebus carefully driving away the flies which plagued her infant and duvancel saw a hylobates washing the faces of her young ones in a stream so intense is the grief of female monkeys for the loss of their young that it invariably caused the death of certain kinds kept under confinement by brehm in north africa orphan monkeys are always adopted and carefully guarded by other monkeys both males and females one female baboon had so capacious a heart that she not only adopted young monkeys of other species but stole young dogs and cats which she continually carried about with her her kindness did not go so far however as to share her food with her adopted offspring at which brehm was surprised as his monkeys divided everything quite fairly with their own young ones an adopted kitten scratched the abovementioned affectionate baboon who certainly had a fine intellect for she was much astonished at being scratched and immediately examined the kittens feet and without more ado bit off the claws the number of characteristics possessed in common by man and the higher apes is indeed very great and includes not only physical and emotional but even intellectual qualitiesfrom schlickeysens fruit and bread translated by dr holbrook special notice persons who have sent numbers of the scientific american to this office for the purpose of having them

paper munn co 37 park row new york decisions of the courts united states circuit courtdistrict of new jersey shawl strap patentgeorge crouch vs william roemer in equity by nixon district judge this is an action for an alleged infringement of complainants letters patent no 82606 dated september 29 1868 and reissued march 7 1871 no 4289 the subjectmatter of the patent is in the reissue described to be a strap to confine a shawl or similar article in a bundle and termed a shawlstrap the schedule attached to and forming a part of the said reissued patent states that before the complainants invention straps had been used to confine a shawl or similar article in a bundle and a leather crosspiece with loops at the ends had extended from one strap to the other and above and attached to this leather crosspiece was a handle this leather crosspiece or connecting strap is liable to bend and allow the straps to be drawn toward each other by the handle in sustaining the weight hence the bundle is not kept in a proper shape and the handle is inconvenient to grasp the invention is then stated to consist of a rigid crossbar beneath the handle combined with suspending straps that are to be passed around the shawl or bundle such straps passing through loops at the ends of the handle no question can be made but that the shawl straps manufactured and sold by the defendant are an infringement of the complainants reissue they consist of a metallic crossbar with slots at the ends for the reception of the straps and which also connect the ends of the handle several defences are set up in the answer but the only one necessary to consider is the first to wit the want of novelty and prior public use i had occasion heretofore to inquire into the validity of the complainants patent in a controversy between the same complainant and speer et al reported in vi off gaz 1874 in which as in this case the principal defence turned upon the novelty of the invention a prior public use was alleged and attempted to be proved i there said and now repeat that the patent is prima facie evidence that the patentee was the original and first inventor and that any one who controverts this assumes the burden of proof and undertakes to show affirmatively that there was a prior knowledge and use of the alleged invention under such circumstances as to give to the public the right of its continued use against the patentee the defence in this case has brought out many facts in regard to the public use of the rigid crossbar in shawl straps anterior to the date of the complainants patent which were not developed in the former suit there is no evidence which in my judgment affects the honesty of the complainants claim or which creates any doubt that he really believed himself to be the original and first inventor but nevertheless i am constrained to the conclusion after a most careful examination of the whole testimony that the proofs show with reasonable certainty that he has been anticipated in the invention and that his patent is void in consequence of the prior knowledge and public use and the bill must be therefore dismissed with costs e b barnum for complainant arthur v briesen for defendant new books and publications the economic theory of the location of railways by arthur m wellington ce price 200 new york city office of the railroad gazette 73 broadway the author of this book is thoroughly conversant with his subject and his statement that the book has gradually grown from a few notes into a volume may be accepted as an explanation of the somewhat fragmentary character of the work he asserts that all our railways are uneconomically located and in many cases these errors are shockingly evident if these statements are true he is right in stating that there is something almost pitiful in the waste of human labor enforced by such costly blundering he considers that other countries have made lamentable blunders in locating their railroads so

citythis is an improved device for operating the slide valve of a steam engine from the piston rod of said engine in such a way that the valve will be moved slightly to partially uncover the inlet and exhaust ports as the piston completes its stroke and its motion will be continued in the same direction as the piston begins to move upon the return stroke until the ports are fully opened and will then stand still with the ports fully open until the piston has nearly completed its return stroke it consists in the combination of a threearmed bar two levers connecting bar and connecting lever with the piston rod and the valve stem of a steam engine and in the combination of a lockbar spring two cylinders and pin with the two levers and the threearmed bar as the piston approaches the end of its stroke the upper end of an upright arm of a bar strikes the concaved side of the upper part of one of the levers operating it and moving the slide valve to close the ports and admit steam in front of the piston as the piston begins its return stroke the inclined upper surface of one of the side arms of the threearmed bar comes in contact with the lower end of the said lever and continues its motion in the same direction fully opening the said inlet port which remains fully open until the piston has again nearly completed its stroke improved reversible eccentric george g lafayette and pitt

boilers by a f nagle me providence r i notes queries it has been our custom for thirty years past to devote a considerable space to the answering of questions by correspondents so useful have these labors proved that the scientific american office has become the factotum or headquarters to which everybody sends who wants special information upon any particular subject so large is the number of our correspondents so wide the range of their inquiries so desirous are we to meet their wants and supply correct information that we are obliged to employ the constant assistance of a considerable staff of experienced writers who have the requisite knowledge or access to the latest and best sources of information for example questions relating to steam engines boilers boats locomotives railways etc are considered and answered by a professional engineer of distinguished ability and extensive practical experience inquiries relating to electricity are answered by one of the most able and prominent practical electricians in this country astronomical queries by a practical astronomer chemical inquiries by one of our most eminent and experienced professors of chemistry and so on through all the various departments in this way we are enabled to answer the thousands of questions and furnish the large mass of information which these correspondence columns present the large number of questions sentthey pour in upon us from all parts of the worldrenders it impossible for us to publish all the editor selects from the mass those that he thinks most likely to be of general interest to the readers of the scientific american these with the replies are printed the remainder go into the waste basket many of the rejected questions are of a primitive or personal nature which should be answered by mail in fact hundreds of correspondents desire a special reply by post but very few of them are thoughtful enough to inclose so much as a postage stamp we could in many cases send a brief reply by mail if the writer were to inclose a small fee a dollar or more according to the nature or importance of the case when we cannot furnish the information the money is promptly returned to the

to be made at once into good stearin candles without any further treatment a yes 2 b b says i wish to express the strongest coloring matter from certain herbs sage leaves for instance how can it best be done cheaply and quickly evaporation during several days after boiling and simmering has the effect but it is inconveniently slow the color produced is a medium brown a dry the leaves etc thoroughly and grind to a fine powder digest this for several days in enough warm water to thoroughly moisten it throughout then add enough wood naphtha to make a stiff paste and after standing an hour transfer to a fine linen bag and express the thick liquid in a screw press 2 is there anything that will set the color a try a strong hot solution of alum 3 h k f m says i have a box made of bohemian crystal the cover which was held to the box by a brass frame has come apart from its frame it seemed to have been cemented by a hard substance resembling plaster of paris how can i make it a boil 3 parts powdered rosin for sometime with 1 part of caustic soda and 5 parts of water then stir into the soap formed one half its weight of plaster of paris and use immediately 4 f n y asks would a canvas bag coated with a varnish made of india rubber dissolved in naphtha be suitable to hold oxygen gas a yes but bags made of double pieces of cloth cemented together with the varnish are better 5 j a b asks is there any difference between electricity and magnetism a electricity and magnetism are supposed to be manifestations of the same force whose actions are produced at right angles to each other the action which occurs in the line of polarization being called electricity and the one at right angles to this line magnetism there is an important difference between them however as electricity is essentially a dynamic force while magnetism is purely static 1 is not the idea of the world moving around the sun in an elliptic form absurd a no 2 my idea is that the north star is the center of the universe or in fact is the magnet that all the suns or fixed stars move around and that the attraction of the pole of the earth although it moves around the sun is the cause of the change of seasons or in other words the angle of light a there is nothing whatever to support the idea but a supposed center of the universe has really been designated by some astronomers 6 p s asks how much copper wire does it require to construct an electromagnet that will uphold 100 lbs and what size of wire should be used a probably 500 or 600 feet of no 14 copper wire would be sufficient with 3 or 4 very large size grove cells and cores about 6 inches long and 1 inch in diameter 7 h s b says water falls about 16 feet per second my overshot water wheel moves about 4 feet per second do i in that way lose that percentage of the actual power of the water a not necessarily 8 c n b asks can a steam engine be worked with compressed air the same as with steam a generally speaking it can but not in every respect 9 j y says if all the measures of length surface and capacity in the world and all the weights were lost by what means could new ones be made corresponding exactly with those we now have a it would be impossible as all the measures in use refer to certain arbitrary standards 10 r b g asks if a horse be pulling at the end of a lever and traveling 3 miles an hour how many lbs pressure against his collar must he exert to raise 33000 lbs 1 foot per minute a the force exerted by the animal will depend upon the length of the lever which should be given 11 c h mck asks would a pump so constructed as to create an incessant suction draw water an indefinite distance or how far would it draw it a such a pump would raise water no higher than any other that was equally tight 12 j w says i wish to get some boilers made about 12 inches in diameter and 13 inches deep i want them to stand a pressure corresponding to 400 fah do you think it would be safe to have them made of cast iron a we think it will be better to use wrought iron make the shell about 716 of an inch thick 13 j r s says in reply to e w p who says that he has an artesian well which does not flow but from which he pumps by inserting a pipe inside the well tubing and asks if we attach the pump to the well tubing directly allowing no air to enter the tube would it not be like trying to pump water from an airtight barrel if such were the case the drive well would be a miserable failure for in all drive wells the pump is attached directly to the tube i would advise e w p to attach his pump to the well tube direct and he will gain three times the amount of water that he now gets by having his pump attached to the well tube directly the working of the pump creates a vacuum and the atmospheric pressure on the earths surface violently forces the liquid to fill the vacuum thus formed thereby giving a much greater amount of water than can be otherwise obtained it is a well established fact that more water can be obtained by the drive well than by any other a in our answer to e w p it will be evident we think to most of our readers that we only referred to the case in which the well had no connection with the atmosphere when the pipe was tightly fitted it appears however that it might have been better to have stated this more definitely and we gladly embrace the opportunity afforded by the interesting letters of our correspondents we would be glad to receive from j r s some experimental data in proof of his assertion as to the great gain from a tight connection this also answers j t g and w h f 14 h h s says 1 given a boat with a 35 feet keel of 6 feet beam with fine lines also a twocylinder engine each cylinder 4 x 5 inches and a wheel 28 inches in diameter and of 3 feet pitch will an upright boiler with 135 square feet heating surface and 4 square feet grate surface be sufficient to run the engine at 250 or 300 revolutions per minute with 100 lbs steam a with good coal and a forced draft the boiler may be large enough 2 what will be the probable speed of boat a in smooth water 7 to 8 miles an hour 15 f a asks what would be a safe outside pressure for a cylinder of wrought iron inch thick and 4 feet in diameter and 8 feet long a according to tables given in wilsons treatise on steam boilers the working pressure for such a tube would be about 65 lbs per square inch 16 f m m asks 1 how large must an engine be to run a boat 12 feet wide 75 feet long drawing 4 feet of water at the rate of 30 miles per hour on a river or bay where the surface is smooth a we have some doubts as to whether these conditions could be fulfilled 2 do steamboats on the ocean use salt water in their boilers for steam or do they carry fresh water a they ordinarily have surface condensers so that the water of condensation is returned to the boilers 17 e s n says please give your ideas as to how much water an engine 18 inches in diameter by 22 inches stroke running at 145 revolutions per minute at 80 lbs steam cutting off at about 18 inches will require we furnished an injector for one of the above dimensions capable of throwing 900 gallons per hour it was found to be insufficient and i went to the mill to discover the cause if possible the manufacturers of the injector thought it ought to be large enough and so did we i found everything set up properly and the piston and valve were evidently in good order i finally measured the capacity of the tank which supplied the injector and found that it drew 960 gallons per hour a we do not think the data are sufficient for an accurate calculation it is possible however that some of our readers have made experiments on similar engines and can give some useful information 18 t w asks what size of breast water wheel with a fall of 2 feet water would it require to produce the same power as an overshot wheel of 4 feet diameter 18 inches face with a fall of 5 feet water a if the breast wheel gave the same efficiency as the other it would require a face about 2 times as wide 19 a k says a asserts that if a small and a large boiler be set side by side and connected with the top gauge cock of the two boilers level when they are first filled with water and then steam is raised that the water will not remain the same that the pressure will be greater in the larger boiler and consequently will force the water into the smaller one b says that the water will always remain the same as long as the boilers are connected that the pressure on the water will be the same in both boilers and therefore the water will always assume the same level in each which is right a the pressures sometimes vary in two boilers connected in this way and they should be set in such a way that the water cannot be forced from one into the other under any circumstances 20 j t g says i notice your reply to w g in regard to pounding of a steam pump in which you recommend the use of a larger air vessel i think that w g can remedy the difficulty by allowing a small quantity of air to enter the pump cylinder at each stroke which can be done without sensibly diminishing the amount of water delivered provided the lift is not so high as to nearly equal the capacity of the pump that would keep the maximum quantity of air in the air vessel and i think that the air in the discharge pipe would have the effect of converting a comparatively rigid column into an elastic one w g can easily try the experiment by running with the drain cocks at the end of his pump partially open and if that remedies the difficulty he might insert a small check valve opening inward to prevent the discharge of water during the outstroke if w g tries this i wish that he would let us know the result through the scientific american 21 g h says please decide the following a claims that a team of horses can draw a greater load when hitched close to it than when hitched at a distance of 10 or 20 feet b claims that everything else being equal distance makes no difference and that the team could pull as many lbs at a distance of 20 feet as it could at ten or less which is right a we incline to bs opinion please tell me the relative power of conducting electricity of the principal metals a according to matthiessen the electrical conductivity of the principal metals under similar conditions is as follows silver 1000 copper 999 gold 800 aluminium 560 sodium 374 zinc 290 cadmium 237 potassium 208 platinum 180 iron 168 tin 131 lead 83 german silver 77 antimony 46 mercury 16 bismuth 12 22 s r s asks how can lime or rather phosphate of lime be precipitated from cod liver oil which is perfectly clear and said to contain 2 per cent of the phosphate a this can only be done by first destroying the organic matter of the oil and then examining the residue for the phosphates with the usual reagentsmagnesia solution barium chloride nitrate of silver ammonium molybdate etc with so small a percentage of the phosphates it will be necessary for you to work with concentrated solutions and slowly the oil may be oxidized by treating it on the waterbath with hot hydrochloric acid with some chlorate of potash added in small quantities at a time then evaporate down nearly to dryness and treat with a little strong nitric and a few drops of sulphuric acid this will take some time if properly done 23 j h s says in answer to j h bs query as to a parrot pulling out his feathers take a knife and scrape the inside edge of the bill and the feathers will slip from the bill without coming out this is done for feathereating hens no doubt it will answer for a parrot as well 24 s r s says i have some dentists pellet gold i alloyed it with brass and silver i melted it several times but it was so very brittle that i could not work it i then added a 2 gold coin and fused all together but it was as brittle as before i then fused it and dropped in lumps of pure saltpeter but it is still as brittle as before i fused the gold on a lump of charcoal with an alcohol blowpipe please tell me how to work it a you fail to state the proportions of your alloy there may be an excess of zinc and copper or the fusion may not have been complete place it together with several small pieces of rosin and a little borax or carbonate of soda in a small blacklead crucible and heat to very bright redness over a good fire if this does not obviate the difficulty fuse the alloy with about three times its weight of nitrate of potassa saltpeter and treat the mass when cold with dilute sulphuric acid pour off the acid solution and fuse the alloy together with any silver sulphate adhering to it and a little carbonate of soda any silver contained in the acid solution may be recovered by adding a little salt or muriatic acid and fusing the precipitated chloride of silver with carbonate of soda 25 n s asks 1 can water be decomposed into its constituents oxygen and hydrogen with any considerable rapidity and in large quantities by electricity a yes providing a large magnetoelectric machine be used 2 what is the best and cheapest method of generating hydrogen in large quantities a the action of iron or zinc scraps on diluted oil of vitriol is among the best a considerable volume of pure hydrogen may also be obtained with facility by passing superheated steam through a large iron tube filled with scrap iron heated to bright redness 26 g s d w asks is there any process by which an engraving can be transferred either to stone or wood where the printing ink can be made to show up as black as in the original after the transfer has been made a we know of no satisfactory method whereby this may be accomplished directly by means of the chromate of gelatin photographic process such transfers may be made without great difficulty 27 f m m asks 1 if a steamboat 100 feet long of 5 feet beam and 4 feet draught be provided with one set of common side paddle wheels and power enough to run it at the rate of 10 knots per hour would two sets of side wheels with the power doubled and the revolutions of the wheels doubled double the speed of the boat a no 2 if we take the same boat side wheels and power for running 10 knots per hour and arrange for the side wheels to feather their paddles what effect would it have on the speed of the boat a you might obtain from 10 to 15 per cent more of the power of the engine in useful effect 28 w j t asks 1 what is the best dark color to paint a laboratory and what kind of paint must i use a one of the best for this purpose is shellac in alcohol colored to suit with vandyke or spanish brown etc 2 i wish to varnish my benches what varnish would you recommend a shellac is commonly used but copal gives good results also brunswick black in oil of what should a waste water pipe be made so as to resist acids a make it of lead or block tin can you recommend an elementary work on electric batteries a spragues electricity its theory sources and applications is one of the best 29 t p h asks can i take a wax impression off type and then electrotype it with a battery a yes this is the common method of making electrotypes for printing from 30 c m asks what are the locations of the various branch mints of the united states a a recent authority gives them as philadelphia pa san francisco cal carson city nev and denver col assay offices are situated at new york city charlotte n c and boise city idaho 31 b l d asks can you give me a recipe for making paste for sharpening razors knives etc a mix the finest emery obtainable with a little suet 32 c b mcm says i hear that four gallon measures of different capacities are in use and that the united states standard gallon contains 230 cubic inches in the confusion of textbook statements such aswine gallon 231 cubic inches beer gallon 282 cubic inches american standard gallon 58973 grains youmans chemistry nearly 234 cubic inches and the very extensive ignorance of what is really correct please repeat the information in a way that may be quoted as authority for the capacity of a united states gallon in cubic inches and the weight in grains a the gallon of the united states is the standard or winchester wine gallon of 231 cubic inches and contains 83388822 lbs avoirdupois or 583721754 troy grains of distilled water at 3983 fah the barometer being at 30 inches it is equal to 3785207 liters the gallon of the state of new york is of the capacity of 8 lbs pure water at its maximum density or 221184 cubic inches it is equal to 362346 litersappletons cyclopoedia 33 s c d says please give directions for electrotyping cylindrical rollers for impressing upon sheets of wax accurately of the proper figure for honeycomb foundations the figure for the surface of the cylinders to be derived from sheets of wax foundation having the figure correctly impressed upon them a this can be done by coating with plumbago and then electrotyping with copper in a way familiar to most printers and to all electrotyping establishments the plates can afterwards be bent round a roller and used to impress the sheets of wax 34 j h t asks there is a piece of ground 100 rods long and 10 rods wide at one end running to a point at the other which we wish to divide into 4 equal lots please give a rule a let the 100 rods be the base of a triangle divide it into 4 parts of 25 rods each and join the apex with each of the three dividing points you will then have 4 triangles on equal bases and between the same parallels which according to euclid are equal to each other 35 r s asks what are the chemical qualities of bisulphide of lime and how can i prepare it a the bisulphide of calcium c2s5 is produced by boiling milk of lime with sulphur and water but not long enough to allow the lime to become completely saturated the filtered liquid on cooling deposits crystals whose composition agrees with the formula c2s2 3h2o exposed to the air it soon absorbs oxygen becoming converted into insoluble sulphate of calcium its aqueous solutions are likewise decomposed its reactions with the metallic salts are similar to those of the alkaline sulphides 36 h m s asks 1 of what is the bronze preparation made and how is it applied to clock fronts a bronze powders are made of various metallic alloys the gold bronze is usually made of dutch gold an alloy of copper and zinc and of the bisulphide of tin aurum musivum they are usually applied to metal work by means of an oil size or japan varnish 2 in what way can i remove the old bronze a wash first with a solution of washing soda hot clean and dry and then rub with a little benzole alcohol or ether 37 w e w asks 1 of what mixture is the bright red paint usually put upon axes made a it consists of fine vermilion ground with 1 part boiled oil and 2 parts turpentine 2 is more than one coat applied a one coat will suffice it is best applied with a fine brush when the metal is warm 38 c m b asks is the odor emitted by the ailanthus tree unwholesome a it is considered so by many but we have no proof as to the facts 39 l s co ask is there anything known which would clean the hands from paints and lacquers without the use of turpentine a a little ammonia and benzine or naphtha aided by a little sand is often used in stubborn cases put plenty of good soap and warm water with a stiff brush or a small piece of pumicestone will ordinarily suffice 40 w p s jr says can you give me a recipe for making papier mach a papier mach is obtained from old paper and the like made into a pulp by grinding with milk of lime or lime water and a little gum dextrin or starch this pulp is then pressed into form coated with linseed oil baked at a high temperature and finally varnished the pulp is sometimes mixed with clay kaolin chalk etc and other kinds are made of a paste of pulp and recently slaked lime this is used for ornamenting wood etc 41 m p b says in reply to a correspondent who asked how to prevent his water filter from getting choked up fit in the filter on the top of the charcoal a piece of board having in the center a circular hole from two to four inches in diameter according to the size of the filter force in this a sponge so tightly that all the water has to pass through it first but not so as to prevent its free passage this sponge will absorb readily the gross impurities of the water and can easily be taken out and cleaned once or twice a week 42 a c s asks 1 is there any reason why lightning rod points should always be bright if the points are kept sufficiently sharp a it makes no difference if the points are not bright 2 if lightning rods put up in the ordinary way above the roof terminate in the eaves spouting of the house and said spouting had good ground connections would this not be equal to the best lightning rod and thereby save many feet of rod and many dollars of expense a the arrangement you suggest would be good make a thoroughly good ground connection with leaders have all joints well soldered and you may dispense with the rod as you propose 43 j a w says having occasion to do some copper plating some time ago i dissolved sulphate of copper in water in a glass jar i then poured it off into my battery and there was some left in the jar i threw a small piece of iron into it and left it for some days i then took it out and to my surprise i found that it had been perfectly plated with copper please let me know the cause a the reaction you note is taken advantage of to cheaply copper plate small articles of cast iron see answer to j o m p 347 vol 36 in the presence of water the reaction is as follows cuso4 fe feso4 cu sulphate of copper iron sulphate of iron copper as the iron is a more positive metal than copper it displaced the latter in combination with acids the remaining portions of the iron becoming coated with the precipitated copper 44 a g asks is the silver for a reflecting telescope put on the back of the glass the same as on looking glasses a no only one side of the glass is ground and polished to the shape required the silvering is done on this side and then with the softest buckskin and the finest rouge the surface of the silver is polished for the reflecting surface in cities where gas is used it will not retain its brilliancy very long then it requires to be cleaned with nitric acid and resilvered which is only the work of a few hours when a person has become accustomed to it 45 a l b says 1 i understand that in modern chemistry the acids and alkalies are the two extremes of a class of substances called hydrates the only difference being the radical in the reaction of nitric acid ho no2 or hno3 on potassic hydrate koh is ko no2 or kno3 and h2o which molecule loses the oxygen atom and why should one part with it more than the other a hno3 koh kno3 h2o nitric acid potassic potassic water hydrate nitrate in this reaction the potassium is considered by virtue of its greater affinity as replacing the hydrogen atom in the hydric nitrate the hydrogen in turn satisfying the oh group to form water these hydrates are similar only in point of constitution their chemical

superintendent typemetal relief plates a superior substitute for woodcuts at much lower prices these plates are engraved almost entirely by photochemical means thus avoiding the old slow and tedious method of engraving on wooden blocks where the workman is compelled to engrave each line separately by cutting away the wood around it often spending many days upon a plate a few inches square in appearance our relief plates are the same as regular stereotypes being mounted type high on blocks ready to be set up and printed from with type on any ordinary press they can be used directly and will wear as long as any typemetal plates but if a great number of impressions are wanted duplicate electrotypes and stereotypes can be made from them the same as from woodcuts they have a printing surface as smooth as glass and the lines are engraved deeper than they are in handcut plates notwithstanding the low prices at which they can be furnished they are very much superior to woodcuts and in some classes of work are rapidly taking the place of lithography references among those who manifest their satisfaction with our work by continued orders we may mentiond appleton co scribner co frank leslie a d f randolph co g w carleton co the american tract society robert carter bros munn co pub iron age pub illustrated weekly pub mcgees illustrated weekly and also a large part of the principal publishers and manufacturers throughout the country copy almost all kinds of prints or engravings from wood stone copper and steel may be reproduced directly the requisites are clean distinct black lines or stipple work on white or only slightly tinted paper all photographs and pencil sketches must first be drawn in ink we keep a corps of artists constantly employed trained to do this work in the best manner we can make drawings from photographs or tintypes taken in the usual way they may be of any size but should of course show the object distinctly drawings for our use unless intended to be redrawn should be on a smooth white surface in perfectly black lines and usually twice the dimensions each way of the desired plate copy for facsimiles of handwriting should be in perfectly black ink on smooth white paper written with a full pen and without use of blotting paper time while we can engrave a plate in a few hours that would occupy a woodengraver a month and often do so yet with the large amount of work constantly on hand and promised we cannot usually engage to fill an order for a single plate in less than from three to six days larger orders will of course require longer time change of size in reproducing woodcut prints the size can often be considerably reduced but if the reduction is great the lines become so fine and close together that they will not print well coarse woodcuts such as are generally used in newspapers may often be reduced to half their linear dimensions but fine woodcuts will admit of but little reduction most steel plate prints and lithographs will not admit of any reduction and even when reproduced the same size in relief require considerable care in printing all kinds of prints generally look bad when much enlarged as the lines become very coarse and ragged on the edges though we have sometimes made very effective cuts for posters and handbills in this way in all cases of enlargement and reduction the relative proportions remain the same it must not be forgotten however that by redrawing prints of any kind can be enlarged or reduced to any desired size proofs we will whenever desired furnish tintype proofs of drawings made by us for examination and approval or correction before engraving a printed proof is sent with each plate when delivered which may always be equaled or surpassed in actual work with proper usage prices it is impossible to give a scale of prices by the square inch for miscellaneous jobwork as sometimes a small cut two or three inches square may require as much work as another one a foot square we can however give an average inch rate to newspaper publishers whose work runs uniformly about the same from week to week especially when they furnish us with copy already preparedsuch as prints and penandink drawings in sending for estimates be careful to send us the copy we are to work from with full specifications as to size and quality and remember that it is the same with engraving that it is with everything else the price will vary greatly with the quality of work ordered never directly or indirectly ask us to give you better prices than we give our other customers as we try to treat all alike the great advantage of our method of engraving enables us to give better work at lower prices than can be given by any other method for the greater part of such work as would be given to woodengravers though in very small pieces of the poorer grades of work the advantage is not so great and in very coarse work such as is usually engraved on mahogany and pine our process gives us no advantage over the woodengraver to estimate properly upon any piece of work we must understand just what is wanted we guarantee all our work to be executed in the style agreed upon terms our terms are cash on delivery except by special agreement orders from parties not known to us must be accompanied by an advance of at least half the price or satisfactory city reference goods sent by

contemplating the erection of fire proof buildingsthe cost can be accurately calculated the cost of insurance avoided and the serious losses and interruption to business caused by fire these and like
