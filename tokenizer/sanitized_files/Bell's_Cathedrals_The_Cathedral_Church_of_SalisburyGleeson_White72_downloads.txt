london george bell sons 1898 chiswick presscharles whittingham and co tooks court chancery lane london general preface this series of monographs has been planned to supply visitors to the great english cathedrals with accurate and well illustrated guide books at a popular price the aim of each writer has been to produce a work compiled with sufficient knowledge and scholarship to be of value to the student of archology and history and yet not too technical in language for the use of an ordinary visitor or tourist to specify all the authorities which have been made use of in each case would be difficult and tedious in this place but amongst the general sources of information which have been almost invariably found useful arefirstly the great county histories the value of which especially in questions of genealogy and local records is generally recognized secondly the numerous papers by experts which appear from time to time in the transactions of the antiquarian and archological societies thirdly the important documents made accessible in the series issued by the master of the rolls fourthly the wellknown works of britton and willis on the english cathedrals and lastly the very excellent series of handbooks to the cathedrals originated by the late mr john murray to which the reader may in most cases be referred for fuller detail especially in reference to the histories of the respective sees gleeson white edward f strange editors of the series authors preface the authorities consulted in the preparation of this book are too numerous to quote in detail but the admirable works by the late rev wh jones have been proved so full of useful information that the service they rendered must be duly acknowledged although in almost every instance further reference was made to the building itselfor to officially authenticated documents nor must the help of one of the cathedral cicerones be overlooked in spite of his desire to remain anonymous for his knowledge of the building served to correct several mistakes in the first edition one moot point concerning the bishop commemorated by an effigy in the north choir aisle is left an open question local authorities insist that it should be attributed to bishop poore antiquarians of distinction affirm that it represents bishop bingham the illustrations with the exception of a few details from britton

cathedral church of s mary there is probably no cathedral church in europe certainly no other english one that has such a clear record of its history as salisbury whereas in almost every other instance we have only vague legendary accounts of the original foundation of the building in this case there is a trustworthy chronicle of its first inception and each successive stage of its progress extant owing to reasons noted in another chapter the former cathedral at old sarum was condemned to be abandoned and a new site chosen for its successor bishop richard poore through whose efforts the change of locality was effected is said to have hesitated long before he could find one suitable wilton then a place of some importance attracted him first there is a more or less accurate ms extant which professes to give an account of his tentative attempts to induce the abbess of wilton to permit him to build his church in a meadow of her domain an old sewingwoman quaedam vetula filatrix is said to have attributed his frequent visits to quite another motive she inferred that the bishop had a papal dispensation to marry and was a suitor for the hand of the abbess the negotiations failed hath not the bishop land of his own that he must needs spoil the abbess verily he hath many more sites on which he may build his church than this at wilton was the reply of the abbess to his demand during his period of indecision the virgin appeared to him in a vision and commanded him to build his new church in a place called myrfield or as some accounts have it maerfield he searched vainly for a piece of ground by that name that he might obey the supernatural edict until by chance he overheard a labourer or a soldier the legends vary talking of the maerfield and then having as he thought identified the place which appears to have been within his own demesne he commenced to plan the present building another tradition ignores the dream and says the site of the cathedral was determined by an arrow shot from the ramparts of old sarum misled by the similarity of sound the name maerfield has been naturally enough interpreted to mean maryfield the apparently obvious form miryfieldas according to leland it appears on an old inscriptionin spite of the marshy nature of the site is probably a mere coincidence nor is thomas fullers merryfield for the pleasant situation thereof better worth attention the generally accepted theory at present is that maer the anglosaxon word for a boundary supplies the clue a hamlet marton near bedwin another of the same name now corrupted to martin near damerham might each be truly described as boundarytowns in wiltshire today merestone is the local idiom for a boundarystone mere is alike the name of a hundred and of a parish in wilts both near its borders the site of the present cathedral is at the junction of three ancient hundredsunderditch alderbury and cawdonthe southeast wall of the close being the boundary line which divides the cathedral precincts from cawdon not only from the fact that the site was given by the bishop may we infer that the poores were a wealthy family but his brother herbert who was his immediate predecessor in the see is described in the osmund register as dives et assiduus rich and painstaking and richard poore before his enthronement was a benefactor to the monastery of tarrant in dorsetshire his native village later we find he gave a large estate at laverstock to his new cathedral hence the old theory that his name was derived from poor or pauper as it appears in several old chronicles is untenable possibly like the irish poer or power it may be traced to the word puer used in a restricted sense to denote the sons of royal or noble families not yet in possession of their heritage a prince of wales in past times has been known as puer anglicanus the spanish infanta the prefix childe have all been cited in support of this theory it is said indeed that the childes trace their descent from the le poers and childeokeford and poorstock two villages in dorset are quoted in evidence2 illustration the cathedral from the south from a photograph by messrs poulton whatever the origin of his name there is little doubt that the bishop was wealthy and absolute certainty that he was a powerful and capable rulerthe whole story of his successful efforts to carry out his scheme proves this much were other testimony wanting even his choice of a site is justified by results although earlier accounts unanimously agree in saying it was little better than a swamp that such descriptions of the place were true is evident enough the subsidence of the tower piers show that their foundation was insecure and the curious feature of a continuous base to the piers of the nave prove also that provision was taken from the first to overcome this obstacle we have frequent records of floods to the extent at times of causing the daily service to be suspended owing to the water actually being within the building itself as late as 1763 there is an account of a specially high one thus interrupting the daily ritual the whole valley of the salisbury avon to its seamouth at christchurch about twentynine miles distant is still under water for months at a time during a wet winter of course the abundance of water has evoked the usual comparison with venice thomas fuller who for the sake of his usual sagacity may be forgiven an allusion so unfounded says this mindeth me of an epitaph made on mr francis hill a native of salisbury who died secretary to the english liege at veniceborn in the english venice thou didst die dear friend in the italian salisbury one of the reasons most frequently alleged for the abandonment of old sarum was its lack of water but if it was deemed unadvisable to acknowledge the political and administrative reasons which really decided the change it is just possible that the superfluity of water was found useful as a plausible explanation of the removal on hygienic grounds or it may even be that the whole story of the scarcity of water at old sarum was a later invention to excuse its unwelcome abundance in the new locality bishop douglas is credited with the saying salisbury is the sink of wiltshire plain the close is the sink of salisbury and the bishops palace the sink of the close certainly the site lacks the natural dignity of position such an edifice demands and which lincoln durham ely and many another english cathedral show was frequently deemed essential thomas fuller who occupied a stall at salisbury has written the most curious and cavilling eye can desire nothing in this edifice except an ascent seeing such as address themselves hither can hardly say with david i will go up to the house of the lord the temporary chapel of wood commenced on the monday after easter in 1219 must have been a modest structure since on the next trinity sunday the bishop celebrated mass and the same day consecrated a cemetery there in the ms by william de wanda precentor and afterwards dean of sarum preserved in the cathedral library we have a record of the very first ceremonies connected with the cathedral which being probably trustworthy in the main is so curiously interesting in itself that it deserves quoting freely from the version given by francis price clerk of the works to the cathedral and author of a very interesting monograph upon it published in the latter part of the last century we find that in the year ad 1220 on the day of st vitalis the martyr being the fourth of the calends of may which was the twentyeighth of april the foundations were laid by bishop richard poore on the day appointed for the purpose the bishop came with great devotion few earls or barons of the county but a great multitude of the common people coming in from all parts and when divine service had been performed and the holy spirit invoked the said bishop putting off his shoes went in procession with the clergy of the church to the place of foundation singing the litany then the litany being ended and a sermon first made to the people the bishop laid the first stone for our lord the pope honorius and the second for the lord stephen langton archbishop of canterbury and cardinal of the holy roman church at that time with our lord the king in the marches of wales then he added to the new fabric a third stone for himself william longespe earl of sarum who was then present laid the fourth stone and elaide3 vitri countess of sarum the wife of the said earl a woman truly pious and worthy because she was filled with the fear of the lord laid the fifth after her certain noblemen each of them added a stone then the dean the chantor the chancellor the archdeacons and canons of the church of sarum who were present did the same amidst the acclamations of multitudes of the people weeping for joy and contributing thereto their alms with a ready mind according to the ability which god had given them but in process of time the nobility being returned from wales several of them came thither and laid a stone binding themselves to some special contribution for the whole seven years following another account differing from the more generally accepted version just quoted says that pendulph the popes legate in 1216 laid the first five stones the first for the pope the second for the king the third for the earl of salisbury the fourth for the countess and the fifth for the bishop this statement is wrong in date for bishop poore was not translated to the see of sarum until the year 1217 in the charter of henry i the first stone is mentioned as having been laid by the king ie in his name on the 15th of august 1220 at a general chapter when the bishop was present it was provided that if any canon of the church failed paying what he had promised to the fabric for seven years that next after fifteen days from the term elapsed some one should be sent on the part of the bishop and chapter to raise what was due from the corn found on the prebend and so long as he should remain there for that purpose he should be maintained with all necessaries by the goods of the said prebend but if the prebend or any person failing in the payment of what was promised be in any other bishopric than sarum such canon should be denounced to that bishop by the letter of the bishop and chapter for his contumacy either to be suspended from entering the church or from celebration of divine service or excommunicated according as the chapter shall judge it in the year 1225 richard poore bishop of sarum finding the fabric of the new church was by gods alliance so far advanced that divine service might be conveniently performed therein he rejoiced exceedingly since he bestowed great pains and contributed greatly towards it thereupon he commanded william the dean to cite all the canons to be present on the day of s michael following at the joyful solemnity of their mother church that is to say at the first celebration of divine service therein according on the vigil of s michael which happened on a sunday the bishop came in the morning and consecrated three altars the first in the east part in honour of the holy and undivided trinity and all saints on which henceforth the mass of the blessed virgin was appointed to be said every day and the said bishop offered that day for the service of the said altar and for daily service of the blessed virgin two silver basons and two silver candlesticks which were bequeathed by the will of the noble lady gundria de warren to the church of sarum moreover the bishop gave out of his property to the clerks that were to officiate at the said mass thirty marks of silver a year until he settled so much in certain rents and likewise ten marks every year to maintain lamps round the said altar then he dedicated another altar in the north part of the church in honour of st peter the prince of the apostles and the rest of the apostles he also dedicated another altar in the south part thereof to st stephen and the rest of the martyrs at this dedication were present henry bishop of dublin stephen lord archbishop of canterbury we read further in the same chronicle that the bishops and their retinues were entertained for a week by bishop poore at his sole charge the next day the feast of ss michael and all angels the archbishop of canterbury preached to a large company including many english and foreign prelates otto the popes nuncio and others on the thursday following our lord the king and hubert de burgh the justice came to the church and the king there heard the mass of the glorious virgin and offered ten marks of silver and one piece of silk and he granted to the same place that every year there should be a fair the same day the justice made a vow that he would give a gold text set in the precious stones and the relics of divers saints in honour of the blessed virgin mary and the service of the new church afterwards the king went down with many of his nobles to the bishops palace and were entertained on the friday following hubert de burgh offered his texte after john gilt with gold and having precious stones and relics of divers saints on the nativity of our lord following the king and his justice hubert de burgh came to sarum on the day of the holy innocents and there the king offered one gold ring with a precious stone called a ruby one piece of silk and one gold cup of the weight of ten marks and when the mass was celebrated the king told the dean that he would have that stone which he had offered and the gold of the ring applied to adorn the text which the justice had before given and then the justice caused the text which he had given to be brought and offered with great devotion on the altar on the 10th of january 1226 william longespe earl of salisbury returned from gascoigne where he had resided twelve months with richard the kings brother for the defence of bordeaux after three months on the channel between the isle of rh and the coast of cornwall owing to the tempestuous weather that so long delayed his landing and the said earl came that day after nine oclock to sarum where he was received with great joy with a procession for the new fabric the scandalous account of his death as given by stow which occurred at the castle of old sarum on the 7th of march in the same year and the part played in the transaction by hubert de burgh cannot be told here beyond the fact that the justice was strongly suspected of poisoning him on the 8th of march at the same hour of the day on which he had been received with great joy he was brought to new sarum with many tears and lamentations and honourably buried in the new church of the blessed virgin matthew paris gravely records that at his funeral despite gusts of wind and rain the candles furnished a continual light the whole of the way of all secular figures connected with this cathedral his is perhaps the most prominent nor is his fame merely local he was active in public affairs during the reign of king john and one of the noticeable heroes in an expedition to the holy land in 1220 when at the battle of damietta matthew paris tells us he resisted the shock of the infidels like a wall he fought both in flanders and in france was at his kings side at runnymede and a witness to magna chartaa copy of which famous charter made probably for his special use is still preserved in the cathedral library in 1226 on the feast of the holy trinity which was then the 18th day of the calends of july the bodies of the three bishops jocelin roger and osmund the latter not yet canonized were brought from old sarum whether their tombs were also brought is not said nor is any mention made of herman who by popular report is credited with a monument in the cathedral a charter of henry iii dated 30th of january 1227 gives certain powers to make new roads and bridges to inclose the city of new saresbury to institute a fair from the vigil of the assumption of the blessed mary to the octave of the same feast etc etc this development of the city more especially by its roads and bridges is held to have been fatal to the prosperity of wilton which from that time ceased to progress and was overshadowed by the now rapidly increasing new sarum bishop poore was ably supported in his great undertaking by a group of notable men among whom were william de wanda the dean who threw his whole soul into the work and traversed the diocese of london to collect alms in its behalf besides leaving us most elaborate accounts of the various ceremonies and the precentor roger de sarum a man of some weight who soon after became bishop of bath and wells henry de bishopston a learned man and a scholar should also be remembered and if leland could be credited we should need to add another member to this group and find in robert hilcot of sarum the author of the philobiblon so generally attributed to richard de bury after bishop poore was translated to durham his three successors bishops robert bingham 12291246 william of york 12471256 and giles of bridport 12571262 continued the works of the new building with great energy in 1258 it was consecratedsome accounts say by bishop giles of bridport who covered the roof throughout with lead but more probably by boniface of savoy archbishop of canterbury henry iii and his queen were present at the consecration and as indulgences of a year and forty days were offered to all who should be present during the octave of the dedication vast crowds visited it it was not entirely completed according to a note in a book of statutes until 1266 and it has been said that with all our modern appliances we could hardly shorten the fortysix years it occupied the cost of the whole building according to ancient authority was about 40000 marks equal to 26666 13s 4d of the money of that day and probably equivalent roughly to half a million in our own time among many benefactors one lady alicia bruere who according to leland contributed the marble and stone for twelve years deserves to be mentioned the cloisters and chapter house were not commenced until the episcopate of bishop walter de la wyle 12631271 and possibly not completed until some ten years later from the will of robert de careville the treasurer in 1267 we find that there were seven altars in the church at this date he bequeathed seven pounds to provide fourteen silver phials each bearing a representation of three keys in order that each altar might have two the erection of the spire evidently not included in the original plan is often erroneously assigned to wyville 13361375 who certainly completed the wall of the close and enlarged the cloisters the king granted him a charter for this purpose and also gave him the stones of the old cathedral many of which with the norman work upon them may be seen plainly at the present time see p 22 it is interesting to note that not only is salisbury the most complete example of its period in this country but is also the first important building carried out entirely in the style we now know as early english henry iii is believed to have been so enthusiastic in his admiration of bishop poores new cathedral that he set about the rebuilding of westminster abbey which was commenced in 1245 and completed in 1269 as far as the east end of the choir the early english work at salisbury has a certain poverty of detail when compared with westminster and the angel choir of lincoln undoubtedly surpasses both yet the effect of salisbury has a character of its own and a purity in its ornament that is in itself a distinction the cathedral of amiens of exactly the same date covers 71000 square feet salisbury but 55000 the vault of amiens is 152 feet high salisbury only 85 but as fergusson observes in his handbook of architecture the fair mode of comparison is to ask whether the cathedral of amiens is finer than salisbury would be if the latter were at least twice as large as it is there has long been a tradition that elias de dereham was the architect of this stately pile and the information gathered together by the rev ja bennet in a paper read before the british archological association at salisbury on august 5th 1887 certainly does much to strengthen the belief from this account and other sources we find that elias de derham is first mentioned in the rot chartarum ap 6 6 john 1208 where he is described as one of the kings clerks and rector of meauton in 1206 he appears to have been a royal official in 1209 he is reported to have been the architect for the repairs of king johns palace at westminster in 1212 he attached himself to the opposite party but was taken again into the kings favour in the following year we have specially interesting notice of his work in 1220 when he was engaged upon the shrine of st thomas at canterbury matthew paris in his account of the translation of st thomas distinctly states that the shrine was the work of that incomparable officer walter de colchester sacrist of st albans assisted by elias de dereham canon of salisbury leland mentions in an extract from an old martyrologie of salisbury that he was rectoror directorof the new church for twentyfive years from the beginning whether he means architect or clerk of the works is not so clear his name as one of the canons of the cathedral occurs eleven times in the osmund register at salisbury there are also references to him in the book of evidences liber evidentiarum among the bishops muniments as the builder of the original aula plumbealedenhalla famous old house in the close the document is entitled scriptura de domibus de ledenhall per eliam de dereham sumptuose constructis a deed concerning the house called ledenhall built at great expense by elias de dereham this residence house remained six centuries after in the gift of the bishop of sarum during the year in which he accompanied bishop poore in his translation to durham and from 1230 to 1238 he was employed upon some architectural work connected with durham cathedral which when bishop poore accepted it was a stately norman fane with an apsidal choir he removed this east end and remodelled it in the early english manner the chapel of the nine altars as this portion is called is remarkably similar in its details to much of the work at salisbury it is curious that two southern churches so near as salisbury and christchurch priory should be found influencing or influenced by the great northern cathedral but the likeness between flambards norman work at christchurch and the same bishops work at durham is as strongly marked as the early english of bishop poore at both the churches in which he was enthroned that elias de dereham is responsible for much of the work of both cathedrals is also a fair assumption curiously enough his name hitherto hastily assumed to be equivalent to elias of durham has probably no connection with that city whether however his patronym should be traced to the norfolk dereham or the gloucester dyrham it is impossible to say with any certainty on somewhat insufficient grounds it has been hazarded that his portrait may be found in a figure on the east side of the staircase buttress of what was formerly the great entrance to wells cathedral owing to the fact that the original design of the building was fully carried out with the addition of a tower and spire its architectural history ceases just where most others begin their chequered career at the time of the reformation it suffered but little except in the wholesale destruction of its stained glass dr pope in his life of bishop ward says that even during the civil war when it was abandoned workmen were engaged to keep it in repair who when questioned as to the authority by which they worked said those who employd us will pay us trouble not your selves to inquire who they are whoever they are they do not desire to have their names known we find as evidence of the secret influence exerted in its behalf that when one of wallers officers sent up to the parliament certain plate and a pulpit cloth from salisbury cathedral he was ordered to restore them as it was considered that he had overstepped his commission all that was retained being certain copes hangings and a picture of the virgin at the restoration bishop ward after a great thunderstorm in 1668 when fears were entertained for the safety of the spire called in sir christopher wren who after examining the tower expressed his belief that a spire was not contemplated by its builders that out of fear to overburden the four piers of the tower its inside was carried for 40 feet above the nave with a slender hollow work of pillars and arches nor hath it any buttresses the spire itself is but 9 inches thick though the height be above 150 feet this work of pillars and arches led him to conclude that the architect laid his first floor of timber 40 feet higher than the vault beneath dr walter pope in his life of bishop seth ward 1697 describes the restorations accomplished by this excellent prelate there being therefore not much to be done as to reparation he employd himself in the decoration of the cathedral first at his proper charges paving the cloyster i mean that side of it which leads out of his garden into the church at his exhortation and more than proportinable sic expence the pavement of the church was mended where it was faulty and the whole quire laid with white and black squares of marble the bishops deans and all the prebendaries stalls made new magnificent and the whole church was kept so clean that anyone who had occasion for dust to throw on the superscription of a letter he would have a hard task to find it there his next care was to repair i might almost say rebuild his palace which was much ruined the hall being pulled down the greater part of the house converted to an inn what remained of the palace was divided into small tenements and let out to poor handicraftmen this dilapidation was the work of one van ling a dutchman by trade a taylor who bought it of parliament when bishops lands were exposed to sale in the minutes of the chapter for august 26th 1789 we find instruction given to wyatt to make new canopies to the stalls to build a new pulpit and bishops throne to put new iron rails to the communion with coping thereon and set new blue stone steps to receive the same to put two wainscot screens across the aisles to lay blue stone paving in the lady chapel in squares to be cut out of the old gravestones and enrich the side walls according to the drawings to clean and colour the church from the east end of the transept and make the screen to the western side of the organ they also ordered the beam in the choir to be removed the north and south porches to be taken down the south door near the vergers house stopped up and another opened near the chapter vestry to open out the chapel in the great north and south transepts and to convert the northeast transept into a morning chapel to remove certain monuments in consequence of alterations in st marys chapel to take down the beauchamp hungerford chapels on the plea that they were in a state as to greatly exceed any ordinary or possible means of repair these formal instructions were not merely obeyed but exceeded and the demolitions of that time confront the student of the building in all his researches of late years many minor alterations have been carried out with a view to restore monuments to their original site and as far as possible to obliterate wyatts damage but the two superb chantries the bell tower the painted glass and many other important features are hopelessly effaced and the cathedral spared by its avowed foes has met with its greatest disaster from the hands of former guardians for the last thirty years the work of restoration has been gradually carried on until its recent completion an arrangement was made in 1862 by which the ecclesiastical commissioners permitted the dean and chapter to spend 10000 on the building as part of a payment in lieu of transfer of their property sir g gilbert scott had control of the restoration owing to the necessary work proving far more costly than the sum allowed was able to effect a public meeting was held subscriptions were started and ultimately sufficient money raised to repair thoroughly the exterior of the building the tower and spire were strengthened by an ingenious system of iron ties planned by mr shields the wellknown engineer the west front was restored and more than sixty statues placed in its vacant niches in the interior the lady chapel was restored and its floor laid with encaustic tiles from the designs of ancient examples in various parts of the cathedral the walls were cleaned and the paintings of the roof reproduced by messrs clayton and bell the choir was restored in memory of bishop hamilton and the old choir stalls cleared the organscreen built by wyatt out of fragments of the hungerford and beauchamp chapels was removed throughout the building the purbeck marble shafts have been most carefully preserved and repolished besides this much decorative work of various sorts including some excellent examples of modern stained glass and metal work has been added from time to time at present the interior has less obvious evidence of age than any other english building of its date but for this the modern restorer is not entirely responsible as wyatt rendered much alteration needful and the design of the work has as we have remarked elsewhere a curiously modern quality in its finish and symmetry which is apt to mislead a casual observer footnotes 1 the headpiece is from an engraving in walpooles british traveller 2 a paper on this subject was printed in the wiltshire archological mag no lvi 3 so misspelt in the text quoted the cathedralexterior salisbury stands alone among english cathedrals for unity of design to own its possession of this quality which is undoubtedly both the earliest and the most mature impression the cathedral imparts is by no means equivalent to unqualified praise there are buildings of equal and less importance whence illustrations might be taken for a complete history of every period of gothic architecture here the examples would be limited not only to one style but if we except the upper stories of the tower and its spire the cloisters and a few minor additions to a very restricted use of early english as it was practised from ad 1220 to 1258 another uncommon feature not so apparent at first sight but yet almost if not quite as rare is that the present building was erected on a virgin site it is hard to find a medival church of any importance in england that is not only upon the selfsame site but more often in part upon the actual foundation of an earlier edifice consistency is the especial character of salisbury and now owing to wyatts iconoclastic destruction of the two later chapels at its east end we have in salisbury the most typical english cathedral which is also our most complete example of early english that this artistic unity is as interesting as a design subsequently modified by other influences may be an open question there are those who think salisbury faultily faultless icily regular splendidly null yet they would hardly dare to continue the quotation and say it was dead perfection no more even at a time when medival art was not generally appreciated in england this cathedral won admiration from chance visitors such as evelyn who saw it in july 1654 and pronounced it the completest gothic work in europe pepys who also left his impressions of it says the minster most admirable as big i think and handsomer than westminster and a most large close about it and offices for the officers thereof and a fine palace for the bishop in later times motley the historian thought it too neat henry james calls it a blonde beauty among churches and even hints that it is a little banal another american critic mrs van rensselaer in a sympathetic study of the cathedral which appeared in the century magazine says if we think it feeble it will be because we cannot see strength where it has been brought to perfect poise and ease if our verdict is banal it will be because we cannot tell the commonplace from the simply and exactly right or we do not know how rare the latter isbecause we long for eccentricity as a proof of personality and need what the french call emphase to impress us there is no overemphasis about salisbury neither in its effect as a whole nor in any of its parts neither in its design nor in its treatment but just in this fact lies its greatest merit and just by reason of this fact joined to its mighty size and its exceptional unity it is intensely individual personal distinct from all other churches in the world dean stanley in comparing it with westminster abbey hardly overpraised it in saying salisbury is allglorious without westminster is allglorious within canon venables considers it as an architectural composition more especially as seen from the outside the most perfectly designed building in the world elsewhere he speaks of it as presenting none of those architectural problems so baffling and perplexing at canterbury lichfield or lincoln its appearance from a distance has been the theme of poets and a favourite subject for artists constable especially delighted to paint it among several of his different versions of the theme the view from the meadows with the rainbow made popular by lucas mezzotint is perhaps the best known studying the building more closely one feels it is not accident that gives to it its peculiar charm but prearranged design the idea of one conception carried to its logical completion this striking unity despite the afterthought of the spire certainly helps to impart an air of modernity to the building that is lacking in far less ancient work for oddly enough it is often the decaying features of the latest decorated style that impress the vulgar by their apparent age the extreme care in the masonry has imparted a machinelike finish as professor willis wrote the regularity of the size of the stones is astonishing as soon as they had finished one part they copied it exactly in the next even though the additional expense was considerable the masonry runs in even bands and you may follow it from the south transept eastward round to the north transept after which they have not taken such great pains in their regularity it is almost impossible to distinguish where they could have left off for it is hardly to be supposed they could have gone on with all at the same time if at first sight this regular and symmetrical detail offers a suspicion of mere mechanism yet it is no less evident that after longer study the charms of this exquisite structure tell with a lasting power too subtle to extort admiration at first it bewitches a student of architecture who notes the scholarly reticence of its detail the masterly way in which as a rule the construction is legitimately ornamented and the decoration made an integral part of the whole design the tower with its famous spire needs no apologist to justify its claim to be considered the most beautiful not merely in england but in europe from the time leland navely wrote the tower of stone and the high pyramis of stone on it is a noble and memorable peace of work every critic of the cathedral praises the tower unreservedly although defoe was anxious to improve it for he said the beauty of it is hurt by a thing easily to be remedied which is this the glass in the several windows being very old has contracted such a rust that it is scarcely to be distinguished from the stone walls consequently it appears as if there were no lights at all in the tower but only recesses in the stone whereas could the windows be glazed with squares and kept clean which might be done they would be plainly visible at a distance and not only so but from the adjacent hills you would see the light quite through the tower which would have a very fine effect it is curious to remember that perfectly as it accords with the rest of the pile so that it seems the very central motive of the whole scheme yet it is really an addition like the touch of genius which by one word changes a good poem to a flawless lyric so the creator of this crown to an already beautiful building by his final touch seems to have imparted additional beauty to that which already existed the first idea was doubtless to add a lantern after the style of ely or at most a wooden spire that the lower part of the tower is part of the original design and intended to be open to the church is proved by the presence of a series of detached purbeck marble columns in the style of the rest of the internal masonry which hidden by the groining or halfconcealed by later masonry were obviously meant to be part of the decoration of the interior but again the original plan of the tower made no provision for the huge weight of a stone spire indeed it is quite doubtful if in its first state it was able to support itself for curiously designed abutments are built in the triforium and clerestory of the nave choir or transepts on each of its four sides the stonework of these is early english which if slightly later than the first story of the tower is yet considerably earlier than its two upper stories notwithstanding the faulty construction that needed additional work so soon after it was erected about fifty years later a daring architect superimposed two stories and added the lofty spire which still stands despite an early settlement which deflected it 23 inches out of the perpendicular but its stability can hardly be reckoned a tribute to the judgment of the architect for many times since complex arrangements of iron bands and ties have been added to ward off such a disaster as that which lost chichester its spire in 1861 and has caused many others to be rebuilt from the very foundations by a report of sir christopher wren made in the time of bishop seth ward two hundred years ago it is evident that in his time the deflection was not increasing nor do quite recent observations show any reason for serious anxiety this haunting fear however has led to curiously precise experiments for ascertaining the state of the spire francis price at the end of the last century describes many of these especially one carried out in the presence of the bishop on july 18th 1717 he also illustrates an elaborate system of additional bands and ties in his time during the restorations that were begun in 1863 a further arrangement of iron bands planned by mr shields the engineer was introduced into the lantern story of the tower illustration salisbury cathedral and bell tower from an old engraving parker in his glossary believes the date of the spire to be about 1300 other authorities fix it thirty years later certain deeds in the book of evidences preserved among the cathedral muniments show that in 1326 edward iii granted a license for surrounding the close with a wall and in 1331 authorized the bishop and canons to use the stones of the church of old sarum for that purpose but against the theory that the material thus obtained was used in the tower also there is the patent fact that while on many stones in the wall there are traces of norman mouldings and other evidence of former use neither in the tower nor spire do the stones betray any such origin modern antiquaries are wellnigh agreed upon the earlier dates for in the capitular register begun in 1329 there is no mention of the spire which could hardly have escaped record had so important a work been then in progress in support of this theory it is urged that from 1258 to 1297 the deans were men who took great interest in the fabric and are entered in its calendar of benefactors three of these became successively bishops of salisbury but the deans who were appointed after 1297 were chiefly foreigners several being cardinals and relatives of the pope whose duties elsewhere would have left them little but a purely temporal interest in the building one of them peter of savoy was in conflict with his bishop and evaded an episcopal admonition ordering him to residence bishop godwin in his catalogue of bishops notes that in 1258 the cathedral was rehallowed by boniface archbishop of canterbury and this fact is the basis of most of the argument for the earlier date of the spire the completion of which according to some could alone have justified the ceremony remembering that winchester had lost its central tower which fell in 1107 we can understand the reasons which induced the original architect to distrust a spire and to adopt a lantern in its place if however timidity delayed it at first when it was undertaken its builder left it not only the most lofty in england then and since but in actual effect the most lofty in the world this is claimed in spite of its 404 feet being exceeded by amiens 422 feet and strasburg 488 feet and although it might appear special pleading to urge such a theory against contradictory facts yet since at amiens the nave roof is 208 feet high against the 115 feet of salisbury it is obvious that the apparent height of the latter exceeds its french rival at strasburg the excess of elaboration in the ornament is detrimental to the effect of height and the same may be said of antwerp or mechlin where the whole effect is not so much that of a spire as of an elaborately fretted finial insubstantial if exquisite in itself but merely an added ornament not appearing part of the solid structure despite the somewhat ornate details of the upper stories and spire they accord well with the rest of the building and although typical early decorated of the time of edward iii fail to clash with the more severe early english work these two stories have elaborately canopied arcades running round them the windows being pierced through two of the arches on each faade and not emphasized by any special treatment above each story is a traceried parapet of lozenge decoration the same design being repeated in the two bands that encircle the spire itself at each of the four angles of the tower is an octagonal turret with crocketed spire amid a coronet of decorated finials the great octagonal spire grows naturally with no abrupt revelation of its change of plan the whole cresting of the tower and the perfectly natural way in which its lines continue easily into the graceful spire itself are triumphs of successful design the silhouette of the mass against the sky so precisely reaches the ideal effect that it is difficult to restrain oneself to sober criticism in describing it yet the result is achieved so naturally that until we compare it with others especially with modern ones we hardly do justice to the subtle beauty that gives it a right to the supremacy it has won the timber framework erected as a scaffold during the progress of the building still remains inside the spire and helps to impart strength to it those curious in such matters will find a mass of information and many plans and drawings of its internal construction in francis prices antiquities of salisbury 1774 in 1762 during the progress of some repairs to the capstone and the addition of a new copper vane the workmen discovered a wooden box and inside it a round leaden one 5 inches in diameter and 2 inches deep which contained a piece of woven fabric4 this was conjectured to be a relic of the virgin mary the patron saint of the church which had been deposited there to guard the lofty spire from danger by lightning or tempest when tested on the 600th anniversary of the building the spire showed it is said no further deflection from that registered two centuries earlier consequently the settlement in the two western piers being so long at a standstill and the repeated additions of metal work to strengthen the spire being apparently entirely successful there seemed no reason to doubt but that in the natural course of events it would remain for many centuries a landmark to its neighbourhood and one of the greatest triumphs of english medival workmanship5 richard de farley a wiltshire man is supposed to have been the architect of the spire that his artistic instinct was right is evident today but his engineering foresight seems less certain as in all probability the settlement began almost immediately after the erection indeed it is said that the efforts to obtain the canonization of osmund were started in 1387 to increase the popularity of the cathedral as a place of pilgrimage and thereby to augment its revenue so that funds might be forthcoming for the additional work needed to support the tower frequent references to miracles at his shrine show that the saint was popularly adored long before his canonization in 1456 a local superstition says the tower was builded on woolpacks according to plinys account the temple of diana of ephesus was made firm with coats or fleeces of wool but it is inconceivable that bags of wool were employed in either case for the foundation at rouen in normandy a similar legend refers to butter as the foundation of one of the western towers which tradition absurd though it be supplies the idea of a butter tax which in turn suggests a wool tax that in such a district as this would have been naturally a profitable source of revenue probably because of the early trouble with the foundation of the great tower there was from the first no intention of making it a belfry even before the spire was decided upon the oscillation of a mass of swaying bells was obviously too dangerous to be seriously considered a special campanile as at chichester was therefore built at the northwest corner of the close its style was evidently similar to that of the cloisters and the chapter house multangular in form an early historian calls it but the engravings still existing show it to have been a somewhat ordinary specimen of early english design its special feature was a single central pillar of purbeck marble that supported the weight of the bells and belfry the spire was doubtless of wood and apparently the upper lanternlike tower also6 although its destruction is not ordered in the official document wherein the chapter gave wyatt authority to do so much mischief on some pretext probably his craze for what he called vistas it was demolished in the terrible destruction of 1789 opening up a view of the cathedral that was entirely unnecessary and wilfully destroying a feature of the close that could ill be spared the custom of climbing the spire during the whitsun fair to which francis price in a nave description attributes much damage to the leadwork of the roofs has only ceased in recent times some sixty or seventy years ago arnold a watchmaker wound up his watch while leaning actually against the vane when a lad during a royal visit stood on his head on the capstone george iii refused to reward him saying that he was bound to provide for the lives of his people on june 26th 1741 the timber braces of the spire were found to be on fire according to francis price there was about ten oclock the night before in a very great storm a particular flash of lightning observed by many of the inhabitants to strike against the tower with a sort of smacking noise and then to have been lost it may well be called dreadful since had it continued half an hour longer all the assistance on earth could not have prevented the total destruction of the pile the west front of the cathedral was beyond doubt the last portion of the original design to be carried out for among its details the ballflower a typical feature of the decorated style frequently occurs the governing idea of its faade is indefensible not merely because in common with wells lincoln and other churches it does not emphasize the construction of the nave and aisles and hides them by a screen but because the screen itself poses as an integral part of the building even considered solely as an architectural composition without regard to the building it professes to decorate rather than hide it is hardly good the two western towers it unites are in themselves not sufficiently important in comparison with the rest of the edifice in fact they are little more than finials to the screen in many similar structures the unity of effect gained at the expense of theoretical consistency justifies the departure here it is merely a huge surface adapted to display a great number of statues rich as it appears now that its long empty niches are again repeopled it is of no remarkable excellence either in mass or in detail its worst fault however is that unlike exeter it does not content itself by frankly assuming to be nothing more than a screen but at first sight appears to be the legitimate finish of the nave and aisles a recent critic defending the faade in spite of its architectural isolation from the building in its rear points out that the chief objection to the west front is that it is wanting in that repose and refinement of detail which characterize the rest of the building and that its design is entirely out of keeping therewith and also complains that the ragged outline at the angles produced by the high relief and rather clumsy sections of the decorative detail has a very bad effect it has been suggested that as from the position of the site there was never a chance of the building being seen from a distanceowing to the level country around it the projection of the transepts and the group of the whole pile could never tell out as they would had it been on a hill therefore the form chosen was deliberately adopted to give a factitious importance to the west front on its own merits the continental builders with much more lofty nave and aisles and with their habit of making the west door the principal entrance were able by enriching its portal and decorating the natural divisions of the building to attain a stately form that honestly fulfilled its purpose here the magnificence is secured by masking the low aisles of the nave with a wall that is a mere theatrical adjunct its simulated windows and its stringcourses marking stories that do not exist apart from theoretical criticism it is not quite admirable in itself the three doorways are hardly of sufficient importance the central window is somewhat larger than it should be to accord with the scale of the whole faade while the apparently built up windows above the genuine windows of the nave aisles whose roofs have their apex about on a level with the sills of the large central lancets are as much frauds as any of those sham windows in symmetrical renaissance work which so excite the ire of ardent champions of gothic purity it consists of five bays of which the lateral ones are square turrets covered with arcades and terminated by spires the lower story of the central bay is composed of three pedimented porches deeply recessed each with a niche in its gable above these is a story of canopied trefoiled arches with quatrefoil lozenges in their centres over this arcade is the large west window a triplet of lancets with slender shafts and chevron ornament above this again is a band of quatrefoils at the foot of the gable which is filled with double couplets of lancets with quatrefoils above their heads and in the upper spandrils is a quatrefoiled aureole the buttresses flanking this central bay have similar arcading continued around them the side bays each have a triple porch a twolighted window with a quatrefoil in the head with a window of the same form above it and higher still the arcading continued from the towers illustration portals of the west front from a photograph by sb bolas and co in 1863 the hundred and odd niches designed to contain statues were either despoiled or had never been occupied with the exception of eight which held figures mutilated beyond certain recognition mr cockerell conjectured that two on the buttress of the south tower represented st peter and st john the baptist on that to the north st paul and st john the evangelist while a figure facing north on the same buttress he believed to represent stephen langton archbishop of canterbury other figures are supposed to commemorate bishop poore william longespe 1st earl of salisbury st stephen and bishop giles de bridport a sketch by hollar dating from the beginning of the seventeenth century shows the niches completely filled and hatcher claims from this evidence that we are warranted in assuming that the figures were destroyed by ludlows troopers when he garrisoned the belfry but such an assumption requires many facts to support it which are not forthcoming we have no proof that hollars sketch was intended to be a literal transcript of what he saw it is quite possible that for the sake of effect he preferred to complete the design according to the supposed intention of its builders we are not certain that the niches were all filled originally it is quite possible that some were purposely left vacant for future benefactors we know also that during the civil war the whole fabric of the cathedral escaped serious injuries the hyde family powerful at that time had friends on both sides and we find record of certain articles sent up to parliament by one of wallers officers were ordered to be restored on the other hand the visitation of cathedrals ordered and undertaken during the reign of edward vi had especial instructions to remove images in addition to these objections to attributing the destruction of the figures to the ludlow soldiers there is also to be considered the natural decay of carving exposed to the open air which might reasonably account for the dilapidation of a certain number however whether wantonly destroyed or not it is certain that the present figures must be all regarded as modern since the eight actually left have been with the exception of st john the baptist very much restored redfern the wellknown sculptor is responsible for the present statues if not possessing the vigour of the old work which from fragments in other parts of the building was certainly superior to these modern additions yet they are creditable in design and scholarly in treatment the arrangement is probably in harmony with the original scheme it represents the orders of terrestrial and celestial beings mentioned in the four verses of the hymn te deum laudamus in the legend of christian art by the rev ht armfield minor canon of salisbury published in 1869 the symbolism and history of the whole design is given at great length here it must suffice to quote a few of the more salient points the statues are arranged in five horizontal lines from north to south exclusive of the figure in the vesica the oval above in the principal niches of the top row is a tier of angels below this a tier of old testament patriarchs and prophets then a tier of doctors virgins and martyrs and lowest of all a tier of worthies including princes martyrs bishops and founders connected with the diocese and the cathedral the vesica contains a figure of our lord seated known technically as a majesty in the tier of angels below noting them from left to right are the celestial hierarchies seraphim cherubim and thrones dominions powers and authorities principalities archangels angels the old testament prophets are david with the harp moses with the tables of the law abraham with the knife noah with the ark samuel with a sceptre and solomon with a church the eight vacant niches should contain figures of isaiah ezekiel elijah melchizedek enoch job daniel and jeremiah the tier with the apostles observes this order on the northern turret st jude with a halberd st simon zelotes with a saw st andrew with the cross that bears his name st thomas with a builders square on the north buttress st peter with the keys on the southern buttress st paul with a sword both these are restorations of ancient figures on the southern turret st james the less with a club st james the greater with a pilgrims staff st bartholomew with the knife of his martyrdom and st matthias with a lance illustration details of main west portal from a drawing by hp clifford the tier of the doctors virgins and martyrs keeping to the same order shows st ambrose bishop of milan with a scourge in his right hand and a bishops staff in his left st jerome in a cardinals hat with a church in his right hand and a bible in his left st gregory in papal tiara the legendary club on his shield his pastoral staff doubly crossed and a book typical of his writings on his left on the smaller north buttress near the turret is a restored figure removed from its original place which represents st augustine wearing a bishops mitre and holding his hand as in the act of benediction on the greater north buttress is the figure of st mary the virgin to whom the church is dedicated this figure is also restored in the eleven niches over the central door are with their various symbols st barbara st catherine st roche st nicholas st george of england st christopher st sebastian st cosmo st damian st margaret and st ursula on the greater south buttress is st john the baptist and on the lesser an old figure unrestored supposed to represent st bridget on the southern turret are st mary st agatha st agnes and st cecilia each wearing the martyrs crown the tier of worthies comprises bishops giles de bridport and richard poore and king henry iii as a founder bishop odo with a wafer in his hand commemorating the legend of his miraculous proof of the transubstantiation of the blessed sacrament st osmund bishop brithwold st alban st alphege st edmund and st thomas of canterbury another figure on the north side of the northwest turret for some time assumed to be st christopher is now assigned to st birinus or possibly with more truth to st nicholas who had an altar dedicated to him probably just at the back of this spot on the apex of the west front is an ancient carving of a bird on a scroll which has puzzled many specialists mr armfield believes it to be intended for a dove the emblem of the holy spirit in a scroll to typify the word and thus with the majesty near to be a representation of the three persons of the trinity in a mode in accordance with english taste the north porch is a massive structure of two stories the upper now used as the deans muniment room has like a similar example at christchurch hants no certain indication of its original use whether it was a dwelling for sacristans a school or a library was doubtful but later opinion thinks it was unquestionably used by the sacristans since it is said that the subtreasurer of sarum who was usually one of the vicars choral pledged himself to see that the clerks told off for given duties slept in the church in their accustomed places and for himself he promised that unless lawfully excused he would sleep each night in the treasury against this theory however it might be urged that the muniment room at the angle of the southeast transept is identified as the ancient treasury this porch sometimes called the galilee was possibly a place where penitents met and from which they were expelled from the church on ashwednesday until maundy thursday externally although of exquisite proportions it has no very important details yet its pinnacles deserve notice but the interior is very beautiful the walls have sunk panelling a base arcade of foliated arches and in the upper tier large foliated circles with subarches each comprising two trefoiled arches with quatrefoil heads mr ge street who thoroughly appreciated this particular period of english gothic as his work at the new law courts proves just before his death restored this part of the cathedral admirably another porch formerly the entrance to the north transept removed by wyatt for the most trivial reason is now in the grounds of the college which occupies the site of the secular buildings belonging to the church of st edmund founded in 1268 the exterior of the nave is simple but with excellently disposed features the triple lancets of the clerestory occur in pairs between flying buttresses with tall finials below these in the aisles are two twolight windows divided by lesser buttresses terminating in gables the fronts of the main transepts show four stories the two lower being divided into three bays by buttresses and flanked by pinnacled buttresses at each side the doors that had a ritual use have long since been walled up both on the north and south sides a triplet window is in the lower stage threelight windows with quatrefoil heads occupying the second while the third has an arcade of six lancets below a floriated circle flanked by sunk panels and quatrefoils the windows in the gable consist of two lesser windows twolight with quatrefoil heads beneath a large octofoil the whole grouped with blank panels at the side beneath a cinquefoil moulding the aisle has flying buttresses reaching to the clerestory and good anglepinnacles the choir transept has no dividing buttresses and a different grouping of windows in the lower stage is a triple lancet there is a group of three twolight windows in the story above and in the upper one an arcade of four lancets grouped under a comprising arch with a quatrefoil in the head the gable is lighted by a triplet window flanked with blind lancets and terminates in a cross illustration one bay of the nave exterior north side the transepts differ slightly in detail on their north and south fronts it has also been pointed out that while in the one transept the lancet form rules in the other the free employment of the circle and the quatrefoil almost foreshadows the early decorated style the windows of both are so singularly pure in design and beautiful in proportion that they have often been selected as typical examples of the best work in their style the east front of the choir is flanked with square pinnacled buttresses above the lady chapel is an arcade with five members pierced with three windows and in the gable a similar arrangement of five lancets three being windows arranged in harmony with the triangular space it fills the flying buttresses on the south side were added by bishop beauchamp in 145058 the east front of the lady chapel is divided by buttresses into three bays and has crocketed gables to each the aisles show a lancet in the lower story with a blind couplet beneath a quatrefoil in the gable the central compartment has a triplet in each story the south side corresponds in character to the north but is partly hidden by the chapter house the

many consecration crosses of beautiful design are to be found on the building marking the spots touched by the oil of unction at the dedication of the edifice see initial letter page 1 the cathedral is built of freestone from the chilmark quarries twelve miles distant with a lavish use of purbeck marble in its interior the grey colour of the leaden roofs and the pure unstained tone of its walls impart a quasimodern aspect to it which no matter how little justified by facts always presents salisbury to ones mind as a late addition to the superb array of english churches yet considering that as we see it from the close no portion except possibly the spire later than the twelfth century comes into the picture there is no other cathedral that so little justifies such an impression and one cannot escape a return to the first reason advanced namely that its singular unity has given it an aspect of perpetual youth illustration the choir screen from a photograph by carl norman and co footnotes 4 this was carefully replaced in its original position inclosed in a copper cylinder 5 recently however anxiety has been again aroused and the spire has been once more strengthened 6 this lantern story was removed in 1757 by order of the dean and chapter the interior of the cathedral and chapter house the ground plan of salisbury is a wellproportioned double cross with the arms of the choir transepts more important than usual indeed the exquisitely proportioned and balanced symmetry of every portion as of the whole which almost places salisbury among classic buildings is as marked in its ground plan as in any part of the building as an appreciative student of the building has written this is the great beauty of salisbury the composition of its mighty body as a whole so finely proportioned and arranged are its square masses of different heights and sizes so splendid are the broad effects of light and shadow they produce so appropriate is the slant of the roof lines and so nicely placed and gracefully shaped are the simple windows that for once we can give no thought of regret either to the circling apses of continental lands or the rich traceries and surface carvings and figuressculptures of later generations the whole effect is in the strictest sense architectural few large buildings teach so clearly the great lesson that beauty in a building depends first of all upon composition not decoration upon masses not details upon the use and shaping not the ornamentation of features and very few show half so plainly that medival architects could realize this fact we are too apt to think that gothic art cannot be individual without being eccentric or interesting without being heterogeneous but salisbury is both grand and lovely and yet it is quiet rational and all of a piece clear and smooth and refined to the point of utmost purity no building in the world is more logical more lucid in expression more restful to the mind and eye7 illustration the nave looking west from a photograph by messrs poulton the number of its pillars windows and doorways is said to equal the hours days and months of the year hence the local rhyme attributed on the authority of godwin to a certain daniel rogers as many days as in one year there be so many windows in this church we see as many marble pillars here appear as there are hours throughout the fleeting year as many gates as moons one year does view strange tale to tell yet not more strange than true fuller speaking of these by a curious lapse falls into the vulgar error of believing purbeck marble to be an artificial product melted and poured into moulds says the cathedral is paramount of its kind wherein the doors and chapels equal the months the windows the days the pillars and pillarets of fusile marble an ancient art now shrewdly suspected to be lost the hours of the year so that all europe affords not such an almanac of architecture once walking in this church whereof then i was prebendary i met a countryman wondering at the structure thereof i once said he to me admired that there could be a church that should have so many pillars as there be hours in the year and now i admire more that there should be so many hours in the year as i see pillars in this church the navethe first glimpse as we enter by the west door is undoubtedly impressive notwithstanding the absence of colour and the lack of mystery for which the complete vista obtained at such a cruel cost by wyatt is insufficient compensation the whole scheme of decoration in its pristine state must have been extremely beautiful if you can imagine it with the walls and piers exhibiting strong contrasts of colour in the dark and polished purbeck shafts and the lighter freestones the arches picked out with colours the groining elaborately decorated and the whole lighted by brilliantly painted windows with a preponderance of dark blue and ruby together with a flood of white light showing through the lancet of the centre we may be allowed a doubt whether tintern or york could have compared with it add to this picture the movable hangings and decorations of its many altars and we cannot honestly attribute the coldness of the present effect to any fault in the original design elsewhere this austerity of monochrome is modified to a great extent by the variety anachronisms though they be of later architectural insertions salisbury through the very purity of its design especially suffers from its translation from chromatic harmony to monotone for although possibly the architectural details are thereby rendered more apparent yet the exaggeration of what is after all but the skeleton of the building destroys the effect of the whole as its architect imagined it clustered columns of unpolished purbeck marble on a quatrefoil plan with smaller detached shafts of lustrous marble at the cardinal points support on either side the ten great arches of the first story of the nave these polished shafts are generally in two pieces with a brass ring covering the joint francis price discusses at great length this constant feature of the whole building and points out that although most of the shafts were probably not in place until after the masonry was fairly set yet frequently subsequent settlement has crushed them although in the nave the main piers in small blocks laid according to the natural bed of the stone are still perfectly sound the large arches are gracefully moulded with masses of carved foliage at the intersections illustration the navesouth side in the nave of this cathedral we have a very uncommon feature in the connected base of the main columns which was doubtless introduced to aid in distributing the weight over a larger surface and so to overcome the treacherous character of the foundation the triforium which from its style naturally suggests comparison with westminster and the angel choir of lincoln is simple but extremely beautiful each of its rather flatpointed arches equalling in span that of the main arch below is subdivided into pairs which again each inclose two smaller ones these are decorated with trefoils and quatrefoils alternately with cinquefoils and octofoils immediately above the carving at the intersection of the main arches is a corbelled head from which rises a triple vaultingshaft with foliated capitals on a line with the base of the clerestory this upper story has in each bay of the vaulting simple lancet windows grouped in threes the arches here as in almost every instance throughout the building are supported by purbeck marble shafts the nave aisles are lighted by double lancetwindows in each bay the most noticeable feature of these aisles is the stone bench which extends the whole length of the building on both the north and south sides illustration north aisle the west wall is panelled in three main arches with an upper story reaching to the height of the triforium base and containing an arcade of four arches subdivided each into two smaller trefoiled ones with cinquefoil heads above these is the triplet lancet of the great west window the effect of the nave looking west is clearly shown in the photograph here reproduced of the chapels and altars once existing we have records in various documents in the sarum processional twelve altars are mentioned dedicated respectively to ss andrew nicholas john the baptist margaret mary magdalene laurence michael martin catherine edward edmund the king and edmund archbishop of canterbury the sites of these so far as they can be traced appears to have been st catherine and st martin in the north choir transept st nicholas and st mary magdalene in the south and st edmund of canterbury and st margaret respectively in the north and south great transepts throughout the nave it is evident that the first plans were rigidly obeyed although the severity of the early years of the style had become much modified before the work was finished the absence of ornate decoration the simplicity of the mouldings and the platetracery of the triforium all indicate the first period of early english illustration nave transept the dimensions of the nave are 229 feet 6 inches long 82 feet wide and 81 feet high the aisles are 17 feet 6 inches wide and 39 feet 9 inches high the nave transepts are in three stories with eastern aisles divided into three bays the screens inclosing chapels in these were demolished by wyatt above the entrances to the great transepts are arches inserted by bishop beauchamp 14501481 to withstand the side thrust of the great tower these are of perpendicular work with their spandrils panelled and their cornices battlemented as shown in the engraving canterbury and wells in a far more prominent fashion have similar features in this instance the addition appears to have succeeded in its purpose to insure the stability of the tower in the choir transepts these additional features take the form of an inverted arch above the main arch the vaulting of the tower roof is also in the perpendicular style and shows excellent groined work both sir christopher wren and francis price call its four main pillars the legs of the tower of the transept fuller says the cross aisle of this church is the most beautiful and lightsome of any i have yet beheld the spire steeple not founded on the ground but for the main supported by four pillars is of great height and greater workmanship i have been credibly informed that some foreign artists beholding this building brake forth into tears which some imputed to their admiration though i see not how wondering could cause weeping others to their envy grieving that they had not the like in their own land monuments in the nave8the peculiar arrangements of the ancient monuments in two long rows on the continuous plinth that connects the bases of the pillars on each side of the nave is another of wyatts freaks during his terrible innovations in 1789 not only did he sever the historical associations of centuries by these arbitrary removals but paid so little attention to consistency that portions of monuments belonging to entirely different periods were combined with curious results and remains transferred to other receptacles than those designed for them it is true that the effect of the present arrangement is not entirely bad but it was not worth achieving at such a cost the first monument on the south side as we enter by the great west door is in memory of thomas lord wyndham of finglass lord chancellor of ireland 1 who died in 1745 the marble figure of hibernia which surmounts it is by rysbrack at the western base of the first south pillar is a purbeck marble slab 2 coffinshaped probably the oldest monument in the building this is usually assigned to bishop herman whose tomb it is supposed to have covered in old sarum but no evidence exists to support this theory in the first place his original burialplace is entirely unknown and william de wanda who chronicles minutely the removal of the bodies of other bishops from the old cathedral does not even mention hermans name illustration the next 3 is an effigy of a bishop in full pontificals also believed to have been originally at old sarum the carving is rich and the design a fine example of the early norman style the chasuble is decorated with stars and the dalmatic has a rich border elaborately carved foliage with birds frames the figure which has its right hand raised in the attitude of benediction and grasps a pastoral staff in the left it is usually believed that it commemorates bishop jocelin who died in 1184 and was probably removed from old sarum at the translation of the bodies of the three bishops the head of the effigy is evidently a much later restoration probably from the style of the richly ornamented mitre about the time of henry iii or edward i as the face is cleanly shaven while the seal of bishop jocelin depicts him as bearded some antiquaries hold this monument to belong to bishop roger and assign to bishop jocelin the one formerly attributed to bishop herman if however differences of opinion exist concerning the identity of these two effigies they are as nothing compared to the uncertainty regarding the next 4 which represents a bishop holding a pastoral staff down the front of this cope are the words affer opem devenies in idem hatcher and duke believe that it represents bishop jocelin britton gough and planch prefer to think that it commemorates bishop roger its inscription on the edge of the slab runs flent hodie salesberie quia decidit ensis justitie pater ecclesi salisberiensis dum viguit miseros aluit fastusque potentum non timuit sed clava fuit terrorque nocentum de ducibus de nobilibus primordia duxit principibus propeque tibi gemma reluxit a version given in the wilts archeo mag vol xvii runs they mourn today at salesberie because there has fallen the sword of justice the father of the church of salesberie while he lived he sustained the oppressed and wretched and feared not the arrogance of the powerful but himself was the scourge literally the club and terror of the guilty he traced his ancestry from dukes and noble princes who shone near thee as a precious gem another item of indirect evidence supplied by this inscription is worth noting namely the l in salisberie the period when this letter superseded the r was about the time of jocelins death only a single coin of stephens has the l to bishop roger reference is made on page 100 and it is evident that even the fulsome praise of an epitaph would hardly go out of its way to describe him as sprung from dukes and noble princes planch despite this objection does not deem it convincing as poor priests were often of noble lineage if however we assume it represents bishop jocelin one of the house of bohun a great norman family and compare the effigy with the seal of that bishop the later theory that deprives bishop roger of this much discussed monument will probably be chosen as the most acceptable in a record at least three centuries old his burialplace is said to be near the chapel of st stephen and in a plan of the cathedral dated 1773 and in prices account 1774 a plain slab with a cross upon it in a shallow recess of the wall east of the north aisle is assigned to bishop roger but this and the other disputed monuments are undoubtedly genuine memorials of the earliest bishops and not merely interesting for that reason but as with the exception of two slabs dated 1086 and 1172 in westminster abbey the earliest examples of their class in england although the question of their identity of the individuals they commemorate were best left to those few who are peculiarly concerned with the history of the period that includes them near these effigies is a slab with faint traces of an incised figure which may possibly have represented an abbot or prior it can hardly be intended for a bishop as no mitre can be traced and the staff is held in the right hand the monument 5 on the plinth under the next arch is also beyond identification next in order comes the altar tomb 6 which now contains the remains of bishop beauchamp who died in 1481 when this was removed from the aisle at the north end of the great transept it was empty and showed no trace of its original dedication during the wanton demolition of the beauchamp chantry where in marble tumbes with his father and mother on either hand the remains of bishop beauchamp had been unmolested for over three hundred years his own tomb was mislaid and never recovered it is pleasant to note that even the apologists for wyatt felt this incident was beyond their sympathy dodsworth navely remarks after this the greatest possible care was taken that nothing of the kind should again occur and so far as we know not even a prior was subsequently lost of this bishop much is said elsewhere in this book and his beautiful chantry described on page 90 the elaborate effigy 7 beneath the next arch represents robert lord hungerford clad in a superb suit of fifteenth century plate armour with the collar of ss round his neck and with his hair polled in the fashion of henry v a superbly decorated sword and dagger hang from his jewelled girdle at his side while his feet rest upon a dog wearing a rich collar this monument was placed originally between the lady chapel and the hungerford chantry founded by margaret his widow by his will lord hungerford directed that his body should be interred before the altar of st osmund the tomb beneath the effigy is made up from portions of the chapel the monument known as lord stourtons 8 removed from the east end of the cathedral is next in order its three apertures on each side are said to be emblematic of the six sources of the river stour which rises at storrhead the ancient family seat from whence the name is derived the whole shape of the tomb is so unusual that in spite of the theory that it represents the six sources of the stour the curious arched openings appear as if pierced to exhibit something behind them yet this could not have been an effigy for the interior is divided by a solid partition of stone the pillars which stood between the arches are gone lord stourton to whom it is attributed was hanged with a silken cord on march 6th 1556 in the salisbury marketplace the tragedy is too long to give in detail as it is told in the country histories and elsewhere here a brief summary must sufficewhen his mother became a widow lord stourton attempted to induce her to sign a bond promising that she would never remarry the family agents a father and son named hartgill sided with lady stourton and seemed to have influenced her in declining to assent to the scheme the hartgills after much physical maltreatment at the hands of lord stourtons mercenaries took legal action against him with the result that he was fined and imprisoned for awhile in the fleet when let out on parole he invited the hartgills to meet him that he might pay them the fine upon their appearance at kilmington churchyard the appointed place they were seized by armed men carried away and murdered in cold blood in full sight of lord stourton himself the same night for this he was committed to the tower tried at westminster and hanged with four of his men at salisbury so late as 1775 a wire twisted into a noose was suspended above his tomb the mutilated effigy 9 of bishop de la wyle died 1271 rests on a base made up of portions of later work the last monument on this side 10 is of the famous william longespe 1st earl of salisbury the natural son of henry ii by fair rosamond this effigy still shows traces of the gorgeous ornament in gold and colours with which it was originally decorated westmacott the sculptor says the manly warrior character of the figure is particularly striking even in its recumbent attitude while the turn of the head and the graceful flow of lines in the right hand and arm with the natural heavy fall of the chain armour at the side exhibit a feeling of art that would not do discredit to a very advanced school the figure is clad in mail armour which covers the mouth in a peculiar fashion and wears a surcoat falling in simple folds almost greek in feeling that are somewhat curious in connection with the rich medival luxuriance of the surface ornament on his shield are borne six heraldic leopards or lions the slab and effigy are stone but the base is of wood encircled by an arcade of trefoiled arches one of its compartments protected with glass yet shows a piece of the beautiful diaper work in silver overlaid on white linen remains of the rich colourings of two successive periods are present on the effigy itself see p 94 crossing the nave and following the northern base of the pillars we find a very beautiful alabaster monument 11 with the effigy of sir john cheyney died 1509 clad in military garb and wearing the collar of ss with the portcullis badge of henry vii suspended therefrom sir john cheyney was the standardbearer of henry of richmond at bosworth field to quote from halls chronicleking richard set on so sharply at the first brount that he ouerthrew therles standard and slew sir william brandon his standardbearer and matched hand to hand with john cheynye a man of great strength who would have resisted him and the said john was by him manfully ouerthrowen wyatt in his ghoulish explorations exhumed sir johns bones and confirmed the legend of his gigantic stature the thighbone was found to be twentyone inches in length four inches more than the standard average his original tomb was destroyed with the rest of the beauchamp chapel and his remains now lie beneath this effigy under the next arch to the westward are two tombs 1213 deprived of the brasses they once bore which represented walter lord hungerford and his first wife catherine peverell the famous iron chapel has been removed to the choir by their descendant the earl of radnor who converted the monument into a family pew the plain altar tomb of st osmund that moved hither by wyatt stood until 1878 below the next arch of the nave is now replaced in the lady chapel on its former site the effigy of sir john de montacute 14 died 1389 clad in mail and chain armour is according to meyrick a good specimen of highly ornamented gauntlets of a contrivance for the easier bending of the body at the bottom of the breastplate and of the elegant manner of twisting the hanging sword belt pendant from the military girdle round the upper part of the sword the head of the figure reposes on a helmet a lion couches at his feet armorial bearings appear on shields at the sides of the tomb see p 79 then we come to chancellor geoffreys tomb 15 and the next 16 has not been identified the larger effigy 17 on the last portion of the northern plinth is of william longespe fourth earl of salisbury the figure wears chain armour and lies with its legs crossed and hands grasped upon his sword he was twice a crusader in 12401242 and in 1249 when he served with st louis of france at damietta he fell in battle near cairo in 1250 and was buried in the church of the holy cross near acre the night he was killed according to matthew paris his mother the countess ela saw in a vision the heavens opened and her son armed at all points with the six lioncels on his shield received in triumph by a company of angels many strange marvels were reported to have been worked by his bones the boy bishopnear this monument is the one 18 known as the boy bishop hidden for a long time underneath some seats near the pulpit it was brought to light in 1680 and moved to its present position at first it was covered with a wooden box for which later on owing to the great curiosity shown by the public the strong iron grating which now protects it was substituted see p 98 notwithstanding that the ceremony of the boy bishop was observed at salisbury for many centuries there is no reasonable proof that this effigy has any connection therewith even john gregory whose famous treatise on the boy bishop is printed in gregorii posthuma 16491669 admits there that it might well seem impossible to everyone that either a bishop should be so small in person or a child so great in clothes thomas fuller also echoes the same objection when he writes but the curiosity of critics is best entertained with the tomb in the north of the nave of the church where lieth a monument in stone of a little boy habited all in episcopal robes a mitre upon his head a crozier in his hand and the rest accordingly at the discovery thereof formerly covered over with pews many justly admired that either a bishop could be so small in person or a child so great in clothes though since all is unriddled for it was then fashionable in that church a thing rather deserving to be remembered than fit to be done in the depth of popery that the choristers chose a boy of their society to be a bishop among them from st nicholas till innocents day if the effigy represents a boy it is hard to explain why it is not lifesize stothard in his monumental effigies in common with most later authorities favours the idea that it is a miniature representation of a real bishop canon jones suggests probably walter scammel henry de braundeston or william de la corner mackenzie walcott inclined to the belief that it represented bishop wykehampton who died 1284 a small figure of bishop ethelman 1260 about the same date is in winchester cathedral there is also one 14 inches long in abbey dore church herefordshire one at ayot st lawrence herts 2 feet 3 inches and other small effigies of knights and civilians elsewhere according to digby wyatt the custom of burying different portions of the body in different places was common in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries from which he infers that probably these figures commemorated the place of sepulture of the heart whether the monument in question be connected with the chorister bishop or not there are so many records of the function with which popular credence has associated it that a short digression is almost unavoidable the pamphlet by john gregory is elaborately minute and much too long to be quoted fully yet some of the facts he brought together may be briefly noted it seems that on the feast of st nicholas the patron saint of children the choirboys9 elected one of their number who from that day to the feast of the holy innocents december 28th bore the rank and exercised the functions of a bishop the other choristers being his prebendaries during his term of office he wore episcopal vestments on the eve of the holy innocents he performed the entire office excepting the mass as a real bishop would have done at salisbury on that day the boybishop and his boyprebendaries went in procession to the altar of the holy trinity taking precedence of the dean and resident canons at the first chapter afterwards the boy bishop attended in person and was permitted to receive the entire oblation made at the altar during the day of his procession the names of many of the choristers and the amounts of the oblations offered for the boybishops are the subject of many entries in the capitular registers of both english and continental churches bishop mortival in his statutes still preserved among the cathedral muniments orders that the bishop of the choristers shall make no visit some commentators consider this has been misinterpreted to infer that elsewhere he held visitations nor keep any feast but shall remain in the common hall unless he be invited to the table of a canon for recreation the order of service in use in this diocese has been preserved ms no 153 of the cathedral library in it we find as a special collect o almighty god who out of the mouths of babes and sucklings etc not however quite in the form in which it appears in the prayer book of ed vi the spectacle was so popular and attracted such great crowds that by special edict it was prescribed that the penalty of the greater excommunication should be incurred by those who might interrupt or press upon the boys during their procession or in any part of their service in spite of the doubts thrown upon the monument at salisbury it is distinctly recorded that if a boybishop died during his term of power he was to be buried in his vestments and have his obsequies celebrated with the pomp pertaining to an episcopal funeral this custom was not confined to this cathedral but practised at many others in england and on the continent where we find records of much greater power being exercised by the boyprelate extending even to the presentation to prebends at winchester it was certainly observed so far back as 1263 we find it described at st pauls cathedral as an ancient custom several sermons preached by the boybishops are still preserved one is reprinted in the camden societys miscellany vol vii dean colet once a prebendary of sarum in his statutes for st pauls school directs all these children shall every childermas day come to paules church and here the childebishoppes sermon and after be

was revived under queen mary and finally abolished on the accession of queen elizabeth not entirely alien to the subject is the office of the bishops boy which is probably peculiar to salisbury his duty is to call at the palace before every service and inquire if the bishop will attend he is formally appointed by the bishop who lays his hands upon him and repeats a prescribed office a nameless tomb 19 and a memorial 20 to dr daubigny turberville an oculist of salisbury who died april 21st 1696 complete the more important monuments of the nave several mural tablets on the aisle walls are of hardly sufficient general interest to need description in prices antiquities of salisbury and many of the numerous works devoted to the cathedral copies of nearly all the epitaphs are given but except in very special instances they form peculiarly depressing reading the choir screen was given as a memorial of the late mr sidney lear by his wife to whom the cathedral is indebted for many of its modern enrichments it is entirely of wrought metal by skidmore of coventry and a good example of its class it replaced the organ screen compiled by wyatt from fragments of the hungerford and beauchamp chantries to erect which he removed the original screen of exquisite workmanship as may be seen by portions now placed along the west wall of the northeast transept the organ that stood on the old screen until lately was built by green of isleworth and a gift from king george iii in his capacity as a berkshire gentleman that county being included in the diocese of sarum until 1836 it was given by the dean and chapter to the church of st thomas the present organ a fine instrument built by willis was the gift of miss chafyn grove is placed in the second arcade on each side of the choir the necessary connecting mechanism being in a tunnel below the pavement while the larger pipes and the bellows are inclosed within a screen in the north transept the oak case is from a design by the late mr street the choir and presbytery are very similar to the nave in the main features of their design the piers show a different plan which provides for eight shafts of purbeck marble to each the inner mouldings of the arches exhibit the dogtooth ornamentation of their period the triforium and clerestory differ slightly from the corresponding parts of the nave in each of the last two bays of the presbytery the triforium has five small cinquefoil arches at the east wall of the choir above the reredos is an arcade of five simplypointed arches below a triplet window in the gable which is filled with stained glass given by the earl of radnor in 1781 and representing the brazen serpent after a design by mortimer the choir still bears traces of wyatts destruction he removed the original reredos behind the high altar and the screen before the lady chapel so that both with the low eastern aisle were thrown into the choir he shifted the high altar from the choir to the extreme east end of the lady chapel sacrificing several chantries and tombs to do so views of the cathedral after his reign of terror fail to show any gain to compensate for so much loss the extreme length is not apparently an advantage while the bare look of the interior seems decidedly intensified by the increased vista that he was so delighted to obtain and for which with a light heart he effaced the silent records of dead centuries the decorations of the roof of the choir and presbytery are reproductions by messrs clayton and bell of the original paintings which dated probably from the thirteenth century the series commencing from the west shows twentyfour prophets and saints all with the exception of st john the baptist selected from the old testament taking them in lines parallel with the choir screen the first row contains reading from the left as one faces the altar zechariah daniel ezekiel and st john the baptist the second zacharias joel hosea and zephaniah the third job habakkuk nahum david the fourth moses micah jonah and jacob the fifth malachi obadiah amos and isaac and the sixth haggai jeremiah isaiah and abraham in the square of the transept crossing are following the same order st thomas and st andrew st matthew and st john st philip and st simon st bartholomew and st matthias at the left the last panel on that side contains st peter and st andrew while another in the opposite corner has st james and st john in the centre is a figure of christ in majesty surrounded by the four evangelists from this point to the east the panels are devoted to secular subjects typifying the twelve months the signs of the zodiac price calls them january warming at a fire february drinking wine march delving april sowing may hawking june flowers july reaping august threshing september fruit october brewing november cutting wood december killing the fatted pig the originals were white or rather buffwashed in the last century owing to the tenacity of this wash and the friable nonadhesive quality of the paint it covered it was found impossible to remove the additional coating without destroying the original paintings tracings of some of them were made by messrs clayton and bell but although the semitransparent character of the buff wash allowed the subjects to be discerned from below on nearer inspection the details became blurred and shapeless the theory that the paintings of the choir had been repainted before their defacement by buff wash seems hardly likely from the state reported by the restorers the idea probably arose from an extract itself possibly interpolated frequently quoted from one edition of defoes tour through the island of great britain the choir resembles a theatre rather than a venerable choir of a church it is painted white with the panels golden and groups and garlands of roses and other flowers intertwined run round the top of the stalls each stall hath the arms of its holder in gilt letters or blue writ on it and the episcopal throne with bishop wards arms upon it would make a fine theatrical decoration being supported by gilt pillars and painted with flowers upon white all over the roof of the choir hath some fresh painting containing several saints as big as life each in a circle by itself and holding a label in their hands telling who they are the altar piece is very mean and behind this altar in the virgin marys chapel are some very good monuments but in the first edition of the same book defoe himself says the inside is certainly hurt by the paltry old paintings in and over the choir and the whitewashing badly done wherein they have very stupidly everywhere drawn black lines to imitate joints of stone in another edition of 1724 the passage reads the painting in the choir is mean and more like the ordinary method of common drawing room or tavern painting than that of a church whatever be the actual value of the painting on its own merits as a record faithfully transcribed of very early roofdecoration it has an interest of its own far beyond much more important work of later periods illustration the choir looking west from a photograph by messrs carl norman and co the choirin the second bay from the east on the north side of the choir stands the chantry of bishop audley who died in 1524 this excellent example of late perpendicular work was built by the bishop himself in 1520 its style is not unlike the chantry of bishop fox at winchester with octagonal shafts similar to those of the salisbury chapel at christchurch which impart a semioriental touch that is so characteristic of this final development of gothic art the images it once enshrined are lost but the original rich colouring is still distinguishable on the fan tracery of the roof the arms and initials of its founder are borne on the shields of the cornice in the corresponding bay on the south side is the chantry founded by walter lord hungerford in 1429 and removed from the nave in 1778 by his descendant the earl of radnor who converted it into a family pew it has been redecorated and new emblazonments added the arms of its founder and his two wives appear on the base the superstructure is of iron and a fine example of its class which includes among the few still extant the chantry of edward iv died 1483 at windsor and that of henry vii at westminster abbey died 1509 the audley and hungerford chantries are the most important left in a cathedral once rich in their kind as the report of the alienation of their endowments proves of modern fittings the brass lectern was given by members of the late dean lears family a brass eagle is mentioned by price and said to have been given in 1714 at a cost of 160 the pulpit is modern with carved medallions on its sides the bishops throne a lofty modern structure made by earp of lambeth was presented by those clergymen who had been ordained in the cathedral it replaced one given in 1763 the choir stalls are made up from work of different periods the seats and elbows being probably part of the original work the poppy heads of the benches are of the time of henry viii much later sir christopher wren added to the stalls and still later wyatt placed canopies over them which have since been removed the deans seat has been said to be of the time of charles i the reredos is modern it was given by earl beauchamp in memory of bishop beauchamp 145081 whose chantry wyatt swept away its design is adapted from the old choir screen now in the lady chapel and the monument of bishop bridport a large centre panel eight feet in height has a basrelief of the crucifixion with the virgin and st john in the head of the central arch are angels amid foliage on each side are two storied canopied niches containing statues of the two maries and of st osmund and bishop beauchamp the whole rises up to a gable terminating in a gemmed and floriated cross the back facing the lady chapel is richly panelled the sides are also elaborately decorated with birds the design by sir gilbert scott was executed at a cost of about 1800 by messrs farmer and brindley illustration the high altar and reredos from a photograph by messrs poulton the high altar the credence table and sedilia are excellent examples of modern work the altar itself is of english oak its design comprises an arcade with seven openings divided into three panels with much elaborate carving it was given by those who had received confirmation at the hands of bishop hamilton the altar cloths worked and given by mrs sidney lear are highly finished examples of modern ecclesiastical needlework the credence table of somewhat elaborate design is of carved oak with a marble top the altar rails are of brass the grills of wrought iron at each side of the reredos screen the choir partially from the lady chapel illustration the choir looking east from a photograph by messrs poulton the definitely planned order of the subjects of the ceiling decoration is held to indicate originally a different place for the high altar than its present site which is the same as that reported by leland two hundred years ago and until attention was drawn to this fact was generally accepted as its original position from the rood screen the sequence of the figures of the patriarchs and prophets leads up to the climax of our lord in glory at this point the capitals of the purbeck shafts surrounding the pillars supporting the arch on which this figure is painted are carved in foliage unlike the others throughout the building which are invariably moulded only the whole subject is discussed at length in a paper printed in the wilts archological magazine vol xvii in a way that supports the hypothesis advanced a somewhat important piece of circumstantial evidence came to light during the late restoration namely a windlass close to the pier on the north side of the supposed original site of the altar which was possibly intended to raise and lower a baldichino or ciborium that hung originally over the altar or still more probably the pyx which as many instances show was usually suspended above it possibly the altar was moved when owing to the early settlement of some of the piers it was found necessary to wall up the space between the arches opening into the choir transepts and insert the perpendicular arches as a counter thrust to the strain of the central tower it is hardly conceivable that the evidence offered by the roof paintings and the solitary instance of carved capitals can be misleading on this point the east or choir transept which on the north side screened as it is from the aisle is used and known also as the morning chapel has on its west wall a portion of a very beautiful screen of early english work of this john carter from whose pages the accompanying sketch of a portion is reproduced says that it was moved during wyatts restoration as he navely puts it during the late dilapidatious innovations and modern fanciful introductions so fatal to our study of antiquities other authorities consider its original position uncertain yet since its architecture is obviously coeval with that of the building and the arches inserted by bishop beauchamp show proof of having been planned to rest on something at the base of the tower piers there can be little doubt that when wyatt removed the screen to reerect a medley of his own composing made of fragments of the demolished chantries he disturbed one more of the original features of the cathedral illustration portion of the old organ screen from a drawing by hp clifford a curious double aumbry in the north wall of this chapel is unusual not merely in the pitch of its arches which are triangular gables but also in the solid stone shelves dividing its space into six compartments other aumbries in this church show similar features but this alone retains its original wooden doors the superb brass of bishop wyville illustrated on p 114 is in the pavement of this transept it is illustrated in almost every work on monumental brasses as a notable example a canopied lavatory of beautiful design is upon the east wall to the right the altar being not in the centre but almost in the corner on the lefthand side the eastern aisle is not so important as similar processionals at exeter winchester and some other english churches still the grace of its clustered columns like those of the lady chapel give it a character of its own illustration piscina in the south choir aisle the lady chapel originally separated from the choir thrown into the presbytery by wyatt for the sake of his much overrated vista is once again partially hidden by the reredos and the grille work of the screen on either side as the earliest portion of the building and the only part bishop poore lived to see completed it would not lack interest were it commonplace in character but it is on the contrary a particularly graceful example of its time the whole chapel is divided into a nave and side aisles by single and clustered shafts of purbeck marble these extremely slender shafts look unequal to the heavy groined roof they support for although nearly thirty feet high the four largest are not quite ten inches in diameter while the clustered ones are mere rods francis price whose interest in the building as he showed throughout his monograph was that of a practical builder was amazed at the vast boldness of the architect who certainly piqued himself on leaving to posterity an instance of such small pillars bearing so great a load one would not suppose them he says to stand so firm of themselves as even to resist the force of an ordinary wind the modern colouring of this part of the building including the low eastern aisle immediately behind the reredos is claimed to be an exact restoration of the original but it is hardly agreeable the black of the newly polished marble shafts the dull green of other parts with the red green and white of the vaulting ribs is more bizarre than beautiful in regarding traces of medival colouring one often forgets that time has blended harmoniously a scheme otherwise entirely crude and to modern taste unpleasing how far in english instances this is emphasized by the absence of rich hangings carpets vestments and pictures it is not within our subject to inquire but since such restoration of the primitive colouring offends one less in churches that still preserve the more ornate furniture of the roman ritual it is at least a moot point the triple lancet east window at the end of the lady chapel was filled formerly with stained glass representing the resurrection after a design by sir joshua reynolds it is now replaced by modern glass in memory of the late dean lear an altarpiece composed of fragments of the destroyed hungerford and beauchamp chapels was set up here by wyatt it has lately been replaced by a triptych designed by sir arthur blomfield with very beautiful panels painted by mr buckeridge the sevenbranched candlesticks in blackwood silver mounted are by the same architect the altar frontal designed by mr sidney gambier parry and worked by mrs weigall is so good that it must not be overlooked the altar itself is of stone from an old altarpiece under the windows runs a series of niches once in the beauchamp chapel above these rich and delicate canopies with foliage and fantracery springing from corbelled heads runs an exquisitely sculptured frieze in this place after he was canonized in 1456 the shrine of st osmund was erected his supposed tomb moved by wyatt to the nave is now replaced between the lady chapel and the southern aisle of the shrine no trace remains but legends of the miracles worked at it and the special indulgences granted to the pilgrims who visited it prove that it existed on this spot the date mxcix inscribed upon this slab has been questioned on the authority of a diary made by captain symons in 1644 now in the british museum in which an entry occurs with reference to this inscription a blew stone rising four ynches from the ground the east end narrower than the west this lately written anno mxcix but whether he means to infer that it was lately restored or that the date itself was a later addition is not quite clear the characters of the inscription planch pointed out correspond in form with those at the time of william the conqueror and as sepulchral effigies are uncommon until the middle of the twelfth century the presumption is in its favour still it is somewhat pathetic to find that the evidence which serves to connect this otherwise unknown monument with the famous st osmund the greatest figure not merely of the cathedral but of the english church of his time is not absolutely beyond suspicion yet even if the roman numerals were a later addition it is hardly credible that the shrine of so popular a saint could have been wrongly identified when wyatt according to his usual habit explored the interior of the tomb nothing was found within it illustration altar and triptych reredos in the lady chapel from a photograph by witcomb and son salisbury in 1540 leland saw here a ballet which he transcribes for his itinerary with an inscription commanding the faithful to pray for the repose of the soul of richard poore monuments in the transept choir and lady chapelthe most important on the west wall of the north great transept is a brass 21 in memory of john britton who did so much to revive a taste for archology and ecclesiastical art by his splendid series of monographs on the cathedrals and his topographical works a fine monument of its class is one by bacon 22 which represents moral philosophy mourning over a medallion of james harris author of hermes and father of the first earl of malmesbury to whose memory close by is a fulllength portrait figure by chantrey a figure 23 of benevolence lifting the veil from a basrelief of the good samaritan by flaxman commemorates william benson earle esq of the close salisbury on the north wall of this transept is a canopied effigy 24 of a bishop said to represent john blythe who died in 1499 it was originally in the ambulatory of the lady chapel behind the high altar until wyatt removed it to its present site in this transept is the statue 25 to sir richard colt hoare author of the histories of modern and ancient wiltshire and other works it is a seated figure not without dignity by rc lucas a native of salisbury a portrait bust to richard jefferies with a long and eulogistic inscription is upon a bracket on the west wall two other monuments by flaxman deserve notice that to walter long esq 26 a medallion supported by two figures representing justice and literature and one 27 to his brother william long in florid gothic style with figures of science and benevolence dr wagen in his art treasures of great britain says the three monuments by flaxman in salisbury two of which are in gothic taste prove that he was superior to most english sculptors in knowledge of the architectonic style there is nothing extraordinary in the design but the workmanship is good and there is real feeling in the heads in the north choir aisle at its junction with the great transept is a large purbeck marble altar tomb 28 with panels and tracery despoiled of the brass legend and armorial bearings it formerly exhibited this is supposed to have commemorated bishop woodville who died 1484 two marble slabs that until 1778 were in the floor of this side beneath the first arch of the choir and in the corresponding place on the south side have been also stripped of their brasses which showed them to belong to bishop simon of ghent 1315 and bishop mortival 1330 on the bench of this aisle is a figure 29 of a skeleton said to represent a man named fox who tried to fast forty days a similar legend is told of the next figure 30 in memory of dr bennett precentor of salisbury 1541 to 1544 it is needless to say that both stories are mere inventions in many monuments the effigy of the hero commemorated was shown in full pomp above while in a niche below the skeleton was depicted by way of pointing a moral too obvious to need further comment a brass in replica of the original has been reinserted in the marble slab that commemorates bishop jewell 156071 31 the next monument 32 for a long time attributed to bishop bingham 122947 has a flat pointed arch terminating in a decorated finial above which rises a sort of pyramid of three stories below is a slab formerly inlaid with brass later antiquaries in spite of the fourteenth century character of its detail assign it to bishop scammel 128487 the audley chapel 33 is entered from this aisle in the northeast choir transept aisle are three gravestones of bishops wyville 1375 gheast 1576 and jewell 1571 removed from the choir when its marble pavement was laid down in the floor of this transept which is known also as the morning chapel is the famous brass to bishop wyvill 34 one that has been repeatedly figured in various works on memorial brasses and it is generally ranked as one of the most interesting of existing examples near this is another brass 35 commemorating bishop gheast the lavatory 36 is noticed elsewhere in the lady chapel under an arched niche in the north wall is a coffinshaped tomb 37 assigned to bishop roger by those who refuse to accept the effigy in the nave as his monument the monument 38 at the end of the north aisle of the lady chapel is a typical example of the mixed classical style so dear to the early seventeenth century taste the effigies below its canopy supported on twisted corinthian pillars represent sir thomas gorges and his widow a maid of honour to queen elizabeth its medley of obelisks globes spheres and images of the four cardinal virtues is more curious than interesting interred near in the choir and all without monuments are many of the earls of pembroke and their wives including sidneys sister pembrokes mother in a niche of the east wall of the choir behind an arcade of three pointed arches with cinquefoil heads is a purbeck marble effigy 39 of a bishop supposed by many to represent richard poore it has been ascribed to bishop bingham because its bearded face fails to agree with that depicted on the seal of bishop poore and also because an entry in an old book of records says that he was buried on the north side of the altar this monument was removed by wyatt to the northeast transept to what is supposed to have been its original position the effigy whoever it represents is a fine one the pastoral crozier of particularly graceful design above it is an angel supporting the circle of the sun and the crescent of the moon the slab which is believed to commemorate st osmund 40 is now restored and placed where his shrine stood formerly between the south choir aisle and lady chapel at the east end of the south aisle is the gorgeous monument 41 to edward earl of hertford son of the protector somerset uncle of edward vi and of his wife catherine sister to lady jane grey the effigies are both in a praying attitude the earl in armour it is elaborately ornamented and splendid in gold and colours restored by order of the late duke of northumberland it is more ornate than modern taste desires but still to call it stately though tasteless as does one chronicler is somewhat harsher criticism than is justified it is seen in the illustration of the choir aisle given here illustration south choir aisle lady chapel from a photograph by norman in the south wall is an altar tomb 42 now assigned to william wilton chancellor of sarum 150623 on its cornice are shields bearing the device of henry viii and catherine of arragon a rose and a pomegranate the arms of bishop audley and those of abingdon abbey also the rebus wil and a tun the monument 43 to bishop moberly designed by mr arthur blomfield is an excellent example of the modern revival the monument 44 to bishop hamilton is also interesting as almost the last design prepared by sir george gilbert scott and one well worthy of its author next to the hungerford iron chantry 45 is the monument 46 ordinarily assigned to bishop william of york but like many of the bishops tombs in this cathedral without any certain clue to its identity it consists of a pointed crocketed arch terminating in an elaborate finial with a flat slab below originally inlaid with a brass illustration south choir aisle showing the hungerford chapel from a photograph by sb bolas and co in the south choir transept is the very beautiful chantry 47 to bishop giles de bridport on either side the gabled roof is carried by two open elaborately moulded arches with quatrefoil heads inclosing two trefoil arches supported by clustered detached shafts each arch has a triangular hood moulding crocketed with carved finials the spandrils are ornamented with very interesting carvings these have been interpreted to mean on the south side the birth of the bishop his confirmation his education and possibly his first preferment on the north the bishop doing homage for his see a procession with a crossbearer generally accepted as a memorial of the consecration of the building by this bishop his death and finally his soul borne up to heaven by an angel with outspread wings illustration chantry of bishop bridport from brittons cathedrals the recumbent effigy has figures of censing angels at its head the whole style of this exquisite structure is akin to that of the cloisters and the chapter house the artists who executed the sculptures are believed to have been contemporaries of niccola pisano a chantry was formerly attached to this monument to the east of which is a double aumbry or cupboard for the reservation of the sacrament near this is a tablet to the memory of canon bowles whose edition of pope plunged him into a bitter controversy with lord byron he was author of many books including a life of bishop ken a large modern monument to the late bishop burgess is against the south wall on the west wall is the monument 48 of bishop seth ward whose additions to the palace after the restoration are mentioned elsewhere the izaak walton whose gravestone is near was the son of the famous angler near is one to the memory of the father of the poet young and a modern tablet to richard hooker author of ecclesiastical polity in the south choir aisle is a rather interesting monument 51 to bishop davenant who is usually credited with the honour of being one of the translators of the bible it is of white marble with two black corinthian pillars surmounted by a mitre and arms there is also a tablet in coloured relief to the memory of mrs wordsworth wife of the bishop and a brass cruciform in shape inserted in a polished granite slab which forms a memorial to canon liddon many other monuments of ancient and modern date that concern forgotten celebrities or are of purely local interest cannot be catalogued nor is it needful to insist on morals they mostly enforce that really all recent works of this class lack the dignity which has given the word monumental a new meaning on the bench opposite is the monument 52 an altar tomb with shields and initials of bishop salcot or capon whose notoriety as a timeserving courtier is mentioned in another chapter a pseudoclassical monument near 53 with vineleaves and grapes in green and gold entwined round black corinthian pillars is to the memory of sir richard mompesson knight who is represented in armour and dame katherine his wife clad in black robe with gold flowers illustration the chapter house from a photograph by carl norman and co close to the south transept in the choir aisle is the altar tomb 54 of bishop mitford 1407 which britton rightly calls a noble monument in the spandrils of the flat arch of its canopy are armorial shields lilies and birds holding in their beaks scrolls inscribed honor deo et gloria are on its cornice the shields on the north bear the bishops arms and those of his see on the south are quartered the arms of england and france and the ensign of edward the confessorthe cross patone surrounded by five martlets here also is a modern altar tomb 55 from a design by mr ge street to the memory of john henry jacob and a fine jacobean monument with bust and latin inscription to lord chief justice hyde among many other postreformation monuments are those to bishop fisher 56 on the east wall a canopied altar tomb 57 in the gothic style to the memory of edward and rachel poore died 1780 and 1781 the collateral descendants of the famous bishop and a marble slab set in a gothic frame to canon hume died 1834 on the south wall of the nave 58 there is an effigy of mrs eleanor sadler who died july 30th 1622 and was interred according to her owne desire under this her pew wherein with great devotion she had served god dailie almost l years amid other monuments on this wall dating from late in the seventeenth century to the present day is a small tablet 60 to one of the most famous salisbury men in modern times the right hon henry fawcett mp late postmastergeneral who died in 1884 the chapter house which is entered from the eastern walk of the cloisters dates probably from the time of edward the first later it may be but certainly not earlier than the commencement of his reign as during certain excavations for underpinning the walls in 1854 several pennies of that king were found below its foundations the architecture is somewhat later in style than that of the cloisters and if it be not as its admirers claim the most beautiful in england it has few rivals like westminster wells and other english examples except york and southwell it has a central pillar from which the groining of the roof springs gracefully in harmonious lines a raised bench of stone runs round the interior at its back fortynine niches of a canopied arcade borne on slight purbeck marble shafts mark out as many seats they are apportioned as follows those at each side of the entrance to the chancellor and treasurer respectively the rest to the bishop dean archdeacons and other members of the chapter illustration the south side of the chapter house illustration bosses from the chapter house roof the plan of the building is octagonal about fiftyeight feet in diameter and fiftytwo feet in height each side has a large fanlight window with traceried head below these windows and above the canopies of the seats is a very remarkable series of basreliefs noticed more fully later on the bosses of the roof are somewhat elaborately carved one north of the west doorway has groups of figures on it apparently intended to represent armourers musicians and apothecaries possibly commemorating guilds who were benefactors to the building the others have foliage chiefly with grotesque monsters on the base of the central pillar is a series of carvings taken probably from one of the many books of fables so popular in the middle ages these were reproduced from the originals which are preserved in the cloisters illustration details of sculptures in the chapter house from photographs by catherine weed ward the quatrefoil over the doorway has an empty niche and it is not possible to say with certainty whether it was originally filled by a crucifix as mr mackenzie walcott infers from the symbols of the evangelists in the angles of the panel or with a seated figure of our lord in majesty or as a third archologist has suggested a coronation of the virgin filling the voussoirs of the arch of the doorway are fourteen small niches containing subjects from the psychomachia of prudentius the battle of the virtues against the vices the figures are not easily identified but mr burges whose iconography of the chapter house is the most important monograph on the subject suggests that on the righthand side the figures in the third niche from the top appear to represent concord triumphing over discord in the sixth temperance is pouring liquor down the throat of intemperance on the seventh fortitude tramples on terror who cuts her own throat on the left hand in the first niche faith is trampling on infidelity in the second a virtue covers a vice with her cloak while the vice embraces her knees with one hand and stabs her with a sword held in the other this incident is taken from prudentius discord by stealth wounds concord she is taken and killed by faith which latter incident may be represented in the next compartment in the fourth niche truth pulls out falsehoods tongue in the fifth modesty scourges lust in the sixth generosity pours coin into the throat of avarice to quote the words of the author from whom these interpretations are derived these sculptures are of the very highest class of art and infinitely superior to any work in the chapter house the only defect is the size of the heads probably this was intentional on the part of the artist the intense life and movement of the figures are worthy of special study these allegories are common in paintings and sculptures of this period at canterbury the same subjects are incised on the pavement that surrounds the shrine of st thomas becket on the spandrils of the continuous arcade sculptures in high relief once restored as far as possible in the original colours are now again scraped clean and with the new heads to the figures look so modern that it is hard to believe they are contemporary with the building they adorn yet since on the whole the restoration has been faithfully accomplished they may be studied as peculiarly valuable examples of early medival sculpture showing certain nave qualities that raise them far above the usual level of contemporary

three candidates selected by the chapter but this attempt to curtail their privilege was successfully resisted by the boys the cathedral precincts the common practice of writers who are describing any one of our more important cathedrals is to declare that altogether it may be fairly called the most beautiful so great is the fascination exercised by continual study of a single medival building which has escaped destruction or overrestoration that such a statement may be advanced in all good faith in claiming however that the cloisters of salisbury are on the whole the most beautiful in england it is merely reasserting what many critics of gothic architecture have already decided to be true the cloisters of gloucester are far richer the space they cover at wells like salisbury not a monastic establishment is greater and in other details these may not be the finest but as a whole their beautiful proportion and the general symmetry of their design make them worthy adjuncts to a building which is preeminent for these special qualities situated according to the usual custom on the southwest side of the cathedral with their western wall in a line with its west front they are exceedingly picturesque even so far back as the time of leland we find him declaring that the cloister on the south side of the church is one of the largest and most magnificent in britain yet as a recent critic has observed from a purely technical point of view there is too great a mass of blank wall above the arcade the green sward of the large garth 140 feet square with its covered walks 181 feet long on each side and the fine group of cedars in the centre showing against the cool grey of the stonework realize the ideal of that cloistered solitude so dear to the poets it should not be forgotten however that the arrangements of this cathedral are not monastic for it was never aught but a collegiate building the style is late thirteenth century with windows of exceedingly graceful design double arches with quatrefoils above united in pairs with a large sixfoiled circle in the main head the upper portions of the tracery had not so long ago traces of coloured glass here and there but whether this feature was part of the original scheme is very doubtful the shafts originally of purbeck marble replaced in 1854 by stone both between and in the centres of the windows have simply moulded capitals while those of the clustered columns at the main angles are carved modern opinion is inclined to date the beginning of the work between 1260 to 1284 but so late as 1338 as a dated charter in bishop wyvilles time which refers to the enlargement of the cloisters shows they were not quite completed hence it is inferred that a part possibly only one side was built at first the north arcade is entirely independent of the south wall of the nave the long space between being known as the plumbery the garth is used as a burial ground and in the cloisters are many monuments but none of more than local interest except possibly a tablet to the memory of francis price died mar 20th 1753 aged 50 the cathedral architect whose excellent monograph devoted to the building is still one of the most useful books of reference on the subject the drawing here reproduced from brittons salisbury shows the work before its restoration by bishop denison but it has been chosen because it suggests the peculiar beauty of the place better than any photograph from the cloisters a very charming glimpse of the spire may be obtained illustration the cloisters from a photograph by messrs

for the canons the upper one a dimlylighted room with an oak roof supported by a central column of wood is the muniment chamber traces of a cross on the central pillar support the theory that the altar in the treasury referred to in various early documents stood here the solidity and strength of the building and the fact that it was undoubtedly the store house for the vestments and treasures of the church leaves little doubt that the supposition is true a very fine cope chest reproduced by mr william burges in his architectural drawings 1870 until lately preserved in the vestry now in the north choir aisle has a quaintlycarved capital on one of its shafts that suggests a very early date for its construction the heavy lid was originally lifted by a rope and windlass although possessing no traces of painting or gilding and but little carving it is both curious and interesting as a specimen of woodwork coeval with the cathedral itself a somewhat similar one exists in westminster abbey in both the lifting lids worked on very slight pivots at westminster the chains remain in 1834 a writer described the room as a feast for moths and spiders now it is kept in admirable order the most important of its extremely valuable documents have been printed in a volume devoted to sarum in the master of the rolls series in the late canon jones fasti ecclesi sarisberiensis in addition to these historic papers there is an immense quantity of chapter registers and other mss of more local interest many of the chests and presses date from early times when the three keys needed to open each were severally in the charge of three of the cathedral dignitaries the contemporary copy of magna charta made for william longespe first earl of salisbury and referred to elsewhere is sometimes exhibited here the documents which contain the statutes and ordinances by which the cathedral is governed extend over six centuries commencing in 1091 and ending 1697 these were edited by dr edward a dayman and the late rev wh rich jones vicar of bradfordonavon whose researches in the past history of not merely the cathedral but the whole district were so extended that it is impossible to do justice in every instance to many facts which have been taken from his pages in the preparation of this handbook the privately printed volume published in 1883 contains the latin text with english notes of these various documents the details of most of these although of immense value to antiquarians are too technical to be available for quotation here but the indirect allusions to customs and manners of the past makes many a paragraph pleasant reading although the whole document may refer to merely the working details of administration the statute dated ad 1319 relating to the rights of the boy bishop is one of the few that have more than local interest illustration hanging parapet on the east wall of the close the close is certainly a fit setting for the jewel it surrounds and with full remembrance of the superb position of durham the picturesque eminence of lincoln the dignity that marks the isolated hill whereon ely towers over the fens around it the harmonious environment of wells and many another site made memorable by its cathedral salisbury is in its own way not less beautiful the quiet tranquillity of the large lawn the halfhidden houses that nestle among its trees the sense of being completely shut off from the workaday world impress one as much as the apparent vastness of the area thus devoted to the cathedral leland in his itinerary was equally struck with its beauty although as the frontispiece shows the surroundings were very different before wyatts exploits and probably in lelands time preserved still more of their medival aspect he says the great and large embatelid waulle of the palace having 3 gates to entre into it thus namyd the close gate as principale by north ynto the town saint annes gate by est and harnham gate by south toward harham bridge the close wall was never ful finished as in one place evidently apperith i redde that in bishop rogers days as i remembere a convention was between him and the canons of saresbyri de muro clausi whether the builders of our great churches were conscious of the beauty of their surroundings or whether no little of that loveliness is but the slow result of centuries of care and the accident of natural growth need not be discussed that to an american especially this peculiar beauty tells with great force we can readily believe and mrs van rensselaer whose paper on salisbury has been quoted before in this book expresses admirably the feeling which whether it be true or only imaginary is no doubt the impression of such a place as the close of salisbury on many an educated visitor salisbury she writes is the very type and picture of the church of the prince of peace nowhere else does a work of christian architecture so express purity and repose and the beauty of holiness while the green pastures that surround it might well be those of which the psalmist writes when the sun shines on the pale grey stones and the level grass and the silent trees and throws the long shadow of the spire across them it is as though a choir of seraphs sang in benediction of that peace of god which passeth understanding the men who built and planted here were sick of the temples of baalim tired of being cribbed and cabined weary of quarrelsome winds and voices they wanted space and sun and stillness comfort and rest and beauty and the quiet ownership of their own and no men ever more perfectly expressed for future times to read the ideal they had in mind the bell tower a striking feature of the close as it was before 1789 is shown on page 19 in the facsimile of an engraving originally published in 1761 and reengraved in the superb county history in 1804 this shows the campanile standing at the northwest corner of the inclosure in style it was about the same period as the chapter house and cloisters the plan appears to have been square although one writer frequently quoted calls it multangular the stone tower was in two massive stories with lancet windows in the lower and windows with plate tracery above with a spire apparently of wood crowning the whole leland speaks of it as a notable and strong square tower for great belles and a pyramis on it in the cemiterie it was evidently massive enough to have stood for centuries and the single pillar of purbeck marble lying in its natural bed which was the central support that carried the bells the belfry and the spire is specially mentioned by price as perfectly sound but he owns that the leaden spire and a wooden upper story were decayed and puts forward a design of a sham classic dome which he hopes might be erected in its place when the cathedral was visited in 1553 by the royal commission there remained a peal of ten bells and the recasting in 1680 of the seventh and eighth by the purdues local founders is recorded among the muniments the sixth is now the clock bell of the cathedral but the fate of the others is absolutely unknown illustration death and the gallant several of wyatts iconoclastic blunders have been already mentioned we now come to his chief iniquity the hungerford chapel demolished by wyatt stood at the east end of the building on the north side of the lady chapel with which it was connected by openings cut in the main wall this chapel was one of those of which fuller so quaintly wrote a chantry was what we call in grammar an adjective unable to stand of itself and was therefore united for better support to some church an addition to the building in a much later style it was founded by margaret daughter and sole heir of william lord botreaux in 1464 she was interred within its walls in 1477 her history too full to note here is a sad one the loss of her movable goods by fyre in amesbury abbey being but a small incident among her many troubles a peculiarly interesting inventory of the ornaments and furniture that she gave to this chantry has been preserved it is printed in dugdales baronage vol ii p 207 and also in the wiltshire archological magazine vol xi the chapel in the somewhat florid late perpendicular style had a large east window of five lights and three of triple lights in its north wall the outside was adorned with shields and devices of the family and crested with battlements within it had a richlygroined roof and underneath a large arch cut in the north wall of the lady chapel and therefore opening into the hall of the chantry stood the monument of lord hungerford surmounted by an ornamental fourarched canopy this altar tomb now devoid of the gold and colour that once enriched it is in the nave its armour like a lobster with its peculiar pattern its large shoulders and elbowpieces and its jewelled girdle is quoted by meyrick as a very fine example of its period above were eight niches of demiquatrefoiled arches with

says it was undoubtedly a portion of the macaber dance as there was close to it another compartment belonging to the same subject this painting was made about the year 1460 and from the remaining specimen its destruction is greatly to be regretted as judging from the dress of the young gallant the dresses of the time would be correctly exhibited there were other wall paintings including a large st christopher with the christ child on his shoulder and an annunciation said to have been a fine work an interesting memorial of the chapel as it stood in the middle of the seventeenth century is to be found in an ms pocketbook still preserved in the british museum harl ms 939 which belonged to a captain symons of the royalist army when he visited salisbury in 1644 he made many notes and sketches of the armorial bearings in this chantry the beauchamp chapelthe interior view here reproduced from goughs sepulchral monuments of great britain although not very clear is curiously interesting conveying as it does trustworthy evidence of the building so wantonly swept away illustration interior of the demolished beauchamp chapel of the beauchamp chapel on the south side of the lady chapel there appears to be no exterior view extant but from sketches of its interior and descriptions it must have been a fine specimen of its period and worthy of its designer the builder of st georges chapel windsor it was larger and more elaborate in detail than the hungerford chantry but like it in plan and similarly lighted by one large east window and three in the side wall the remains of its founder bishop beauchamp reposed in a plain tomb in the centre in the wall on the north side were exquisite canopies above the tombs of the father and mother of the bishop an altar tomb of sir john cheyne now in the nave stood formerly at the southwest corner see page 48 there was a custom that on christmas day and all holy days the wives of the mayor and aldermen and gentry of the city came to prayers in the beauchamp chapel in the evening with flambeaux and torches excepting on innocents day when they went to their own parish churches in an interesting guide to the cathedral now in the british museum annotated in the last century by some visitor we find an entry concerning this chapel the ceiling is of irish oak and never known to have spiders or cobwebs in it much of the carved work in both these chantries was employed elsewhere in the buildings the plea put forward for their removal was founded on a report by francis price thirtysix years before wherein he considered them unsafe when the hungerford chantry was added one of the outside buttresses of the lady chapel aisle was removed to make room for it the opening pierced through the main walls of the cathedral into both the chapels were also sources of weakness wyatt seized upon these facts and with the precedent of prices report declared the chapels unsafe and also which was no doubt his real motive for action that their lack of uniformity injured the appearance of the buildings wyatts ideal virtues were of the lowest order to obtain neatness and tidiness he was prepared to sacrifice any and every thing and the two chapels were obviously not in the style of the cathedral nor unluckily for had they been they might yet be standing precisely symmetrical in effect so they were swept away these actions at salisbury and similar destruction at lincoln hereford and elsewhere have made wyatts name odious but deserving though he be of all blame it must not be forgotten that restorers of today even at salisbury have effaced much interesting work of past time on the same pretext that it failed to accord with the rest of the work to which it was obviously a late addition this plea specious and even excellent in theory has probably done more irreparable injury to our ancient buildings than even the iconoclasts of the reformation a shattered ruin may convey a clear idea of its original state while a smooth pedantic restoration will obliterate it entirely the stained glass throughout the whole building survives but in a few instances and these with two exceptions not in their original places of its wholesale destruction we have sad evidence extant in a letter dated 1788 from john berry glazier of salisbury to mr lloyd of conduit street london it may be transcribed in full to show how reckless the custodians of the fabric were at that timesir this day i have sent you a box full of old stained painted glass as you desired me to due which i hope will sute your purpos it his the best that i can get at present but i expect to beate to peceais a a great deal very sune as it his of now use to me and we do it for the lead if you want more of the same sorts you may have what thear is if it will pay for taking out as it is a deal of truble to what beating it to peceais his you will send me a line as soon as possoble for we are goain to move our glasing shop to a nother plase and thin we hope to save a great deal more of the like sort which i ham your most omble servantjohn berry illustration portions of the old stained glass the fragments that survived were collected some fifty years since and placed in the nave windows and in parts of some of the others the most important are in the great west triple lancet wherein the glass ranges in date from the twelfth to the fifteenth century mr winston in his paper read in 1849 before the archological institute and printed in the salisbury volume for that year considered that the earliest fragments are from a stem of jesse about 1240 and some medallions about 1270 he describes two of the ovals that are on each side of the throned bishop a prominent figure in the lower half of the central light one of the christ enthroned the other of the virgin the two medallions below them he believes represent zacharias in the temple and the adoration of the magi the later glass now in the same window may be either flemish work brought hither from dijon or possibly partly from rouen and partly from a church near exeter it has been conjectured that in the south lancet the figures represent ss peter and francis in the central one the crucifixion the coronation of the virgin and the invention of the cross and in the north light the betrayal of christ and st catherine in two of the side windows of the nave are the arms of john aprice 15551558 and bishop jewell 1562 the stained glass in the north choir aisle includes a window executed by messrs clayton and bell in memory of archdeacon huxtable with figures of archangels and angels in the upper lights and the angel appearing to gideon and the vision of isaiah in the lower panels also a window by clayton and bell to the memory of the wife of the rev chancellor swayne having for its subject the reply of our lord to his disciples in the east side of the morning chapel is a window by messrs burleson and gryles to the memory of mrs wr hamilton with the nativity crucifixion resurrection and the three archangels gabriel michael and raphael in the south choir aisle are two clayton and bell windows to the memory of george morrison and two others excellently treated both designed by holiday and executed by powell in the one eight panels represent four holy women of the old testament and the four maries this is to the memory of the late countess of radnor in the other to the memory of jacob the 4th earl of radnor a similar screen of decoration embodies figures of eight prophets in the southeast transept is a window erected to the officers of the wiltshire regiment who fell in the sutlej campaign in 18456 and in the crimean war of 18545 also one of the raising of lazarus in the upper windows of this transept is a quantity of old glass of different dates which had been stored away for over a century in the roof of the lady chapel until lately collected and placed where it now is the south choir aisle has a window in memory of the late duke of albany jacobs dream and two of the intended six windows of a hierarchy of angelsthe angeli ministrantes and the angeli laudantesdesigned by sir e burnejones and executed by william morris which are notably among the most superb examples of the art of glass painting since medival times next in order towards the east is a window of fine design to the memory of the late duke of albany in the southwest transept there are three clayton and bell windows in memory of archdeacon macdonald with three subjects from the life of christ in memory of bishop douglas and in memory of cg verrinder also one to the memory of sir ga arney with moses and the tables of the law and the sermon on the mount and the large south window by bell to the memory of dean hamilton above the altar is a fine light window of last century work singularly good of its kindbad though the kind may be in the south aisle of the nave is a window to the memory of mr wm coates with subjects the miracles of healing executed by messrs clayton and bell in 1890 a fine modern window from a design by henry holiday was inserted in the south aisle of the nave this has for its subject suffer little children to come unto me it is to the memory of john henry jacob and his wife in 1620 dr simpson mentions three great windows newly glazed in rich colours to make the story of st paul throughout the cathedral and in the chapter house were many specimens of geometrical painted glass some of which are figured in mr winstons paper before referred to these have served as motives for much modern design which faithfully as it may have copied the forms has generally missed the softened colour that distinguishes the original work illustration tomb of william longespe 1st earl of salisbury p 47 from a photograph by catherine weed ward history of the see the site of old sarumsearobyrig the dry city as the saxons called itis about a mile to the north of the present new sarum or salisbury to use the more familiar name it was probably a fortified place from very early times long before it became the roman station of sorbiodunum william of malmesbury says that the town was more like a castle than a city being environed with a high wall and notwithstanding that it was very well accommodated with other conveniences yet such was the want of water that it sold at a great rate this latter statement although repeated by every chronicler is not supported by investigations of recent explorers who found an ample supply in divers wells francis price concludes that it was frequented by roman emperors from the coins of constantine constans magnentius crispus and claudius being found frequently among its ruins this statement also lacks probability a legend of the visit of a single emperor might have been barely credible but the lavish variety the otherwise trustworthy historian offers is fatal to ones belief its early history more or less legendary need not be chronicled here probably kenric the saxon who captured it in 553 lived there and it seems to have been kept in his line until egbert united the whole heptarchy king alfred ordered leofric earl of wiltunscire to add to its fortifications which appear to have fallen into decay after the romans held it in 1003 svein king of denmark pillaged and burnt it but the religious establishments if not spared were soon reestablished for we find that editha queen of dward the confessor conveyed the lands of shorstan to the nuns of st mary sarum at this time it appears to have possessed a mint as a coin of dward the confessor bears an inscription showing that it was struck by godred at sarum from the time of st aldhelm in 705 to that of herman in 1058 there are no other facts of its secular history sufficiently pertinent to our purpose to warrant their quotation here as the record of the place is so woven into the lives of its bishops that the brief summary of the ecclesiastics who held the see includes all we need of the history of the city in this kingdom within a kingdom a cathedral surrounded by a fortress its inhabitants were naturally split into factions the soldiers and the clergy failed to agree and in spite of the document quoted below there is little doubt that political rather than climatic reasons led to the removal of the cathedral whether as some writers think it was but an insignificant structure it is certainly recorded that the church erected by osmund took fifteen years to build five days after its consecration on april 5th 1092 it was partially destroyed by a thunderstorm we find in robert of gloucesters chronicle hearnes ed p 416 this allusion to the disaster so gret lytnynge was the vyfte yer so that it al to nogte the rof the church of salesbury it broute rygt evene the vyfte day that he yhalwed was whether the sentence in an old chronicler that roger made anew the church of sarum means it was so seriously damaged by the lightning that he actually rebuilt it or merely that he restored it is not clear roger was the great architectural genius of his time and from the evidence of its ground plan traced in the foundations revealed in the singularly dry summer of 1834 it may be that the stately edifice 270 feet long by 75 feet wide on the plan of a latin cross was in its last state not the work of osmund during the excavations at this time various fragments of stained glass and several keys were discovered also what was apparently the original grave of st osmund before his body was moved to sarum an extract from harrisons description of britain prefixed to hollinsheds chronicle shows clearly enough the principal events that produced the crisis which doomed old sarum to desolation in the time of ciuile warres the souldirs of the castell and chanons of old sarum fell at ods inasmuch that often after brawles they fell at last to sadde blowes it happened therefore in a rogation weeke that the cleargie going in solemn procession a controversie fell between them about certaine walkes and limits which the one side claimed and the other denied such also was the hot entertainment on eche part that at last the castellans espieing their time gate betweene the cleargie and the towne and so coiled them as they returned homewards that they feared anie more to gang their boundes for that year hereupon the peope missing their bellychere for they were wont to haue banketing at every station a thing practised by the religious in old tyme they conveyed forthwith a deadly hatred against the castellans but not being able to cope with them by force of arms they consulted with their bishop that it was not ere the chanons began a church upon a piece of their own ground and thus became old sarum in a few years utterly desolate by other accounts we find there was insufficient room for all the canons to live within the walls and the right of free egress being disputed the position became so intolerable that bishop richard poore a man of great force of character who succeeded his brother took up the design herbert had set aside and commenced negotiations in earnest the result of which is best explained by the following document honorius bishop servant of the servants of god to our rev brother richard bishop and to our beloved sons the dean and chapter of sarum health and apostolical benediction my sons the dean and chapter it having been heretofore alleged before us on your behalf that forasmuch as your church is built within the compass of the fortifications of sarum it is subject to so many inconveniences and oppressions that you cannot reside in the same without corporal perils for being situated on a lofty place it is as it were continually shaken by the collision of the winds so that while you are celebrating the divine offices you cannot hear one another the place itself is so noisy and besides the persons resident there suffer such perpetual oppressions that they are hardly able to keep in repair the roof of the church which is constantly torn by tempestuous winds they are also forced to buy water at as great a price as would be sufficient to purchase the common drink of the country nor is there any access to the same without the licence of the castellan so that it happens on ash wednesday when the lords supper is administered at the time of the synods and celebrations of orders and on other solemn days the faithful being willing to visit the said church entrance is denied them by the keepers of the castle alleging that the fortress is in danger besides you have not there houses sufficient for you wherefore you are forced to rent several houses of the laity and that on account of these and other inconveniences many absent themselves from the service of the said church this mandate dated at the lateran 4th of the calend of april in the second year of our pontificat concludes by giving formal power for the translation of the church to another convenient place after the cathedral was removed the prosperity of the place quickly waned the new roads and bridges made access to the new city more convenient wilton suffered from the growth of its new rival but sarum ceased to be even a ruin as the very stones of its cathedral were ultimately taken to build a wall around the precincts of the new church and oblivion soon overtook the ancient city which today is not even a hamlet but at most a geographical expression as a specimen of an early burgh or hill fortress its form well deserves study its circular walls and various ditches and ramparts are shown in plans in the county history in francis prices book and elsewhere illustration tomb of the boy bishop p 49 from a photograph by catherine weed ward the diocese of sarum so far as its history concerns us here it suffices to note that the greater part of wiltshire and those portions of dorset and somerset which had been comprised in the see of winchester were about the year 705 during the reign of ina king of the west saxons included in the new diocese of sherbourne which in its turn about two hundred years after circa 9059 was subdivided into those of wells for somerset and crediton for devon about 920 a new see was allotted to wiltshire whose bishop took his title from ramsbury near marlborough on the borders of the county and with this was soon after reunited the smaller diocese of sherbourne and in 1075 the episcopal seat was removed to the fortress of old sarum whence in 1218 it was again removed to the present city in 1542 part of the see was devoted to the new diocese of bristol the see of sherbourne ruled over by st aldhelm from 705 to 709 was a much larger one than the second diocese of the same name which in 1058 was united to ramsbury under herman who held it from 1058 to 1078 the eight previous bishops are more or less well known and in the admirable diocesan history and in the fasti ecclesi sarisburiensis both by the late rev wh jones there is much interesting detail of the earlier rulers of the diocese now called salisbury herman by birth a fleming was one of the ecclesiastics brought over by edward the confessor his record is unmarked by events that left lasting results he made a bold but fruitless attempt to annex the abbey of malmesbury during his time as an old writer quaintly phrases it it is agreed by all authors both printed and in manuscript that there was not yet any cathedral church or chapter either within or without the kings castle of old sarum but only a chapel and a dean later authorities however assign to him the commencement at least of a cathedral in benson and hatchers wiltshire we find it has been conjectured that herman on removing his see to sarum found there a chapel and a dean and that in exchange for this building he transferred the two cathedrals of sherborne and sunning to the dean to whose peculiar jurisdiction they have since belonged other evidence however points to the church having been begun and finished by osmund his successor whose own words in the charter of foundation run i have built the church at sarum and constituted canons therein an epistle of gregory ix to the bishops of bath and wells states that osmund of pious memory had employed great care as well in temporals as in spirituals so that he had magnificently builded the said church from its foundations and enriched it with books treasures and lands from his own property herman like other english bishops who were his fellownatives leofric at exeter and giso at wells was not deprived of his see after the conquest but in 1075 in obedience to the decree of the council of london that bishops sees should be removed from obscure to more important places he chose the hill of sarum his remains are said to have been transferred to a tomb in the present cathedral but later antiquarians decline to endorse the tradition osmund who is believed to have been the nephew of william the conqueror was son of henry count of seez in normandy he was created earl of wiltshire soon after the conquest before he became an ecclesiastic camden speaks of him as the earl of dorset as the author of the consuetudinariam the ordinal of offices for the use of sarum wherein he collated the various forms of ritual in use at many churches both in england and on the continent he won a fame far more than the building of old sarum were it never so stately a cathedral could have secured him his famous sarum use was adopted by almost the whole of england and reflected glory upon the church that instituted it so that in the words of an old historian like the sun in his heavens the church of salisbury is conspicuous above all other churches in the world diffusing the light everywhere and supplying their defects the original manuscript of this great work is one of the choicest treasures of the cathedral library exhibited to those who have access to that collection it is also available to the ordinary student in a volume entitled the church of our fathers published by dr rock in 1849 as a man says william of malmesbury osmund was rigid in the detection of his own faults and unsparing to those of others although his body and his tomb were moved to the lady chapel of the new cathedral in 1226 and his name adored popularly he was not canonized until over two hundred years later pope callistus the first of the borgias issued the bull on january 1st 1456 but not according to rumour until ample funds had been supplied to facilitate his action some interesting correspondence relating to it has been lately printed in the sarum charters and documents issued under the direction of the master of the rolls the bull itself in the keeping of the chapter has been printed in volume iii of the great collection of papal bulls edited by cocqueline and published in rome 1743 on july 15th 1457 according to the authority of a writer in archologia vol xiv the translation of his body was completed principally at the expense of the bishop a huge concourse of people being present at the festival from the plentiful accounts of miracles worked at his shrine long before he was officially canonized there is but little doubt but that it had become a favourite place of pilgrimage he died in 1099 and in spite of his tomb being removed to the cathedral in 1226 and a stately shrine erected later a stone with no inscription but a date of doubtful authenticitymxcixis all that commemorates him there today the next bishop was roger who was elected in 1102 consecrated in 1107 and died in 1139 if his fame as an ecclesiastic is not so assured as that of his illustrious predecessor in architecture and in secular history he has left a decided mark he was a poor norman priest who won his mitre by singing a hunting mass quickly before henry i made chaplain by the king on his accession he afterwards became first chancellor and then justiciary he organized the court of exchequer which has preserved the earliest official records known to us his castles at devizes sherborne and malmesbury excited the jealousy of the nobles his son was chancellor one nephew bishop of ely and another nephew bishop of lincoln besides much work now destroyed at old sarum so that whether he merely restored the damage caused by lightning or rebuilt it from the foundations according to the norman custom we cannot tell his additions to sherborne minster are still memorable as a new departure in norman architecture in fact he has been called the great architectural genius of the thirteenth century unscrupulous fierce and avaricious he is a type of the great feudal churchmen when they were veritable rulers according to william of malmesbury was there anything contiguous to his property which might be advantageous to him he would directly extort it either by entreaty or purchase or if that failed by force although after king henrys death henry bishop of winchester persuaded him to open the vast treasure of the late king to stephen yet in the fourth year of his reign stephen imprisoned him and the bishop of lincoln his nephew and seized their castles of devizes and sherborne newark and sleaford bishop roger the same year according to one chronicler by the kindness of death escaped the quartan ague which had long afflicted him and died brokenhearted but another version says that he starved to death through a promise to king stephen that his castle of devizes should be surrendered to him before he eat or drank but his nephew the bishop of ely who then had possession of it kept it three days before he made the surrender to the king jocelin de bohun or as he is sometimes called de bailleul 1142 to 1184 is best known from his quarrel with thomas becket of canterbury for his share in framing the constitutions of clarendon he was excommunicated by the archbishop on the death of roger in 1139 king stephen nominated philip de harcourt but the canons preferred jocelin who was not however consecrated until 1142 after the murder of abecket he purged himself by oath of his offences towards his late foe in 1184 he retired to a cistercian monastery and died shortly afterwards a monument on the south side of the cathedral nave is attributed to him the see was now left vacant for five years when hubert walter was consecrated in 1189 he shortly after went to the holy land to join richard i in his crusade while at acre he was nominated to the vacant archbishopric of canterbury to which he returned in 1193 he exercised a powerful influence on both king and people the latter with whom he had never been popular found at his death that they had lost the only bulwark strong enough to resist or break the attack of royal despotism herbert de la poer or poore 11941217 who succeeded him ruled in a troubled period when the realm was under the interdict of pope innocent iii compelled to quit old sarum he died at wilton in 1217 illustration monument locally accredited to bishop poore with richard poore who was consecrated bishop of chichester in 1215 and in 1217 bishop of old sarum where he had been dean begins the record of the bishops immediately connected with the building his history is so intimately bound up with that of the cathedral that here it is sufficient to note that he ruled at old sarum and salisbury until 1229 when he was translated to durham10 his distinct influence upon the architecture of that cathedral in connection with elias de derham is noticed elsewhere he died at his birthplace tarrant tarent crawford11 in dorsetshire where he had founded a cistercian nunnery in which his heart is said to have been interred his body was taken to durham and a monument with his effigy erected in the new cathedral at salisbury the names of st osmund and richard poore stand out beyond all others in connection with this see the one for the indirect glory he conferred upon it by his memorable ordinal the other by his removal of the cathedral and the superb fabric he left to commemorate his fame with them excepting possibly bishop hallam the record of men of mark ceases of their successors hardly one has had a reputation beyond his diocese and certainly there is not one whose fame has spread beyond his native land illustration north choir aisle with bishop binghams monument robert bingham 12291246 finished the work of the cathedral during his eighteen years rule but when he died he left it in debt 1700 marks his monument with effigy is now in the north choir aisle william of york 12471256 was one of the chaplains to henry ii by his renewal of the vexatious custom of attending the lords courts he became very unpopular matthew paris mentions him as one of the favourites of the king and bishop godwin says that he was better versed in the laws of the realm than in those of god giles of bridport or de bridlesford 12571262 who held also the deanery of wells by a faculty in commendam for pope honorius continued the works of the cathedral until it was consecrated in 1258 by boniface archbishop of savoy the brother of the queen of edward i he also founded the college of vaux in 1260 during his bishopric there is a curious entry in a document lately printed which refers to nicholas of york canon of salisbury le engineur in the same volume rolls chronicles 1891 there is a note of this bishop granting 200 lbs of wax annually from his wardrobe for increasing the lights in the church as he had been told that amount would be sufficient to double the number of the candles at each ministration walter de la wyle 12631271 the founder of the church of st edmund of abingdon has a mutilated effigy assigned to him in the cathedral robert de wykehampton 12741284 although elected by the canons the monks of canterbury and the king was opposed by the archbishop who after four years interval and an appeal to rome was forced to consecrate him he is said to have become blind in 1278 walter scammel 12841286 although on his election the monks of canterbury appealed to the pope against it they subsequently withdrew their opposition he was buried near the audley chapel henry de braundeston 1287 who died the same year was buried according to leland in the lady chapel walter de la corner 12891291 was one of the chaplains of the pope he was buried in the middle of the choir nearly under the eagle nicholas longespe 12921297 was fourth and youngest son of the first earl of salisbury and countess ela simon of ghent or de gand 12971315 first empowered the mayor and citizens to fortify the city according to a document printed in the rolls chronicles 1891 the visitation of many of the churches about 1300 compares badly with a similar record for 1220 ignorance of the clergy gross neglect of the fabric insufficient and dilapidated books and vestments with other evidences of lack of energy are very frequent roger mortival 13151330 founded a collegiate establishment at knowsley his birthplace the library of merton college oxford contains many manuscripts his gift while he was archdeacon of leicester he is said also to have drawn up the statutes by which the cathedral is still partly governed robert wyville or wivil 13301375 was by walsinghams account not merely destitute of learning but so deformed and ugly it is hard to say whether he was more dunce or dwarf more unlearned or unhandsome that had the pope seen him he would never have endorsed his appointment he was a militant bishop and in 1355 instituted a suit against william de montacute and sent his champion clothed in white to try wager of battle with him he recovered for his see 2500 marks and the ancient castle of old sarum also that of sherborne he obtained permission to fortify his manors of sarum sherborne woodford chardstock potterne canning sunning and his mansion in fleet street now salisbury court in the suburbs of london his brass is in the morning chapel ralph erghum 13751388 was probably of flemish birth he was translated to bath and wells in 1388 where he died in 1400 he is said to have erected the city cross as a penance but the sarum register seems rather to indicate that he compelled the earl of salisbury to do so john waltham 13881395 was master of the rolls in 1382 and keeper of the privy seal in 1391 for a time he resisted the metropolitan visitation of archbishop courtney notwithstanding that the bishop of exeter had been forced to yield in a similar contest but when the archbishop excommunicated him he was compelled to submit he was specially in the favour of his king richard ii and died lord high treasurer in 1305 he was buried not without much general dissatisfaction according to walsingham in westminster abbey where his brass can be seen in the floor of the chapel of the confessor to the right of king edwards tomb richard mitford 13951407 was the favourite and confessor of richard ii but during the socalled wonderful parliament he was imprisoned in bristol castle until released by the king on his reassumption of power in 1389 he was nominated to the see of chichester and translated therefrom to salisbury in 1395 his tomb stands in an angle of the south transept nicholas bubwith 1407 at one time treasurer of england held salisbury for three months only between the bishoprics of london and bath and wells he died at wells 1424 robert hallam 14071417 notwithstanding his brilliant career both the origin and birthplace of this prelate are unknown born in england of royal blood says one chronicler but there is no corroborative evidence prebendary of york archdeacon of canterbury in 1401 chancellor of oxford 1403 he left england in 1406 for rome and was nominated by pope gregory xii to be archbishop of york this latter preferment was withdrawn but in its stead he became bishop of salisbury in 1407 he was at the council of pisa in 1409 and in 1411 was created a cardinal by pope john xxiii at the famous council of constance 14151417 he was one of the foremost champions of religious liberty and almost alone in condemning the punishment of death for heresy indeed the whole future of the roman church is said to have been changed by his death at the castle of gotlieb in 1417 and the supremacy of the italian party assured by the decease of its most formidable opponent the brass that marks his burial place in constance cathedral is supposed to have been executed in england and sent thence some time after his death it is engraved in kites monumental brasses of wiltshire john chandler 14171426 is remembered chiefly for his brief life of william of wykeham robert neville 14271438 was the nephew of henry iv after holding the see of salisbury for ten years he was translated to durham he founded the monastery at sunning william ayscough 14381450 who has left little record of his life met his death during a local rising in 1450 the year of the jack cade rebellion on the feast of ss peter and paul his church at edingdon near westbury one of his palaces was attacked by a mob who seized the bishop in the vestments wherein he had just said mass and dragging him to a hilltop near there they stoned and beheaded him stripping off his garments and dividing them among themselves for memorials his body was afterwards interred at edingdon possibly his scholarship which separated him from his people was the real cause of his unpopularity which is however generally attributed to his frequent absence with king henry vi to whom he was confessor richard beauchamp 14501481 was translated from the bishopric of hereford son of sir walter and grandson of lord beauchamp of powick he was sent on diplomatic missions to various courts including burgundy in 1471 he was one of the signatories of the truce with the duke of brittany in 1477 he became dean of windsor and was appointed by edward iv master of the works then in progress which included the rebuilding of st georges chapel at salisbury he left the great hall of the bishops palace and his own superb chantry as memorials of his architectural skill elsewhere in this book is a fuller description of this beautiful tomb demolished by wyatt he himself was buried at windsor in an arch opposite his tomb was a missal carved in stone with a quaint inscription beginning who leyde this boke here he is said to have been the first chancellor of the order of the garter although dr milner assigns that honour to william de edingdon whether the first or not he and his successors in the see held it by charter of edward until they were deprived in the reign of henry viii in 1671 it was again awarded to the see of salisbury but passed in 1836 with berkshire to that of oxford lionel woodville or wydville 14821484 nephew of elizabeth queen of edward iv was appointed to the see in 1482 his brotherinlaw the duke of buckingham was beheaded in salisbury market place just before the battle of bosworth woodville is said to have died of grief occasioned by the downfall of the fortunes of his house on the accession of richard iii thomas langton 14851493 is best remembered as a patron of literature for which he has been called a second mcenas yet despite the fostering hand he always afforded to learned men he was an opponent of wicklifs heresies and did his best to stamp them out in his see when they had gained a number of adherents john blyth 14941499 was chancellor of ireland in 1499 an effigy assumed to be his is in the north transept henry dean or denny or syer 15001501 was translated to canterbury shortly after his appointment to salisbury he is believed to have been one of the victims of the great plague and to have died at lambeth in 1503 edmund audley 15021524 was bishop of rochester in 1480 translated to hereford in 1492 and to salisbury in 1502 his beautiful chantry still remains in its original position st marys oxford contains a pulpit said to be his gift lorenzo campegio cardinal of st anastatius was nominated by pope clement in 1524 he was sent to england to join cardinal wolsey in adjudicating upon the royal divorce in 1535 when henry viii disgraced wolsey campegio was also deprived of his see by act of parliament at rome however he was regarded as bishop of salisbury until his death and for some time after an independent succession was maintained by the pope in two english bishoprics namely salisbury and worcester nicholas shaxton 15351539 was president of gonville hall cambridge and for a while a sturdy supporter of the king at the time of latimers resignation he also resigned in common with many other bishops he was imprisoned and in 1546 condemned to be burnt for denying the real presence but recanting became prominent as opponent of the reformers preaching fiery sermons at the martyrdom of anne askew and others after he resigned his see he became suffragan to the bishop of ely he died at cambridge in 1556 john capon or salcote 15391557 had been bishop of bangor his record is notorious for its greed and timeserving first orthodox then protestant and one of the revisers of the liturgy under edward vi again changing under mary and one of the judges at the trial of bishop hooper of gloucester fuller impeaches him with veysey or harman of exeter saying it seems as if it were given to binominous bishops to be impairers of their churches peter peto 1557 a cardinal nominated by the pope was refused possession by queen mary who appointed francis malet dean of lincoln in his stead but he in turn before his consecration was ejected by elizabeth who had succeeded to the throne meanwhile john jewel 15601571 is one of the few protestant bishops connected with this see who can claim more than diocesan fame he was born at berry narbor devonshire in 1522 and appears to have belonged to a good old family when a fellow of corpus at oxford his adherence to the doctrines of the reformation caused him to be expelled but so greatly was he beloved for his pure life and his profound scholarship there that in spite of his expulsion he was chosen to be public orator at his university his life is too widely known to need an epitome here among his writings the most famous the apology for the church of england published in 1562 was quickly translated into every language in europe in episcopal matters he took great interest and built the library over the cloisters12 besides devoting great care to the education of students having always a number of poor lads in his house and maintaining others at oxford one of whom was the famous judicious hooker fuller praises him in terms that seem however extravagant to be generally admitted by his contemporaries to be fully deserved and the famous sentence it is hard to say whether his soul or his ejaculations arrived first in heaven seeing he prayed dying and died praying shows that he was reverenced by the reformed church as a veritable saint he died at monkton fairleigh in 1571 his tombstone despoiled of its brass is now near that of bishop wyvil whence it was removed from its former place in the choir edmund gheast or gest 15711577 the first protestant bishop of rochester was translated to salisbury where he gave a fine collection of books to the new library of the cathedral his tombstone is in the north choir aisle john piers 15771589 preached before queen elizabeth at the solemn thanksgiving for the defeat of the spanish armada he was translated to york in 1589 john coldwell 15911596 a physician before he became a cleric is also noticeable as the first married bishop who held the see he was accused of wasting its revenues and is responsible for the loss of sherborne castle which he alienated says fuller owing to the wily intrigues of sir walter raleigh henry cotton 15981615 was one of the chaplains of elizabeth and a godson of the queen of whom she is reported to have remarked that she had blessed many of her godsons now one should bless her sir john harrington says he had nineteen children by one wife which is no ordinary blessing and most of them sonnes his wifes name was patience the name of which i have heard in few wives the quality in none as the second married bishop he certainly appears to have supported fully the protestant opposition to the celibacy of the clergy robert abbott 16151618 was the elder brother of george archbishop of canterbury fuller says george was the more plausible preacher robert the greater scholar george the abler statesman robert the deeper divine gravity did frown in george and smile in robert as one might infer from so strong an opponent of laud amid the large number of his published works most are polemical and antiromish martin fotherby 16181620 held the see but a year and hence left no lasting impression upon it robert townson 16201621 who attended the execution of sir walter raleigh and has left a graphic and touching account of his last hours was but ten months bishop when he died says fuller who was his nephew of a fever contracted by unseasonable sitting up to study when preparing a sermon to preach before parliament john davenant 16211641 attended the synod of dort at the bidding of james i and was the author of many theological works brian duppa or de uphaugh 16411660 was tutor to the sons of charles i and appointed to salisbury just before the commonwealth he was deprived almost immediately and lived in seclusion at richmond until at the restoration he was translated to winchester his memorial tablet is in westminster of him izaak walton said he was one of those men in whom there was such a commixture of general learning of natural eloquence and christian humility that they deserve a commemoration by a pen equal to their own which none have exceeded humphrey henchman 16601663 was appointed at the restoration no doubt as a reward for his great services to king charles after the battle of worcester after holding the see three years he was translated to london john earles 16631665 appointed bishop of worcester at the restoration was translated to salisbury in 1663 one of his books the microcosmographie or a piece of the world discovered in essays and characters first published anonymously in 1628 was extremely popular and ran through many editions it is still read as a faithful picture of its times hallam in his literary history praises it highly clarendon in his memoirs also eulogizes its author and izaak walton in his life of hooper speaks of his innocent wisdom sanctified learning and pious peaceable and primitive temper earles was constantly with prince charles during his exile and hence one of the first ecclesiastics to receive preferment alexander hyde 16651667 was first cousin to the famous lord chancellor clarendon a portrait alleged to represent this prelate was found by bishop fuller in an obscure cottage it is now in the bishops palace seth ward 16671689 who was made bishop of exeter at the restoration and translated to salisbury in 1667 took great interest in the fabric and restored the bishops palace the survey of the cathedral by sir christopher wren was undertaken by his request and at his own cost he regained for his see the chancellorship of the order of the garter lost for a century and a half he founded the college of matrons and at his death at knightsbridge in 1688 was buried in the south choir aisle dr walter popes biography of this bishop is an interesting record of an eventful life gilbert burnet 16891715 lord macaulay has summed up the character of this bishop in terms that if they convey an impression of a vain indiscreet and somewhat blundering partisan yet do justice to the vigour and strength of his character while of the history of his own times and many other volumes yet remembered he says a writer whose voluminous works in several branches of literature find numerous readers one hundred and thirty years after his death may have had great faults but must also have had great merits william talbot 17151721 was of the house of shrewsbury and father of lord chancellor talbot he was translated to durham in 1721 richard willis 17211723 held the see for two years when he was translated to winchester benjamin hoadly bishop of bangor 1716 hereford 1721 sarum 1723 owing to the controversy raised

and was translated to london in 1748 in the most apathetic time of the anglican church he is a striking example of activity and earnestness john gilbert 17491757 was a turbulent bishop whose record is full of disputes with the civic authorities at salisbury john thomas 17571761 bishop of peterborough 1746 and afterwards bishop of winchester was married four times and is reported to have said that he had killed three wives by never contradicting them robert hay drummond 1761 was translated to the archbishopric of york four months after his appointment to salisbury he preached at the coronation of george iii john thomas 17611766 elected bishop of st asaph in 1743 but consecrated to lincoln was eighty years old when translated to salisbury john hume 17661782 bishop of bristol 1756 bishop of oxford and dean of st pauls 1758 shute barrington 17821791 translated to durham excepting bishop wilson his fiftysix years tenure of office is the longest in the anglican church he died in 1826 john douglas 17911807 was present as an army chaplain at the battle of fontenoy in which he very nearly took an active part but was so laden with valuables left in his care by officers that he was compelled to refrain and be content to remain a noncombatant and remove his treasures to a safe place as author of the criterion or rules by which true may be distinguished from spurious miracles 1754 and many other books he established for himself a sound literary reputation made bishop of carlisle in 1787 and translated to salisbury in 1791 he was also dean of windsor from 1780 to his death when he was buried in st georges chapel john fisher 18071825 exeter 1803 preceptor to princess charlotte thomas burgess 18251837 st davids 1803 edward denison 18371854 brother of a late speaker of the

monkton 12 this statement is open to doubt the close and churches the kings house which faces the west front on the western side of the close is a stately building wherein tradition says monarchs have dwelt richard iii is said to have been housed there when the duke of buckingham was brought prisoner to salisbury and in the reign of james i its owner sir thomas sadler was often honoured by visits from that monarch underneath the great gateway which pierces the building in the north wall is the shaft of a sack lift a curious relic of medival times the fine proportions and sturdy treatment of the architecture of this house deserve study it is now used as a training establishment for school mistresses close by is the deanery and to the south a building known as the wardrobe house which name is supposed to indicate its use in connection with the kings house still farther south is leden hall or leyden hall hidden behind trees so that from the close you can but catch a glimpse of the building by elias de derham to which reference has been made earlier in this book in the other direction are the theological college a very lovely and spacious building the choristers school and many private houses of great antiquity and considerable beauty indeed it is possible that at no other place could you find such a display of english domestic architecture from medival to georgian times the beauty of the close well wooded as it still is despite the havoc wrought by the terrible gale in march 1897 is not to be put into words no matter how praise were lavished in a description it would yet be inadequate but whether you see it for the first time or after many visits it still keeps its place as the most perfect thing of its sort in the world the high street gate which from its position may be regarded as the chief entrance to the close is an embattled structure of two stories built as the pieces of norman stone work clearly show from material brought from old sarum in the niche above the arch on the south side is a figure popularly supposed to represent charles i although its proportions more nearly resemble those of james i it is said that a statue of henry iii originally occupied the niche to the left as you have passed the gateway stands the picturesque matrons college founded and endowed by bishop seth ward in 1685 also on the left is a house formerly occupied by canon bowles and still earlier by archdeacon cole both salisbury worthies with more than local reputation st anns gate is in the east wall of the close in the southern angle it is a long low twostoried building with two light perpendicular windows in the upper story and from the street outside where a projecting window is a noticeable feature is very picturesque in common with the other gates and with the walls of the close norman stones moulded and carved are visible in many places a house near the south side was occupied by fielding who moved afterwards next door to the friary in st anns street and finally to another at milford hill where he wrote tom jones harnham gate near the south boundary is but a fragment an embattled archway devoid of an upper story near this gateway just outside the precincts stood the ancient college of de vaux founded in 1260 by bishop bridport the bishops palace is not visible from the close but can be seen through a doorway in the cloisters it is set in the midst of delightful gardens a rambling picturesque building dating from many periods bishop poore began itbishop beauchamp built its great hall within its walls are portraits of all the bishops of salisbury since the restoration the hospital of st nicholas is situated between harnham gate and harnham bridge the charter of its endowment dates from the castle of old sarum in september 1227 it still shelters a dozen inmates in a most picturesque house part of the original structure on an islet is a more modern building which is on the foundation of the chapel of st john suppressed at the reformation the church house as it is now called was formerly known as audley house and belonged to the earl of castlehaven who was beheaded in 1631 and his property divided between the bishop and others it is most picturesquely placed by crane bridge illustration south front high street gate north front from photographs by carl norman and co the poultry cross is still standing near the market place at one time a sundial and ball crowned the structure but these have been replaced by a cross close by it and scattered frequently throughout the streets of the city are overhanging houses that betray their antiquity at a glance illustration the church house from a photograph by witcomb and son salisbury the guildhall a very interesting building as engravings show was demolished at the end of the eighteenth century the joiners hall the tailors hall the hall of john halle the old george are still standing with some of their features modified but not sufficiently altered to deprive them of interest the church of st thomas becket is a most picturesque structure and placed as it is in a square of old tiled houses makes a delightful picture it consists of a nave with two aisles a chancel with aisles and a vestry room it was built in 1240 by bishop bingham the embattlemented tower has in its south front two niches containing much mutilated figures of the virgin and child and st thomas becket in the porch is a very curious panel with a biblical subject rudely carved by humphrey beckham who died aged eightyeight in 1671 and left this as his memorial the most striking feature of the interior is the large painting above the chancel arch representing the day of judgment in the nave manner of its time a reproduction will be found in hoares modern wiltshire vol 6 and most works on ecclesiastical mural decoration mention it as one of the most important examples that have come down to us other paintings in the south aisle were brought to light by mr ge street during the restoration in 1867 without and within it is a building hardly less worth study than the cathedral itself illustration the poultry cross from a photograph by carl norman and co st edmund founded by bishop de la wyle in 1268 for a provost and twelve secular canons is at the northeast of the city to the east of its churchyard is the college of st edmunds on the site of the convent founded in 1268 by the same bishop in the grounds of the college stands the old north transept porch of the cathedral a picturesque ruin whose architecture at once disposes of the theory that it came from old sarum illustration old plan of salisbury st martin is another church of very ancient foundation containing an interesting norman font it is impossible to close even the most brief note of objects of interest at or near salisbury without naming george herberts church bemerton and stonehenge two places which attract pilgrims from all parts of the world yet no space is left to describe them or to refer to henry lawes musician and philip massinger dramatist two of the many famous men who had the city for their birthplace the cathedral has been the main object of this volume
