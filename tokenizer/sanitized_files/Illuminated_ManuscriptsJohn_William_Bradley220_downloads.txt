be comparedthe aim of illuminationdistinction between illumination and miniaturedefinition of illuminationthe first miniature painterorigin of the term miniatureovids allusion to his little book the desire for decoration is probably as old as the human race nature of course is the source of beauty and this natural beauty affects something within us which has or is the faculty of reproducing the cause of its emotion in a material form whether the reproduction be such as to appeal to the eye or the ear depends on the cast of the faculty in a mild or elementary form probably both casts of faculty exist in every animated creature and especially in the human being art being the intelligent representation of that quality of beauty which appeals to any particular observer whoever exercises the faculty of such representation is an artist greatness or otherwise is simply the measure of the faculty for in nature herself there is no restriction there is always enough of beauty in nature to fill the mightiest capacity of human genius artists therefore are measured by comparison with each other in reference to the fraction of art which they attempt to reproduce the art of illumination does not aim at more than the gratification of those who take pleasure in books its highest ambition is to make books beautiful to some persons perhaps all ordinary books are ugly and distasteful probably they are so to the average schoolboy hence the laudable endeavour among publishers of schoolbooks to make them attractive the desire that books should be made attractive is of great antiquity how far back in the worlds history we should have to go to get in front of it we cannot venture to reckon the methods of making books attractive are numerous and varied that to which we shall confine our attention is a rather special one both its processes and its results are peculiar mere pictures or pretty ornamental letters in sweet colours and elegant drawing do not constitute illumination though they do form essential contributions towards it and indeed in the sixteenth century the clever practitioners who wished in bright colours to awaken up the old woodcuts used to call themselves illuminists and the old german books which taught how the work should be done were called illuminir bcher illuminists were not illuminators in the twelfth century when as far as we know the word illuminator was first applied to one who practised the art of book decoration it meant one who lighted up the page of the book with bright colours and burnished gold these processes suggest the definition of the art perfect illumination must contain both colours and metals to this extent it is in perfect unison with the other medival art of heraldry it might almost be called a twinsister as an art it is much older than its name we find something very like it even among the ancient egyptians for in the louvre at paris is a papyrus containing paintings of funeral ceremonies executed in bright colours and touched in its high lights with pencilled gold but after this for many centuries there remains no record of the existence of any such art until just before the christian era then indeed we have mention of a lady artist who painted a number of miniature portraits for the great biographical work of the learned varro we must carefully observe however that there is a distinction between illumination and mere miniature painting sometimes it is true that miniaturesas eg those of the early byzantine artists and afterwards those of western europewere finished with touches of gold to represent the lights this brought them into the category of illuminations for while miniatures may be executed without the use of gold or silver illuminations may not there are thousands of miniatures that are not illuminations at the period when illuminating was at its best the miniature in its modern sense of a little picture was only just beginning to appear as a noticeable feature and the gold was as freely applied to it as to the penmanship or the ornament but such is not the case with miniature painting generally lala of cyzicus the lady artist just referred to lived in the time of augustus csar she has the honour of being the first miniaturist on record and is said to have produced excellent portraits in little especially those of ladies on both vellum and ivory her own portrait representing her engaged in painting a statuette is still to be seen among the precious frescoes preserved in the museum at naples the term miniature now applied to this class of work has been frequently explained it is derived from the latin word minium or red paint two pigments being anciently known by this nameone the sulphide of mercury now known also as vermilion the other a lead oxide now called red lead it is the latter which is generally understood as the minium of the illuminators though both were used in manuscript work the red paint was employed to mark the initial letters or sections of the ms its connection with portraiture and other pictorial subjects on a small scale is entirely owing to its accidental confusion by french writers with their own word mignon and so with the latin minus in classical times among the romans the miniator was simply a person who applied the minium and had nothing to do with pictures or portraits at all but with the writing that the rubrication of titles however was somewhat of a luxury may be gathered from the complaint of ovid when issuing the humble edition of his verses from his lonely exile of tomi parve nec invideo sine me liber ibis in urbem hei mihi quo domino non licet ire tuo nec te purpureo velent vaccinia succo non est conveniens luctibus ille color nec titulus minio nec cedro carta notetur candida nec nigra cornua fronte geras1 tristia cl 1 eleg 1 1 go little book nor do i forbidgo without me into that city where alas i may enter never more nor shall whortleberries adorn thee with their crimson juice that colour is not suitable for lamentations nor shall thy title be marked with minium nor thy leaf scented with cedaroil nor shalt thou bear horns of ivory or ebony upon thy front there are many allusions in these pathetic lines which would bear annotation but space forbids the one point is the use of minium chapter ii vellum and other materials difference between vellum and parchmentnames of different preparationsthe kinds of vellum most prized for illuminated booksthe parcheminerie of the abbey of clunyorigin of the term parchmentpapyrus as vellum is constantly spoken of in connection with illumination and illuminated books it becomes necessary to explain what it is and why it was used instead of paper we often find writers when referring to ancient documents making use of the words parchment and vellum as if the terms were synonymous but this is not strictly correct it is true that both are prepared from skins but the skins are different they are similar but not the same nor indeed are they interchangeable in point of fact the skins of almost all the wellknown domestic animals and even of fishes have been used for the purpose of making a material for writing upon specifically among the skins so prepared were the following the ordinary lambskin called aignellinus2 that prepared from stillborn lambs called virgin parchment 2 strictly agnellinus from sheepskins was produced ordinary parchment and also a sort of leather called basane or cordovan vellum was produced from calfskin that of the stillborn calf being called uterine vellum and considered the finest and thinnest it is often spoken of in connection with the exquisitely written bibles of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries as of the highest value besides these were the prepared skins of oxen pigs and asses but these were chiefly used for bindings though occasionally for leaves of account and other books liable to rough usage before the tenth century the vellum used for mss is highly polished and very white and fine afterwards it becomes thick and rough especially on the hair side in the examination of certain mss the distinction of hair side and smooth side is of importance in counting the gatherings so as to determine the completeness or otherwise of a given volume towards the period of the renaissance however the vellum gradually regains its better qualities thus it may be seen that the difference between vellum and parchment is not a mere difference of thickness for while in general vellum is stouter than parchment there is some vellum which is thinner than some parchment not only are they made from different kinds of skin but the vellum used for illuminated books was and still is prepared with greater care than the parchment used for ordinary school or college treatises or legal documents the fabrication of both parchment and vellum in the middle ages was quite as important a matter as that of paper at the present time and certain monastic establishments had a special reputation for the excellence of their manufacture thus the parcheminerie as it was called of the abbey of cluny in france was quite celebrated in the twelfth century one reason probably for this celebrity was the fact that cluny had more than three hundred churches colleges and monasteries amongst its dependencies and therefore had ample opportunities for obtaining the best materials and learning the best methods in use throughout literary christendom as to the name vellum it is directly referable to the familiar latin term for the hide or pelt of the sheep or other animal but specially applied as we have said to that of the calf the writing material thus prepared being termed charta vitulinain french vlin and in monastic latin and english vellum the name parchment had quite a different kind of origin it is an old story found in plinys natural history bk xiii ch 70 that the ancient use or revival of the use of parchment was due to the determination of king eumenes ii of mysia or pergamos to form a library which should rival those of alexandria but that when he applied to egypt for papyrus the writing materials then in use ptolemy epiphanes jealously refused to permit its exportation in this difficulty eumenes we are told had recourse to the preparation of sheepskins and that from the place of its invention it was called charta pergamena pliny and his authority however were both wrong in point of history eumenes who reigned from about 197 to 158 bc was not the inventor but the restorer of its use see herodotus v 58 it was called in

adopted for books though more especially for letters and accounts st jerome mentions vellum as an alternative material in case papyrus should fail ep vii and st augustine ep xv apologises for using

etcthe square bookhow different sizes of books were produced seeing that illumination grew originally out of the decoration of the initial letters our next point to notice is the penmanship the alphabet which we now use is that formerly used by the romans who borrowed it from the greeks who in turn obtained it or their modification of it from the phoenicians who lastly it is said constructed it from that of the egyptians of course in these repeated transfers the letters themselves as well as the order of them underwent considerable alterations with these we have here no concern our alphabet ie the roman and its variations is quite sufficient for our story in order to show as clearly as may be the varieties of lettering and the progress of penmanship from classical times to the revival of the old roman letters in the fifteenth century we offer the following synopsis which classifies and indicates the development of the different hands used by writers and illuminators of mss it is constructed on the information given in waillys large work on palography and in dr de grey birchs book on the utrecht psalter the former work affords excellent facsimiles which together with those given in the plates published by the palographical society will give the student the clearest possible ideas respecting these ancient handwritings omitting the cursive or correspondence hand the letters used by the romans were of four kindscapitals usually made angular to be cut in stone rustic uncials and minuscules the rounded capitals were intended to be used in penwork uncials differ from capitals only in the letters a d e g m q t v for the sake of ease in writing it is said that this class of letters was first called uncials from being made an inch uncia high but this is mere tradition the word is first used on jeromes preface to the book of job no uncials have ever been found measuring more than fiveeighths of an inch in height for the assistance of such students as may wish for examples we must refer to certain mss and reproductions in which the foregoing hands are exemplified circa fourth century capitals yet not pure the vatican vergil no 3225 throughout birch p 14 silvestres palographie universelle pl 74 with regard to the relative antiquity of capitals and uncials m de wailly observes the titles in pure uncials but less than the text itself give an excellent index to the highest antiquity this is verified in mss 152 2630 107 of the bibl du roi etc mss of the seventh or eighth century whether on uncial or demiuncial or any other letter are never constant in noting the title at the top of the page or the kind of writing will vary or if uncials be constantly used the titles will not be smaller than the text these variations become still greater

in the eighth it is much better and almost easy to read celtic the national hand of ireland it is founded on the demiuncial roman borrowed as to type from mss taken to ireland by missionaries it is bold clear and often beautiful lending itself to some of the most astonishing feats of penmanship ever produced such are the chief varieties of writing found in the mss produced before the great revival of the arts and learning which took place during the reign of charles the great karl der grosse known familiarly as charlemagne wattenbach schriftwesen etc says that uncials date from the second century ad from examples still extant of the fifth and following centuries it seems that while the roman capitals were not uncommon in celtic mss the form generally adopted was the uncial it was the form also usually chosen for ornamentation or imitation in those visigothic merovingian or lombardic mss which made such remarkable use of fishes birds beasts and plants for the construction of initial letters and principal words of which we see so many examples in the elaborately illustrated catalogue of the library at laon by ed fleury and in that of cambray by m durieux most of these precarolingian designs are barbarous in the extreme dreadfully clumsy in execution but they evince considerable ingenuity and a strong predilection for symbolism before concluding this chapter perhaps something should be said concerning the shape of books though this is a matter somewhat outside the scope of our proper subject yet as the brief digression will afford an opportunity for the explanation of certain terms used in mss we will avail ourselves of it the ancient form of writing upon skins and papyrus was that of the roll the hebrew arabic or greek terms for this do not concern us but its latin name was volumen something rolled and from this we obtain our word volume such words as explicit liber primus etc which we often find in early mss refer to this rollform explicare in latin meaning to unroll hence apropos of a chapter or book to finish when transferred to the square form or codex it simply means here ends book first etc the modern book shape first came into use with the beginning of the christian era under the name of codex here it will be necessary to explain that caudex codex in latin meant a block of wood and had its humorous bysenses among the roman dramatists as the word block has among ourselves such as blockhead5 so caudicalis provincia was a jocular expression for the occupation of woodsplitting 5 terence heautont 5 1 4 whether the word had originally any connection with cauda a tail is not here worth considering as if so it had long lost the connection and when used to mean a book had only the sense of a board or a number of boards from two upwards fastened together by means of rings passed through holes made in their edges probably the first use was as plain smooth boards only examples of such are still in existence then of boards thinly covered with usually black wax a pair of such tablets waxcovered was a common form of a roman pocketor memorandumbook it was also used as a means of conveying messages the reply being returned on the same tablets the method was to write on the wax with a finepointed instrument called a style the reverse end of which was flattened when the person to whom the message was sent had read it he or she simply flattened out the writing smoothed it level and then wrote the reply on the same wax schoolchildren did their exercises on these tablets housewives and stewards kept their accounts on them and on them literary people jotted down their ideas as they do now in their pocketbooks extant examples of these early books or tablets are fairly numerous and may be seen in most public museums a codex of two leaves was called a diptych of three a triptych etc the codex form was used for legal documents wills conveyances and general correspondence hence the roman postman was called a tabellarius the tablets containing correspondence being tied with a thread or ribbon and sealed this custom of sending letters on tablets survived for some centuries after augustan times wattenbach gives several interesting instances of their medival use6 6 schriftwesen 48 of course when the tablet gave place to the codex of skin or paper the papyrus was too brittle and fragile for practical utility and examples as we have seen were very rare but vellum soon became popular we may mention in passing that the papyrus roll gave us a word still in use in diplomatics the word protocol the first sheet of a papyrus roll was called the greek small letter pigreek small letter rhogreek small letter omegagreek small letter taugreek small letter omicron with tonosgreek small letter kappagreek

was stamped or marked with the name of the government officer who had charge of the department in the vellum codex though each leaf might have only one fold and thus technically be considered as a folio the actual shape of it was nearly square hence its name of codex quadratus when other forms of books such as octavo duodecimo etc came into use it was in consequence of the increased number of foldings the gatherings originally quaternions or quires became different and those who undertake to examine mss with respect to their completeness have to be familiar with the various methods7 this kind of knowledge however though useful is by no means essential to the story of illumination 7 wattenbach schriftwesen madan books in manuscript etc chapter iv greek and roman illumination the first miniature painterthe vatican vergilsmethods of paintingorigin of christian artthe vienna genesisthe dioscoridesthe byzantine revival it has been already stated that the earliest recorded miniature painter was a lady named lala of cyzicus in the days of augustus csar days when cyzicus was to rome what brussels is to paris or brighton to london all her work as far as we know has perished it was portraiture on ivory probably much the same as we see in the miniature portraiture of the present day but this was not illumination the kind of painting employed in the two vatican vergils was however something approaching it these two precious volumes contain relics of pagan art but it is the very art which was the basis and prototype of socalled christian art of those earliest examples found in the catacombs and in the first liturgical books of christian times the more ancient of the two vergils referred to no 3225 which labarte 2nd ed ii 158 thinks to be a century older than the other sir md wyatt considered as containing some of the best and most interesting specimens of ancient painting which have come down to us the design is free and the colours applied with good effect the whole presenting classical art in the period of decline but before its final debasement whereas in the second ms no 3867 the style though still classical is greatly debased and probably in addition to this by no means among the best work of its time it is described as rough inaccurate and harsh the method is of the kind called gouache ie the colours are applied thickly in successive couches or layers probably by means of white of egg diluted with figtree sap and finished in the high lights with touches of gold palograph soc pl 114 117 this finishing with touches of gold brings the work within the range of illumination there is indeed wanting the additional ornamentation of the initial letter which would bring it fully into the class of medival work but such as it is it may fairly claim to be suggestive of the future art indeed certain points in the ms 3225viz that zeus is always red and venus fair that certain costumes and colours of drapery are specially appropriatedwould lead to the supposition that even then there existed a code of rules like those of the byzantine guide and that therefore the art owed its origin to the greeks between this ms and the first known christian book work there may have been many that have now perished and which had they remained would have marked the transition more gradually but even as they stand there is no appreciable difference between the earliest monuments of christian art and those of the period which preceded them nor shall we find any break any distinct start on new principles it is one continuous series of processesthe gradual change of methods growing out of experience alonenot owing to any change of religion or the adoption of a new set of theological opinions of course we shall find that for a very long time the preponderance of illuminated mss will be towards liturgical works and we shall also find that where the contents of the ms are the same the subjects taken for illustration are also selected according to some fixed and wellknown set of rules we shall see the explanation of this byandby the first example of a christian illuminated ms is one containing portions of the book of genesis in greek preserved in the imperial library at vienna it is a mere fragment only twentysix leaves of purple vellumthat is bearing the imperial stainyet it contains eightyeight pictures we call them miniatures but we must remember that by miniator a roman bookseller would not understand what we call a miniaturist and as we have said the word illuminator was not then known this vienna genesis is not introduced among illuminated books therefore because of its miniaturespictures we prefer to call thembut because the text is nearly all written in gold and silver letters the pictures according to the greek manner are placed in little square frames they were executed no doubt by a professional painter not without technical skill and not hampered by monastic restrictions the symbolism which underlies all early art is here shown in the allegorical figures such as we shall meet with again in later byzantine work which are introduced to interpret the scene we see the same thing in the catacombs being a relic of great importance this genesis codex has been often described and examples given of its pictures of course in a little manual like the present we cannot pretend to exhibit the literature of our subject we can scarcely do more than refer the reader to a single source in this case perhaps we cannot do better than send the inquirer to the victoria and albert museum at south kensington if we select another ms of this early period it is the one which may be said to be the oldest existing ms in which the ornamentation is worthy of as much notice as the pictures we refer to the collection of treatises by greek physicians on plants fishing the chase and kindred matters in the same library as the genesis fragment it goes under the name of dioscorides who was one of the authors and dates from the beginning of the sixth century the genesis is a century older engravings from the dioscorides are given in labartes arts industriels etc pl 78 and in louandres arts somptuaires etc i pl 2 3 enough has been said on these earlier centuries to show quite clearly the character of the art known as early christian it is simply a continuation of such art as had existed from classical times and had in fact passed from the greeks who were artists to the romans who were rarely better than imitators it is carried on to the period when it again is nourished by greek ideas in the later empire and once more attains distinction in the splendid revival of art under the emperor justinian notejulius capitolinus in his life of the exquisite emperor maximin junior

artperiods of byzantine artexamplesmonotony and lifelessness of the style the signal event which gave birth to medival illumination or rather to the ideas which were thereby concentrated upon the production of magnificent books was the rebuilding of the imperial palace and the basilica of constantine henceforward to be known as the church of sancta sophia or the divine wisdom at byzantium the emperor justinian had been reigning six years when a terrific fire caused by the conflicts between the various seditions called circus factions of the time almost entirely destroyed not only his own palace and the great christian church adjoining it but the city of constantinople itself so important a scheme of reconstruction had probably never been forced upon a government since the great fire in rome under nero justinian whose early training had been of the most economical kind and whose disposition seemed to be rather inclined to parsimony than extravagance now came out in his true character for various reasons he had hitherto studiously concealed his masterpassion but this catastrophe of the fire which seemed at first so disastrous was really a stroke of fortune it afforded the hitherto frugal sovereign the chance he had long waited for of spending without stint the hoarded savings of his two miserly predecessors and gratifying his own tastes for magnificent architecture and splendour of apparel not only asia with its wealth of gold and gems but all the known world capable of supplying material for the reconstructions were called upon and ivory marbles mosaics lamps censers candelabra chalices ciboria crosses furniture fittings picturesin short everything that his own taste and the experience of four or five of the ablest architects of the time could suggestadministered to the gorgeous the unspeakable splendour of the new edifices and their furniture paul the silentiary an eyewitness of the whole proceeding has left a description in verse and the accurate du fresne in prose which enable us easily to trace how the roman city of constantine became transformed into the semioriental byzantium of justinian during the two centuries which had elapsed since the days of the first christian emperor many foreign luxuries had found their way into the eastern capital byzantine jewellery and byzantine silks were already famous the patterns on the latter were not merely floral or geometrical but fourfooted animals birds and scenes from outdoor sports formed part of the embellishment which therefore must have taken the place occupied in later times by the tapestries of arras and fontainebleau hitherto the byzantines had imported their silks from persia after the rebuilding of the basilica justinian introduced silkculture into greece the garments ridiculed by asterius bishop of amasia in the fourth century were repeated in the sixth century when men says he appear in the streets thus dressed the passersby look at them as at painted walls their clothes are pictures which little children point out to one another the saintlier sort wear likenesses of christ the marriage of galileeand lazarus raised from the dead on the robe of the empress theodorathe wife of justinian who is shown in one of the mosaics of st vitale at ravenna as presenting rich gifts to that churchthere is embroidered work along the border showing the adoration of the magi theodora pia was one among the many rles played by that allaccomplished actress but this seems to have been after her death like lucrezia borgia perhaps she was better than her reputation with such surroundings liturgical books could not have existed without sharing in the universal luxury of enrichment and in point of fact we still have records of such books while justinian reigned in byzantium it happened that hormisdas a native of frosinone was pope of rome he was a zealous eradicator of heresy especially of the eutychian and manichan and in recognition of his services in this direction the greek emperor with his thanks sent him a great gospelbook richly decorated no doubt with those splendid eusebian canons and portraits of the evangelists the like of which we see in the byzantine examples still preserved at paris in london and elsewhere plates of beaten gold studded with gems formed the covers of the gospelbook of hormisdas nor was this sumptuous volume the only or even a rare example of its kind we read that the art of book decoration had become a fashionable craze no expense was spared in the search for costly materials colours were imported from india persia and spain including vermilion and ultramarine while the renowned byzantine gold ink was manufactured from imported indian gold persian calligraphers had taught its use afresh to the byzantine scribes if as we may believe the first object of the roman miniatores was distinctness combined with beauty we may now believe that the object of the byzantine scribes was splendour the progress had been from mere cheirography to calligraphy now it was from calligraphy to chrysography and arguriography this employment of gold and silver inks may be looked upon as the first step in the art of illumination as practised in the middle ages and the preliminary to the use of metallic inks was attention to the tint of the vellum the pioneers in this career of luxury no doubt had observed that very white vellum fatigued the eye hence at first they tinted or stained it with saffron on one side at least sometimes on both once begun the tinting of the vellum extended to other colours for works of the highest rank the favourite was a fine purple the imperial colour of the roman and greek emperors for chrysography or goldwriting the tint was nearly what we call crimson for arguriography or silverwriting it became the bluish hue we call grapepurple on the cooled purples vermilion ink was used instead of or together with the gold or silver as the usage began with the greeks we may be sure that it came originally from asia the emperor nero once having heard that an olympic ode of pindar in letters of gold was laid up in one of the temples at athens desired that certain verses of his own should be similarly written and dedicated on the altar of jupiter capitolinus at rome this was an imperial luxury several times repeated by other princes after the official establishment of christianity it became a common practice to have the greater liturgical books executed in the same costly fashion and between the time of constantine and that of basil the macedonian many a burning homily was directed against the custom denounced as a sinful extravagance which no doubt it was but in vain until the fashion had worn itself out it might fairly be expected this being the case that many examples of this kind of codex would still be in existence but owing to war fire robbery and other misfortunes but very few remain one of the oldest and finest is the socalled codex argenteus or silverbook now kept at upsala in sweden containing portions of the gospels of the msogothic bishop ulfilas originally the effect of the stamped or burnished silver on the rich purple of the vellum must have been very splendid but now the action of the air has blackened it as it has done in many other instances where silver was used in illumination even gold will gather tarnish and in several such mss has turned of a rusty red gold ink was not invariably confined to tinted vellum it was often used on the plain ground the copy of the old testament in greek presented by the high priest eleazar to king ptolemy philadelphus was a roll of fine white vellum upon which the text was written in letters of gold to enter upon the antiquities of greek palography would lead us too far from our track in view of the brevity of our present survey we therefore with some reluctance turn from this interesting topic to our more immediate subject we may remark however that the great majority of greek mss are written on vellum in the eleventh century are found instances of what is called charta bombycina or cottonpaper appearing more plentifully in the twelfth century but on the whole vellum is the chief material of byzantine illuminated books much has been said about the want of life and total lack of variety of treatment in this school of art to a very great extent the charge is just yet it could scarcely be otherwise the one circumstance which compelled byzantine work to remain so long as if cast in one unalterable mould and thus to differ so strangely from that of western artists was due to the fact that in very early christian times the scribes and illuminators were enrolled into a minutely organised corporation originating primarily in monasticism but by no means confined to the monastic orders lay guilds existed the regulations and methods of which were rigid beyond modern belief so that as a class byzantine art has acquired the reputation of a soulless adherence to mechanical rules and precedents depriving it of originality and even of individuality and therefore excluding the remotest scintilla of artistic genius of the great crowd of examples of ordinary work this may be true but it certainly is not true of the best by which it has the right to be judged as we shall see from the examples referred to byandby certainly there is one invaluable particular in which greek mss are superior to those of the west latin or otherwise that is they are much more frequently signed with the names localities and dates of the copyists and illuminators it will be some help towards our knowledge of this school if we divide its existence into chronological sections or periods 1 from prchristianity to the age of justinian ie down to the year 535 justinian reigned from 526 to 564 this period marks the decadence of ancient art but carries with it the characteristics and methods of the ancient greek painters 2 from the age of justinian to the iconoclastic paralysis of art under leo iii the isaurian ie 564 to 726 leo reigned from 717 to 741 during this period vast numbers of illuminated liturgical books were destroyed for religious or fanatical reasons just as in our own cromwellian times numbers of hor missals etc were destroyed as papistical and superstitious this edict of 726 did not absolutely put an end to all art in mss it only had the effect of excluding images of god christ and the saints as in arabian and persian mss leaving the artist the free use of flowers plants and line ornament after the manner of the mohammedan arabesques 3 from leo iii to the empress irene who restored the worship of images in part ie from 741 to 785 irene ruled from 780 to 801 this was a period of stagnation though by no means of extinction of art 4 from irene to basil i the macedonian ie from 801 to 867 a halfcentury and more of rapid renaissance to the most brilliant epoch of byzantine art since the time of justinian if not the zenith of the school basil i was a great builderbuilding in fact was his ruling passionso that it may be said that he took justinian for his model both as a ruler and as a patron of the arts he reigned from 867 to 886 5 from basil the macedonian to the fall of constantinople ie from 886 to 1453 allowing for a few flashes of expiring skill in various reigns this may be considered as a period of gradual but certain decline to a state worse than death for though the monks of greek and russian convents still kept up the execution of mss it was only with the driest and most lifeless adhesion to the manual this socalled art still exists but more like a magnetised corpse than a living thing examples of the first period are seldom met with we have one signal specimen in the british museum add ms 5111 being two leaves only of a gospelbook and containing part of the eusebian canons or contentstables of the four gospels etc the work is attributed to the time of justinian himself it is of the kind already referred to as probably affording the model of work to the early illuminators of france and ireland and as being like the gospelbook of hormisdas and those brought to england by augustine in 596 another example of the same eusebian canons is found in roy ms 1 e vi of the fourth periodie the ninth centuryperhaps the most typical example is the menologium a sort of compound of a calendar and lives of the saints now in the vatican library ms gr 1613 this ms shows that the revival under basil the macedonian was a return not to roman but to ancient greek art the facial types being of the

glaring when transferred to celtic and carolingian gospelbooks see chapter on carolingian illumination of this fourth period we might indeed point to many examples one must suffice it is the beautiful greek psalter now at paris ms p 139 containing lovely examples of antique design including remarkable personifications or allegorical figures in this ms is one of the most graceful personifications ever painted that of night with her veil of gauze studded with stars floating overhead the seven pictures from the life of david are among the best ever put into a ms but personification is carried to an extreme thus the red sea the jordan rivers mountains night dawn etc are all represented as persons the drawings are really beautiful and the illuminated initials and general ornament in good taste

noticeable in these byzantine pictures that while the figurepainting is often really excellent the design skilful and the pose natural the landscape trees etc are quite symbolic and fanciful the painters seem to have been utterly ignorant of perspective buildings too without any regard to relative proportion are coloured merely as parts of a colour scheme they are pink pale green yellow violet blue just to please the eye that the painter had a system of colourharmony is plain but he paid no regard to the facts of city life unless indeed it was the practice of the medival byzantines to paint the outside of their houses in this truly brilliant style possibly they did so we have similar things in italy even nowadays no doubt the french illuminators of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries drew from these sources both their perspective and their architectural colouring as for ornamental illumination the principal method of decoration was a square heading10 perhaps including a semicircular arch sweeping over several arcades the corners and wallspace being occupied either with arabesque patterns showing them to be after the time of leo iii or with scrolls of lineornament

which is placed a small scene of sacred history or perhaps of country life sometimes the title in golden letters is surrounded with medallions containing heads of christ and the virgin apostles and saints the peculiar interlacing bands of violet yellow rose blue etc which are still often seen in russian ornament are also features of these byzantine mss but most of all is the lavish use of gold perhaps the fact most to be remembered about these mss is that the painters of them worked in a manner that was absolutely fixed and rigid the rules of which are laid down in a manual called the guide to painting a work which has been translated by m didron so fixed and unalterable indeed is the manner that there is absolutely no difference to indicate relative antiquity between a ms of the eleventh century and one of the sixteenth or even later we might almost say of the present day in the matter of saintimages this is strictly true chapter vi celtic illumination early liturgical books reflect the ecclesiastical art of their timethis feature a continuous characteristic of illumination down to the latest timeselements of celtic ornamentgospels of st chaddurham gospelscontrast of celtic and byzantinest columbabook of kellsdetails of its decoration in the earlier centuries of christianity when liturgical books were the chief occupation of the illuminator it will need little pointing out to demonstrate that the page of the illuminated manuscript where it contained more than the mere ornamental initial was simply a mirror of the architectural decoration of the church in which it was intended to be used where the church enrichments consist as on the byzantine basilicas of panellings arcades and tympana of gilded sculpture in wood or stone with figures of saints the pages of the gospelbook bear similar designs where as in the romanesque they are rich in mosaics and fretted arcades interlacing each other so are the illuminated lives of the saints the menologia psalters and gospelbooks where as in the gothic cathedrals of the westof france germany or italythe stained glass is the striking feature of the interior so it is with the illumination it is a vitraila glasspainting on vellum on this latter point we shall have more to say when we reach the period of gothic illumination incidentally also the book reflects the minor arts in vogue at the period of its execution often in the illumination we may detect these popular local industries we see mosaic enamelling woodand stonecarving and lacquerwork and as we approach the renaissance even gemcutting and the delicate craft of the medallist in venice and the netherlands we have the local taste for flowerculture in germany we find sculpture in wood and stone in france the productions of the enameller and the goldsmith until at length in the full blaze of the renaissance itself we have in almost every land the same varieties of enrichment practised according to its own special style of work it has been said that the oldest celtic illuminated mss show no signs of classic or even byzantine influence yet the plan or framework of the designs makes use both of the cross and the arch as used in the earliest byzantine examples the details indeed are quite different and manifestly derived from indigenous sources it may be therefore that the framework is merely a geometrical coincidence which could not well be avoided the fact that the basis of pure irish ornament is geometrical and developed out of the prehistoric and barbarous art of the savages who preceded the celts in ireland such art as is used on the carved shafts of spears and oars and staves of honour and afterwards on stone crosses and metalwork may account for the similarity of ideas in ornament developed by old roman decorators in their mosaic pavements and may reconcile in some measure the varied opinions of different writers who have approached the subject from different points of view westwood adhered to the theory of its being purely indigenous fleury on the other hand in his catalogue of the mss in the library at laon asserts that we owe the knots and interlacements to the influence of the painters sculptors and mosaicists of rome these interlacings cables etc there is no galloroman monument which does not exhibit them and only to cite local instances the cord of four or five strands is seen in the beautiful mosaics discovered in profusion within the last five years 185762 at blanzy at bazoches at vailly and at reims it was from them that the franks borrowed their knots and twists and ribbons for their belts and buckles their rings and bracelets pt i p 8 the elements therefore of book ornament as used by the celtic penmen are such as were employed by the prehistoric and sporadic nations in the textile art in plaiting and handweaving and afterwards transferred to that of metalwork terminals of animal bird or serpent form afterwards combine with the linear designs the dog and dragon are common as may be seen in the archaic vases produced by the greeks before they came under the influence of ideas from western asia among celtic artists as among those of later times the practice of working in various materials was common to the same individual and dagus d 586 may compare with dunstan eloy tuotilo and others to apply these observations to the style of illumination which now comes under our notice it may be said that if we allow the cross and arch to be copied from the byzantine mss introduced from abroad the details are undoubtedly supplied by the wickerwork and textile netting familiar to the everyday life of the artist assisted by the fertile imagination of bardic lore in snakes dragons and other mythic monsters of heroic verse the illuminator produces a pencilled tapestry of textile fabric or flexile metalwork as marvellous as it is unique no amount of description can give a true idea of what celtic work is like it must be seen to be comprehended one glance at a facsimile of such a ms as the book of kells or the lindisfarne gospels or those of st chad at lichfield or wherever as at st gall such work is to be met with will supersede the most laboured attempt at description we must therefore at once refer the reader to the facsimile when that has been inspected we may proceed in the first place it may be noted that with these occidental mss begins the importance and development of the initial which indeed as regards the illumination of western europe is the very root of the matter it is the development of the initial letter first into the bracket then into the border which forms the great distinction of the art of paris as dante calls it from that of byzantium the latter is almost always of a squared or tabular design traced and painted on a ground of burnished gold the former exhausts itself first in fantastic lacertine forms twisted into the shapes of the commencing letters or words of the writing to which the suggestion of some byzantine ms perhaps occasionally adds a frame next come birds dogs dragons vinestems and spirals embedded in couches of colour but whatever its character always it is the letter that governs and originates the ornament only at the very end of its life when the border has completely eclipsed the initial is the idea of origin forgotten then indeed we find the border treillages of flowerstem or leafwork starting from meaningless points of the design or scattered shapelessly at random when we meet with work of this sort we need no further proof that the real art is dead we have before us in such a performancea trade productiona mere object of commerce valuable so far as it is the result of labour but not as a work of art according to the abb geoghegan11 christianity was known to the people of ireland in the fourth century the greek menology asserts that it was carried thither by simon zelotes but this is contradicted by the roman breviary and the martyrologists simeon metaphrastes attributes it to st peter vincent of beauvais to st james unreliable as these traditions may be taken singly they nevertheless agree in placing the conversion of ireland at a very early date probably as geoghegan says in the fourth century it is certain that about the middle of the sixth century an irish prince of distinguished ancestry and himself a saint led a band of missionaries from donegal to iona it is curious to observe that the event is almost contemporary with the renovations of justinian at byzantium and only a short time before the founding of the famous abbey of monte cassino by st benedict before the existence of the benedictine order there was a monastery at durrow in ireland and in this monastery the aforesaid prince was educated his name was columba at least so he is called but whether it be merely in allusion to his missionthe doveor really a patronymic it is hard to say he was the messenger of peace to the natives of iona and even the name of the island seems to suggest an allusion to the old testament missionary to the ninevites jonah the irish missionaries called the spot to which they went i columcille the cell of the doves isle or columbas cell it is usually spoken of as the monastery of iona columba went on many other missions but ultimately returned to his beloved iona where he died in 597 the year after the arrival of augustine at canterbury 11 hist de lirlande his companions busied themselves with the transcription of the gospels for the use of new converts after the model of those they had seen and used at durrow it is even traditionally asserted that columba himself took part in the work and transcribed both a psalter and a gospelbook moreover that one of the iona gospelbooks written by him is still in existence this ms whether the work of st columba or not and probably it is not is the earliest known monument of irish calligraphic art it is known as the book of kells and there is no doubt that it is the most amazing specimen of penmanship ever seen it is at once the most ancient the most perfect and the most precious example of celtic art in existence it exhibits the striking peculiarities and features of the stylethe band work knots and interlacings such as may be seen on the stone crosses which mark the burialplaces of british and irish chieftains witness for instance the carew or the nevern cross described in the journal of the archoelogical institute iii 71 which might be taken to represent an initial i wrought in stone there is no foliage no plant form at all it is not therefore derivable from romanesque byzantine or oriental ornament it is indigenous if not to ireland at least to those prehistoric aryan tribes of which the irish were a branch its basis is the art of weaving and in some respects resembles the matting of polynesia much more closely that the vinestems of sicily or the arabesques of byzantium spirals occur that bewilder the eye yet are so faultlessly perfect that only the magnifyingglass brings out the incredible accuracy of the drawing among them are mythological and allegorical beasts snakes and lizardsthought to represent demons like the gargoyles of gothic architecturein every conceivable attitude of contortion and agony there are also doves and fishes but the latter being sacred emblems together with the lamb are seldom made grotesque it was a monkish legend that the devil could take the shape of any bird or beast except those of the dove and the lamb chapter vii celtic illuminationcontinued the iona gospelscontrast with roman and byzantinedetailstreatment of animal formscolour schemesthe gospelbook of st columbanusthat of mael brith mac durnanthe lindisfarne gospelscumdachsother bookshrines we have seen that in both roman and byzantine mss the titles and beginnings of books were merely distinguished by a lettering in red or gold rather smaller in fact than the ordinary text but rendered distinct by the means referred to the handwriting too is clear and legible whether capital uncial or minuscule in absolute contrast to all this the iona gospels have the first page completely covered with ornament on the next the letters are of an enormous size followed by a few words not merely in uncials but in characters varying from half an inch to two inches in height the page opposite to each gospel is similarly filled with decoration separated into four compartments by an ornamented greek cross this may of course be simply a geometrical device in no way connected with greece but taken in connection with other features we see in it an indication of contact with byzantine work and the side of illumination which deals rather with the tabular enrichment of the page than the development of the initial further the writing though large is not easily legible for it is involved enclaved and conjointed in a manner sufficiently puzzling to those who see it for the first time the plaiting and inlaying are certainly borrowed from local usages and the survival of the same kind of interlaced plaiting in the scottish tartans is some evidence of the long familiarity of the celtic race with the art of weaving when we remember that some of the early illuminators were also workers in metals we can understand that penmen like dagus dunstan and eloy had designs at their command producible by either method so we see both in the ms and in the brooch and buckle the same kind of design among the earliest animals brought into this celtic work we find the dog and the dragon the latter both wingless and winged according to convenience or requirement the dog is so common in some of the celtolombardic ms of which examples still exist at monte cassino as almost to create a style while the dragon survives to the latest period of gothic art whatever is introduced into a celtic illumination is at once treated as a matter of ornament when the human figure appears it is remorselessly subjected to the same rules as the rest of the work the hair and beard are spiral coils the eyes nostrils and limbs are symmetrical flourishes colour is quite regardless of natural possibility the hair and draperies are simply patterned as compartments of green or blue or red or black as may be required for the tout ensemble the face remains white lightened tints are preferred to full colours as pale yellow pink lavender and light green a very ludicrous device is made use of to denote the folds of the drapery they are not darkened there is no light and shade in celtic work but are simply lines of a strongly contrasting colour the blue and red appear to be opaque and therefore mineral colours the rest are thin and transparent nothing can be more wayward than the colouring of the symbolic beasts of the gospels in the evangeliary of st columbanus not columba but the founder of luxeuil and bobbio who died in 614 the lion of st mark is an admirable beast in a suit of greenandred chain armour in the form of mascles or lozenges see the illustration in westwoods palographia sacra pictoria of a figure page from the gospels of mael brith mac durnan for a typical example12 12 see also an article by westwood in journal archol inst vii 17 on irish miniatures the only point that might argue the freedom in celtic work from byzantine influence is the absence of gold but perhaps this was only because the earlier irish illuminators could not obtain it we find it later on in the book of kells and the lambeth gospels there is no gold the former dates somewhere in the seventh century not the sixth as sometimes stated the latter shortly before 927 in the lindisfarne gospels 698721 gold is used in the psalter of ricemarchus now in trinity college dublin are traces of silver it is in connection with these irish mss that decorated and jewelled cases called cumdachs make their appearance such as the one attached to the gospels of st moling in the library of trinity college dublin these bookshrines are almost exclusively an irish production in other countries the idea was to adorn the volume itself with a splendid and costly binding perhaps including gold silver and gems in ireland the idea of sacredness was carried out in another way instead of decorating the covers of the book itself it was held as in such a ms for instance as the book of durrow to be too venerable a relic to be meddled with and a box or case was made for it on which they spent all their artistic skill generally the case is known as a cumdach but one kind called the cathach was so closed that the book was completely concealed and it was superstitiously believed that if it were opened some terrible calamity would overtake its possessors such was the cathach of tyrconnell we must remember however that in this instance the keepers were not men of booklearning but hardy warriors who carried the cathach into battle as a charm and an incitement to victory of similar shrines which were made for precious books by both the greeks and lombards the oldest and most famous is that made for theudelinde wife of agilulf king of the lombards and given by her in 616 together with the famous iron crown and other relics to the cathedral of monza where they are still to be seen the enrichment of the covers of books themselves as distinct from the use of cases or shrines has been usual in almost all ages and styles of decoration when we come to speak of carolingian mss we shall find several remarkable instances we must now pass on from this curiously attractive theme of celtic calligraphy to its contemporary styles of france germany spain and italy only remarking by the way that no other style of its time had so marked an influence on the local scriptoria into which it was introduced as this same celtic of ireland it is not only traceable but easily recognised all along the rhine in burgundy the swiss cantons and lombardy until at length overwhelmed by the general introduction of romanesque or byzantine which was restored and filtered through the exarchate and the lombard schools during the early days of the new carolingian empire chapter viii semibarbaric illumination

civilisation was fast fading away perhaps we may look upon the socalled splendour of the reign of dagobert in france as the spasmodic scintillations of its latest moments of existence the kingdom of dagobert after 631 was almost an empire for the seven years preceding his death in 638 he ruled from the elbe and the saxon frontier to that of spain and from the atlantic ocean to the confines of

have made the chair of bronzegilt now in the national library at paris called the fauteuil of dagobert and many other works which disappeared either during the wars of louis xv or those of the revolution of 1789 he founded the abbey of solignac near limoges and it is not improbable that the reputation of this city for metalwork and enamelling may be dated from his foundation with such works as those of eloy before them it is difficult to believe that the wretched and puerile attempts at ornamental penmanship and illumination which are shown at laon and other places as the work of this period can possibly represent the highest efforts of the calligrapher but we must remember that st eloy was an extraordinary genius in his art and that the bulk of the clergy not to mention ordinary workmen were very ignorant and illtaught very few indeed were men who could be considered cultured gregory of tours the historian and venantius fortunatus the hymnwriter are among the few in the library at laon m fleury describes a ms of the natural history of isidore of seville which is looked upon as a work of reference both as regards art and learning it was at one time a very popular book being a latin cyclopdia dealing with the sciences and general knowledge of the time yet the example referred to by m fleury shows us only a crowd of initials learnedly styled by the benedictine authors and others ichthiomorphiques and ornithoeides ie made up of fishes and birds and about equal in quality and finish to the efforts of a very ordinary schoolboy these initials betray an utter decadence from the beautiful uncials of the fifth and sixth centuries seen in the st germains psalter for example now in the national library at paris the colours are coarse and badly applied and even where brightest are utterly unrefined and without taste notwithstanding however the apparently total eclipse or extinction of roman art in gaul or as it must henceforth be called france it is claimed by m fleury13 that the interlacements which constitute the principal feature of these earlier merovingian mss are derived from the remains of roman mosaics found profusely at blanzy bazoches and reims this may be so but those mosaics would not account for the same features in the irish work for the romans never reached ireland as occupants or colonists 13 see later take another example from the laon collection the history of orosius the first page is a type of the species to which it belongs and moreover a good sample of the earliest efforts of all pictorial art an ordinary rectangular cross occupies the centre of the page the centre shows us the lamb of the apocalypse and st john on the arms are the beasts which typify the evangeliststheir emblems as they are sometimes called we notice that they are all symbolic and not intended to be natural imitations of reality the various animals scattered about the page are all symbolicall have a mystical interpretation and raison dtre a borderframe passing behind each extremity of the cross contains a number of doglike animals some plain others spotted while the body of the cross itself is occupied with attempts at foliage ornaments in the left upper corner are the letters x p i in the right i h v thick foliage springing from the i and v and falling back over the monogram in the lower corners are two fishes and two doves each pair hanging to a penwork chain the emblem of john on the upper extremity of the cross is an eagleheaded and winged man holding a book its opposite one of lucas at foot is a singularly conceived anthropoid and winged ox also with a book on the left marcus whose head is indescribable and on the right matthew with human head the rest of the figures being as before the eye in all the figures is a most remarkable feature both in the pictures and the initials of this ms the outline has been drawn in black ink and the colours yellow red brown and green applied afterwards as the new masters of the west were not so much interested in the artistic remains of the mangled civilisation they were endeavouring to destroy as in mastery and military success it was left for the monasteries and the church to see to the welfare of books and monuments in the seventh century it was the monasteries that saved almost all we know of the preceding centuries during the turmoil of the period from the fifth to the eighth century we find certain quiet corners where learning and the arts still breathed grew and dwelt in security lrins founded by st honoratus of aries luxeuil by columbanus bobbio his last retreat and above all monte cassino the great pattern of monasticism the rule of whose founder was destined to become the basis of all later orders were each of them steadily labouring to rescue the civilisation daily threatened by the ravage of war and to preserve it for the benefit of the ignorant hordes who because of their ignorance now only aimed at its entire destruction we have seen how these monks and clerics with more goodwill than ability did their best to adorn the books which came into their hands it is a poor show but there is no better it is absolutely our only record of how civilisation managed to struggle through the storm let us then be thankful even for the laon orosius for the sacramentary of gellone and the mozarabic liturgies of puy they are among the links between ancient and medival art as already stated the handwriting of merovingian mss is mainly an adaptation of the roman uncial as it is in irish and lombardic or we might say everywhere else abbreviations we still uncommon where minuscules are used the writing is not quite so legible as in the larger hands but we are not met by the singular difficulties of some of the lombardic texts a few solitary texts of the earliest time are in capitals such as the really handsome prudentius of the paris national library where the entire text of the great christian poet is boldly inscribed in the centre of a large white page of vellum like a series of separate inscriptions the first few words are rubrished in the antique manner the ms is supposed to date previous to the year 527 a little later than this st columbanus founded the monastery of luxeuil and later still viz in 616 that of bobbio if we turn to the visigothic area including the south of france and the entire peninsula of spain our first and typical example is the celebrated sacramentary of gellone this ms dates it is said from the eighth century it is written throughout in visigothic uncials though executed in the south of france its ornamentation is frankly barbaric the colours used are yellow red and green the great initials are double lined and the interlinear space filled in with a flat tint of colour and lines of red dots as in the book of kells occasionally follow the contours here also are the fish or birdform letters as in the laon orosius now and then occurs a tiny sceneperhaps a fight between two grotesque brutes neither fish nor fowl nor beast known to the naturalist but a horrible compound of the worst qualities of each the human figure when it occurs is childishly shapeless but the design and treatment nevertheless bear witness to a lively imagination and considerable knowledge of christian symbolism it is these mental qualities which in spite of the manifest absence of manual skill render the gellone evangeliary one of the most precious monuments of its time of the rest of the mss of this wretched period we will say nothing non ragioniam di lor ma guard e passa we are glad to hurry on for another century or so remembering that the leading idea now is the development of the initial letter chapter ix development of the initial the initial and initial paragraph the main object of decoration in celtic illuminationstudy of the letter l as an examplethe i of in principio and the b of beatus vir from the moment when the initial was placed beneath the miniature the object of the whole design was not to give prominence to the initial but to the picture until then that is whilst the initial remains above or beside or outside the picture it is the initial we must watch for style and development and therefore we seize on one letter among those of the latter part of the eighth century because of the frequency of its occurrence in the gospelbook or evangeliary one of the commonest books of the time this the letter l of liber generationis etc the commencing words of st matthew this passage is always made of importance and on the initial and arrangement of the words the artist expends his best efforts properly i should here display pictorially the series of which i speak it would certainly be the quickest way of explaining the matter but as this is out of the question for many reasons and as the present little guide aims rather at showing the way than marching through it the reader must be content to take its advice about where to look for examples which it cannot reproduce regarding the letter l as an index of time and style first we may take the irish l of the book of kells on p 17 pt 1 of miss stokes early christian art in ireland note first the form of the letter then the way it is filled up with ornament compare this which dates from the seventh century with a similar l in the adacodex in the town library at trves no 22 a black and white copy of this is given in taf 6 of lamprecht initial ornamentik this carries up the work to the second half of the eighth century next say the l in the town archives at cologne no 147 this belongs to the second half of the ninth century the chief departure here is towards the knotted band work which figures so largely afterwards both in german and italian book ornament the form is still unchanged but with the tenth century comes change of form as well as of mode of filling as for example taf 19 of lamprecht in which there is a complete alteration of treatment the student may take for similar comparison also the i of in principio of st johns gospel and the b of the first psalm in the psalter and carry the comparison on to the end of the fourteenth century by referring to the mss in the british museum and other public libraries or in the numerous illustrated works to be found in those collections chapter x first english styles transition from iona to lindisfarneinfluence of frankish artthe opus anglicumthe winchester school and its characteristicswhence obtainedmethod of paintingexampleswhere found and described the succession of the school of iona shows us in the first examples of english illumination the type exemplified in the book of kells modified but not very much by its transference to lindisfarne whatever doubt may be felt as to the influence of byzantine or romanesque models on pure irish work such as the book of kells there can be none as regards the lindisfarne gospels in the first place we have gold both in the lettering and ornament this ms known also as the durham book brit mus nero d iv was the work of abbat eadfrith of lindisfarne it has been often described as it is really a most precious example of eighthcentury art in this country no other ms of its time is to be found in any continental scriptorium to be compared with it it is not a collection of clumsy inartistic attempts at ornamental writing but highclass effective work which should be seen and studied by every student of illumination from its style of execution its details of portraiture and other features it may be looked on as one of the earliest links between the two extremes of oriental and occidental art another ms in the british museum vesp a 1 which combines the roman method of painting as in the vergils with the penwork of these angloceltic gospelbooks may also repay careful examination it is very possible that the celebrated scriptoria of york and jarrow may have been furnished with both mss and copyists from rome yet there can be little doubt that the intercourse with durham would be quite as active nor is it less probable that similar intercourse would keep them en rapport with oxford st albans westminster glastonbury and other scriptoria so that in the eighth century england stood with respect to art second to no other country in the christian world during the ninth century active intercourse with the frankish empire enriched english churches and religious houses especially winchester with examples of byzantine and roman models which charlemagne had introduced into his own palatine schools from such secondary models as the sacramentaries and evangeliaries executed at tours soissons metz and other busy centres of production english illuminators succeeded in forming a distinctive style of their own in the french or rather frankish mss while the richness of the gold and the beauty and delicacy of the colouring are in themselves most charming and while certain features may in general be recognised as no doubt suggestive there is nothing which quite predicts the remarkable treatment which characterises the english work opus anglicum was its distinctive title the term indeed was applied to all english artistic productions more or lessembroidery among the rest the women of england says william of poitiers were famous for their needlework the men excelled in metalwork and jewellery but it was the illuminated service books that have perpetuated the term from the lindisfarne gospels to the winchester benedictionals is a far crybut art is long and time is fleeting hence many pages of intervening description must be omitted we may however refer the reader to westwoods palographia sacra pictoria the palographical societys publications and other works for enlightenment on this period on the rouen and devonshire benedictionals much interesting information may be found in vol 24 of the archologia and in the recent volume of the bradshaw society concerning them the work is peculiar and if we consider the treatment of foliage apart from the colour we cannot but notice its similarity to the ivory carving observable in the consular diptychs ivory carving was then a popular artistic occupation the foliage is graceful the composition wellbalanced and the colour mostly bright body colour applied in the greek manner the fault of the heads is that they are too small for the figure and of the draperies that the folds are overdone too much fluttering detail the gilding differs from the byzantine in not being laid on the vellum in the form of burnished leaf but painted on like the colours not only in the figures but in the framework and ornaments the british museum contains several characteristic examples but as has been said the very finest are those at rouen and in the library of the duke of devonshire perhaps no genuine example exists earlier than the golden charter of king edgar of true winchester illumination executed forty years after the accession of athelstan whose coronation book brit mus tib a 2 is most probably not english at all but carolingian of the finest type many other scriptoria in england in the tenth century were equally busy with winchester but none could vie with the royal city in the production of illuminated books chapter xi carolingian illumination why socalledworks to be consultedthe library of st gallrise and progress of carolingian artaccount of various mssfeatures of the stylegospels of st serninthe adacodexcentres of productionother splendid examplesthe alcuin biblethe gospel of st mdard of soissons once more crossing the channel let us now inquire what has been doing among the franks since the gellone sacramentary especially in the schools instituted by the emperor charles the great materials for this inquiry are most abundant one of the more important works on the subject is the lucid monograph of dr rahn of zurich on the golden psalter of folchard at st gall which deals more or less with the whole question of carolingian art while m lop delisles brochure on the evangeliary of st vaast of arras gives us a copious account of the francosaxon branch of it apart however from these sources of information we have not a few original mss still extant which of course more vividly speak for themselves and only require pointing out to the student the clearest method of study being to take things in the order of their creation so in order to understand the character of savage grandeur and nave originality which has been attributed to this style it will be best to take up these mss chronologically at the same time if anyone merely wishes to know what the style is like at its best dr rahn must be his guide as the golden psalter which he has selected for study is as splendid an example as perhaps may be found in the whole career of the art we have noticed how the irish missionaryartists carried their work to their continental settlements how they planted their schools in burgundy switzerland and lombardy of all their depositories however numerous as they are elsewhere none is richer in the relics of their work than the celebrated abbey which takes its name of st gall from that disciple of st columbanus who in 614 founded his little cell beside the steinach about nine miles south of the lake of constance under charles martel the cell had become a monastery which he endowed as a benedictine abbey in 830 was founded its magnificent library of mss the library still exists and at the present moment gives shelfroom to 1800 mss and more than 41700 printed books besides this another called the town library founded in the sixteenth century and containing 500 mss and 60400 printed books gives this upland busy modern manufacturing swiss town no mean importance as a centre of literary culture physically it is probably the highest town in europe its streetlevel being very nearly 2200 feet above that of the sea its libraries and museums are rich storehouses of medival treasures the architect raves over its monastic buildings the scholar and palographer gloat over its books and mss in the libraries of st gall are some of the masterpieces of irish saxon and carolingian art and its great benedictine abbey under grimald from 841 ie during the later carolingian period possessed one of the most active scriptoria in europe to begin with the beginning however we must leave st gall and passing by some less important mss go back to the year 781 and the city of toulouse in that year and in the abbey of st sernin saturninus in that city was finished a wonderful and truly splendid manuscript of the gospels as a present to the emperor and his wife hildegardis this is our first example it now is to be seen in the national library paris nouv acqu lat 1203 next comes the evangeliary of abbat angilbert of centula now st riquier near abbeville charlemagnes soninlaw this ms executed about the year 793 is still preserved in the town library of abbeville in the same rank but somewhat finer in execution comes a third evangeliary that of st mdard of soissons now in the national library paris no 8850 lat in these three mss reproductions from which are to be found in various modern works on art the writing and ornamentation are the parts into which the artist puts his best work not the figure drawing although in the st sernin ms there is in the christfigure a distinct attempt at portraiture quite different from the coils and penflourishes which make up the gospelfigures in the irish and merovingian mss here the inspiration is clearly greek not irish the figure is draped in green and violetseated on an embroidered cushion before a low castellated wall the hair is light and the chin beardless the design shows a decided likeness to the consular ivory diptychs and the painting follows the eastern methods in the details of ornament only are irish features thus we trace in this ms the sources of carolingian art the ms being dated is important as affording a means of comparison with other undated work it was presented to st sernin on the occasion of the visit of the emperor and empress with their son the amiable louis le debonaire14 just after the latter had been made king of aquitaine godeschalk the writer of it on the last two leaves tells us that it took him seven years to accomplish it is written throughout in gold and silver letters on purple vellum and is moreover ornamented with borders pictures portraits and panellings at first it was kept in a cumdach of silver set with precious stones but that has disappeared 14 mod fr debonnaire the golden gospels of st mdard like the centula ms are similar but betoken an advance in both taste and execution the figures are still rude and deformed but the artist shows a laudable desire an ambition in fact to imitate the work of better artists than himself nevertheless the calligraphy and borderwork are the best parts of his performance in this ms the use of silver betrays a tendency to prodigality in design the influence of the artists who built the new church of san vitale at ravenna a church which became the model for the abbey of st mdard itself is quite manifest yet perhaps need not be traced further than soissons or pavia in certain of the illustrations as for instance the fountain of life there is at once a likeness and a variation as compared with the same symbol in the evangeliary of st sernin they are both too intricate to describe but of both it may be said that they show an intimate acquaintance with early christian symbolism the ivory carving and architecture of ravenna have evidently been known to the director of these frames and backgrounds in the year which saw the completion of godeschalks gospels alcuin was at parma but when the st mdards gospels were written he was abbot of st martins at tours it was the presence of alcuin at the court of charlemagne that accounts for the prevalence of the saxon character in the new and beautiful handwriting we now call carolingian it was the presence of paul warnefrid that accounts for much of the classic and most of the lombardic features both of the writing and the illumination many other scholars assisted these two in the various centres in which alcuin established branches of the palatine schools the intercourse with italy and england was constant and led to the frequent interchange of books and community of methods and models another fine ms of the same period c 780 is the golden adacodex of st mesmin or maximin of trves in 1794 this ms was taken from trves to mainz in 1815 it was transferred to aixlachapelle and is now back again at trves the externals of the adacodex are very costly its binding being a late gothic pendant to the cover of the echternach evangeliary at gotha in the centre of the forecover there is a magnificent topaz15 with several imperial figures inside the work is a handsome example of the early carolingian16 it contains the four gospels written by order of the mother and lady ada sister of charles the great abbess of st mesmin next we have in the british museum another grand example of the style as modified by english or saxon influence also the zurich bible of the same date executed at toursand the bamberg bible said to be a copy of the alcuin bible of the same school then follow the drogo sacramentary presented by the emperor to his natural son drogo archbishop of metz 826855 perhaps illuminated at metz but of the same school as those above mentioned 15 or sardonyx lamprecht says topaz 16 a photograph of the cover is sold by f linz of trves in our own national library again we have the athelstan gospels harl 2788 also in all probability executed at metz at paris nat lib theol lat 266 is the evangeliary of lothairea most beautiful example of goldwriting and ornament so we might enumerate a score of splendid mss and classify them into their various minor schools but such is not our object all we want here is a general but clear idea of the style as a whole to characterise it broadly by the names of its most important elements we should call it a lombardsaxon stylethe interlacing bands and knots and other minor features and the main character of the writing being of saxon origin the classical foliages and manner of painting the figures and certain ideas of design lombardic strengthened by direct contact with the sources of the latter style whatever variations there may be they can generally be accounted for according to locality and centre of production we have instanced a few examples of the earlier time as showing the principal features of the style under the emperor charles the greats grandson charles the bald carolingian illumination reached its highest point of excellence and the mss executed for him or his contemporaries accordingly give a correct idea of what carolingian illuminators considered as good work the chief centres were still tours and metzthe latter a branch of the former but gradually developing distinct features of its own and among the productions of these schools there still remain preciouswe might say pricelessexamples such as the vivien bible of the paris library socalled because presented by count vivien abbat of st martins of tours to charles the bald in 85017 it contains a fine picture of the presentation with beardless figures it has also a number of exceedingly splendid initials showing strong byzantine influencecapitals of columns of classic origin and traces of merovingian in letter forms and ornamental details it is like the evangeliary of lothaire already mentioned a most sumptuous example rich in silver and goldthe latter having a grand portrait of lothaire seated on his throne both mss are in the national library at paris the vivien no 1 theol lat the lothaire no 266 but the one example to which we would call the readers attention though among the earlier productions of the period as not only most readily accessible but most precious to the english student is the celebrated alcuin bible in the british museum add ms 10546 this venerable ms is a copy of the vulgate revised by alcuin himself and said to be exactly similar to the one at bamberg biblical revision was perhaps the most important of his many literary occupations and this volume is reasonably believed to be the actual copy prepared for presentation to charlemagne under the revisers own superintendence possibly in part at least the work of his own hand it is a large folio finely written in a neat minuscule mainly saxon hand with uncial initials in two columns the miniatures including their architectural details are in the roman manner the ornaments partly byzantine partly celtic the great similarity of design between different manuscripts is strikingly exemplified by a comparison of three borders from a the evangeliary of st vaast of arras fol 28 v see delisle b the evangel in national library paris anc fds lat 257 see louandre and evangeliary no 309 bibl de cambrai see durieux 17 plate in t 1 of louandre indeed comparisons of this kind are very instructive frequently as suggestive of provenance as each working centre would have its own set of models and designs of course comparison of the mss themselves is out of the question but the comparisons can often be effected by the students having louandre durieux fleury labarte etc by his side during the examination of any given period the limits of our little book forbid our speaking of other examples of this splendid style but we cannot conclude without noticing that in the opinion of m ferdinand denis the golden gospels of st mdard of soissons is the most beautiful carolingian mss extant chapter xii monastic illumination introductorymonasteries and their work from the sixth to the ninth centurythe claustral schoolsalcuinwarnefrid and theodulfclerics and monasticsthe golden age of monasticismthe order of st benedictcistercian housesother ordersprogress of writing in carolingian timesdivision of labour in the sixth century the monasteries such as they were necessarily kept themselves very quiet and unobtrusive they were situated usually in outoftheway corners solitudes apart from civilisation or at least apart from the busy haunts of men in the eighth century there is a marked difference the capitular of aixlachapelle of 789 required that minor schools should be attached to all monasteries and cathedral churches without exception and that children of all ranks both noble and servile should be received into them also that the larger monasteries should open major schools in which the seven sciences of mathematics astronomy arithmetic music rhetoric dialectics and geography were to be taughtand this in two ways there were to be two sorts of schoolsinterior or claustral intended for monastics only and exterior or canonical intended for secular students these schools were under separate scholastics or masters and lay students were received in the exterior schools as freely and fully as in the public schools of the present time mabillon18 gives a list of some twentyseven monastic and cathedral schools by no means confined to great or wealthy cities but well distributed throughout the empire 18 prfat in iv scul 184 in the time of charlemagne those most in repute were tours st gall fulda reims and hirsfeld we have given the names of alcuin and paul warnefrid as the chief promoters of the carolingian revival but we should not omit that of theodulf of orleans the indefatigable school inspector of the time he it was who assisted the artistic side of the movement by his ingenious contrivances as a writer and illustrator of school books undoubtedly it was from his suggestions that we so often find in medival scientific treatises of the driest kind those graphic and wonderful tabulations and edifices labelled and turreted which make aristotle priscian and marcianus capella not only comprehensible but attractive theodulf composed in simple and easy latin versesomewhat after the style of the propria qu maribus our own childhoodthe description of a supposed tree of science which he had drawn and painted on the trunk and branches of which were the figures and names of the seven liberal arts at the foot sat grammarthe basis of all learningholding on her hand a lengthy rod ominous for the tender student on the right rhetoric stretched forth her hand on the left was dialectic philosophy sat on the summit the rest being disposed according to their relative importance the whole was explained in the carmina de septem artibus in which the bishop who was one of the famous poets of the age strove in flowery language to render these dryasdust studies acceptable to the youthful understanding theodulf was a great scholar and assisted alcuin in the revision of the bible one copy of which he himself had written whilst still abbat of fleury about 790 at the beginning of this bible is a poem in golden letters on purple and a preface in prose also in golden letters giving a synopsis of the several books the text differs somewhat from the alcuin bible as it is that of jerome before alcuins revision this ms is now at paris another bible executed to the order of theodulf is now in the town library at puy it seems incredible after the efforts made by charlemagne and his ministers for the maintenance of learning and the arts that there should ever be any risk of a return to barbarism but it is a fact that the dissolution of the empire proved in certain localities the suspension of prosperity fortunately the monasticsespecially the benedictinesand the canons of the cathedrals still kept up the practice of copying books but almost all the south of france languedoc and provence always conservative remained more or less illiterate they produced poets and jongleurs but seldom artists or scholars and even in the north where the capitular schools were most flourishingas paris reims and chartresthe general tendency was towards relapse in high germany it was even worse in spite of all efforts of the clergy by the extension of secular schools the laity preferred the excitement of chase and camp to the quiet humdrum of the schoolroom religion seemed to be regarded rather as a profession than a principle quite right in its place ie the church and the monastery but unsuited for active life the wealthy landowners therefore did not cease to endow religious houses or to build churches but they left booklearning to the clerics accordingly the clerics and the monastics flourished exceedingly from the beginning of the tenth century to the beginning of the thirteenth was the golden age of monasticism the order of st benedict scattered its foundations thickly over france and western germany while its reformed colonies of cluny citeaux clairvaux and the chartreuse again spread their settlements in all directions thus we find cluny established in 910 grammont in 1076 the chartreuse in 1080 citeaux in 1098 savigny in 1105 tiron in 1109 austin canons in 1038 premonstrants in 1120 crutched friars in 1169 in england from 1100 scarcely a year passed by without the establishment of some fresh foundation during the thirtyfive years of the reign of henry i more than 150 religious houses were founded and even during the disastrous reign of stephen in less than twenty years no fewer than 100 houses of various orders were established the twelfth century in england was especially the age of monasteries it is true that not very much in the way of original literature except theological treatises can be assigned to the three centuries referred to but the unwearied labours of the copyist and illuminator did much to preserve the works which previous centuries had created of course in so long a period changes were many and great so great indeed that between a ms of 850 and another of 1200 scarcely is there a common feature from 850 to 1000 in france the carolingian minuscule from the first so clear and beautiful remained with scarce a stroke of alteration but immediately after the opening of the eleventh century a series of rapid changes set in and by the beginning of the twelfth a new hand perfectly clear and regular but quite different from the carolingian had been formed which lasted until it was superseded by the gothic while a system of contractions adopted because of the scarcity of parchment creates a fresh need for study apart from the peculiarities of personal habits side by side too with this there grows up a nonprofessional handthe socalled cursive or running hand of the ordinary writerin many cases especially in deeds and other brief compositions all but utterly illegible except to the professional palographer occasionally these autographs are of the highest importance and intensely interesting as for instance when in an english ms we come across a note in the handwriting of ordericus vitalis or matthew paris from 900 to 1200 the vast majority of mss illuminated and otherwise were the work of monastics every house of any note had its room set apart for writing the larger monasteries sometimes utilised the cloisters of the churches themselves in recesses of which they had desks or tables placed for the copyist usually however they had a large common room called the scriptorium where either the copyist and illuminator worked separately and each on his own account or where a number of copyists awaited with pen and parchment the dictation by one of the fraternity of some work of which a number of copies had to be made no admittance except on business was the rule of this chamber there under the direction of the armarius the expert writers did their work sometimes a single monk executed the book from first to last by himself he prepared the vellum ruled it with the fine metal point copied the text painted the illuminations put on the gilding and even added the binding generally however the labour was dividedone monk scraped and polished the parchment another ruled it another wrote the text leaving spaces for initials and miniatures another put in the initials and did the gilding and flourishing with borders etc and another painted the miniatures this in the monasteries was done in the case of large and important mss and afterwards when illuminating became a laycraft subdivision of labour was the common practice binding was done in a special apartment and by one specially skilled therein the scriptorium was looked upon as a sort of sacred place and the work of copying often considered as a labour of piety and loveentered upon with devout prayer and solemnly blessed by the superior especially in cases where the books to be written were bibles or connected with the services of the house the lives of the saints or treatises on theology very frivolous or absurd indeed are sometimes the inducements to copyists to do gratuitous work of this kind such as that every letter transcribed paid for one sin of the copyist and it is said that a certain monka heavy sinneronly owed his salvation to the fact that the number of letters in a bible which he copied exceeded by a single unit the sum total of his sins chapter xiii monastic illuminationcontinued the copyistsgratuitous labourlast words of copyistsdisputes between cluny and citeauxthe abbey of cluny its grandeur and influencesuse of gold and purple vellumthe more influential abbeys and their work in france germany and the netherlands of course only really expert calligraphers were employed on great and important works in the monastery all such labour was gratuitous that is the copyist received no pecuniary remuneration only his food and lodging yet even this had to be provided for hence the frequent requests for donations from the laity to give a volume to a monastery did not always mean actually to present the book but to stand the expense of its production in the monastery itself in the case of specially distinguished penmen their entertainment in a monastery was sometimes an expensive business it was only in later times however when layartists were invited to reside in the monastery to do their work that money was paid for their services very often we find notices at the end of volumes that soandso had ordered the book to be written and illuminated at his expense and an invocation for the gratitude of the reader and remembrance in his prayers is added sometimes with the date to the very hour when the book was finished the copyists last words after his task was completed are often very full of wearinesssometimes

write thinks it is no trouble as time goes on after the tenth century it is noticeable that the more beautiful a manuscript becomes in its writing the less accurate becomes its latinity and so the monks who once were noted for learning gradually lose their grip on latin the manuscripts executed in benedictine abbeys became inaccuratealmost illiterate faults of ignorance of words misrendering of proper names blundering in the inept introduction of marginal notes and confounding such notes with the text showing that the heart of the copyist was not in his work nor his head capable of performing it his hand is simply a machine which when it goes wrong does so without remorse and without shame so in the greater houses men were appointed whose sole business was to supervise the copyistsin fact to supply the brains while the scribe furnished the manipulation of the pen even they however did not always succeed to perfection as very few of them were too well furnished with scholarship there were not many alcuins or theodulfs in the twelfth century what they did usually keep free from serious error were the books used in their own services it was the aim particularly among the cistercian houses to have their liturgical texts absolutely without fault in respect of illumination there was a great quarrel between the abbey of citeaux and that of cluny the great abbey of clugny or cluny in ancient burgundy was founded in 910 and in the course of a century or obtained a degree of splendour influence and prosperity unrivalled by any other medival foundation it possessed enormous wealth and covered western europe with its affiliated settlements under peter the venerable when the controversy began it was the chief monastic centre of the christian world the words of pope urban ii when addressing the community were ye are the light of the world the grand basilica at cluny was completed in 1131 and until the erection of st peters at rome was the largest church in christendom and even then was only ten feet shorter than the roman edifice the building is a masterpiece of architectural beauty and massiveness being with its narthex added by abbat roland de hainaut no less in length than 555 feet the splendour of the church its gorgeous tombs and mausoleums its huge coronals for lights of brass silver and goldthe grand candelabrum before the altar with its settings of crystal and berylthe mural painting of the cupola and the general luxury and magnificence of the whole constituted an unpardonable sin in the eyes of the stern and selfdenying cistercians hence arose long disputes between the abbats of the two houses about tithes and other matters among the other matters were included questions of candlesticks and bindings and gildings of books the two houses were long at variance on the right definition of luxury in living and this variance may to this day be observed in their separate and distinct styles both of architecture and the ornamentation of books the use of gold was still continued in the older benedictine abbeys but was long forbidden in the cistercian almost all the ornament of the latter being confined to pendrawing and the use of coloured inks the employment of gold for the text of manuscripts so common in the ninth century became rare in the eleventh only here and there do we hear of such volumes where the gold lettering still lingers it is confined to the first page or two and the same may be said of the purple vellum a certain monk admar who died at jerusalem in 1034 wrote a life of st martial of limoges entirely in letters of gold but it was quite an exceptional volume another example occurs in an evangeliary which was probably a copy of a ninthcentury model as at first glance it might be assigned to that age but on closer examination it is found that in one of the borders is a medallion bearing the name of the emperor otho showing that it cannot be later than the latter part of the tenth century it is now in the national library at paris before speaking of othonian illumination it may be well to refer to that of the netherlands in these earlier centuries the most ancient writings known in this district were charters and other documents and the pious effusion of the occupants of the monasteries such as st amand lobbes stavelot etc it was the revival of art and literature under charlemagne that was the beginning of artistic calligraphy then followed the production of books outside the monasteries classical authors chronicles and mirrors of various sciences in the eleventh century we find monastic books and others of which the ornamentation is sometimes even splendid such as psalters evangeliaries bibles and missals glowing with gold and colours already the abbeys of stavelot and lige were highclass centres of production st martins of tournay had a famous scriptorium also noted for the beauty of its writing and its grand initial letters immediately following st martins the abbeys of gembloux st bavon at ghent and others produced or acquired mss of the most sumptuous kind and before the thirteenth century the netherlands had established quite a distinguished reputation in a later chapter we shall deal with the development of its remarkable schools whose work eventually took rank not only among the most artistic but the most prolific in europe chapter xiv

burgundythe empress theophanohenry ii and the empress cunegundabambergexamples of othonian art perhaps the first departure towards a new style arising out of the elements of carolingian illumination is in the combination of the bird and serpent used for letter forms and continued into coils of vinestem and foliage in combination with golden panelled frames or pilasters the monsters thus produced seem to be a revival of the dracontine forms of the semibarbarous celtic and early frankish arts but the difference in elegance and refinement of drawing and beauty of colouring is very great indeed other animal forms are also made use of nor is the human figure altogether absent sometimes entire letters are made up of the latter in various attitudes little scenes illustrative of the subject which the initial commences are often placed within it as for instance in the b of the first psalm19 19 a characteristic othonian evangeliary of the eleventh century executed at the abbey of stavelot

twelfthcentury initials look like designs in metalwork placed on the panelled grounds of coloured enamels but the rapid development of the vinestem coils out of the stemless foliages of the carolingian and winchester styles is one of the wonders of the early german revival after the accession of the emperor otho i a still greater improvement takes place after the marriage of his son otho ii to the princess theophano daughter of romanus ii attributable no doubt to a fresh accession of artistic enthusiasm from the home of the new empress in point of elegance of design beauty of curve adaptation of every part to its share in the composition nothing could be finer than the initial letters of the othonian period of illumination the year 963 introduced greek fashions and greek artists into germany the results of which are at once traceable in the increased splendour of monastic illumination in that country the details of greek ornament become the fillings of the frames and panels of the large initials the cistercian illuminators or rather calligraphers while they constantly repudiate the golden splendour and monstrous follies of their rivals absolutely excel in this same ornamental draughtsmanship what for example could be finer than the pendrawing of the great arnstein bible in the british museum harl 2800 the ornament is mostly in a red ink with flatcoloured blue green or yellow backgrounds but it is not to be surpassed no the interlacements and coils foliages and panels of the twelfth century are absolutely among the finest examples of ornamental lettering ever conceived illuminating seemed at this epoch to be more and more closely following the details of contemporary architecture and so paving the way to the next great variety of the art which is looked upon by some writers as the real beginning of medival illumination it must be admitted however that the excellence limits itself to the ornament the human figure is wretchedly incorrecteven barbarous it may be asked why is this how is it that while the decorative portion of an illuminated book is beautiful in the highest degree both in line and colour and yet occasionally the artist seems not to have the remotest idea of the true shape of hands and feet or any part of the human body of course the usual explanation offered is that monastic education did not permit the study of the nude and hence the monkish ignorance of figure drawing but that is scarcely an excuse for the monstrous hands and feet and exaggerated facial expression of the miniatures the italian monk angelico in spite of his monastic limitations succeeded in a most graceful rendering of the figure and a charming delicacy in the forms of the hands as in some instances the artist does reach a fair standard it must be admitted that where he does not is owing to actual inability in himself and not in his system the three emperors who give the name of othonian to the period immediately succeeding the carolingian ruled germany and had much to do with the ruling of italy from 936 when otho i called the great succeeded henry the fowler about five years before the death of athelstan whose sister eadgyth20 was othos first wife his mother mathilda was the patroness of the cloisterschools for women working in them personally she herself taught her servants and maids the art of reading her daughter mathilda the famous abbess of quedlinburg in 969 persuaded the abbat wittikind of corvey to write the history of the saxon kings henry her father and otho her brother now in the royal library at dresden hazecha the treasurymistress of quedlinburg also employed the monks of corvey with whose beautiful initial drawing she was greatly pleased to illuminate her own life of st christopher the beautiful but imperious princess hedwig another of othos sisters read virgil with ekkehard of st gall and taught the child burchard greek while othos niece gerberga abbess of gandersheim was the instructress of the celebrated hrosvita the oldest german poetess and this reminds us that at this time the womencloisters of germany and the netherlands were among the most active centres of learning and bookproduction the great monument of feminine erudition and artistic skill called the hortus deliciarum was of a somewhat later time but other examples still exist among them the beautiful niedermnster gospels of the abbess uota now at munich a woodcut by albert drer prefixed to the first edition of hrosvitas works nrnberg 1501 represents the nun hrosvita kneeling before the emperor and beside the archbishop wilhelm of mainz presenting her book21 as to the literary labours of hrosvita this is not the place to discuss them she is simply an incidental figure in our view of the brilliant court of the othos a ms of her works 500 years after her death was found among the dust of the cloisterlibrary at st emmeram of regensburg by conrad celtis and as we have seen printed for the first time in 1501 thus she stands out as an illustration of the fact often alluded to of the importance of feminine foundations in the monastic scheme 20 the chroniclers are rather confused as to the name of this princess 21 it is thought however by some that the figure behind is that of the abbessnot the archbishop see drer soc portfolio for 1900 her picturesque story of the romantic adventures of adelheid of burgundy her marriage in 947 to king lothaire of italy her widowhood and perils her misfortunes and eventual marriage to the emperor otho reads more like a chapter from the morte darthur or the arabian nights than a veracious history of real people the empress adelheid was indeed a remarkable woman and the nun of gandersheim is full of her praises in her younger days she had been a zealous patron and protectress of the abbey of cluny which stood on her native land of burgundy and her sympathies remained always with the religious houses in this respect indeed she was a worthy successor of the pious mathilda and her daughters she died in her seventyfirst year in her abbey of selz in elsass leaving a memory rich in benefits to the monastics especially those of cluny and venerated as the patroness of many an illuminated volume of poems or theology not to mention the liturgical books executed at her expense for use in her various foundations the tenth century seems to have been an age of illustrious women no sooner do we leave the story of adelheid than we enter upon that of the young wife of otho ii the empress theophano daughter of the greek emperor romanus ii when little more than a child she was married to the son of adelheid he himself being in his twentieth year in the year 972 and in the city of rome the young greek princess who had been reared amid the luxury and splendour of the eastern capital at once became the fashionthe manners of her byzantine household became those of her roman court and were transplanted to her german home at bamberg artists limners copyists musicians scholars formed part of her retinue and at once the german court became the rival of those of england byzantium cordova and rome it was indeed a renaissance an awakening in literature art and social life nor did its glory fade until eclipsed by the succeeding rivalries of france and italy theophano survived her husband who died in 983 and proved herself a capable regent during the infancy of her son otho iii she however did not live to see his early death nor indeed to see that of the aged adelheid who survived her eight years and died in the same year 999 as othos aunt matilda abbess of quedlinburg the death of otho iii in 1002 did not affect materially the steady advance of monastic art bamberg st gall corvey luxeuil bobbio monte cassino continued their accustomed labours under the capetian kings the french foundations maintained the reputations they had won during the carolingian times while others were added from time to time throughout the rhineland limousin and the south of france where the romanesque or byzantine tastes had not yet penetrated and whose work therefore remained distinct from that of italy and the german empire henry ii and the empress cunigunda made bamberg the great centre of german art and it is to bamberg st gall luxeuil monte cassino and magdeburg that we have to look for the finest productions of the eleventh century among the earlier works of the othonian period we may mention the famous gospelbook executed for the minister of otho ii egbert archbishop of trves and known as the codex egberti it was written in 980 at reichenau on the lake of constance or bodensee as it is locally known by two monks kerald and heribert whose dwarfish figures appear beneath that of the archbishop on the frontispiece it contains fiftyseven illuminations and several folios of violet parchment with golden ornaments and lettering but its pictures are rather remarkable mostly the figures are too short and the limbs and extremities badly drawn but in some of the statelier personages the error is reversed and they are too tallthis seems to be owing to greek influence while the byzantine taste shows itself in the treatment of the borderfoliages beasts are unnaturaldemons and swine are alike both in form and colour pub lib trves an evangeliary formerly in the cathedral treasury at bamberg but now in the royal library at munich cimel 58 is a good example of the kind of work that at first glance appears to be actually carolingian both in the figures attitudes and treatment of drapery but which on closer examination proves to be really due to the reign of otho ii in this ms the beginning of st matthew contains four medallionstwo of henry i the fowler one of otho i his son and another of his grandson otho ii nat lib paris lat 8851 a still more notable ms is kept in the munich library cimel 58 containing a twopaged picture of tributary cities bringing gifts to the emperor otho iii in the painting in this ms notwithstanding the exaggerated solemnity of expression the faces are well drawn and the features carefully modelled the painting is in the greek manner as is also the general character of the draperies the small illdrawn feet are by no means comparable with the heads the imperial crown is square like those of the magi in the bremen ms now in the library of brussels or like that of baldwin as emperor of constantinople in the several enthronements which occur among the imperial miniatures at munich there are important and significant differences which might not be noticed unless pointed out the changes in the shape and treatment of the orb for instance mean more than a mere advance in enrichment or an improvement in artistic skill the difference indicates a change in political usage in the miniature of charles it does not occur at all in that of otho iii it is a mere symbol in that of henry ii it is the actual emblem of sovereignty presented by the pope to the emperor to be held by the latter in token of his investiture it was seldens opinion that the orb surmounted by the cross never appears in western art until the time of henry ii thus it is here one of the many seemingly insignificant details which in the miniature art of the middle ages contribute to the elucidation of history chapter xv franconian illumination the later saxon schoolsbernward of hildesheimtuotilo and hartmut of st gallenportrait of henry ii in ms 40 at munichnetherlandish and other work comparedalleged deterioration of work under the franconian emperors not truebad character of the eleventh century as to artexample to the contrary the ms just referred to munich cimel 58 brings us most probably to the time of the third otho but it is really with his fathers marriage to the princess theophano that the great revival in the arts began and the names of st bruno of cologne and augsburg gerbert bernward of hildesheim tuotilo salomon hartmut folchard and sintramn of st gallen are as it were points of light and centres of expanding circles of artistic skill bruno and gerbert are too well known to need any further remark bernward of hildesheim made bishop there in 992 by theophano and tutor to her son otho iii excelled no less in the mechanical than in the liberal arts he was an excellent penman a good painter and as a household manager was unequalled such is tangmars tribute to his pupils character he was indeed an enthusiast in painting mosaic and metalwork and used to collect all the objects of art he could lay hands on to form a museum or studio for the instruction of a class of art students and workmen the collection was formed mainly out of the numerous presents brought to the young emperor from foreign and especially greek and oriental princes and contained many examples of beautiful metalwork and greek illumination his own cathedral of hildesheim was supplied with jewelled servicebooks in part at least the work of his own hand the chalices and incenseburners and the massive golden corona or candelabrum of the cathedral were also the productions of his own workshops the mural paintings too were executed by himself his handiwork so lovingly described by his old schoolmaster tangmar may still be seen in hildesheim where visitors to that quaint old saxon city are told that the bronze gates of the cathedral and the jewelled crucifix were placed there by the venerable bishop himself in 1015 while in the cathedralclose rises a column adorned with bronze reliefs from the life of christ authoritatively declared to be the work of his own handslet us say they came out of his own workshops in the year 1022 nearly a thousand years ago st bernward was canonised by celestine iii in 1194 his sarcophagus is in the crypt of the basilica of st michael at hildesheim of tuotilo the pupil of moengall or marcellus it is said that he was physically almost a giant just the man says his biographer that you would choose for a wrestler he was a good speaker had a fine musical voice was a capital carver in wood and an accomplished illuminator like most of the earlier monks of st gallen he was a clever musician equally skilful with the trumpet and the harp and the charm about it all was that he was always cheerful and in excellent spirits and in consequence a general favourite nor is this all besides being teacher of music in the upper school to the sons of the nobility he was classical tutor and could preach both in latin and greek his chief accomplishments however were music and painting and on these his reputation mainly rests he composed songs which like an irish bard he sang to the harpthe popular instrument of this irish foundation being thus multifariously accomplished he was by the way an excellent boxer he was much in request and by the permission of his abbot travelled to distant places one of his celebrated sculptures was the image of the blessed virgin for the cathedral at metz said to be quite a masterpiece nay he was even a mathematician and astronomer and constructed an astrolabe or orrery which showed the courses of the planets this allusion to the astrolabe reminds us that it was abbat hartmut of st gallen who was also an accomplished illuminator who constructed a large map of the worldone of the extremely few that until that time the world had ever seen st gallen and its artists however must not be permitted to monopolise our attention too long the reader must for the rest refer to dr rahn and the writers whom he quotes sometimes it is said that the illuminations of the eleventh century are proofs of the rapid decline of art and to demonstrate the fact that they are frankly hideous some writers bring forward instances such as the miniatures of a missal especially a crucifixion said to be at paris22 and a ms at berlin said to have been executed in the earlier days of the franconian dynasty 10341125 containing another crucifixion which though not quite so horrible as the one just referred to is sufficiently bad these miniatures are irredeemably barbaric and not in any sense typical of the age such examples in fact can be found in any age and in any country were they really representative of the best art of the time there might be an excuse for their reproduction but they are not and therefore no reliance can be placed on their evidence 22 le livre etc par mp louisy paris 1886 8 p 79 in the miniatures of mss executed for the othos and henrys of the early saxon dynasty the worst they can be charged with as compared with the periods before and after them is slavish imitation the portrait of henry ii saint henry husband of cunegunda in ms 40 at munich is by no means barbaricit is more greek than anything elsebut it is down to the smallest element of composition a direct imitation of the similar portrait of charles the bald in the emmeram gospels it is not a copy for there is a significant difference in the attitudes of the emperors henry holds a sceptre in his right hand and an orb in his left like otho iii in the miniature already described whereas charles is empty handed then both on the emperors head and on the smaller figures the crowns are differentthe panelling of the imperial canopy is different and of course there is a different inscription lastly it may be said that some of the differences are improvements another change is characteristiccharles was beardless henry has a pointed beard it is true this is an example belonging to the very brightest years of the othonian revival but to pass over other saxon mss there are extant examples from evroul when roger de warenne son of the great earl of surrey practised as a scribe and illuminator on his retirement to that monastery st martins of tournay st amand benedictbeuern lobbes and weissobrunn could all boast accomplished calligraphers the last establishment produced the celebrated diemudis who though a woman was distinguished by a most extraordinary activity and skill nor are these all that could be named for by no means least among them we may quote monte cassino many of whose elegant productions have been published by the present occupants of the monastery then the greek miniaturists of the eleventh century are once more to the front the famous slav evangeliary of ostromir 105667 shows us a ms probably executed for a governor of novgorod which contains by no means despicable work whether in the figures of the evangelists or the ornamental borders of course in greek mss we know pretty well what to expect fairly good ornament rich details of embroidery etc wilfulness of colour in architecture mannerism in the attitudes and faces but good clever technic and bright gold lastly there is the celebrated evangeliary given to san benedetto of mantua by the countess matilda now in the vatican enriched with little miniatures from the life of the virgin which lanzi declares surpass everything else he ever saw of the same period the poitevin ms at poitiers a biographical compilation of saints in honour of st radegonde though nothing wonderful is worth recording as a transitional example just before the close of the century as an example of the latter part of a continual deterioration it should be worse than anything preceding yet it is not so it is certainly heavy and rather dull and the drawing far from excellent but it is also on the other hand far from frankly horrible in introducing examples of other schools into this chapter the writers object has solely been to vindicate the illuminators of the eleventh century from the sweeping charge sometimes made against them of absolute deterioration of the school directly under our notice the charge is certainly not true and the wretched stuff cited in support of it can only be looked upon as accidental salvages of no artistic value whatever in proof that the bookwork of the eleventh century was not all worthless we may refer to just one example it is a ms consisting of but a few fragments executed at luxeuil under abbat gerard ii the remains are such as to cause regret for the loss of the rest on one page christ is shown seated on a rich sella covered with an embroidered cushion in the manner of the consular diptychs he is clothed in a pale yellow tunic over which is worn a purple pallium with a white border he is beardless and his brown hair is kept close to the head and neck and falls over the shoulders the feet are nude and by no means illdrawn surrounding the head is a cruciform nimbus enclosed in a circleboth cross and circle being pale green the latter outlined with red the chief fault of the head is the excessive length of the nose and the wide stare of the eyes the right arm is raised somewhat as in the st sernin evangeliary but with the palm outwards and much superior in drawing the whole figure is painted on or at least surrounded by a golden backgroundso far indicating the byzantine origin of the design it is enclosed in a cusped aureola formed of several coloured bands of green violet and rose this shows german taste eight circlets or medallions surround this figure of christ four of which contain the symbols of the evangelists the other fourisaiah daniel ezechiel and jeremiah all hold portions of the band which connects them and on which appears a series of inscriptions in latin these consist of passages from the vulgate the whole picture is placed in a square frame consisting of bands of various colours and gold outlined in red the inner ground is chiefly blue and the names of the prophets and evangelists are painted on it in white roman capitals taken altogether it is a very splendid page but even this is surpassed in gorgeous richness of ornament by the miniature of st mark and the borders of other pages in this luxeuil fragment are full of ornament giving the impression that the work was imitated from that of the goldsmith and enameller the figures and symbols of the evangelists in these early gospel texts are fully explained after st jerome by alcuin whose revision of the vulgate forms the text of the durham book already referred to the manual shortly to be mentioned differs somewhat in its explanation of these symbols the curious combination called the tetra morph is a compound of the four attributes or symbols into a single figure to signify that the four evangelists give only one gospel and ought not to be separated it occurs frequently in greek but only seldom in latin or western iconography23 23 on this figure see annales archologiques tom 8 p 206 etc chapter xvi artistic education in the cloister the manualits discoveryits origin and contentsdidrons translationthe compendium of theophilusits contentsenglish version by hendriebenedictine and cistercian illuminationhow they differcharacter of monastic architects and artists about the twelfth century comes forward the mention of a certain manual minutely detailing every process of painting and laying down rules for the due composition and arrangement of every subject to be represented in the sacred history and other books connected with divine service how long such a manual had been in use is unknown but it is thought that something of the kind must have existed from the time at least of justinian perhaps earlier the manual here referred to was found by m didron at sphigmenou on mt athos this little monastery is said to have been founded by the empress pulcheria sister of the emperor theodosius the younger she died in the year 453 theodosius it may be remembered was himself an admirable penman and illuminator so much so as to have acquired the cognomen of kalligrphos the monastery is built in a narrow valley by the seaside between three little hills and as it were squeezed in and hence its name in greek greek small letter sigmagreek small letter phigreek small letter iotagreek small letter gammagreek small letter mugreek small letter epsilon with tonosgreek small letter nugreek small letter omicrongreek small letter final sigma which describes its situation exactly it is occupied by about thirty unusually neat and orderly monks who are justly proud of the few relics and curiosities which they exhibit to visitors it was at sphigmenou that curzon saw the piece of ancient jewellery set with diamonds and a russian or bulgarian ms of the gospels the book which m didron found there is the copy of an older ms which it is said was copied by dionysius one of the monks from the works of the once celebrated master manuel panselines of thessalonica who was the giotto of the byzantine school and flourished in the twelfth century if by works the monk meant literary it is most likely that it was the transcript of a still older document if by works dionysius meant paintings it is a manual of his practice one of his pupils in order to propagate the art of painting which he had learnt at thessalonica writes down the series of subjects to be taken from the bible so as to epitomise the divine scheme of salvation and describes the manner in which the events of the old testament and the miracles and parables of the new ought to be represented he mentions the scrolls and inscriptions such as we noticed in the gospels of luxeuil belonging to each of the prophets and evangelists with the names and characteristics of the principal saints in the order of the menologium or martyrology and then goes on to direct how the subjects should be arranged on the walls and cupolas of the churches the manual of dionysius is an abstract of this wide scheme but is still very comprehensive the copy of it seen by didron was one belonging to a monk of sphigmenou named joasaph who was himself a painter it was loaded with notes added by himself and his master which in course of time would be incorporated according to immemorial custom in the text in this way indeed the manual has grown to what it is at present a transcript of it may probably be found in every monastery belonging to the greek church another monk named macarios also a painter had a fine copy of it laid open in his atelier and his pupils read from it in turn whilst the rest painted according to its directions for the scheme itself we must refer the reader to the second volume of didrons christian iconography p 193 unfortunately the transcriber did not think it of sufficient importance or relevancy to copy the first part as being purely technical and dealing merely with the art of painting the scheme therefore only contains the part relating expressly to iconography it is to be regretted too that this part also has been in some places considerably abridged as dealing with greek art and martyrology more copiously than it was thought by the translator would be interesting to english readers there are numerous good and reliable introductory works dealing with early christian art besides the greater treatises to which the student who wants to pursue this line of research shall be directed later on but there is another of these original manuals to which we must call attention as especially dealing with the practice of monastic artists in the twelfth and following centuries the one to which we now refer is quite distinct from the greek manual which we just mentioned and by way of contrast may be called the latin manual as being originally composed in that language moreover as the greek manual formed the guide and vade mecum of all the painters of the greek church so this latin one became the indispensable monitor in all latin foundations its origin was german and said to be the compilation of a benedictine monk who is variously spoken of as rutgerius rugerius rotkerius etc and assigned by different editors and critics to either the eleventh twelfth or thirteenth centuries probably we shall not be far wrong in placing him about the middle of the twelfth the treatise is known as diversarum artium schedula and the compiler of it calls himself simply theophilus presbiter humilis which of course records nothing but his personal modesty it was at first attributed to tuotilo of st gallen this opinion was put forward by lessing but it had no foundation whatever beyond the fact of tuotilos wellknown versatility24 besides tuotilo lived in the ninth century but really the question of attributions does not concern us here it matters little who he was outside the treatise and certainly we shall not discuss the question further it is with the treatise that we are concerned we shall simply call the author theophilus and his work the compendium let us turn to it at once 24 tuotilo was renowned throughout all germany as painter architect preacher professor musician calligrapher latinist hellenist sculptor and astronomer the compendium which is thus known to contain the working methods of all the monastic illuminators mosaicists glass painters enamellers and so forth throughout germany lombardy and france consists of three books containing altogether one hundred and ninetyfive chapters of definite and special instructions in artistic matters book i comprising forty chapters treats of the preparation mixture and use of colours for wallpainting panel and parchment ie for the decoration of churches furniture and books it contains some most curious and valuable instructions for the employment of gold silver and other metals in the decoration of mss how it should be applied whether in leaf or as an ink how raised and burnished down to the minutest details of practice how colours are to be tempered ie mixed what media or temperings are best for each colour according to the surface to which it is to be applied such is the compendium we need not therefore wonder at its popularity and the estimation in which it was held thirtyone chapters on glass glass painting enamelling etc form a second book and the third and last book contains some hundred and twentyfour chapters on gold and silver workthe art of the goldsmithin cups chalices vases candelabra shrines and so on it is the first book that is of most interest to us and had we space we would have liked to quote from its pages but as it is we can only refer the reader to the work itself it is to be met with in various forms and editions first we recommend the english translation by robert hendrie the oldest ms of the work is one of the twelfth century in the library at wolfenbttel the next is in the imperial library at vienna fragments of other copies exist in several other public libraries but the completest copy known is that in the harl25 collection of the british museum used by hendrie as the basis of his translation 8 1847 25 1 harl ms 3915 it was as we have said in the eleventh and twelfth centuries especially that the great abbeys were founded and it cannot be too clearly stated that the principal abbatial churchesthose most splendid monuments of architecture whose structure and dimensions are still the admiration of the most cultured critics and in which all the rules of art were so marvellously appliedwere the work of simple monks the great church of st benignus at dijon so often spoken of by writers on burgundian art was built in 1001 under abbat william assisted by a young monk named hunaldus the period between 1031 and 1060 saw the creation of the grand abbatial church of st remi at reims in the words of the comte de montalembert from the very beginning of the monastic orders st benedict had provided in his rule that there should be artists in the monasteries he had imposed on the exercise of their art only one conditionhumility hence it is that all we know of the author of the compendium from himself is humilis presbiter theophilus for the same reason tuotilo and folchard and sintramn and the rest are never anxious to put their names upon their work for the same reason the occurrence of an artists name in a monastic ms is quite exceptional and unexpected the foresight of st benedict was accomplished and his law faithfully fulfilled the benedictine monasteries soon possessed not only libraries but ateliers where architecture painting mosaic sculpture metalchasing calligraphy ivory carving gemsetting bookbinding and all the branches of ornamentation were studied and practised with equal care and success without interfering in the least with the exact and austere discipline of the foundation the teaching of these various arts formed an essential part of monastic education the greatest and most saintly abbeys were precisely those most renowned for their zeal in the culture of art st gallen in germany monte cassino in italy cluny in france were for centuries the mothercities of christian art and after the establishment of the reformed colony at citeaux the cistercian order became the one above all others which has left the most perfect edifices and if the cistercian illumination may not claim the splendour of some contemporary examples it often excels them in soundness of design and severe correctness of execution in saying that all this kind of work was executed by monks we are speaking literally the monks were not only the architects but also the masons and even the hodmen of their edifices nor were the superiors in this respect different from their humble followers whilst ordinary monks were often the architectsinchief of the constructions the abbats voluntarily accepted the rle of labourers during the building of the abbey of bee in 1033 the founder and first abbat grandseigneur though he was worked as a common masons labourer carrying on his back the lime sand and stones necessary for the builder this was herluin another norman noble hugh abbat of selby in yorkshire when in 1096 he rebuilt in stone the whole of that important monastery putting on the labourers blouse mixed with the other masons and shared their labours monks illustrious by birth distinguished themselves by sharing the most menial occupations it is related of roger de warenne that when he retired to evroul he took up quite a serious rle of this kind in cleaning the shoes of the brethren and performing other offices which a mere cottager would have probably considered degrading occasionally in our school histories we come across the mention of a man like dunstan of whom it is related as a wonderful thing that he was at the same time a metal worker architect and calligrapher but monastic biographies abound in such instances we have already quoted several the same man was frequently says montalembert architect goldsmith bellfounder miniaturist musician calligrapher organ builder without ceasing to be theologian preacher litterateur sometimes even bishop or intimate counsellor of princes26 26 lart et les moines ann archologiques t vi p 121 etc chapter xvii the rise of gothic illumination germany

gospelsdescription of the msrise of gothicuncertainty of its originthe spirit of the age in the chapter on othonian art we saw how the ornamentation of books was drawn away from the great french centres and began to take a new departure from the various leading cities of germany such as bamberg which the othos had made their capital whilst the decline which was the inevitable consequence of a personal government like that of charlemagne took place in france it was but natural that the new artistic movement at bamberg should become the fashion and germany predominant in art as she was in politics in the twelfth century the german empire was the principal power in europe france italy england and spain were all more or less secondary italy however was already on the alert she was initiating certain movements in social life that must soon withdraw the cultivation of all the arts from the control of the monasteries at the same time the love of learning and personal accomplishments of the second and third othos and st henry ii soon prepared the imperial court to become as brilliant as classical scholarship and artistic skill of the highest class could make it the wave of byzantine influence which had passed over germany by the time of henry ii had immensely benefited the germans we notice it especially in the miniatures of the gospelbooks the technic is much more masterly the painting really methodical in soundly worked bodycolour with a delicate sense of harmony and showing no longer that coarse handling and slovenliness of execution that marks some of the carolingian miniatures in the figure a sense of proportion has been gained the tendency perhaps being rather to excessive tallness as compared with the thickset proportions of the carolingian work again expression is improvedthe faces are more intellectualnot beautiful but strong and quite superior to the utterly expressionless faces of the carolingian type take for example that fine missal now at munich cimel 60lat 4456 in which st henry who is bearded receives his crown from a bearded christ his arms being upheld by two bishops ulrich of augsburg and emmeram of regensburg the two great saints of bavaria we know these to be the personages represented because two inscriptions tell us so to the one supporting the kings right hand huius vodalricvs cor regis signet et actus to the other emmeranvs ei faveat solamine dulci the christ is seated on a rainbow within a cusped aureola or amande of several bands of different colours on the central one being inscribed in a mixture of greek and latin charactersone of the new fashions brought in by the greek revival clemens xpe tuo longum da vivere xpic to ut tibi devotus non perdat temporis usus some writers have thought this to be a picture of the emperors apotheosis and that the crown is that of life or immortality but such is certainly not the import of the above verses o gentle christ give to thy christ long to live that devoted to thee he may not lose the use of time besides two angels on either side christ precipitately bestow on the emperor the spear and sword of a temporal sovereignty round the emperor are the words ecce coronatur divinitus atque beatur rex pius heinricus proavorum stirpe polosus all which can scarcely refer to anything but his german empire the expression give to thy christ is an allusion to the hebrew usage of calling the king the anointed or the christ besides the interest possessed by this ms as a monument of the art of its own time it has a special value resting in the fact that its illuminations were copied from the famous emmeram golden gospels of charles the bald written by linthard and berenger and sent as a present to regensburg another illumination in it representing the enthronement of the emperor is extremely interesting as showing how the later artist renders the work of the earlier one the general composition is precisely the same the lower figures in the same attitudes and bearing the same insignia but in the details of costume and in the significant position of the emperor there are alterations in the miniature of the emmeram gospels the two angels above are simply winged messengers of the usual biblical type in the missal they are cloaked and crowned and bear horns in their hands in the older ms the two crowned figures with horns on either side wear simple mural crowns in the later one they are regal like those of the emperor the details also of the canopies are different but the remarkable difference is that while charles the bald is beardless and bears nothing in his hands merely sitting as if addressing an assembly henry ii holds in his right hand a sceptre and in his left an orb and cross here is a distinctly new feature with a meaning here are the symbols of authority in the emperors own hands and not merely in those of his attendants27 these two mss are worthy of careful study 27 see p 92 in another missal in the library at bamberg is a miniature of the emperor presenting the book to the virgin in the great evangeliary presented by the emperor henry ii to the cathedral of bamberg there is a grand picture of the emperor and his consort the famous saint cunegunda being crowned by christ with ss peter and paul standing at the sides here also as in the carolingian ms already mentioned are the nations bringing tribute but not in the same order here germany stands upright between two figures of gaul and rome while six others appear simply as busts munich cimel 60 4456 the twelfth century was clearly much given to symbolism and allegory as shown in apocalyptic commentaries and similar works a very remarkable apocalypse is that in the library of the marquis dastorga the latter is remarkably rich in pictures which have been described by ma bachelin of paris the drawing in these pictures reminds one of the basreliefs of the campaigns of hadrian and trajan and other work of the early roman centuries one hundred and ten miniatures of uncommon interest constitute the illustrations many of which are perfect curiosities of symbolism depicting not only the four figures of the evangelists but the mysteries of the seals and vials serpents beasts etc on yellow red green blue and brown backgrounds the draperies in some of the miniatures show byzantine teaching but with the grandiose style of the early roman times the ms it might be compared with of the twelfth century is the hortus deliciarum of the abbess herrade this latter ms which unfortunately was burnt with many other treasures during the siege of strassburg by the germans in 1870 was a veritable treasury of medival customs furniture and costumes illustrating a medley of encyclopdic information for the use of the nuns and secular students of the abbey of hohenburg in alsace the good abbess called her book a garden of delights it is known that it dated from 1159 as that date and also the date of 1175 occurred in its pages we do not know whether the authoress was also the illuminatrix but at any rate she directed the illumination their style is of the same type as that of the apocalypse just spoken of somewhat monumental as figures of the liberal arts allegorical figures of the virtues and vices and the syrens as symbols of sensual temptation there was a figure of the church riding upon a beast with the four heads of the evangelsymbolsthe sun and moon in chariots as in the classical mythology and scenes of warfare marriage festivities banquets everything indeed depicting the life of contemporary persons28 the drawing and treatment generally is of no very skilful kindthe colouring bright and in bodycolour draperies as usual much folded and fluttering and the heads generally of the calm expression of the later french school but the action sometimes very spirited 28 for a copious and exhaustive account of the hortus see het gildeboek utrecht 1877 v i also engelhardt herrad v h etc 8 with atlas of twelve plates 1818 the title began thus incipit hortus deliciarum in quo collectis floribus scripturarum assidue jucundetur turmula adolescentularum in the rhytmus came the lines salve cohors virginum hohenburgensium albens quasi lilium amans dei filium herrat devotissima tua fidelissima mater et ancillula cantat tibi cantica sic et liber utilis tibi delectabilis et non cesses volvere hanc in tuo pectore in the netherlands which mostly at this time lay within the boundary of lotharingia or lorraine the style of illumination was much the same as in other german districts gospelbooks and psalters however exhibit features somewhat akin to english work in the eleventh and twelfth centuries the continental methods prevail in more solid painting and less penwork of the twelfthcentury work of germany examples are exceedingly numerous stretching over every province from west to east as westphalia the palatinate burgundy switzerland and bavaria extending even into bohemia an evangeliary in the university library at prag agrees altogether with those of germany towards the middle of the twelfth century with the accession of the house of hohenstaufen 1138 etc arose a new style since called romanesque of which many examples are to be found in various libraries it is not very easy to select the most typical examples but one good and typical ms is found in a gospelbook at carlsruhe which contains some capital miniatures of this most thoroughly german style under frederick barbarossa as under the caroling emperors and the othos we may note a wave of new life especially in saxony a contrast as regards artistic ability to the hortus deliciarum is the gospelbook executed for henry the lion at the convent of helmershausen once in the cathedral library at prag and bought by king george of hanover29 in the page of the eusebian canons we see features which take us across the plains of lombardy to the doors of s michele of pavia and to the churches of venice the columns rest on crouching animals allegorical figures are introduced striving with each other as in the later gothic illuminations a halfnude figure of faith vanquishes the champion of paganism on the dedication page sits the madonna with ss john baptist and bartholomew and below them the patron saints of brunswick blaize and egidius leading forth the duke and his wife mathilda it may indeed be called a splendid book among the rest of the pictures some of them within richly decorated borders occurs the usual representation of the duke and his duchess receiving crowns the figures are well drawn even elegant the draperies good and the colouring skilful 29 see f culemann in neue hannov zeitung 1861 nos 224 one of the many characteristic mss of this period to be seen in continental libraries is the mater verborum of the monk conrad of scheyern in bavaria a noted scribe illuminator goldsmith and grammarian the subject is one that scarcely gives promise of lending itself to pictorial illustration but after the successful attempts of theodulf we may be prepared for anything in the way of diagram and symbol imagine a dictionary in which not only actual objects are pictorially represented but also abstract terms music philosophy virtues and vices illustrated by historical instancessacred subjects treated in the manner of the glass painters which is so commonly found in german and french work of this period of twelfthcentury illumination in general it may be said that it shows a marked effort towards true artistic design and subtle beauty of linear outline some of the noblest curvedrawing with rich and massive grouping of foliages is to be found in the ornamental initials and dignified border designs presented on the later examples of the century and it is very interesting to observe the rapid pace at which the climax is reached in mere calligraphic ornament after the opening of the gothic period initials become smaller but exquisitely drawn and reasonable expression takes the place of the senseless stare or grotesque exaggeration of attitude and feature which detract from the artistic value of all preceding efforts to conclude our list of german illuminations of purely monastic production we will bring forward one more example of womens work which whether as regards its curious illustrations of symbolism or its richly foliaged geometrical backgrounds and borders is one of the most interesting mss in any collection it is the evangeliary of the abbess uota or perhaps rather tuota of niedermnster a lady of the house of the counts of falckenstein 117780 or of utta abbess from 1009 to 1012 but more probably the former another tutta ruled the abbey from 920 to 934 and still another 123942 this precious ms which cahier has very fully described as the manuscrit du niedermuenster de ratisbonne is now in the royal library at munich cimel 35 some writers in speaking of it have classed it among the mss of the eleventh century but it is too refined and too well done for that period and indeed that it belongs to the latter part of the twelfth is almost proved from the work itself perhaps it was the profusion of inscriptions or legends placed all over the miniatures that gave the idea of its belonging to the eleventh century in this respect the ms certainly resembles the evangeliary of luxeuil already described the miniature of the crucifixion is very remarkable besides the figure of christ showing a return to the primitive syriac idea30 instead of the figures as usual of mary and john here are given allegorical figures of life and death cf fest in exaltatione sce crucis ad laudes 14th sept perhaps the best commentary on these old figures is the biblia pauperum as it is commonly called or as it should be called the bible of the poor preachers it also has the old allegories and inscriptions rendered into later forms 30 cf the rabula ms at vienna as for the texts or inscriptions they would require a commentary to themselvesnot to speak of translations and remarks upon the calligraphy one of these remarkable miniatures may be described as it depicts the presentation of the volume to the madonna our lady in the centre of the design is seated on a byzantine sedile with the infant jesus on her knees she is crowned and has the nimbus and appears as if intended to represent the glory of the church her hand is raised as in the act of teaching christ also has the nimbus but with the cross upon it and raises his hand in the attitude of benediction in the tympanum of the semicircle over the madonna written in letters of gold on purple surrounded by the word sancta in ordinary ink is the monogram of maria having a small sun and moon above it and other inscriptions partly latin partly greek below the madonna on the left stands the abbess her knees slightly bent holding up her book and clothed in the costume of her order but coloured no doubt simply for artistic reasons thus she wears a blue veil and a claretcoloured robe in the reversed semicircle before her is another monogram uota or tuota a name which perhaps may be translated uta utta ida etc it has been said already who she is likely to have been it does not follow of course that she herself wrote or illuminated the book she is presenting but judging from similar instances as eg herrade of landsberg and hrosvita of gandersheim she may have done so still the work looks technically too masterly for anyone not a trained artist to have done in the corners are small quadretti containing busts of the four cardinal virtuesprudence justice temperance and fortitude and in circlets in the centre of each border are faith hope and charity the latter twice at top and bottom a number of extraordinary beasts fill up little niches in the design which may possibly be also symbolical but possibly also nothing but artistic fancies the other miniatures we must pass over nevertheless those representing the four evangelists are worth examination31 the ornamentation being especially rich and elaborate let us now turn our attention to a new elementa new spirit we might term itwhich was manifesting itself in italy and france we cannot too strongly insist upon the fact that whatever appears in illumination has appeared first in architecture and its auxilliary arts now we have to see how this fact begins to change almost entirely the character of the ornamentation of books during the latter part of the twelfth century when precisely we cannot say nor where a new form of architecture began to show itself this new style laying aside both the classic cornice and the romanesque arch makes use of a new vertical principle of construction called in french the ogive or arch composed of two sections only instead of the whole semicircle by some fatality of which no exact explanation can be given english writers have given this new style the name of gothic scores of cathedrals throughout europe are called gothic cathedrals whereas in all probability if we exclude sweden there is only one really gothic building in the world that is the tomb of theodoric at ravenna and none of the socalled gothic cathedrals are in the least like it as to the invention itself it has been claimed by almost every nationality in europe there can be no doubt that accidentally or otherwise the pointed arch had been used often enough without any idea of its adoption as a principle of construction even in ancient buildings the famous gate at mycoene is one instance this is not the place to discuss the question so we let it pass we could point out long and elaborate arguments intended to prove that it originated in englandthat it originated in francein germany32 possibly they may all be right in a sense for most probably the origin was not in any particular locality but in the religious spirit of the time it was a general revival of the church itself that was its cause if any special locality has more reason on its side than another it is probably france but as we say that is not an essential point it must suffice us here that it arose and that by the end of the twelfth century it was a fact and the remarkable part about it is that it was by the influence of lay artists and especially of the freemasons that it became the accepted architecture of christendom 31 for more about them see cahier mlanges darchologie etc 32 not to mention

illuminationrise of the miniature as a distinct featureguildslay artists we have now reached the parting of the ways the study of nature is fast superseding the dogmas of the monastic code and what some writers have characterised as the hieratic is giving way to the naturalistic treatment of art like the pointed architecture itself it is an outcome of the spirit of the age exactly when it begins we cannot say as in the physical sciences our limits are necessarily somewhat arbitrary to suit our convenience in classification we take the beginning of the thirteenth century as a convenient dividing line between old and new we accept it as the boundary between the artistic sway of the east and southand that of the west and northbetween the lifeless fetters of prescription and the living freedom of invention the contrast between the two is very strongly marked the soft and curling foliages of the sunny south are for a season giving way to the hard and thorny leafage of the wintry north it would seem as if pointed architecture began with the hard and frozen winter of its existence and if it had been the plan or design of one individual we might have accepted this peculiarity as part of the scheme and all that followed as a natural consequence and development but it is curious that as a system worked out by many minds pointed architecture should thus begin first come thorns and cusps and lanceolate forms without foliage then not perfect leaves but buds in due time the bud opens at first into the profile coil and byandby into the fullspread leaf then comes the flower and finally the fruit after that rottenness and decay it is curious that this should actually take place through a course of centuries that it should be reflected in book illumination is simply the usual order of thingsthe fact has been frequently observed and as it is curious we call attention to it but as we have said the great change itself was brought about by the influence of lay artists and chiefly by the freemasons who and what the freemasons were everybody is supposed to know but on inquiry we find very few people indeed know anything definite about them of course we do not refer to the friendly societies or social guilds that now bear the name but to the medival builders everybody knows says batissier33 that the study of the sciences and of literature and the practice of the various branches of art took refuge in the monasteries during the irruptions of the barbarians and the strife of international war in those retreats not only painting sculpture engraving on metals and mosaic but also architecture were cultivated if the question arose about building a church it was nearly always an ecclesiastic who furnished the plan and monks who carried out the works under his direction the brethren in travelling from convent to convent naturally exercised a reciprocal influence over each other we conceive then that the abbeys of any given order would put in vogue the same style and that the art would be modified under certain points of view in the same manner in each country 33 hist de l art monumental p 466 paris 1845 i 8 it is certain moreover that outside the cloisters there were also troops of workmen not monastics who laboured under the direction of the latter masons were associated among them in the same way as other trade corporations it was the same with these corporations in the south as with the communesthe dbris of the roman organisation they took refuge in the church and had arrived at a condition of public life and independence when order was established between the commune the seignory and the church during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries these corporations were organised into recognised fraternities having their own statutes but there is abundant evidence of their having a much earlier existence a great number of masons were trained in italy and came from lombardy which in the tenth century even was an active centre of civilisation italy had its corporations of masons called maestri comaccini enjoying exclusive privileges who having passed the different degrees of apprenticeship became accepted34 masons and had the right of exercising their profession wherever they might be the sovereigns of different countries granted them special privileges and the popes protected them in all catholic countries where they might travel thus the lodges grew and prospered the greek artists who had fled from constantinople during the various iconoclast persecutions had got themselves enrolled in the ranks of the freemasons and taught their fellowmasons their byzantine methods 34 german angenommen speedily these corporations spread through france england and germany where they were employed almost exclusively by the religious orders in building their churches and conventual buildings while therefore the general plan and rules of construction were common to all members of the fraternity the details were almost entirely left under regulations to the individual taste of certain members of each band of workmen who being all qualified artists were quite capable of putting in execution and with masterly skill any such minuti of ornament as might be left to their discretion35 local illuminators would thus speedily get hold of every novelty and the page of the psalter or bible would become as a french writer has explained it a vitrail sur velin if not indeed exclusively following the stained glass they copied the mural decorations and so we find the backgrounds of the miniatures whether fitted into the initials or placed separately in framed mouldings faithfully reproducing the imbrications carrelages panellings and diapers of these mural enrichments 35 governor pownall observations on the origin and progress of gothic architecture and on the corporation of freemasons archologia 1788 vol 9 pp 110126 was of opinion that the collegium or corporation of freemasons were the first formers of gothic architecture into a regular and scientific order by applying the models and proportions of timber framework to building in stone and that this method came into use and application about the close of the twelfth or commencement of the thirteenth century see also gould rf history of freemasonry vol i p 259 note without going so far as to agree with governor pownall that the freemasons invented gothic it may be reasonably contended that without them it could not have been brought to perfection and without gothic they would not have stood in the peculiar and prominent position that they did that there was mutual indebtedness and while without freemasons there would have been no gothicwithout gothic the freemasons would have formed but a very ordinary community of trades unionists to select an example of gothic illumination which shall exemplify the earliest features of the pointed style is not an easy matter notwithstanding the number of thirteenthcentury mss which still exist in public collections in the national library at paris are several such mss one that decidedly marks the change from the german work hitherto in vogue is the psalter of st louis nat lib paris lat 10525 which contains nearly eighty small delicately executed miniatures it was completed about 1250 its noticeable features are a vastly improved dexterity in draughtsmanship which displays a refined certainty of touch enabling the artist to express his intention with unhesitating freedom the drawing thus produced in outline is filled in with flat tints of bodycolour without gradation or any attempt at brushwork shading whatever finishing in this respect might be thought necessary was added with the pen nothing could show more clearly that it is simply and frankly imitative of stained glass as in the glass the black outline is left for definition no colour is used on hands of faces except a slight touch of red on the cheeks and lips the prevailing colours are rich blue and bright scarlet perhaps the illuminator would have been better advised had he neglected some of the harder features of this kind of work not considering that the limits of the glass painter did not apply to his vellum he fettered himself unnecessarily and instead of a picture he has only succeeded in producing a surface enamel or a mere reticulation of surfacepatterns this very defect has by some writers been held up to admiration as the true perfection of all illumination its flatness was applauded because it had to be shut up in a book and was therefore the only appropriate way of making a picture for such a purpose but whoever would dream that because a picture painted in due perspective and proper light and shade was to be shut up in a book that the figures represented in relief would actually be crushed such reasoning is most puerile the supposed parallel case of a carpet or hearthrug representing groups of flowerseven if the latter ever did deceive the domestic catdoes not in the least affect the most childish conception of a picture in a book we see it in a scene in light and shade we enjoy and admire its reliefs but at the same time we know it is a picture and that it is quite flat the two tests of knowledge never interfere with each other to suppose they do is to suppose a case of imbecility that even a lunatic must laugh to scorn so far therefore we think the illuminator mistaken in slavishly copying the limitations of the glasspainter it is no very great knowledge of nature that is shown in these drawings there is a good example of the method of study followed by thirteenthcentury artists in the sketchbook of a french mason named villars de honnecourt still kept in the national library at paris36 in this book the artist has made drawings as he says from the lifesome are views others drawings of objects of art one represents a lion of the medival heraldic type yet the artist assures us it is from the life but there is no real accuracy everything is done with reference to some canon it is however quite free from the byzantine influence though by no means free from a certain tincture of symbolism the nude is rarely attempted but when it is it is certainly less ugly than in carolingian and romanesque to return to the psalterthe style of the figures is rather graceful attitudes are gentle and modest though the inclination of head and body are such as to suggest a sort of undulatory movement in walking that is scarcely natural the forms are slender and the limbs occasionally beyond the owners controlsometimes even deformed the feet are small and weaknow and then overtwisted the hands more delicate than formerly especially when open faces are gently oval and sometimes expressive 36 it has been published as the album of v de h paris 1858 sometimes the histories are placed in initial letters the grounds of which when not of burnished gold consist of imitations of mural carrelages chequers etc or rich enamelled patterns imitative of engraved traceries on metal in other cases they are placed in framemouldings consisting of a bar or beading of gold supporting an inner bar of coloured and polished wood or enamel workthe polish being represented by a fine line of white along the centre for illustrations of this precious volume the reader may refer to labarte hist des arts industriels album pl 92 paris 1864 now that the monasteries had ceased to be the exclusive nurseries of art and literature the masters of the different arts and crafts usually belonged to the middle classes of the towns where at first each art or craft had its own fraternity and as the idea of tradeassociation crew the crafts most nearly related would form a guild or corporation all who joined these corporations bound themselves to work only as the ruler of the guild permitted nor were outsiders allowed to compete with them in their own branches so exclusive was the protection of the guild each confraternity had its altar in some particular church whose patron saint became the protector of the guild and indeed the constitution of the guild included even political rights and obligationsmilitary service among the rest like other feudal institutions each town had its own special corporations which thus led to the formation of separate schools of art while travelling apprenticeships gave the opportunity to all of acquiring knowledge not accessible at home members were accustomed to travel and to attach themselves to the service of various princes receiving appointments as varlets or escripvains or enlumineurs which sometimes obliged them to resign their membership occasionally they became political agents and even ambassadors it will be remembered that some pages back we noticed the fact that in western illumination generally the design of the page depended upon the initial letter or that at least the initial was the principal object of it in the thirteenth century although the initial had very much diminished in size the same principle still prevailed the letter itself was formed of some fabulous longnecked and longtailed animal or bird mostly a dragon as conceived by the medival artist the head framed more or less on that of the mastiff or lion or both the legs of a bird of prey the body and tail of a serpent wings of heraldic construction to suit the form of the letter while the body of this unspeakable beast formed the body of the letter the tail was indefinitely extended to sweep down the margin of the text and round the base of it so as to form a border while not unfrequently slender branches would spring from it to form coils here and there ending in a kind of flowerbud the extremity of the tail forming a similar coil very soon however the animal form was abandoned and the letter made simply as a decorated initial or capital if possible one of its limbs was made to sweep up and down the margin and along the bottom or top as before where the interior is not occupied by a history we find coiled stems ending in profile leaves or buds at the same time the text has diminished in size sometimes down to dimensions no greater than those of an ordinary printed book of today but often beautiful and regular as the clearest printing such a book is the bible written by a certain william of devon now in the british museum roy ms 1 d 1 a description of this beautiful ms may be seen in bibliographica vol i p 394 written by sir em thompson here though the writing is that of an englishman the style is completely french another ms deserving of study is a richly illuminated bible now in the burney collection of our national library no 3 another which owing to its being recommended for study by the late john ruskin was once known as the ruskin book is add ms 17341 which contains many fine initials with border and bracket foliages similar to those of the evangeliary of the sainte chapelle now in the national library paris ms lat 17326 both the mss show the contemporary peculiarity of presenting bible characters excepting divine personages apostles and evangelists in ordinary local costume paris of course is the city where most and perhaps the best of these mss are preserved but those named above in london are also among the finest known examples chapter ii rise of national styles the fourteenth century the true golden age of gothic illuminationfrance the cradle of other national stylesnetherlandish italian german etcdistinction of schoolsdifficulty of assigning the provenance of mssthe reason for itms in fitzwilliam museum cambridgethe padua missalartists nameswhence obtained through the thirteenth century is the epoch of the gothic renaissance it is the fourteenth to which really belongs the title of the golden age the style of work remains precisely the same only it grows it changes from the bud to the leaf it casts off the severity and much of the restraint of its earlier character to the grace of youth it adds beauty the beauty of adolescence to fourteenthcentury illumination we can give no higher praise than that it is beautiful not indeed because of its deliberate limitations but in spite of them for after ages have taught us that if in pure ornament and resplendent decorative completeness the pages of the fourteenth century cannot be surpassed in miniature historiation it must take a second place the skilled illuminators of the later schools are the masters of the mere picture for surely no judge of art could possibly assert that the miniatures of the grunani breviary or of the brera graduals as miniatures are inferior to those of the psalter of st louis the berry bible or the prayerbook of margaret of bavaria yet these are typical mss of the highest rank hence we say that while the illumination of the golden age of the art was beautiful it was not absolutely perfect it is not to be taken by modern students as the only possible model or basis simply because it was the best of its kind there is no such despotism in art to those who think it the only possible form of book decoration let it be so by all means but we may as well hope to clothe our soldiers in chain or plate armour and send the elite of our nobility on another crusade to jerusalem or satisfy our universities with the quod libets and quiddities of the trivium and quadrivium as hope to make popular to the england of the twentieth century the artistic tastes of the fourteenth we indulge in no such dreams if we are to have illuminated books our own age must invent them the illuminators of the bibles romances mirrors and chronicles of the fourteenth century no doubt did their best and we honour and praise them for it we think their work among the loveliest gratifications of the eye that can be imagined but the eye is very catholicit has immense capacities for enjoyment the window of the soul opens on illimitable prospects and if the soul be satisfied for the time it is not necessarily repleted for ever golden ages are cyclical and it may be that the glory of the books of the future shall surpass all the glories of the past by 1350 france had absorbed all the antecedent varieties of illumination from france therefore spring all the succeeding styles now considered national and as is most natural these styles develop by proximitythe nearest to french being netherlandish the next as a result of immediate intercourse italian then german spanish and the rest as intercourse gave opportunity it is not always an easy matter to say offhand whether a ms is french or flemish in the earlier days it is not easy to say whether it be french or english or even whether french or italian but the distinctness comes later on in the fifteenth century the italian german french and english are quite distinct varieties towards the sixteenth the netherlandish is quite as distinct but the styles of spain bohemia hungary poland though possessing features which identify them to an experienced eye are to the ordinary spectator merely subvarieties of netherlandish italian or german with regard to the distinctions of schools or local centres within the same country the evidence of probable origin has to be corroborated by historic fact it is not safe without further proof than that afforded by general features to affirm that this or that ms was executed at paris dijon amiens or limoges in france or at ghent bruges or elsewhere in flanders or whether a ms be rhenish or saxon bavarian or westphalian in germany bolognese florentine siennese milanese or neapolitan in italy or executed at westminster st albans exeter or elsewhere in england nevertheless the special characteristics of all these schools are quite distinguishable in the attempt to distinguish them although the diagnosis may be perfectly accurate the actual facts may be otherwise accounted for hence the danger to which even the experienced connoisseur is liable for example certain mss are written in a fine bolognese hand which it is proved were actually executed in flanders others that one would feel sure were netherlandish were illuminated in spain some very fine typical flemish miniatures were painted in italy certain florentine miniatures were the work of artists residing in rome milanese illumination is quite distinguishable from neapolitan and venetian from both yet the school is not proof of the provenance illuminators like other craftsmen travelled from city to city and princes employed men who resided in their patrons palaces who yet had learned their art many leagues away how often we find the names of artists with the words dallemagna il tedesco le poitevin veronese franco crovata etc employed in italian houses indicating the place of their nativity so that even when we know every feature of the work we have much to learn ere we can say with truth that it was executed in such and such a city we must take into account details which are liable to escape the ordinary observer such as quality of vellum or paper choice of pigments mode of application and other particulars quite distinct from style of ornament or varieties of form in foliage in the fitzwilliam library at cambridge is an italian ms the characteristics of whose ornamentation are unequivocally french but whose mode of treatment shows not only that it is italian but that it is milanese but whether executed in milan or not is more than anyone can affirm in the british museum is a magnificent servicebook called the padua missal but the probability is that the paduan artist who painted its splendid pages painted them at venice that it was executed for sta justina at padua is no proof that the work was done in that city in monastic times we have seen why the artist rarely signed his name after the thirteenth century the lay artist had no such scruples and hence we often find particulars of origin and purpose which explain all we wish to know but if the mss themselves do not contain the particulars very often the accountbooks of cathedrals and other establishments for which the books were illuminated give the details of price and purpose and add the names of the artists the household expense books guild books municipal records and the journals of the painters themselves are fertile sources of information and if we seek with sufficient diligence these will probably be the means by which it may

expanding ivy leaf which forms the chief feature of fourteenthcentury bookornament we find the miniaturist as a further improvement adding delicate colour in the faces also that instead of the invariable lozenging or diapering of the background he occasionally makes a background of plain burnished gold and as if to prove that his predecessors were really hampered with the restrictions imposed by their imitations of painted glass he begins to try his best to paint up his miniatures into real pictures with high lights on draperies and shading upon the folds a certain amount of flatness however still remains but it scarcely seems to have been the intention or aim of the painter there is a similar flatness in the work of all the early schools of painting which had no reference whatever to the destination of the picture see for instance the origny treasure book in the print room at berlin ms 38 and the life of st denis in the national library at paris nos 20902 both mss dating somewhere about 1315 the drapery shading in the latter ms is no longer the work of the pen but brushwork in proper colour the westreenen missal in the museum at the hague which dates about 1365 though not a french ms is an example of the fact that by the middle of the century the tradition of penwork outline and flatcolouring had become pretty nearly obsolete the reign of the afflicted charles vi of france disastrous in the extreme to the material welfare of his own subjects full of untold misery to the poor and of oppression to the growing community of artisans and traders was nevertheless as regards literature and the arts a period of progress and even splendour the kings incapacity by affording his uncles and brothers opportunities for fingering the revenues during the selfappointed and irresponsible regencies enabled them to gratify their magnificent tastes in the purchasing of costly furniture and the ordering of splendid books louis of orleans usually credited with the worst of this prodigality was by no means singular in his conduct his uncle the duke of berry while daily earning the execrations of the taxpayers by his unscrupulous employment of the public money was constantly enriching his library and both he and his brothers and nephews were in the habit of sending priceless volumes illuminated by the best artists as wedding and birthday gifts to each other or their wives or acquaintances we talk and justly of the fine taste and noble love of literature of jean de berry his contemporaries at least those beneath his own rank looked upon him as a tyrant and plunderer his disastrous administration of languedoc was described as one long fte where the excess of expenditure was rivalled only by the excess of scandal if the marmousets could have hanged him they would in default they hanged his treasurer all this maladministration was very wrong but we cannot afford to burn the mss in consequence for the bible the grandes heures and other books once possessed by the wicked duke are among the most precious relics of any age add to them the beautiful volumes of poetry and romance composing the contemporary literature of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and we have treasures that we dare not relinquish by the beginning of the fifteenth century pure french illumination was losing its own characteristics and acquiring others in the north in flanders and brabant franchecomt and the burgundian dukedom generally it was becoming that peculiar kind of french which had received the name of burgundian it can scarcely be said to be flemish enough to rank as netherlandish yet neither can it stand side by side with french of paris let us look at a few examples there is the book of offices in the library of st genevive at paris bibl lat 66 also the st augustine in the same library also a small crowd of volumes in the royal library at brussels another in the national library at paris one of the richest examples known is the psalter of the convent of salem in the university library at heidelberg other grand mss are the two volumes of the mutacion de fortune of christine de pisan and the cit des dames of the same authoress the volume of her poems etc in the british museum is a marvellously fine work harl 4431 the greater part of this volume is in the earlier or berry style ie the fine pensprays of ivy leaf of burnished gold but the first grand border is altogether transitional consisting of the pensprays of golden ivy leaf alternating with sprays of natural flowers this innovation it has been said was due to the school of van eyck but as no proof is forthcoming that j van eyck ever worked on illuminating we may be content to say that it arose about 1413 and that probably it came from bruges it is the beginning of the burgundian style but the ornamental leafage is different from ordinary brugeois inasmuch as it is pearled along the central veins and is not symmetrical the pearling is perhaps a suggestion from glass painting it was very early adapted in german foliage work on the first flyleaf are several signatures including the name and device of louis gruthuse plus est en vous gruthuse the miniatures still remain french with mostly panelled backgrounds some with landscape it is evidently a transitional document illustration psalterm et officia 14th cent brit mus harl ms 2897 fol 184

while caxton was setting up his press at westminster as she was among the most welcome guests at the courts of charles vi and philip of burgundy she was the daughter of a distinguished venetian savant thomas de pisan who had come at the invitation of charles le sage to paris as astrologue du roi at the age of fifteen christine who was as beautiful as she was accomplished became the wife of a picard gentleman named estienne castel two years afterwards the death of the king brought trouble upon her father and with it sickness and despondency then followed sorrow upon sorrow whilst she was herself still burdened with the cares of early motherhood her father died and within nine years from her marriage the sudden death from contagion of her husband to whom she was most fondly attached left her a widow with two little children dependent upon her and with only what she herself could earn as a means of livelihood she was not yet twentysix years old to assuage her misery she betook herself to study and the composition of essays and poetry her works speedily brought her the recognition of distinguished personages her children were provided for and she herself soon acquired both fortune and reputation charles vi allowed her a pension and she composed for his queen isabella of bavaria several important treatises among her numerous compositions were les cens histoires de troyes in verse le chemin de longue estude la mutacion de fortune and a life of charles v the latter composed at the request of philip the good of burgundy but the work which sets off her wit and learning to the best advantage was an allegorical essay on womanhood which she called le trsor de la cit des dames altogether her works include fifteen books and about sixty smaller writings which she dedicated to the king and queen of france the dukes of burgundy and orleans and the princesses and princes of the court one beautifully illuminated copy of the mutation of fortune in two volumes is a curious example of its title for one volume of it is in the national library at paris fonds fr 603 and the other in the royal library at munich in the former we have her portrait in a blue gown she sits at her writingdesk busy at her work on her head is the muslindraped and highpeaked hennin beside her a table covered with a green cloth and laden with crimson and violetbound books and an inkstand her chair has a high back and the floor is of the usual kind seen in illuminations that is as if composed of a parquetry of coloured woodwork or of tiles of various kinds of marble on the sill of the gothiclatticed window through which we catch a glimpse of the blue sky stands a vase of flowers not perhaps an ideal ladys boudoir but still an apartment of taste and an altogether charming little picture in the second miniature of the munich volume christine is standing in a chamberin the same costume as above described the pictures on the walls area fortress a watchman two knights a prince with crown and sceptre seated on his throne surrounded by courtiers a duel and a martyr having his head struck off just such medival subjects as we may expect in a fifteenthcentury mansion in a copy of the cit des dames at munich is another portrait of christine the book is an apology for the feminine sex and it is well thought out it appears that the conversation of the time was not always free from rather severe sarcasm concerning the ladies we learn from du verdier that the continuator of the romance of the rose narrowly escaped most condign chastisement from some of the insulted sex at the french court for the base insinuations in his poem against the character of women christine herself heartily disapproved of the romance of the rose and wrote a sharp criticism upon it her cit des dames is an elaborate confutation of the opinion that women are naturally more immoral and less capable of noble studies or high intellectual attainments than men in her introduction she says i reflected why men are so unanimous in attributing wickedness to women i examined my own life and those of other women to learn why we should be worse than men since we also were created by god i was sitting ashamed with bowed head and eyes blinded with tears resting my chin on my hands in my elbowchair when a dazzling beam of light flashed before me which came not from the sun for it was late in the evening i glanced up and saw standing before me three female figures wearing crowns of gold and with radiant countenances i crossed myself whereupon one of the three addressed me fear not dear daughter for we will counsel and help thee the aphorisms of the philosophers are not articles of faith but simply the mists of error and selfdeception the three ladies or goddesses are fame prudence and justice and they command christine under the supervision of reason or commonsense to build a city for the noblest and best of her own sex so the city was begun and the elect allegorically let into it in varied ranks following one another came goddesses and saintly women christian and heathen womenamong them walks as leader the queen of the amazons queen ceres who taught the art and practice of

workmen who are busily at work before her is an unfinished wall and several completed towers in two other miniatures the gradual progress and entire completion of the city are shown and in the foreground of each christine and her three patronesses as before other examples deserving of extended notice are the shrewsbury romances roy 15 e 6 and augustine cit de dieu roy 14 d 1 two great folios the former most interesting for its miniaturesthe latter as a fair example of the rougher kind of lille work bold in design good drawing the choice of colours includes marone blue green and gold the ornaments as usual consist of sprays of ivy leaf and grounds filled in with treillages of natural flowers among which are the daisy viola tricolor thistle cornbottle and wild stock fruits and vegetables also as grapes field peas and strawberries the miniatures include a few rather coarse grisailles a little volume harl 2936 contains exquisitely drawn brugeois scrolls in monochrome on grounds of the same colour or plain gold or black lastly we may mention les heures de la dame de saluces otherwise called the yemeniz hours in the british museum add 27967 a large octavo as an example of transitional burgundian here the secondary borders have mostly the penwork ivy leaf with brugeois corners and with strawberries etc in the midst of the sprays among the foliages grotesque figures frequently appear the principal pages however are more like harl 4431 yet without the ivyleaf tendrils the miniatures are still gothic but richer and deeper in colour than ordinary french work it would appear that two different artists were employedone decidedly french the other netherlandish and of a more individual character still with french accessories every page has a border of some kind

chapter we left our native schools of illumination at work on such mss as the devonshire and rouen benedictionals and with the reputation of being the best schools of the kind in christendom mention also is made elsewhere in dealing with monastic art of the usages of the scriptoria such usages of course could only obtain in houses where scribes themselves were to be had hence we should discover were it not otherwise known that writing and illumination even in the monastic age were not confined absolutely to the cloister with respect to the secular scribes who sometimes worked in the monastery sometimes at their own homes in those days when the monastic orders still did most of the bookproduction there were three classes of specialists these were the librarii or ordinary copyists the notarii or lawscribes whose business lay in copying deeds charters and suchlike instruments and taking notes in the courts and paginators or illuminatores it sometimes happened as we have said that in some monastery or other no monastic was found qualified to undertake any of these duties it then fell to the prior or abbat to seek the assistance of professional outsiders the paging and rubrication putting in initials in the spaces left by the common scribe and if needed the addition of pictures or marginal drawings and ornaments caricatures heraldic illustrations etc were the proper work of the illuminator but it often happened that the same man had to do the whole work from the commencement to the finish the chronicon trudonense tells us graduale unum propria manu formavit purgavit pinxit sulcabit scripsit illuminavit musiceque notavit syllabatim several of our old english chronicles of which the mss exist in the british museum and elsewhere seem to be of this description reference has been made to the scriptoria at winchester ie at st swithuns and the new minster it is the latter foundation which is usually referred to in speaking of winchester work the monastery of the holy trinity or the new minster was founded in the first year of his reign by king edward son of alfred no doubt in obedience to his fathers wish if not absolutely in the terms of his will its first charter is dated 900 for 901 and the second in 903 in the latter document the abbey is spoken of as dedicated to the holy trinity the blessed virgin mary and to st peter and is amply endowed under the augustinian rule in 965 not without trouble and resistance it was converted into a benedictine abbey in 968 ethelgar who had been trained at glastonbury and abingdon became abbat and from this time the new minster became famous for both discipline and the production of mss as we walk along the high street of winchester now we find the story in mossgrown stones or other memorials how among other methods william the norman punished the monks for their english warlike proclivities by walling them up nearly close to their church with the walls of his royal palace in the old time when the two monasteries stood side by sidest swithuns is close behind the new minsterso closely packed together says the old chronicler37 were the two communities of st swithun and st peter that between the foundation of their respective buildings there was barely room for a man to pass along the choral service of one monastery conflicted with that of the other so that both were spoiled and the ringing of their bells together produced a horrid discord the result of this was first the abovementioned hemming in of the younger establishment and eventually its migration to another site in hyde meadow here while the monastic buildings suffered much through fires and other disasters the rule remained until 1538 when it was surrendered into the kings hands and the abbat prior and nineteen monks the last survivors of this oncefamous foundation were pensioned 37 dugdale monasticon the scriptorium at st albans to which the fame of book production in the middle ages very largely reverted was not founded until nearly three centuries after the foundation of that abbey the library began with twentyeight notable volumes and eight psalters a book of collects another of epistles and evangelia legenda per annum two gospelbooks bound in gold and silver and set with gems together with other necessary volumes for ordinary use almost every succeeding abbat contributed something to the library shelves geoffrey the sixteenth abbat a norman who once had a school at dunstable and who was both a popular and liberal ruler enriched the library with a missal bound in gold another incomparably illuminated and beautifully written and also a psalter richly illuminated a benedictional and others his successor ralph gubiun also gave a number of mss robert de gosham the next abbat gave very many books which he had caused to be written and sumptuously bound for the purpose and abbat simon who followed in 1166 created the office of historiographer to the abbey repaired and enlarged the scriptorium and kept two or three of the cleverest writers constantly employed in transcription and ordained that for the future every abbat should maintain at least one suitable and capable scribe among the many choice mss added by abbat simon was a beautiful copy of the bible specially written with the greatest care and exactness in addition he presented the library with all his own precious collection another liberal benefactor was john de cell a man of vast learning in grammar and poetry and also a practitioner in medicine being unfit for household management he committed the secular affairs of the abbey to his prior reymund by whose zeal many noble and valuable books were transcribed for the library and so grew in magnitude and importance the great collection which supplied roger of wendover and matthew paris with materials for their famous histories st albans indeed was at one period perhaps the most noted of all the english centres of book production to dilate on other centres such as westminster exeter worcester norwich or york would lead us too far afield for a mere handbook like the present enough has been said to give a good idea of what our english abbats and priors were in the habit of doing for art and letters illustration psalterium cum canticis ad 1240 brit mus roy ms 2 a xxii fol 14 illustration epistre au roy rich 2 c 1375 brit mus roy ms 20 b vi fol 1 since 980 a considerable quantity of transcription and illumination must have been produced notwithstanding disquiet turbulence and war at westminster the traditions of illumination seem to have followed the methods of the earlier winchester school but in the twelfth century english work shows on the whole a greater likeness to the contemporary work of germany of westminster work an example occurs among the royal mss 2 a 22 the subject is the psalter and the text is the handsome style of penmanship known as english gothic of the latter part of the twelfth century it would appear from the frequent occurrence of this particular servicebook that it held the place of the later book of hours and so we may expect a great similarity among different copies both in the selection of the illustrations and their mode of treatment it was usual in all such volumes to prefix to the text a series of subjects from the old and new testaments and the lives of the saints here we have them from the life of the virgin and from the life of david by no means unworthy samples of the school one represents the virgin and child seated on a seat of the germanobyzantine type beneath an arch and within a square frameborder the border seems first to have been flatly painted in two colours pale blue and pale red ochre and on this a foliage scroll of recurring forms in a bold dull red outline finely relieved with white this is more or less repeated as the form of border to the other illuminations outside the whole is a characteristic slender frame of bright green in two tints the arch overhead has two bands of vermilion with white edgereliefs and a central band of blue again in two tints with pairs of black crossbars every halfinch or so resting on the capitals of the two pillars which form the sides of the scene these pillars have each a green abacus at the top of each capital and scarlet bead below each pillar is of dappled red marblelike porphyry with plinths of scarlet and blue tiers of differently coloured steps separated by bands of scarlet green etc form the seat the virgin wears the hood cape and robe of the benedictine nun but coloured grey chocolate and blue respectively an under garment of pale amber completes her dress the infant wears an amber tunic wrapped in a scarlet robe a very common embroidery of the drapery consists of little stars or triads of white studs this also is a characteristic of german and early netherlandish illumination there is a rich gold brocade border to the blue robe of the virgin both mother and child have round nimbuses the former in plain circular bands of russet and orange the latter consisting of bands of pale blue surmounted by a scarlet cross two lumps of green glass or metal hang from the arch the background is a plate of gold the flesh tones are livid being of a pale greenish ochre tint one other of the illuminations of this exceedingly interesting ms may be mentioned viz the david playing his harp he also wears three garmentsa tunic of white shaded with pale blue then another of lavender or lilac and having rich brocaded borders and lastly a pallium or robe of pale chocolate lined with ermine orangecoloured hose the throne like the previous one is of several coloursslateblue green orange and white with a buff cushion here is a back to the throne of a deep blue with a background as before of bright flat gold the white moulding is shaded with pale green with bluish slate corners the outer border is of the pale red ochre or pink so common in later work in contrast with deep blue an outer frame or edging of green completes the page the harp is not gilded but of a drab hue with two quatrefoil studs or orifices in the frame relieved as usual with fine edges of white compare this ms with one in the library at lambeth the english illumination of the thirteenth century is so like that of france that it is often difficult to determine its real nationality there is occasionally some feature which we know from other sources to be english or some circumstance in the history of the ms which fixes its origin as for example in the additional ms 24686 known as the tenison psalter sir em thompson also describes this ms in the bibliographica i 397 but it was previously described at some length by sir edward bond in the fine arts quarterly review the psalter which has had a somewhat eventful history is one of the best examples of english thirteenthcentury illumination at least this may be said of the early portion of it for while it is illuminated throughout only the first gathering is in the earlier manner the peculiar value to the student lies in the fact that although quite in the same style as contemporary french work it is the work of an english illuminator the colouring however is not confined as in somewhat earlier examples to blue and dull pale rose or paled red ochre and gold it gives us scarlet crimsonlake green and brown besides the blue and pink and bright gold which suggests some german influences the line fillings are somewhat peculiar as having silver tracery on the blue side by side with golden tracery on the crimson the full ivy leaf appears in the long branch work of the borders and some of the initials still retain the bird or dragon forms in their construction the compound barframe gold and traceried colour side by side is however already taking the place of the mere sweeping tail or branch but perhaps the best indication of english design is the presence of a number of grotesque animals with birds and occasional humorous scenes disposed not in framed miniatures but simply among the stems and coils of the foliage this is a form of illustration much appreciated by english illuminators at all times though it appears also in much continental work among other english mss which display this taste we may point out arund 83 which among many other treatises and curious compositions such as the turris sapienti and a valuable calendar in which are notes on the arundels of wemme contains a psalter with anthems etc and hence is known as the arundel psalter its date is probably between 1330 and 1380 the drolleries are very funny and the other illuminations very instructive and curious some of them contain really good pendrawingrefined expressive and graceful but above all typical of english draughtsmanship in a little scene of the adoration of the magi folio 125 the kings are costumed like our henry iii as we find him n sculpture wall paintings etc over a very expressive picture of the three living and the three dead occur the lines each over a figure ich am afert lo wet ich se methinketh hit beth deueles thre ich wes welfair such scheltou be for godes loue be wer by me folio 12838 the three living in this illumination are three fashionable ladiesno doubt princesses for they wear crowns generally they are men as at lutterworth in the sculptures over the door and in the famous fresco of gozzoli at pisa the subject occurs sometimes in books of hours 38 i am afraid lo what i see methinketh it be devils three i was well fair such shalt thou be for love of god beware by me many mss of this period and later have hunting scenes shooting practice and games in ms 264 misc bodl lib oxford there are such scenes one being a game at blind mans buff or as literally here hoodman blind for the latter actually wear a hood drawn down over his head and shoulders and three girls are having a fine game with him the goldfinch or linnet looking on from the border seems to enjoy the fun another fine source of similar things is the louterell psalter in the british museum in this also are some richly diapered backgrounds and exquisite border bands this ms dates about 1340 but the gem of english fourteenthcentury illumination is the royal ms 2 c 7 called queen marys psalter not as being painted for her since it had been painted nearly two centuries before she ever saw it but in the year 1553 being about to be sent abroad it was stopped by a customs officer and presented to queen mary tudor it is bound in what appears to be the binding put on it by the queenie crimson velvet embroidered on each cover with a large pomegranate and having gilt corner protections and once upon a time golden clasps the clasps are gone but the plates remain riveted on the covers engraven with the tudor badges the ms contains 320 large octavo leaves the first fiftysix being taken up with illuminated illustrations of biblical history from the creation to the death of solomon these pictures are arranged in pairs one over the other and to each one is given a description in french taken sometimes from the canonical text sometimes from an apocryphal one the drawings are really exquisite they are so fine so delicately yet so cleverly sketched they are not coloured in full bodycolours but just suggestively the draperies being washed over in thin tints the folds well defined but lightly shaded next after these subjects follows the psalter with miniatures of new testament scenes and figures of saints accompanied with most beautiful initials and ornaments illuminated by a thoroughly practised hand for the artist of this volume was by no means a novice at his work a good example of it is given in bibliographica pl 7 23 which forms the frontispiece to vol i and one or two outlines in the folio catalogue of the arundel mss arund ms 84 is also a good example of thirteenthcentury illumination to a rather unpromising subject being a latin translation of euclid from the arabic by athelard of bath it is illustrated with diagrams speaking of fourteenthcentury illumination brings us to notice a very striking change which takes place in the reign of richard ii in the character of english illumination in the british museum roy 20 b 6 is a ms entitled an epistle to richard ii written it is said in paris in which the illuminations and foliages are purely french but which are the type of all the english work of the same date take for example the ms already spoken of roy 2 a 22 produced in the scriptorium at westminster abbey compare with it a bible written for the use of salisbury and dated 1254 then add the tenison psalter the arundel psalter illuminated 131020 if these mss be compared however with lansd 451 or roy 1 e 9 the least accustomed eye must notice the entire and almost startling change in the luxuriance and character of the flowers and foliages which constitute the initial and border decorations it is not merely a development there are additional features but that these features are added as usual from france is contradicted by reference to roy 20 b 6 mentioned above the new features are not french the question is where did they come from chapter v the sources

art and literaturedepression caused by her deathexamination of roy ms 1 e 9 and 2 a 18the grandison hoursother mssintroduction of flemish work by edward iv it has been suggested by a high authority that the immediate sources of the third period of english illumination were netherlandish but probable as this seems at first sight there is another explanation which seems to the present writer to be a better one as already pointed out the influence on english work before 1377 notwithstanding political conditions are distinctly french after this date though the artistic relation with france is not broken off yet long before 1390 we find this new influence which is not french and for which we have no special evidence that it is netherlandish if we go however a little farther afield we shall find it in the new work is a softer kind of foliage and a greater variety of sweet colour and both these characteristics are found in a school of illumination that was being formed under the auspices of the emperor charles iv at prag in bohemia the artists in that capital who executed the famous golden bull and commenced the grand wenzel bible were a select band of frenchmen and italians the combined result of whose designs and labours was this very mixture of gothic ivy leaf and thorn with the softer othonian and roman foliages and a new scheme of colour charles iv son of that famous john of luxembourg the blind king of bohemia who perished at crcy was himself king of bohemia as well as emperor and a man of brilliant personal accomplishments and cultivated tastes in literature and art becoming emperor the very next year after his succession to the throne of bohemia he fixed his residence at prag where he began the building of the new city and founded a university on the model of that of paris where he had studied and whence he had married his first wife blanche daughter of charles count of valois his university soon attracted some thousands of students and with them no small crowd of literary men and artists both from france and italy the great fact however to remember about charles iv is the golden bull the masterly scheme by which all matters concerning the election to the empire were in future to be settled all the constitutions were written in a book called from the bulla or seal of gold which was appended to it the golden bull of which the text was drawn up either at metz or nuremberg in 1356 and many copies distributed throughout the empire it is further affirmed that the absolute original is at frankfort but the splendid copy made by order of the emperor wenzel in 1400 is still preserved in the imperial library at vienna and as it is ah example of the style of illumination practised in prag during the reign of charles iv we may call it bohemian it is true that the foliages are a little more luxuriant in this wenzelbook than in the earliest examples of the style seen in england but the twenty years which had elapsed would easily account for this difference as compared however with either french or netherlandish the new english style shows a much greater similarity to the work then being done in lower bavaria in these soft curling foliages and the fresh carnations of the fleshtints of the prag and nuremberg illuminators we may trace the actual source of the remarkable transformation seen in english illumination after the marriage of richard ii charles iv was four times married his successor wenzel whose ghastly dissipations can only be regarded as the terrible proofs of insanity was the child of his third wife his fourth wife the beautiful daughter of the duke of pomerania and stettin had four children of whom sigismund the eldest afterwards succeeded wenzel as emperor and anne the third came to england as the wife of richard ii the magnificence of her equipage and the crowd of persons who formed her retinue are noticed by contemporary writers and the effect upon english manners was instantaneous her beauty sweetness of manners and culture rendered her at once not merely the idol of her husband who says walsingham could scarcely bear her to be out of his sight but universally beloved by all the english nation to her the first english writer on heraldry john of guildford dedicated his book and the artists who came with her from her luxurious home at prag would naturally become the leaders of taste in their adopted country after a while indeed the numbers of countrymen of the queen were looked upon as the cause of extortions practised on the english people in order to supply the money lavished on these foreigners more than once is this grievance referred to in an old ms in the harley library 2261 containing a fifteenthcentury translation of higdens polychronicon these foreigners are made responsible for at least one fashionable extravagance anne qwene of ynglonde dyede in this year 1393 at schene the viith day of the monethe of janius on the day of pentecoste the dethe of whom the

theire schoone it is a fact that the bohemian manner of illumination with its threelobed and varicoloured foliages became the fashion in every english centre of illumination in the preceding remarks we have endeavoured to account for it that the same style went from prag to nuremberg may be only the natural result of its being carried in the marriage and retinue of the princess margaret annes halfsister who became the wife of the burggrave john quite a similar ms to those executed in the reign of richard ii in england and those of bohemia is the wilhelm van oransse of wolfram v eschenbach now in the imperial library at vienna a similar but inferior work exists in the prayerbook written by josse de weronar in the british museum add 15690 the english foliages never show quite all the varieties of colour seen in the continental examples but the golden diapers and pounced gold patterns are quite as elaborate see this work however in arundel 83 it appears also in the mural paintings of the end of the fourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth centuries no doubt the english art of the fourteenth century is of french originso mainly is that of bohemiafor charles iv was brought up at the court of france further than this we think we are justified in tracing the new elements in bohemian to italy and those in english to bohemia the most striking proof is not only the foliages but the change from the long colourless faces of french miniatures to the plump and ruddy countenances seen for example in the lancastrian mss in the record office and in harl 702639 of the british museum of course this suggestion of source is not put forward as a dead certainty but it affords this probability that as the style suddenly arose during the lifetime of anne of bohemiaand she was the acknowledged leader of fashionso her tastes in respect of illuminated books and heraldic decoration would become those of her new subjects let us examine this fifteenthcentury english work and for this purpose let us take the great illuminated bible in the royal library 1 e 9 it is an enormous folio and rather unwieldly but a most interesting example of the new style its initials are large richly illuminated in gold and attractive colours it has wellexecuted histories within the initials and boldly designed border frames elegantly adorned with foliages and conventional or idealised flowers perhaps the most noticeable feature is the beautiful decorative foliage work in the limbs of the lettersitself a south german peculiaritythen the alternation of colours without interrupting the design the profusion of foliage modelling in the backgrounds of the letter panels outside the historiations the next thing is the bold use of minium side by side even with pure rosepetal colour pale bright cerulean blue and bright gold lastly the immense variety of leafforms based on the three five and sevenlobed groupings of the typical form the coil and spiral are freely used as the groundwork and the colours alternated as the coils or spirals change from front to back of the leaf 39 the lovell psalter illustration missale sarum use 14th cent late brit mus harl ms 2785 fol 194 v

treatment both of architectural design and treillages of foliage the gothic pilasters are filled with the same kind of coiling and spiral leaves and ribbons that are used in 1 e 9 and harl 1892 the backgrounds of the miniatures enriched with fine gold patterns the furniture and costumes indicate the later years of the reign of richard ii being similar to those shown in the miniatures of harl 1319 which relates the story of richards misfortunes a few miniatures of saints accompany the prayers to them one of the saints is peculiar being the prior of bridlington perhaps the robertus scriba who copied certain theological treatises for the library and who lived in the time of stephen or henry ii in the beautiful initial d is the figure of a lady praying the first few words of the prayer being written on a floating ribbon above her head a fine panelling of black and gold forms the background the ladys costume is that of the end of the fourteenth century her headdress being somewhat lower than that worn in the time of isabella of bavaria in other respects she recalls the figure of christine de pisan in harl 4431one of the fine mss of the french school as the psalter or offices was once the property of the grandison family as is shown by the numerous entries respecting them in the calendar no doubt this lady was the first owner of the ms and probably the same as shown in the beautiful miniature of the annunciation previously given many charming initials follow this one and brightly coloured bracket treillages and borders are given in profusion introducing every variety of coloured ideal leafform known to the art of the time it seems probable from its style and the costumes that the ms was executed for the lady margaret widow of thomas the last lord grandison who died in 1376 and given to her by sir john tuddenham her second husband a better model for the modern illuminator could not easily be found other examples may be briefly enumerated in 2 b 8 2 b 10 2 b 1 2 b

the gist of this is that it was composed at the instance of the lady joan princess of wales mother of richard ii and that it was executed by brother john somour seymour a franciscan in 1380 thus the illumination of it would probably be done about the time of the young queens arrival in england the princess joan died july 8th 1385 the work corresponds with this date the grandison psalter is

empire as the civiliser of europe it is not a little curious and somewhat surprising to find that in the twelfth century when german and french artists were doing such good and even admirable work that of italy was almost barbaric a ms in the vatican 4922 is shown as a proof of this it is not an obscure sort of book that might have been written by a merely devout but untrained monk for his own use but a work of importance executed for no less a personage than the celebrated countess matilda the scribe was donizo a monk of the benedictine abbey of canossa it is of the early or prcarolingian type rather inclined to byzantine but with the big hands and aimless expression of all semibarbaric work yet it has a certain delicacy and carefulness in rome itself during the ninth century barbarism was at its very lowest point only the seaport towns had any notion of what was being done in other places painting was practised it is true so was mosaic but the worst of oriental carpets would be a masterpiece of elegance beside anything done in italy whatever gleams of artistic intelligence appear they certainly emanated from ravenna or pavia but as there were no wealthy and peaceful courts no indolent highbred luxurious courtiers during that dark and troublous period miniature or illumination had no call for existence in the twelfth century bookillustration consisted simply of pensketching of the most elementary kind the lombards alone produced anything like illumination a sort of roll containing pictures of the various scenes of the old and new testaments which represented the leading doctrines of the church and which used to hang over the pulpit as the preacher discoursed upon them is the only representative of the time such a roll was called an exultet from its first word which is the beginning of the line exultet jam angelica turba clorum of the hymn for the benediction of the paschal wax tapers on easter eve several of these exultets are still kept in the cathedral at pisa and in the barberini and minerva libraries in rome40 of course the pictures are upside down to the reader so as to be right for the congregation 40 see one in british mus add ms 30337 and description of it in journ of the archol assoc vol 34 p 321 very little progress was made as we may imagine until after the great revival movement begun by cimabue giotto and their contemporaries about the middle of the thirteenth century but before taking up any inquiry into italian work generally we must not omit reference to the remarkable mss produced at la cava and monte cassino during the francolombard period some idea has already been furnished in dealing with celtic mss and the foundations begun by columbanus and his scholars indeed the general character of these lombard mss is seen in the francoceltic the distinguishing feature if there be one is the frequent recurrence among the interlacements of the white dog the la cava library which was one of the finest in italy has been transferred to naples monte cassino still continues and maintains not only a library but a printing press from which the learned fathers have issued at least one great work on the subject of cassinese palography of all the prcarolingian hands lombardic or lombardesque was certainly the most peculiar and is perhaps the most difficult to read one evidence of this is the diversity of opinion on the true reading of certain proper names in the original ms containing the oldest text of tacitus which happens to be a lombard ms the characters and other examples of the eleventh to the thirteenth century that have been published at monte cassino however fully illustrate the peculiarities of the handwriting and give besides several splendid examples of calligraphy41 41 the la cava mss have been described by p gillaume in an essay published at naples 1877 and those of monte cassino by a caravita monte cassino 186071 one of the earliest illuminated italian ms which bears a date is a volume of letters of st bernard now in the library of laon it is very seldom that the earlier scribes and illuminators who produced italian mss or worked in italy were italians they were usually foreigners and mostly frenchmen and the art was looked upon at the beginning of the fourteenth century as a french art this very decided example of italian work is already different from the french work of the same period the profile foliages have already acquired that peculiar trick of sudden change and reversion of curve showing the other side of a leaf with change of colour which is a marked characteristic of all fourteenthcentury italian illumination for examples of it the bolognese law books decretals and suchlike afford frequent illustration before leaving this firstquoted ms we may say that it points to france rather than to germany or lombardy for its general form of design but the foliages are quite of another kind another laon ms 352 shows the same treatment of foliage but in effect more like what may be considered as the typical italian style seen in the famous avignon bible of the antipope clement vii robert of geneva which dates between 1378 and 139442 42 see humphreys illum books of the middle ages pl 16 and silvestre palographie universelle pl 117 a further example still more powerful in expression and skilful in manipulation is seen in a copy of the poems of convenevole da prato in the british museum roy 6 e 9 executed for king robert of naples a patron of giotto 12761337 which in comparison with the laon letters of st bernard of about the same date is even still more italian cardinal stefaneschi another of giottos patrons was also a promoter of illumination his missal now at rome in the archives of the canons of st peters is a fine example of this style it dates from 1327 to 1343 the ms of boethius at laon is another but one of the most masterly whether as to design or manipulation is a law book in the library at laon no 382 this grand folio contains glossa ioannis andre in clementinasthe gloss or explanation of joannes andreas on the clementines by the way as illuminated law books civil and canonical form so large a section of italian mss it may be well in this place to warn the reader against random explanations sometimes offered in sale catalogues concerning these books their authors and commentators for instance this commentator joannes andreas was not as we have seen it confidently stated as if it were part of the actual contemporary title of the ms bishop of aleria episcopus aleriersis but a jurist of bologna the bishop lived a century or so after the jurist who had completed his long career as professor of law at bologna extending over fortyfive years before the bishop was born his chief works are commentaries on the clementines printed in folio at mayence 1471 and again at dijon in 1575 and commentaries on five books of the decretals printed in folio at mayence in 1455 and at venice in 1581 while on this topic of italian law mss it may be useful to state clearly what they are by way of contrast to the corpus juris canonici or body of canon law the subject of books dealing with the socalled decretals the other branch including the institutes digest and novell of justinian was entitled corpus juris civilis the decretals then which we so often meet with in public libraries under various names are the canons which mainly constitute the canon law strictly speaking they are the papal epistolary decrees decreta said to have existed from very early times in the ninth century a collection of them was formed or manufactured in the name of the celebrated isidore of seville but with the donation of constantine to pope sylvester and many others in the later compilation of gratian these are usually looked upon as spurious and false the great and authorised collection was completed by a simple benedictine monk of st felix in bologna a native of chiusi the ancient clusium in tuscany a man so learned in the law as to have earned the title of magister this is the work often richly illuminated which goes by the name of the decretum gratiani43 when glancing over the lovely initials and beautiful foliages or resplendent ornaments we are apt to overlook the work itself which is truly monumental being a summary of the papal epistolary decrees the synodal canons of 150 councils selections from various regal codes extracts from the fathers and comments of schoolmen all methodically arranged and digested so as to facilitate its use as a manual for the schools it is said to have occupied the compiler incessantly for twentyfive years immediately on its completion in 1151 it was at once authorised by the pope eugenius iii as the only textbook to be used in the public schools and to govern the decrees of the ecclesiastical courts hence its celebrity its transcripts are very numerous and it has been often printed as to the sext and clementines they are merely additional commentaries on supplementary collections of decrees thus a new collection authorised by boniface viii is called the sext ie the sixth book of the decretals the clementines were the constitutions of clement v other collections such as that of john xxii are called extravagantes 43 see add 15274 british museum the most ancient mss of the decretals bear the title of concordantia discordantium canonum a concordance of discordant decrees afterwards the book of decrees lastly the decretals it was considered however by some jurists and others to be not so much a concordance of discordant canons as a subjugation of the ancient canons to the decrees of the papacy and as already stated many of its decrees were found to be false and fictitious nevertheless it is by no means an uncommon volume among the illuminators let us now return to the laon exampleone of four or five of the species in that collection the scene where the author is presenting his work to the popewe now know them bothis quite a painting except for the defect that kneeling figures are somewhat misshapen or illproportioned in the lower limbs the work is quite comparable with contemporary mural painting both for composition and colour it is almost modern it is quite realistic in costume expression easy and appropriate attitude it has quite outrun french illumination altogether another dated ms 1332 in the same library no 357 rubrics of the decretals is a most amusing example of the universal taste for irony and satire in the initial figures and corner effigies a muchlauded ms among these fourteenthcentury examples is one that has been carefully and expensively reproduced by the late cte horace de vielcastel namely the statuts de lordre du saintesprit au droit dsir ou du noeud an order instituted at naples in 1352 by louis i danjou called louis of taranto king of jerusalem naples and sicily cousin and husband of queen joanna of naples the style of the illumination is precisely the same as those just mentioned belonging to laon and as several mss in the british museum its stem and foliage ornament is very brightly coloured in fine green scarlet rose ultramarine and gold the miniatures which occasionally contain evident attempts at portraiture are painted in the manner of the school of cimabue and the earlier italian painters more particularly that of simone memmi it is substantially the byzantine manner but improved and enlivened by attention to natural attitude and expression the greenish underpainting of the fleshtints is often noticeable the decorative portions are very skilful and elaborate as well as extremely neat and symmetrical the gold profuse and brilliant indeed the whole production may be studied as a typical example of its time the text though good is not so beautiful as the bolognese hand usually found in italian mss of the following century but perhaps this should add to its value as a proof of its being absolutely contemporaneous with the foundation of the order and therefore of its being the identical ms ordered by the magnificent founder louis of taranto second husband of the toocelebrated joanna of naples their marriage took place in the august of 1346 and on the 27th of may 1352 being whitsun day they were crowned in memory of this happy event joanna founded the church of the virgin louis instituted the order of the holy spirit or of the knot the symbols of which appear frequently in the illumination of the ms it was named in honour of the day of pentecostlordre de la chevalerie du saintesprit the phrase au droit dsir had reference to the circumstances preceding the marriage the knot was worn in token of the perfect amity of the members of the order44 44 see reproduction published at paris by englemann and graf in 1853 1 fol other works of the fourteenth century are enthusiastically praised by italian writers as eg those of don silvestro a camaldolese monk who flourished at the same time as the illuminator of this ms of louis of taranto and who worked on the great choir books of the monastery degli angeli in florence so loudly commended by vasari and others who had seen them they have long been broken up and dispersed and it is not improbable that cuttings from them were among those bought by ottley rogers and other amateurs a fragment of an antiphonary of nocturnal services now in the laurentian library at florence finished in 1370 shows the style of work to be of the kind just described other great choir books of the earlier period are preserved in the academy at pisa but the number of mss to which reference might be made is legion those of this date are chiefly civil law books next to these come the canon law and divinity among the intermediate class are the copies of the rationale of durandus one of these being in the british museum add 31032 now and then a fine missal like the stefaneschi or the munich missal of 1374 which may be referred to as being one of the models of the school of prag on the whole perhaps the law books are more numerous than liturgical ones and are referable generally to bologna or padua the name of nicholaus of bologna occurs more than once in these books a book of offices of the virgin by nicholaus is now at kremsmnster and a new testament dated 1328 in the vatican tommaso di modena another distinguished italian illuminator also had much to do with altering the style of the artists who worked for charles iv at prag some of his work or work presumed to be his is still to be seen in the bohemian capital next to these bolognese mss we may place those of florencecopies of the divina commedia and the triumphs and sonnets of petrarch which with historians and copies or translations of the classics chiefly occupied the illuminators of florence and siena with one notable exception whoever has visited any of the north italian cities cannot fail to have noticed and admired the magnificent choirbooks still to be seen in the cathedrals and cathedral libraries at siena the piccolomini servicebooks are truly splendid those in san marco the riccardi the laurentian and other collections in florence are no less admirable veronas best work is chiefly elsewhere at florence siena etc at

of the neapolitan renaissance preserved in the national library at paris writers on italian miniatures are very numerous and a good deal of interesting information about italian mss may be found in m delisles cabinet des mss etc there is one style of italian illumination made very popular by the illuminators of the works of petrarch many of which are found in various libraries that is the one called the vinestem style it consists of gracefully coiled stems usually left uncoloured or softly tinted with yellow and bearing here and there peculiar ornamental flowerets while the grounds are picked out with various colours on which are fine white triads of dots or traceries in delicate white or golden tendrils a later variety of this style makes the stems of some pale but bright tint and the grounds of deep colour the vinestem style seems to have prevailed throughout the whole of italy just previous to the classic revival brought about by the medici in throwing open their museums of sculptures coins and other antiquities and by the liberal patronage of the new classic work by matthias corvinus king of hungary and the dukes of urbino after 1500 the vinestem style seems to have gradually died out and thenceforward only varieties of the revived antique became the fashion to the italian renaissance we shall revert in a later chapter chapter vii german illumination from the

of german illumination to the time of the hohenstaufen emperors we may now make a new start with frederick ii the eccentric resolute intractable accomplished stupor mundi 121050 not only was he a patron and encouraged art but also an author the work which he composed is still extant and is preserved in the vatican library under the title de arte venandi cum avibus paintings of birds and hunting scenes embellish its pages the art is not specially high class and though in courtesy it may be called german seeing that he was the german emperor and in some respects is like the imperial mss of the saxon period in point of fact it is italian or sicilian46 this sicilian school is peculiar and exhibits very slight traits of relationship with the rest of italy after the arab conquest of the island in 827 whilst new ideas were imported still the old greek cities kept their ancient traditions and methods in art especially in those branches we term industrial and just as both greek and arabic tongues existed as vernaculars beside the latin so the arts and industries bore the features of three artistic tastes 46 bibl vatican palatina no 1071 notice in kobell kunstv miniaturen p 44 the silkweaving of the greek craftsmen was embellished with the designs of embroidery from damascus and these were mingled with patterns in which the foliages of carolingian and german origin are distinctly traceable examples of the kind of manufacture here referred to may be seen in the robes of the emperor henry ii still preserved in the cathedral treasury at bamberg also the coronation mantle of st stephen of hungary husband of henrys sister giselaoriginally a closed casula covering the body but now an open cloak richly embroidered with figures of prophets animals and foliages and even portraits of the king and queen it has sometimes been thought from the inscription on its border that like the bayeux tapestries of queen matilda the needlework was from the queens own hand but no doubt both these attributions are mistaken47 still more saracenic in taste are the mantle and alb now in the imperial treasury at vienna of the twelfth century and executed at palermo sicilian in some respects is intermediate between italian and german hence we deem this a proper place to speak of it and rather as a transient phase than a style for it perished with the hohenstaufen dynasty 47 see description in bock die kleinodien des heiligen rmisches reichs pl 17 the cruel tyranny of the coldblooded despot remembered but execrated in sicily as charles of anjou extinguished the last scintilla of native art and when the italian revival of the thirteenth century took place it was confined entirely to the north except when such patrons as robert or ferdinand or alfonso encouraged tuscan artists by inviting them to naples palermo was no longer of importance though a capital and sicily existed merely as a portion of the kingdom of naples let us pass then to the great german capital changes here too have taken place it is not bamberg but prag for the imperial crown has passed from the house of suabia through the hapsburgs to that of luxembourg and among its territories is the picturesque old city with its historic bridge and gatetowers a slavonic not a german city in its origin the ten german circles of suabia and franconia westphalia bohemia and the rest did not as

support the holy roman empire very thinly perhaps but still the imperial sceptre meant a real supremacy and in the hands of such emperors as henry of luxembourg a supremacy maintained with real and becoming dignity prag as we have said is in a slavonic country and one sometimes hostile to the empire it was the capital of bohemia in 1310 its king was john the restless son of the new emperor henry vii of luxembourg hence we find it at the moment we begin the study of its art a nominally german city shortly before this time were produced several examples of german work as for instance the minnelieder with more than a hundred miniatures of hunting scenes and similar outdoor amusements which are useful as studies of costume but otherwise of little interest but it is not until 1312the new king being then for the sake of acquiring the crown though only it is said thirteen years of age already the husband of the princess elizabeth the late kings second daughter yet neither a favourite with his wife nor with her fathers peoplethat the abbess of st georges in prag the princess cunigunda composed a passionale richly illustrated with interesting miniatures the saints histories and allegories are painted in tender watercolours the architectural details being in gothic taste it is still preserved in the university library at prag no xiv a 1748 the emperor charles iv son of the valorous but impracticable john born 1316 died 1378 and who has already been spoken of in connection with english illumination was the founder of the bohemian school or rather of the school of prag owing probably his fine tastes and many accomplishments rather to his mother than his father he devoted himself to art and literature inviting painters and scholars from other countries to reside in the bohemian capital for the collegium carolinum of which he was the founder he caused many noble volumes to be executed and among the vast treasures and curiosities of his celebrated schloss karlstein was a fine collection of illuminated mss in the museum at prag and other local libraries are still kept some relics of his library the liber viaticus of bishop john of newmarktthe orationale

metropolitan chapter in pragthe evangeliary of canon john von troppau johannes de oppavia written and illuminated at brunn in moravia now in the imperial library at vienna all these illuminated mss are examples of the great variety of styles in which the bohemian colony produced their work under the auspices of their liberal patron yet not without peculiarities which mark the individuality of the artist thus while the orationale of arnestus is almost french the passionale of cunegunda is entirely free from french influence for costumes the weltchronik of rudolf von ems 135085 and now in the royal private library at stuttgard is almost an encyclopdia similar is the legenda aurea of 1362 in the public library at munich cod germ 6 a very interesting ms with miniatures of costumes and curious usages is the bellifortis of conrad kyeser gttingen public library philos no 63 the evangeliary of troppau is most beautifully written its text is a model of elegant and perfect penmanship its ornaments distinctly bohemian three or four prag mss executed for charless son wenzel 13781409 are it may be said typical of these the grandest though incomplete is the illuminated bible called the wenzel bible executed by order of martin rotlw for presentation to the emperor the choice of illustrations in this singular performance are rather more than on a par with the woodcuts of the great english bible of cranmer the wilhelm von oranse of 1387 now in the ambras museum at vienna no 7 affords splendid examples of the fine embroidered and richly coloured backgrounds we so often see towards 1400 in english mss and the golden bull of charles iv also in the imperial library at vienna j c 338 has the softly curling foliages variously coloured which form the characteristic difference between the french and english illumination of the fifteenth century 48 wocel mittheil der centralcommiss v 1860 p 75 with illustrations another rich example of german as distinct from french or italian work of this period is the grand salzburg missal now at munich lat 15710 when we reach the fifteenth century german illumination begins to grow gaudy especially in the revived taste for particoloured borderframes in which green and scarlet are often to be seen the kuttenberg gradual at vienna imp lib 15501 is of the bohemian type now and then a ms will show the influence of westphalian treatment of foliageand again of the school of cologne or nuremberg or augsburg these all differ whilst still keeping an unmistakable german character the hildesheimer prayerbook at berlin points to cologne the frankendorfer evangeliary at nuremberg is characteristic of that city the choirbook of st ulrich and afra in their abbey at augsburg is typical of its locality the missal of sbinco archbishop of prag inclines to nuremberg rather than prag imp lib vienna no 1844 it is eighty years earlier than the augsburg and hildesheim mss passing actively onwards we find illumination still in vogue in the sixteenth century notwithstanding that germany was the cradle of the printing press in fact it seems to wax more and more sumptuousthe books more profusely ornamented than ever the missal and prayerbook of albert of brandenburg archbishop of mainz once at aschaffenburg executed about 1524 are among the finest productions of the illuminators art while perhaps we may complain that design has given way to profusion and the border flowers and insectsa contemporary characteristic of netherlandish art alsoare neither more nor less than portraiture applied to flowers fruits and the insect world the larger miniatures are modern paintings including portraits differing in nothing but dimensions from the works of the greatest masters of the schools of painting in ignorance of the strict rules of the gilds some writers have gone so far as to say that miniatures also such as these were the work of the van eycks the memlings and the lucas van leydens of our public galleries this particular ms was the work of a famous nuremberg miniaturist one of a distinguished family of artistsnicolas glockendon a very similar but perhaps still richer ms is the prayerbook of william of bavaria still kept in the imperial library at vienna no 1880 painted by albert glockendon it is one of the most exquisite volumes possibly to be met with a prayerbook in the british museum add 17525 though far inferior may give some idea of the sumptuous character of the glockendon work the first archbishop of prag arnestus or ernest von pardubitz was an industrious collector of mss and employed many scribes another of the famous patrons in prag was gerhard groot who employed one of the best penmen to copy st john chrysostoms commentary on st matthew in 1383 he founded at deventer the famous house of the brothers of the common life who made a business of transcribing books and indeed so profitably that for instance ian van enkhuisen of zwolle received five hundred golden gulden for a bible on account of the goosequill which the brothers wore in their hats they were familiarly known as the brethren of the pen49 49 wattenbach schriftwesen im mittelalter p 264 chapter viii

grimani breviarybritish museumromance of the roseisabella breviarygrisailles in speaking of the netherlands we have to bear in mind that some portions of what are now called the netherlands were once parts of germany while others were parts of france in the thirteenth century netherlandish art was simply a variety either of northern german or northern french the earlier schools of flanders and hainaut and perhaps of brabant belong rather to france while holland limburg luxembourg and the rhine districts were more inclined towards germany but as soon as the schools of ghent and bruges and other burgundian centres began to assert their claims it was speedily apparent that they had an individuality of their own in no country had the study of nature a more direct influence on the character of illumination the allegorical method which so long had characterised both french and german art was promptly abandoned and direct realism both in figure and landscape became the prevailing characteristic symbolism it is true remained in the representation of cities and other generalities of pictorial composition but the details were in all cases direct imitations of contemporary facts half a dozen soldiers or houses might indicate an army or a city and even some particular army or city named in the text but the individual soldiers though representing the army of alexander or roland would wear the equipment or armour of the artists military acquaintances or his overlords own company the city whether ghent or bagdad would consist of the same sort of houses peaked and parapeted the same towers and pinnacles that the illuminator saw before him in his daily walks his conception of a scene from scripture history would probably be framed more or less upon the traditions of the schools transmitted from the sphigmenou manual or the masters portfolio of schemes but while a prophet an angel or a divinity would wear ideal raiment abraham and pharaoh would be arrayed in the costume of a contemporary burgomaster and an almost contemporary french king in one memorable instance we are told so realistic was the scene that isaac was about to be despatched with a horsepistol and in another representing the birth of cain adam was bringing to the french tester bedside a supply of hot water from the kitchen boiler in a copper saucepan this kind of anachronism it is true is to some degree chargeable on all early work we see it among the early italian painters no less frequently perhaps but mostly accompanied with so much of allegory or imagination that we scarcely notice it or if we do we wink at it as part of the times of ignorance it is really a mark of overhaste to be truthful or at least to be understood and at the worst it is no more than the natural rebound from the evil constraint of the old byzantine tyranny over scheme and costume and invention it is often truly diverting in its very insouciance but its priceless value to usand here the same remark applies to all styles of pictorial art before the fifteenth centuryis the ocular record of dress architecture implements of peace and war incidents of daily life etc for which no encyclopdia britannica of verbal explanation could ever be more than the poorest makeshift as we say this same happy anachronism is common to other schools of illumination and we cannot fail to notice it from byzantium to britain but it is the intense realism of the netherlands that forces it upon us so strongly that we are bound to speak of it the oldest notice of illuminated work in the netherlands is in a benedictine chronicle of the ninth century where mention is made of two ladies daughters of the lord of denain named harlinda and renilda50 who were educated in the convent of valenciennes in 714 they left their native province to found a monastery on the banks of the maasamong the meadows of alden and maaseyck they there consecrated their lives to the praise of god and the transcription of books adorning them with precious pictures51 about the year 1730 an evangeliary of great age was discovered in the sacristy of the church by the benedictine antiquary edmond martne which on good ground has been attributed to the two sisters the ms is still in existence and was exhibited in brussels in 1880 it is a small folio and contains a great number of miniatures in the carolingian or perhaps more strictly francosaxon manner on the first leaf is a romanesque colonnade of arches surmounted by a larger one under the smaller arches are the figures of saints demons and monsters and in the tympanum scrolls of foliage and birds between the columns are the reference numbers to the chapters 50 or relinda 51 bradley dict of miniaturists ii 87 the evangelist portraits are dignified and saintly recalling the earliest work of the byzantine school and that of the catacombs draperies and other details are heavy dull and ill drawn in short the work is of the same class as the early carolingian the blue red green and gold of the borders etc have all kept their brilliancy52 it is somewhat curious that the van eycks the founders of flemish painting were natives of this little townthen doubtless pretty and rural now a busy place of breweries oilfactories tanneries and other fragrant nuisances some miles further northward lie deventer and zwolle and kempen the land of the brothers of the pen and of the immortal thomas kempis there is a style of calligraphic ornament deriving its origin from these northern hollandish foundations such as zwolle which is confined almost entirely to the painting of the initial letters and the decorating of the borders with flourished scrolls of penwork very neatly drawn and terminating in equally neat but extremely fanciful flowers finely painted it seems to have been brought at some time from the neighbourhood of milan where a similar kind of initial and exceedingly neat penmanship also is found in the choir books many south german choir books are similarly ornamented so that it is not easy to say at once where the work was done the dutch illuminators however may usually be recognised by the netherlandish character of the miniatures combined with neat and sometimes rigidly careful penmanship in the scrolls and tendrils and a hardness in the outline of the flowers sometimes the large initials are entirely produced by the pen the labyrinthine patterns in blue or vermilion being filled in with circlets loops and other designs with infinite patience and excellent effect some of the border scrolls are exceedingly pretty and the borders differ from flemish in mixing natural flowers painted in thin watercolours with the more conventional flowers painted with a different medium not in the later flemish manner where the flowers are frankly direct imitations of nature and painted in the same medium as the rest of the illumination 52 see messager des sciences etc 110 1858 and deshaines lart chrtien en flandre 34 douai 1860 8 after the maaseyck evangeliary the work of these northern foundations may well reckon either with the french or german schools until the fifteenth century where otherwise they are not distinguishable the netherlandish miniatures are usually such as prefer plain burnished gold backgrounds to diapered ones or have a plain deep blue paled towards the horizon and lastly replace the background by a natural or what was intended to be a natural landscape as a test between french or german influence generally the use of green shows the latter that of blue the former not that this was any sthetic point of difference in taste but somehow the germans had the green paint when the french had not and so they used it it is an open question whether flanders or italy first introduced the landscape background but flemish artists were so numerous so ubiquitous that we can hardly say where they were not at workin france italy or spain plenty of socalled spanish illumination is really the work of flemish craftsmen this was largely owing to the political conditions of the times the dukes of burgundy and the austrian archdukes both ruled over flemish municipalities and employed the gildmen as their household enlumineurs and of course the success of the van eycks rogier van der weide de la pasture derrick bonts and hans memling stirred up the spirit of rivalry among the illuminators they all worked in the same minutely careful manner and one could almost take a corporal oath on the identity of illuminations and panels which are really the work of different artists even yet the illuminations of the grimani breviary are attributed in part to hans memlingand no wonder only the best qualified judges can distinguish them it is known that gerard david of oudewater in holland a master painter belonged also to the gild of miniaturists but no miniatures are known to be from the hands of either ian or hubert or marguerite van eyck or hans memling the supposed identifications are merely guesses but while this is so there is still no lack of illuminators not to mention the illustrious few who were employed by the brothers of charles v king of france and when we come to the days of his grandson philip of burgundy 141967 we might name quite a crowd of distinguished illuminators from 1422 to 1425 ian van eyck was varlet de chamber to duke john of bavaria first bishop of lige and regent of luxembourg holland and brabant in 1425 he passed into the service of philip he died in 1440 in court service there were besides jean de bruges david aubert jean mielot jean wanguelin loyset lyeder and others connected more or less closely with the maas valley and the province of limburg this valley seems to have been the cradle of netherlandish miniature art it is from this neighbourhood that paris was supplied with craftsmen in the days of the brilliant if reckless administration of the uncles of philip the good there were schools of illuminating artists in maestricht and lige and within a very brief period the style of the netherlander surpassed that of all competitors for facility clearness and realism a marked feature in this mastery is the free use of architectural and sculptural design all gothic draperies are in some degree sculpturesque and in miniatures we find sculpture to be the ruling principle perhaps it was the practice of uniting the crafts of painter and imagier in one person that fostered this peculiarity but certain it is that netherlandish illumination in its border foliages after the taste for the larger vine and acanthus leaf had superseded the ivy the drawing is studiously sculpturesque many of the gantois borders are like undercut wood carvings even as to colour we find either the gilded wood brown or the stone grey quite as frequently as gayer colours and much more so than any natural green the afterfashion for grisailles or camaieu gris has reference probably rather to stained glass than to carving before the fifteenth century we do not often meet with individual illuminators by name but in the limburg chronicle under 1380 is this entry there was at this time in cologne a celebrated painter he was probably a native of herle in limburg the like of whom was not in the whole of christendom and more to his praise his name was wilhelm in the municipal expense book under 137090 page 12 is written to master wilhelm for painting the oath book 9 marks the oath book still exists but unfortunately the miniature has been cut out53 53 woltmann hist of painting eng transl i p 412 of course it may be expected that some of the best examples of netherlandish illumination are to be found in the royal library at brussels the bibliothque de bourgogne as it is called contains indeed a great number of them some of course may be classed as burgundian there are for instance the grand chroniques de hainaut in three immense folio volumes written from 1446 to 1449 nos 92424 also jean mansels fleur des histoires in three grand folios nos 92313 written about 1475 the frontispiece to the chroniques shows the duke philip with his son the count of charolais receiving the work from the author perhaps the best illumination in all three volumes another 9245 the book of the seven sages of rome is an example of the last quarter of the fourteenth century still another 9246 the history of st graal or of the round table is dated 1480 a missal and pontifical 9216 9217 shows miniatures dating about 1475 but other public libraries also possess admirable examples the imperial library at vienna possesses a most masterly production in the fragments of a folio chronicle of jerusalem no 2533 in which both figures and architectural details are most delicately and minutely finished so that the miniatures form a most valuable treasury of costumes armour and architecture correctly drawn and exquisitely painted the figure of baldwin king of jerusalem shows the pointed toes which anne of bohemia is said to have introduced into england at vienna also is the richly illuminated history of grard de roussillon in french no 2549 at paris we find the champion des dames no 12476 round the first miniature in this ms are splendidly emblazoned the armorials of the various countries and cities of his dominionsburgundy brabant flanders franchecomt holland namur lower lorraine luxembourg artois hainaut zealand friesland malines and salins on either side are scenes from the story and beneath a symbolical crown is the motto of philips grandfather philip le hardi aultre naray the same motto appears in the chronicle of jerusalem at vienna and on the velvet of the das of isabella of portugal philips third consort it may be interesting to note as a means of distinguishing these burgundian princes or their mss that the arms of philip ii the good differ from those of his father during the latters lifetime by having in chief a label of three points and from those of his grandfather philip the bold by having an inescutcheon of pretence on the centre of the arms of margaret de maele first assumed by his father john the fearless that is or a lion rpt sa for flanders as we have just said many of the mss claimed as netherlandish may be classed as burgundian the difference lies mainly in the miniatures where the latter are manifestly french with the mixed brugeois borders they may pass as burgundian but with similar borders yet distinguishably netherlandish that is broadnosed squarejawed and excited faces as compared with the finer features and placid expression of the french artists the work may still be burgundian but it will be also netherlandish the individuality of netherlandish illumination above every other quality establishes its identity look at the expression of the onlookers in a crucifixion or a christ before pilate or a stoning of st stephenthe diabolical ferocity the fiendish earnestness the downright intentional ugliness put on some of the characters are in direct contrast to the sweet indifference the calm complaisance and blank unconcern of a crowd as shown in similar scenes by french illuminators illustration hor 15th cent late brit mus add ms 17280 fol 21 illustration valere maxime trad par simon de hesdin 15th cent late brit mus harl ms 4375 fol 68 we have seen something of the earlier kind of netherlandish mss in those already referred to it now remains to take a rapid glance at a few of the later ones and here the difficulty is that of selection in 1484 gerard david appears on the list of illuminators of bruges54 and it appears that he and not hans memling was the painter of those marvellous miniatures in the grimani breviary at venice usually attributed to the latter and therefore may be considered as one of the founders of the school of bruges or at least of the later style that may be referred to the grimani breviary as its most perfect example executed in much the same manner is a book of offices in the british museum containing portraits of philip the fair and his wife the unhappy juana la loca son and daughterinlaw of the emperor maximilian similar again are the offices of the elector albert of brandenburg possibly the work of the same artists who produced the grimani breviary there are also some fragments in a guardbook in the british museum add 24098 which may compare with any of the preceding examples but perhaps to many booklovers no better specimen of the highest class of netherlandish art could be more welcome or more interesting than the celebrated copy of the roman de la rose also in our great national collection harl 4425 this justly famous ms is a real masterpiece in every department whether we consider the expression in its miniatures or the consummate technical skill displayed in the drawing and colour of the borders these secondary embellishments consist of fruit flowers birds beetles and butterflies but of course the great interest of this book lies in its miniatures scenes from the poets allegory and in the little statuesque figures of the various characters in the poem 54 cf his judgement of cambyses in the museum at bruges two marvellous little volumes there are in the national museum at munich 8612 which are surely unapproachable one of the borders in 861 consists of the eyes of peacock feathers so absolutely perfect that we can only wonder at its rainbow hues and pearly sheen of colour something similar to it exists in a fragment no 4461 in the victoria and albert museum at south kensington the isabella breviary of the british museum add 18851 ought not to pass unmentioned but space forbids us to add more on this inexhaustible topic there is however the class of work alluded to early in the chapter and in that on french work which must be at least mentioned we refer to what the italians call chiaroscuro and the french grisaille ie painting executed in tones of grey in which the lights are given in white or gold and the backgrounds in rich blue occasionally the draperies and ornaments also are touched with gold and the flesh tints as in life grisaille is not limited to netherlandish illuminations we find it both in french and italian but perhaps it is among the netherlandish books we meet with it most frequently several examples are to be seen in the royal library at brussels and there is at least one in the british museum

montmorency heures de dinteville etc when the new ideas derived from the italian revival first reached france it would be difficult to say there must have been communication with italy going on the whole time that cimabue and giotto memmi and the rest were astonishing their fellowcitizens with their divine performances the roads from lyons poictiers dijon and paris were well known and frequently trodden by both artists and merchants as well as by soldiers the renaissance therefore was no sudden convulsion perhaps a very careful examination of some of our burgundian mss might reveal the presence of notions derived from italian travel for it is in the details of ornament that we find the traces of a new movement and when the great change of style is clearly noticeable it is when the habits of society themselves have been remodelled and when the once strange and foreign element has become a familiar guest in the fixing of schools and centres much is owing of course to the residential choice of princes on whose patronage depends the very existence of art this explains the schools of bruges and dijon of paris and tours for while the earlier dukes of burgundy and the earlier kings of france had lived at bruges and paris the later dukes had preferred dijon and louis xi charles viii and louis xii lived mostly at tours so that while dijon became the new centre of burgundian illumination tours became to the new movement from italy what paris had been at the commencement of the gothic period tours in fact became the centre of the renaissance the influence of dijon was on the wane burgundy itself was going down michel coulombe the great breton sculptor who had been trained at dijon left it for tours and probably illuminators and other artists followed his example as we know from examples the burgundian art of dijon had the flemish stamp strongly markedthe flemish artists had a way of making strong impressions tours on the other hand had had an entirely different training the artists of touraine had no shadow of flemish influence in their practice their sculptures enamels colourscheme were of another bias their stamp came from italy and if not so deep as that of flanders or dijon it was equally inevitable and more permanent the first name that we meet with among the illuminators of touraine who are expressly connected with the renaissance is that of jean fouquet of his origin or training nothing seems to be known but he was born probably about 1415 he must have acquired distinction even as a youth for some twentyfive years afterwards 14403 he was invited to rome to paint the portrait of pope eugenius iv and he stayed in italy until 1447 on his return to france he was made valet de chambre and painter to charles vii at tours and continued in the same office under louis xi it was part of the business of the paintre du roy to design and provide decorations and costumes banners and devices for all state ceremonies and this became fouquets duty at the funeral of charles vii and when louis instituted the order of st michel in 1470 and the last trace of him as an artist occurs about 1477 his sons louis and francis were both painters and like himself worked much at the illumination of books it is curious that this great masterone of the greatest miniaturists of any school and one of the founders of the french school of paintingbecame entirely forgotten until the discovery of some fragments of a book of hours painted for estienne chevalier the kings treasurer forty miniatures of the most masterly description came into the hands of m louis brentanolaroche of frankfortonthemaine their uncommon excellence led to a most diligent search for information respecting the artist which resulted in the unearthing of many other examples of his unequalled pencil we now know of a dozen most precious examples besides the brentano miniatures two other fragments of the same book of hours have been found and several large and important mss among these we may name the antiquities of the jews by josephus in the national library at paris mss des 6891 and a book of hours executed for marie de clve widow of charles duke of orleans in 1472 attributed to him are the versailles livy nat lib paris 6907 the sorbonne livy fds de sorb 297 a livy in the public library at tours also passes under his name and the famous boccaccio of estienne chevalier at munich containing ninety miniatures is also confidently assigned to him other mss that are imputed to him are probably the work of his sons or scholars the paris josephus is generally considered his masterpiece the volume which contains only the first fourteen books is in folio written most beautifully in two columns and is adorned with miniatures vignettes and initials but much of its interest lies in the note at the end placed there by robortet secretary to the due de bourbon en ce livre a douze ystoires les troys premieres de lenlumineur du duc jehan de berry et les neuf de la main du bon paintre et enlumineur du roy loys xie jehan foucquet natif de tours and we gather from another note that the book had been entrusted to fouquet for completion by jacques darmagnac duc de nemours a further note informs us that the book belonged to the duc de bourbon it seems to have been one of the rich presents made by the due de berry to jacques de nemours the first three miniatures are by the illuminator of the duc de berry and this artist was probably andrieu beauneveu though other illuminators did work for him as jacques de hesdin and pol de limbourg the fourth miniature is by fouquet and represents a battle the rest to the seventh are either not his best work or else the work of his pupils but the seventh on folio 135 gives us a good idea of fouquet at his best it represents david receiving with his crown the news of the death of saul the eighth ninth and tenth are very fine but the eleventh m paulin paris mss du roy thinks the most beautiful of all its subject is the clemency of cyrus towards the captive jews in babylon55 of the other mss space forbids us reluctantly to forego description 55 see mrs mark pattisons lady dilke the renaissance in france i 273 etc bradley dict of miniaturists art fouquet i 346 the characteristics of the school of tours as seen in the work of the greatest of its expositors is 1 the clearly marked influence of italy and the antique 2 a masterly understanding of french landscape see fine instances of this understanding also in trsor des histoires now in the british museum cott aug 5 3 a complete freedom from gothic influence and from the domination of the school of bruges the colours for which fouquet seems to have a preference are first a clear orangevermilion supported by golden brown and gold clear blue and green lemonyellow and then as a contrast grey of various tones in walls and buildings soft landscape greens and arial tints of distance and sky perhaps the technical skill of fouquet has never been surpassed it is so perfect that some have tried to explain it by supposing that he was trained in a flemish studio his sons and pupils continued his methods and thus while paris remains under the influence of flemish masters tours was carrying forward a quite different type of traditions the valerius maximus harl 4374 of the british museum will give an idea of the later paris school its date is about the end of the fifteenth century we ought not in this place to forget the influence brought into french art through the marriage of the murdered duke of orleans with valentina of milan not only directly through books and artists but by the hereditary transmission of that love of art and beautiful things for which valentina and her family were well known it was in art letters and books that the widowed princess sought such consolation as was possible56 in her best days she had united in herself a seductive grace of carriage beauty of person and dignity of rank which made her the ornament of the french court she was almost the only one about the unfortunate charles vi who could influence him in his moments of mental aberration coming from the luxury of the most splendid court in italy she brought into france the most refined taste in matters connected with the arts the inventory of her jewels at the time of her marriage includes three books of hours three german mss and a volume called mandavilla like her husband she was an employer both of copyists and illuminators and before her death had collected at her castle of blois a very fine collection of beautiful books 56 she assumed as her impresa the chantepleure with the sorrowful motto plus ne mest rien rien ne mest plus her son charles the poet inherited her tastes and added to her collections we are not surprised therefore to find her grandson louis afterwards louis xii supporting the great artistic movement which he and his queen anne of brittany helped so effectually to identify with the court of france about the time that we hear the last of fouquet we have the earliest notices of another illuminator who plays an important part in the illuminations executed for anne of brittany the noble and gifted queen of france and wife first of charles viii and then of his successor louis xii in 1472 jean perral is entrusted with the glass paintings of the carmelite church at tours lemaire in his lgende des vnitiens calls him a second zeuxis or apelles during the reigns of charles viii and louis xii he is the chief artist of the time in 1491 and perhaps earlier he is engaged in the usual duties of a valet de chambre ie designing and preparing the requisite devises arms and banners for public functions in 1502 he went to italy in 1509 his name occurs in connection with that of jean bourdichon of whom we shall hear more when we come to the work done for the queen in 1523 in the household of francis i he is still valet de chambre twentyfour years previously it was as valet de chambre that he prepared the decorations for louis xiis entry into lyons on the death of anne of brittany also he performed similar duties and again on that of louis xii he even came to england in 1514 sent by louis xii to superintend the trousseau of mary tudor pour aider dresser le dict appareil la mode de france previous to her wedding journey to paris57 four months afterwards he was summoned to direct the funeral obsequies of louis himself no illuminated work can be really identified as the work of perral but mrs patteson lady dilke strongly urges the probability that he painted the bible historie of corpus christi college cambridge bequeathed by general oglethorpe58 she considers it quite the sort of work that would grow out of that of fouquet and dwells upon the fact of his official duties as valet de chambre giving him just that minute facility in the decoration of armour and furniture in the miniatures which the ms displays whether this be so or not it is certain that the bible historie is a fine example of the school of tours 57 see vespas b 2 brit mus 58 see her renaissance of art in france i 303 another court painter and valet de chambre to louis xi and his successors was jean bourdichon an artist born at tours in 1457 and therefore as a youth probably one of the scholars in the atelier of jean fouquet he is first noticed in the accounts in or about 1478 a jehan bourdichon paintre la somme de vingt livres dix sept solz ung denier tournois pour avoir paint le tabernacle fait pour la chapelle du plessis du pare de fin or et dazur59 later on after naming the painting of a statute of st martin for which he received twenty golden crowns is a note of his painting a ms which we translate to the said bourdichon for having had written a book in parchment named the papalistthe same illuminated in gold and azure and made in the same 19 rich histories miniatures and for getting it bound and covered thirty crowns of gold for this by virtue of the said order of the king and by quittance of the abovenamed written the 5th april one thousand four hundred and eighty milcccciiiixx after easter here rendered the sum of 19 1 8 59 comptes de lhtel de louis xi 147881 another quittance shows him to have been employed on the decorations of the chteau of plessis les tours we may easily see how it is that these artists when they came to illuminate the books entrusted to them had such special knowledge of embroideries and decoration of armour when we read in the accounts how they were constantly employed in designing dresses for weddings tournaments and funeral obsequies and making patterns for the dress and equipment of war a notice in 1508 tells us that anne of brittany made an order of payment to bourdichon of 1050 livres tournois for having richly and sumptuously historiated and illuminated a great book of hours for our use and service to which he has given and employed much time and also on behalf of other services which he has rendered hitherto this refers to the celebrated hours of anne of brittany now in the national library at paris this volume peerless of its kind has been reproduced in colour lithography by curmer of paristhe result however is disappointing from the flat and faded look of the prints as compared with the brilliancy of the original pages the ms is an invaluable monument of french renaissance illumination it is french of touraine rather than of paris yet bearing traces in its flowers and fruit borders of flemish modes of ornament it has also reminiscences of italian painting but the french neatness and restraint from overdecoration have kept it in a manner unique it has not quite the softness of italian and is far from the intensity of flemish indeed its fault if it be faulty is in its want of force with the exception of annes own portrait given with her patrons st anne st helena and st ursula the queens gown is of brown gold brocade trimmed with dark brown fur her hair is brown like the fur she wears a necklace of gems set in gold on her head is a black hood edged with gold and jewels beneath which and next her face is a border of crimped white muslin she has brown eyes and finely pencilled eyebrows as to nose and mouth she and the two younger saints are pretty much alike with the allowance of blue for black st anne wears the dress of a benedictine abbess a dark crimson cloth covers a table before which the queen is kneeling and on which lies open a finely illuminated servicebook the calendar which follows this portrait is for each month enclosed in a margin of ornament to the outer margin of every other page of the book is placed a broad tablet or pilaster containing flowers fruits insects etc from five to six inches high each having the latin name of the plant etc at top in red and the french one in red or blue at the bottom these names may have been put in later it must be admitted that the fruits flowers and insects are painted with the greatest care and neatness though sometimes a little assisted by the imagination of the painter the text and initials are rather heavy and commonplace now and then a border surrounds the text completely where flowers or fruits are scatteredsomewhat recklessly at times but usually with good designover a ground of plain gold on which the branches etc cast heavy shadows this part of the design is certainly flemish where histories occur the border is a plain brown gilt frame within a black border undoubtedly the hours of anne of brittany is a very precious volume the figure subjects are of various degrees of excellence the four evangelists are vivid and recall the portraits of ghirlandaio and it is to italy also that the illuminator is indebted for his architectural and sculptural details yet bourdichon is inferior to fouquet in colouring as the latter is to the italians in design and composition perhaps he is most successful in his flowers and insects nothing said muntz is less like the elegant foliages of ghirlandaio and attavante and nothing is more worthy of being put in comparison with them60 60 la renaissance en italie etc 5478 an illuminator of the name of jehan poyet is said to have assisted in the hours thus while bourdichon painted the miniatures poyet put in the flowers and fruit etc but this share of work is by some believed to belong to a smaller book of hours executed for the queen flowers and fruit are said to have been poyets speciality and it is quite possible that he may have had the painting of the borders of the grandes heures while bourdichon did the rest the writer of the ms was another native of tours named jehan riveron during the reign of francis i the school of tours was removed to paris because the court had settled there louis xii had died in the htel des tournelles and francis though full of plans for plaisances elsewhere lived mostly in paris fontainebleau is the dream of the near future il rosso the italian architect painter poet and musician was busy there amid a crowd of other artists from florence and romethe refuse of a once brilliant sodality it was the frivolous pretty graceful side of italian art that came northward in that great migrationthe graver and more dignified elements were left behind to see what italian art became in france we have only to enter the grand gallery at fontainebleau and we see it at its best in architecture sculpture and painting and we cannot help admiring it for it is amazingly beautiful yet it is not italianthe italian of the medici and farnese palaces il rosso was neither a michelangelo nor a carracci but he set a fashion he changed the face of art for france nor was it in painting and sculpture only the italian passion for devises anagrams emblems and mottoes became the rage in paris it first came in with the return of charles viii from his neapolitan campaign louis xii adopted the hedgehog or porcupine with the motto cominus et eminus his queen claudes motto was candida candidis the princess marguerites emblem was a marigold or heliotrope others assigned her the daisy her motto non inferiora secutus the wellknown emblem of francis was a salamanderwhy is a mysterywith the motto nutrisco et extinguo all this entered into the taste of the illuminator and elegant cartouche framesprobably of dutch origin as we see in the old mapbooks of ortelius cluverius and bleau imported by ortelius and his friends into italy and made use of by clovis and thence transferred to francewere made into borderframes for miniatures varied with altarforms doorways and other fanciful frameworks from the new architecture decorated with flowers ribbons panels mottoes another new thing too no doubt afforded plenty of suggestion to the illuminator this was stained glass jean cousin was in his glory in glasspainting robert pinagrier also but it was cousin who adopted the new italian ideas and whose works were models for the illuminator in the backgrounds and details of his glasspaintings at sens fleurigny paris and elsewhere we may trace his progress and an excellent model too was jean cousin he has other claims to remembrance in sculpture engraving authorship but it is as the glasspainter that his influence is seen in illumination indeed mr af didot strongly urged the probability that cousin was himself the illuminator of the splendid breviary or hours of claude gouffier61 the drawing is in his best manner the frameborder of caryatides in camaieu is of a richness of ornamentation in keeping with the rest of the volume the arms and motto of gouffier are painted in it it is objected that cousins name does not appear in the gouffier accountbooks while those of other artists are given but only a portion of the accounts is extant cousin may perhaps only have designed the book and the other miniaturists carried out his designs at any rate the accounts give us the names of three miniaturists which we may here recordjean lemaire of paris 1555 charles jourdain and geoffroy ballin 1359 these enlumineurs are stated to have decorated two books of hours for gouffiers wedding as a good example of the style employed in the decoration of titlepages we may quote the chimneypiece of the chteau danet executed for diane de poitiers where a sculptured marble frame surrounds a painted landscape many of the books of the time of francis i and henry ii are ornamented in this style 61 now belonging to m le vicomte de tanz in the british museum are several fine mss illustrative of this period of french illumination viz add 18853 18854 and 18855 these three mss formed part of the purchase which included the bedford offices 18853 is a book of offices executed apparently for francis i in some of the borders is a large f with the cordelire of the third order of st francis and a rayed crown and on folio 97 v a large monogram consisting of the letter f with two crossed sceptres and palm branches surmounted by the crownroyal of france nothing is known of the history of the ms from 1547 to 1723 when it was in possession of the regent philippe dorlans possibly it had remained as an heirloom in the family philippe gave it to his natural son the abb rothelin a great lover of rare books and a noted collector at whose death it was bought by gaignat another collector who sold it to the duc de la vallire and so step by step it came at length to sir john tobin of liverpool and thence to the british museum the partly sculpturesque character of the borderframes are of the kind just referred to with festoons and garlands of flowers and drapery monograms and emblems in full rich colours the architecture and other ornaments sometimes finished with pencillings of gold the miniatures are of excellent design and colour finely modelled and quite in the manner of the paintings of fontainebleau the text is a combination of jarrylike roman with italic it may be compared with 18854 similar in some respects but the smaller miniatures and the frames look more like the older school of tours this ms is also a book of offices and was written for franois de dinteville bishop of auxerre in 1525 as appears from an inscription in gold letters on fol 26 v illustration officm b mari virgines c 1530 brit mus add ms 18853 fol 52 illustration officm mortuorum 16th cent early brit mus egert ms 2125 fol 183 some of the borderframes are drawn in sepia others in redbrown or burnt siena and highly finished with gold the writing is a small roman hand on the whole it is richer in illustration than 18853 but not so perfect in drawing yet it is a very fine ms sometimes it has a border like those in the hours of anne of brittany on fol 26 v is a curious border of twisted ribbons covered with mottoes such as virtutis fortuna comes ingrates servire nephas etc some of the tiny miniatures of the saints in the memori are very charmingly painted st mary magdalene for instance on fol 147 v the pillar architecture of some of the borders with pendant festoons of flowers is also very handsome 18855 folio is a book of offices written in a gothic text the miniatures are large fullpage paintings within architectural frames or porches with coloured pillars or pilasters with panels of rich blue covered with golden traceries bronze gold pendants at sideoccasional borders as in the hours of anne of brittany the work is of the older school of tours but loaded with ornamental details from north italian pilasterwork among the best miniatures are the nativity 34 v the adoration of the magi 42 v and the bathsheba the last perhaps a little too open a scene for a ladys bathroom but placed within a most gorgeous architectural window or doorway fol 62 v compare also harl 5925 no 574 for a titlepage of french renaissance style from a printed book which suggests venice as the source of the style of 18853 in the national library at paris are of course a number of this class of mss such as the offices ms lat 10563 officium beat mari virginis ad usum romanor 1531 or the exquisitely painted heures de henry 2d fds lat 1429 or the magnificent epistres dovide of louisa of savoy fds fr 875 and others by no means of less importance we may cite the beautiful volume belonging to the late comte dhaussonville now in the muse cond at chantilly called the heures du conntable anne de montmorency and the heures de dinteville ms lat 10558 the decoration of which is quite on a par with the heures de montmorency or those of henry ii also the psalter of claude gouffier arsenal lib 5095 containing the psalms of marot it is scarcely worth while to carry the subject further what is done later than francis ii does not grow finer or better it only becomes more overloaded with ornament too much gold too much richness even foliages are often variegated like pearls or change gradually from colour to colour on the same sweep of acanthus as in a ms in the british museum attributed to pierre mignard sol gallicus add 23745 compare also

sixteenth century and is manifestly a reflection with peculiar mannerisms of either flemish or italian illumination of the same period it may seem almost superfluous to devote a separate chapter to the subject yet there is a goodly list of both spanish and portuguese artists who practised the art of illumination so early as the time of isidore of seville we find notices of libraries copyists and the like see book iv of his encyclopdia and an able writer of the last century don jos maria de eguren published a work on the ms rarities of spain62 the most important of the miniatures in the famous codex vigilano are also reproduced in el museo espaol de antiguedades most interesting respecting the calligraphy and miniature art of the eleventh century 62 memoria de los codices notables conservados en los archivos ecleseasticos de espana madrid 1859 l 8 one of the earliest instances of royal patronage bestowed on painting in spain is a document in the royal library at madrid containing the expenses of king sanchez iv in 12912 thus to rodrigo esteban painter of the king for many paintings done by the kings orders in the bishops palace 100 golden maravedis again in the archives at barcelona we find that juan cesilles painter of history was engaged 16th march 1382 to paint the history of the twelve apostles for the grand altar of the church at reps for 330 florins in 1339 one gonzalez ferran had some reputation both as a wood engraver and a painter he was probably a miniaturist in 134081 garcia martinez a spanish illuminator worked at avignon a copy of the decretals dated 1381 in the cathedral library of seville is by his hand in the fifteenth century we have many notices of painters especially in toledo whither the taste was in all likelihood brought from naples after the conquest of that kingdom by alphonso v of aragon in 1441 it has been observed by those familiar with native spanish art that its chief characteristic is that it is gloomy this may be so but it is not fairly chargeable to the artists but to the tyranny of the spanish inquisidor who laid the embargo on the illuminator that he should not follow the wicked gaiety of the italians nor the sometimes too realistic veracity of the flemings this accounts usually for backgrounds of black where the fleming would have had rich colour or gold for the prevalence of black in the draperies and for the sombre tone in general of spanish painting it is not always in evidence as may be seen in many of the miniatures of the famous choirbooks in the escorial the sombre period began under ferdinand the catholic and it has left its mark on the schools of the fifteenth century the sixteenth began a new era and under philip ii several both netherlandish and italian miniaturists were invited to assist in the production of the enormous choirbooks ordered by the king for san lorenzo of the escorial between 1572 and 1589 the volumes are bound in wooden boards covered with leather stamped and bossed with ornaments of gilded bronze it is said that 5500 lbs of bronze and 40 lbs of pure gold were used in the bindings the actual dimensions of the volumes are 115 by 84 centimetres every volume has at least seventy folios and every folio is splendidly illuminated thus affording more than 30000 pages covered with richly ornamented initials miniatures and borders the illuminators and copyists of these choirbooks were cristobal ramirez who planned the work fixed the size and other details of the volumes and the character of the handwriting fray andrs de leon fray julian de fuente del saz ambrosio salazar fray martin de palencia francisco hernandez pedro salavarte and pedro gomez ramirez was engaged at the escorial from 1566 to 1572 in the latter year he presented a breviary with musical notation to the king and was then engaged for the great undertaking mentioned above andrs cristobal was also an illuminator of note at seville where he worked from 1555 to 1559 andrs de leon worked at the escorial from 1568 and is especially mentioned by los santos in his wellknown description of the monastery of san lorenzo son de gran numero y excelencia las iluminaciones que tienen de mano nuestro fray andrs de leon que fue otro don julio en el arte63 the allusion is to the celebrated don giulio clovio then in the height of his fame in italy fray julian received similar praise for a capitolario for the principal festivals of the year especially for the grand dimensions of the miniatures the like of which the writer says had never been seen before either in spain or italy andrs de leon died at the escorial in 1580 salazar continued working on them till they were completed and in 1590 went to toledo where he finished two missals for the cathedral which had been begun by the famous juan martinez de los corrales he was still engaged on similar work until his death in 1604 two other illuminators esteban and julian de salazar were working at the escorial in 1585 bermudez64 mentions fray martin de palencia as having executed a volume in a fine handwriting and with beautiful miniatures for the monastery of saso thus we see there were numerous miniaturists in spain in the latest years of the existence of the art that had been imported chiefly from italy 63 fr francisco de los santos description breve del monasterio de s lorenzo el real del escorial 24 64 diccionario iv 24 after most of these great choirbooks had been finished there were still others in progress in 1583 giovanni battista scorza of genoa who is celebrated in the galleria of the cavaliero marini was invited by the king to take part in his great choirbook scheme scorza was then thirtysix years of age and in the height of his reputation as a painter of small animals and insects after a little time he returned to genoa where he lived to be ninety years old he had a brother sinibaldo who was equally skilful in miniature and especially in scenes from history the scorzas were pupils of luca cambiaso it may be noticed that all this work in miniature although so late in its own history is accomplished before the greatest names in spanish painting are known josefo ribera was born in 1588 zurbaran in 1598 velasquez in 1599 alonzo cano in 1601 murillo in 1617 this in a sense is the natural course of things as generally illumination has preceded the other kinds of painting with regard to portugal very little is recorded that does not in some way connect itself with spain so we find that antonio and francesco de holanda seemingly of netherlandish origin are mentioned in relation to the books illuminated for the royal monastery of thomar francesco also worked for the monastery of belem francesco de holanda was a great admirer and imitator of clovio but he always insisted that his father antonio was the inventor of the method of stippling as the finishing with minute points of colour is technically called which was brought to such perfection by clovio and his scholars and imitators taken altogether the work of the spanish illuminators at the escorial and those of toledo and seville is really the same with just the variations we might expect from pupils and imitators as that of their masters in genoa rome venice or bruges examples of it may be seen occasionally in diplomas such as are found in the british museum and other public libraries as eg claud b x lansd 189 add 12214 18191 27231 etc in 1572 the same year in which luiz de camoens published his lusiades an accomplished calligrapher miguel barata published an elaborate treatise on his own art then in high repute in the fourteenth century the cancioniero of don pedro affonso ct de barcellos affords an example of the calligraphy for which spain and portugal have always been famous and illumination which is precious for the student it is still in existence in the palace of ajuda its date is 132040 and there are mss in the torre do tombo of lisbon that are richly illuminated again in seville there is the juego de las tablas executed under alphonso the wise in 1283 with its gothic arcades and ornaments m joaquin de vasconcellas has made a study of this ms the miniatures of the torre do tombo of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries are mostly of the french school about 1428 33 was executed a splendid ms entitled leal conselheiro which is attributed to a famous miniaturist in his time named vasco it is however simply a monument of penmanship as it contains no miniatures the ms has been edited by labb roquete in 1842 the portuguese mss of the fifteenth century betray a decided flemish influence as well they may for probably the producers of them were flemings constant intercourse with the court of burgundy had something to do with this the chronica do descobrimento e conquista de guin now at torre do tombo is clearly a flemish work it was begun about 1440 and finished in 1453 the portrait of the enfante don henrique called the navigator is set in a border evidently by a pupil or imitator of j van eyck the calligraphy of the ms is most beautiful this influence of the netherlands on portuguese art is indeed confirmed by the political diplomatic relations of the fifteenth century and is of some importance in the history of art we shall refer again to this matter when dealing with another ms among all the calligraphic monuments of portugal it is claimed that the most splendid is the bible of the hieronymites see revista universal lisbonense 1848 pp 248 this work it is said was a present from the court of rome to emanuel successor of john ii in remembrance of the homage made to the holy see of the first gold brought from the indies but the story is very doubtful the king in bequeathing the seven volumes to the convent of belem says nothing about such an origin they are manifestly in great part the work of foreign artists one wellknown miniaturist antonio de holanda the father of the betterknown francesco took part in the work and having a good conceit of his own abilities we shall probably hear of him again reserved an entire volume to himself in order to give proof of them the seven volumes which then were covered with crimson velvet and silver bosses and enamels are now simply bound in red morocco in the middle of each cover are the arms of emanuel king of portugal vols v and vii have those of dona isabel his spanish wife the initials and ornaments show that the art of italy is freely mixed with that of portugal indeed from the signatures in the volumes it is seen that the work of the penman was italian vol i being written at ferrara by sigismundo de sigismundis the wellknown italian calligrapher in 1495 the second volume also finished in 1495 bears the name of alessandro verazzano another famous copyist who wrote several of the volumes illuminated by attavante vol iii is dated 1496 and is unsigned the next three volumes are also without signature vol vii is the work of antonio de holanda who from his name appears to have been of dutch descent his work is certainly excellent and renders this volume a very precious monument of the art of portugal he was the official herald of the king and he and his son francesco gave their whole time to the practice of illumination his sons memoirs give a most interesting account of his travels and intercourse with giulio clovio and the other italian artists whom he met with in rome65 for some years the hieronymite bible was in paris having been brought thither by marshal junot where it remained unnoticed for several years being called for by the portuguese government louis xviii paid 50000 francs to the family of junot and restored it to the monastery of belem a splendidly illuminated atlas by an illuminator and cartographer named fernando vas dourado was published in the year of his death 1571 65 see my life of clovio as an important example of what we may fairly call native art we will now briefly refer to the celebrated missal of estevam gonalvez neto one of the productions of the busy second half of the sixteenth century the clever amateur who achieved this beautiful series of paintings for paintings they are in addition to the writing and other ornamentation of the ms was descended from a noble family of srem in the parish of macinhata fortythree leagues from lisbon he became canon of viseu and during his leisure after this appointment executed the pontifical missal which bears his name it is dedicated to don jos manuel of the house of tancos bishop of viseu afterwards of coimbra and lastly archbishop of lisbon this prelate gave the book to the church of viseu the original ms was afterwards in the library of the convent of jesus and is now in the academy of sciences at lisbon stephen gonsalvez died july 29th 1627 the missal is signed steph glz abbas sereicencis fac 1610 it has been very well reproduced in colours by macia of paris the genealogies of the house of sandoval written and painted in lisbon in 1612 is now in paris it is called genealogia universal de la nobilissima casa de sandoval ramo del generoso tronco de los soberanos reyes de castilla y leon por don melchior de teves del conseio real de castilla del rey d philippe iii at the foot of the page is written eduardus caldiera vlisspone scripsit anno dni mdcxii this magnificent ms which measures fortysix by thirty centimetres is numbered in the catalogue of the national library as 10015 a grand frontispiece formed of two columns of the composite order occupies the first page representing a king in royal robes and crown arresting the wheel of fortune two lions accompany the scene and the motto of the picture is virtute duce non comite fortuna page 2 contains the various escutcheons of the family of the count of lerma for whom the book was written it contains a great number of portraits a final instance of the influence or rather the inroad of flemish art in portugal in the fifteenth century may be shown in the ms called the portuguese genealogies in the british museum the work consists of eleven large folio sheets separately mounted and measuring eighteen by ten inches it commences with a prologue with the arms of portugal supported by two savages having clubs and shields outside the inner frame are three scenes 1 wild animals in combat 2 a seanymph being rescued 3 a fight among sylvan savages next comes a series of portraits painted in the most finished and lifelike style beginning with dom garcia f del rey abarca and dona constancia on a fruitful tree with foliage fruits and birds a cat and other things the tree is an oak beside it are apple and cherry trees on the oak are green acorns the birds are very beautiful the cat simply perfect these details recall the highly finished and lovely work of georg hoefnagel on the great missal at vienna gothic browngold architecture and three battle scenes complete the page then follow the genealogical tables and more portraits the whole showing the most patient and careful work letters on the borders of the robes recall the same kind of ornament in the grimani breviary at venice no one has been able to explain these curious inscriptions in the grimani breviary they were thought to be either croatian or merely ornament here they cannot well mean anything but decoration the portraits are fanciful but interesting mementoes of the period and include several personages noted in history the last ms to be mentioned in this hasty sketch is one in the british museum stowe 597 it is a missale romanum and is said to have been illuminated for john iii in 1557 it was once the property of the abb gamier chaplain for near thirty years of the french factory at lisbon the binding is red morocco and once had silver clasps it commences with a large mirrorlike oval tablet containing the title set between two pillars of pinkveined marble with bronzegold capitals and bases the tablet is crimson with a violetslate frame moulding of egg and dart pattern at foot are two roman legionaries one seated as supporting the tablet on each side on folio 3 is the index in a rosewood panel and pale green frame the peculiar forms of the frames and the scrollwork on them are of the fantastic kind differing from italian which is characteristic both of spanish and portuguese ornament the chief colours are a bright emerald green and blue with ochre gold and crimson the initials are still more fantasticpartly human partly plant or fishform sometimes sculptured ornament and plantforms combinedbut all so sweetly painted and so delicately finished as to be most attractive the text is a fine and elegant roman minuscule interspersed with italic here and there are exquisite little drawings of ecclesiastical utensils etc but the everlasting variety among the quaint and fanciful initials provides an unwearying fund of interest tiny birds of the loveliest plumage sit among and beneath the limbs of the letters or elegant scrolls of pencilled gold cover the little coloured panels on which the plain gold roman initials are placed some of the larger initials are very finely executed and contain fulllength figures of saints bishops or queens one lovely initial b has a graceful girl simply clad in blue tunic and pale yellow skirt with a silken coil of pale rose forming the upper loop of the letter the lower being formed of the curved body of a green dragon her left hand lifts the silkwork her right hanging by her side holds a little golden pitcher the whole is painted on a panel of bright gold another l shows a peasant rushing laughingly with a hare slung over his shoulder past the figure of a guardian terminus of bronze but the missal should be seen to be properly understood for though in a general way it has a look of italian influence its originality is beyond question chapter xi illumination since the invention of printing the invention of printingits very slight effect on illuminatingpreference by rich patrons for written bookswork produced in various cities in the sixteenth centuryexamples in german italian and other cities and in various public libraries up to the present time the art of printing as the reading world has been frequently informed was invented in the fifteenth century and undoubtedly had to a considerable extent a destructive effect upon the craft of professional copyists but in the fifteenth century the art of the writer and that of the illuminator had long been separate professions there was no particular reason therefore why the invention of printing should interfere with the illuminator as a matter of fact it made little difference nor indeed did printing entirely put a stop to the professional career of the scribe it was prophesied before practical experience of facts proved the contrary that the invention of the railway engine would abolish the horse the printingpress did not abolish the penman but it certainly spoiled his trade we have seen in the course of the preceding chapters that it did not spoil the trade of the illuminator nor was it quite owing to the fact that many printed books were so adorned as to appear like illuminated mss more than one wealthy patron absolutely declined to have anything to do with printed books the matter was too vulgar and too cheap the last duke of urbino was a prince of this lofty way of thinking and scarcely a court in europe but continued to have mss produced as if no such thing as the printingpress were known how they were multiplied in spain and france we have seen in detail we will now proceed to take a farewell look at the german and italian libraries in order to see how the illustrious presses of mainz strassburg augsburg kln munich vienna venice milan florence and rome affected the ateliers of the great schools of illumination established in most of these cities what do we find in point of fact some of the richest most magnificent books ever produced by the illuminator not only whilst the press was still a novelty but long after it had become perfectly familiar to everybody for several of the cities aforesaid we have the means of proof thus for mainz at the end of the superb copy of the mazarine bible now at paris is the following inscription iste liber illuminatus legatus and completus est henricum cremer vicari ecclesie collegiate sancti stephani moguntini sub anno dni melesimo quatring entesimo quinquagesimo sexto festo assumptiois gloriose virginis marie deo gratias alleluya this was in 1456 the year before the first press was set up in 1524 we have two most splendidly illuminated mssa missal and a prayerbookexecuted by order of albert of brandenburg archbishop of mainz two richer examples of the german renaissance cannot easily be imagined we cannot dilate upon them we may however truly say that together with very many other examples of illuminated work both in manuscripts and printed books they show the art of the illuminator to be no less splendid or elaborate after the invention of printing than it was before on the last page of the missal is written ich niklas glockendon zu nurenberg hab dieses bhuch illuminiert ond vollent im jar 1524 the prayerbook is similarly adorned with miniatures and brightly coloured borders on the cover is a copy of the archbishops portrait painted by drer and on folio 1 is written by the archbishop himself anno domini mdxxxi completum est presens opus sabbato post invocavit albertus cardinalis moguntinus manu propria scripsit other glockendon books exist in other libraries then there is the beham prayerbook at aschaffenburg and a bible in the library at wolfenbttel in two thick 4 volumesa work well worth examination at nuremberg is the servicebook executed by conrad frankendorfer of nuremberg in 1498 in the british museum is the fine german msthe splendor sous a sixteenth century ms harl 3469 in the national library at paris is the prayerbook of william of baden 105678 executed at strassburg by frederic brentel in 1647 augsburg was producing illuminated servicebooks ten years after gnther zainer had set up the press in that city munich also with the penitential psalms etc by hans mielich vienna too can show a magnificent missal by georg hoefnagel bearing the dates 1582 to 1590 venice is represented in the work of benedetto bordone and the ducali florence in the splendid missals etc of attavante and his contemporaries milan shows the gorgeous graduals of the brera belonging to the sixteenth century and the sforziadas of london and paris so we might pass from city to city almost all over western europe the great spanish choirbooks were almost all produced under philip ii several papal servicebooks are represented in the fifteenthand sixteenthcentury examples of the scrapbook 21412 of the british museum and the works of clovio the most noted of italian illuminators all belong to the sixteenth century these instances are amply sufficient to prove that in every city in europe where printing was in full practice the art of the illuminator continued to flourish until the progress of modern inventions and various processes added to the general cheapening of books led to its disuse its present application seems to be almost solely to diplomas and testimonials and in point of quality usually as poor and spiritless as the incapacity of most of its professors can make it there seems however no reason why the artistic skill and elaborate methods of reproduction of the present day should not produce magnificent booksindeed the imitation of thomas kempis and other continental examples prove that this is amply possible the next few years will probably show that readers are still desirous of possessing beautiful books and that artists are still
