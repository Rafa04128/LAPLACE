late in and about new york on the subject of the adoption by steamboat proprietors of some apparatus that will in some measure secure the passengers against such casualties as have occurred on board the excelsior and several other boats there have been a great variety of inventions introduced for the purpose of preventing explosions but from the best information we can obtain on the subject we are of the opinion that mr barnums apparatus takes a general preference over all others it consists of an arrangement of machinery partly within the boiler and which is constructed on such a selfregulating principle as to keep up a supply of water within the boiler without any attention from the engineer and in case that the apparatus itself should become impaired or cease to operate regular the engineer becomes instantly notified thereof explanationit is inexpedient for us to give a full and minute description of the several points and peculiarities of the mechanism of this apparatus but we may so far explain as to say that a horizontal lever inside of the boiler being mounted on a pivot near its centre and connected to a buoy or float at one end as represented in the engraving a part of the surface of the boiler being omitted for that purpose and not as some might infer to represent the apparatus attached to a boiler already burst by an explosion one of these floats is placed within a small enclosed box within the boiler that it may be secure from the effect of foam which sometimes pervades the surface of the water in a steam boilerthis lever near its bearing is connected to a short valverod which governs the valves in a small valvechamber whereby the steam is occasionally admitted to operate a small steam engine placed directly over the boiler and this engine puts in motion a pump by which the water in the boiler is replenished this engine it will be understood is never put in operation except when the water in the boiler becomes too low and when the water rises the elevation of the encased float closes the valve and stops the engine the ball on the end of the lever acts as a counterpoise to the float which is of stone that it may be freely influenced by the rising or falling of the surface of the water the small engine constructed by mr barnum for this purpose is well adapted to its place and has several peculiarities whereby the valves and consequent reciprocal motion of the engine are regulated without the use of a crank or flywheel but of these we cannot at present give a minute description the whole of this apparatus evinces much scientific ability of the inventor daniel barnum esq resident at present in this city and who has received many certificates from the first scientific men in the union in commendation of his invention a piggish parvenue a proud porker fancying that it was degrading to his dignity to root in the gutter came upon the sidewalk and full of his consequence promenaded from morning till night leaving his humbler companions to munch corn husks and potatoe parings he fared as people usually do who from vanity assume a station they are not qualified to fill in the gutter he would have lived in unnoticed enjoyment on the walk he got kicked by every passenger and bitten by every cur till hungry and bruised he was glad to return to his proper stationex paper wanting workmen back again the proprietors of the cotton mill in schuylerville n y who reduced the wages of their hands a week or two since says the schuylerville herald twentyfive per cent are now and have been for several days endeavoring to induce them to return to their work at the old wages but they are too late as most of them are engaged to work in other mills hard climbing a man in orange county was found one night climbing an overshot wheel in a fulling mill he was asked what he was doing he said he was trying to go up to bed but some how or other these stairs wont hold still there are many unlucky wights who are laboriously endeavoring to climb fortunes ladder on the same principle power of imagination an amusing incident recently occurred at williams college which is thus related by a correspondent of the springfield gazette the professor of chemistry while administering in the course of his lectures the protoxide of nitrogen or as it is commonly called laughing gas in order to ascertain how great an influence the imagination had in producing the effects consequent on respiring it secretly filled the india rubber gasbag with common air instead of gas it was taken without suspicion and the effects if anything were more powerful than upon those who had really breathed the pure gas one complained that it produced nausea and dizziness another immediately manifested pugilistic propensities and before he could be restrained tore in pieces the coat of one of the bystanders while the third exclaimed this is life i never enjoyed it before the laughter that followed the exposure of this gaseous trick may be imagined true policy under all circumstances there is but one honest course and that is to do right and trust the consequences to divine providence duties are ours events are gods

character is unaffected piety nature may lavish much on her person the enchantment of her countenance the grace of her mind the strength of her intellect yet her loveliness is uncrowned till piety throws around the whole the sweetness and power of its charms she then becomes unearthly in her desires and associations the spell which bound her affections to the things below is broken and she mounts on the silent wings of her fancy and hope to the habitation of god where it is her delight to hold communion with the spirits that have been ransomed from the thraldom of earth and wreathed with a garland of glory her beauty may throw a magical charm over many princes and conquerors may bow with admiration at the shrine of her beauty and love the sons of science may embalm her memory in the page of history yet her piety must be her ornament her pearl her name must be written in the book of life that when the mountains fade away and every memento of earthly greatness is lost in the general wreck of nature it may remain and swell the list of that mighty throng who have been clothed in the mantle of righteousness and their voices attuned to the melody of heaven with such a treasure every lofty gratification on earth may be purchased friendship will be doubly sweet and sorrow will lose their sting and the character will possess a price far above rubies life will be but a pleasant visit to earth and entrance upon a joyful and perpetual home and when the notes of the last trump shall be heard and sleeping millions awake to judgment its possessor shall be presented faultless before the throne of god with exceeding joy and a crown of glory that shall never wear away such is piety like a tender flower planted in the fertile soil of womans heart it grows expanding in its foliage and imparting its fragrance to all around till transplanted and set to bloom in perpetual vigor and unfading beauty in the paradise of god iron ore one of the most valuable beds of iron

creditor shall not interrupt you new inventions lewiss reversible faucet filters highly favorable as our opinion may be of the several excellent filters which have been introduced we cannot avoid giving a preference to the one recently invented by mr s h lewis it consists of a very neat faucet calculated to be attached to a common croton or other hydrant and in connection with the faucet key is a circular chamber three inches in diameter within which is a circular filter consisting of a quantity of cotton cloth flannel sponge or porous porcelain which is preferred compressed between two perforated metallic disks and the faucet key is so constructed that by turning it to the right the water is permitted to flow through the filter in one direction but its course is reversed and it is made to flow in the opposite direction through the filter by turning the key to the left the filter is thus cleansed at pleasure without any trouble on examination of the filter or chamber they may be seen at 28 12 broadway wests cheap and convenient filter for the thousands of families in this city whose houses are not furnished with the croton waterpipes a neat portable filter recently invented by mr n west of this city is as near perfection in convenience and utility as could be furnished for the low price of one dollar and should find a place in every house or shop where the croton water is used it consists of two conical pails one within the other the first is furnished with an efficient filter at the bottom thereof and the other has a faucet by which the water is drawn off as occasion requires they may be found at 156 delancy street improved yoke for oxen this yoke is constructed with sliding blocks attached to the under side of the beam of the yoke near each end and each sliding block is attached to the beam by bolts which pass through mortises so that the blocks may be made to slide occasionally to the right or left to these blocks are attached the bows the position of which are adjusted by gauge screws and by the sliding of the blocks the distance of the oxen from each other may be regulated the middle of the yoke is furnished with a draught staple or eyebolt which is moveable and regulated by a hand screw at the top whereby the pitch of the draught it regulated invented by david chappel and entered at the patent office sept 3d another improvement in stoves messrs hartshorn payson ring entered at the patent office september 3d an improved stove in which they claim the combination of the common wood stove and cylinder coal stove so that the coal may be burned alone and the draught so arranged as at the same time to heat the wood stove with the same heat and if wood alone should be burned then the draught should be so managed and arranged as at the same time to heat the side radiators and coal cylinders a minute description of this improvement is not in this place essential iron shingles we have never been able to understand the reason why iron has so long been neglected as a covering for roofs but are gratified to learn that mr wm beach of troy n y has invented and patented a mode of using cast iron plates for covering roofs they are about one foot square and are made to fit one into another so as to render the roof water tight by applying white lead to the joints it can be afforded at 16 cents the square foot and probably may be so far improved as to cost no more than slate and will be much more permanent and safe we see no difficulty in dispensing with white lead however and making the seams tight without it improvement in the railroad track this improvement was entered sept 5th by john f rogers what he claims is the combination of the balance beam with the centre beam by means of the recesses in the centre beam spring plates having tubes thereon on which the springs rest and attached to the beam by bolts by which a compact and secure connection is formed while all the necessary flexibility is preserved the

the waters of the bayconnected to that ornament of the city the battery by a long bridge this bridge the managers have covered with a roof and thus secured a very eligible and spacious apartment for the exhibition of carriages sleighs carts farming implements and machinery in great variety thence the ingress suddenly opens into view the whole interior creating the most lively and pleasing emotions in the columns of the scientific american we shall endeavor to give those details that will we trust interest our readers and promote the cause of american improvements baths after leaving the bridge the passage way to the interior of the castle is ornamented on both sides with a pleasing display of bathsthe immersion bath made of tin and of iron and these combined with the showering apparatus the shower baths are variously constructed and some of them are of finished workmanship and costly material stebbins patent furniture shower bath presents itself first in the form of a very convenient washstand with all its out fit it is next easily converted into a work stand with equal dispatch it assumes the form of a shower bath furnished with every requisite we regard this as an ingenious piece of furniture that will greatly increase the use of the showerbath and thus add to the health of the community sofa bedsteads much ingenuity has been expended in combining the sofa and bedstead the first that attracted our attention was that manufactured by mr john a robson 30th st and 8th avenue it is on the double cone spring so constructed that using it as a bed does not affect

days information to persons having business to transact at the patent office of models continued from no 2 sec 26 the law requires that the inventor shall deliver a model of his invention or improvement when the same admits of a model the model should he neatly made and as small as a distinct representation of the machine or improvement and its characteristic properties will admit the name of the inventor should be printed or engraved upon or fixed to it in a durable manner models forwarded without a name cannot be entered on record and therefore liable to be lost or mislaid sec 27 when the invention is of a composition of matter the law requires that the application be accompanied with specimens of ingredients and of the composition of matter sufficient in quantity for the purpose of experiment on granting anew lost patents sec 28 the third sec of the act of march 3 1837 provides sec 3 and be it further enacted that whenever it shall appear to the commissioner that any patent was destroyed by the burning of the patent office building on the aforesaid fifteenth day of december or was otherwise lost prior thereto it shall be his duty on application therefor by the patentee or other persons interested therein to issue a new patent for the same invention or discovery bearing the date of the original patent with his certificate thereon that it was made and issued pursuant to the provisions of the third section of this act and shall enter the same of record provided however that before such patent shall be issued the applicant therefor shall deposit in the patent office a duplicate as near as may be of the original model drawings and description with specification of the invention or discovery verified by oath as it shall be required by the commissioner and such patent and copies of such drawings and descriptions duly certified shall be admissible as evidence in any judicial court of the united states and shall protect the rights of the patentee his administrators heirs and assigns to the extent only in which they would have been protected by the original patent and specification proceedings on applications for patents and on appeals from decisions of the commissioner act of 1836 section 7 sec 29 that on the filing of any such application consisting of petition specification model and drawings or specimens and the payment of the duty hereinafter provided the commissioner shall make or cause to be made an examination of the alleged new invention or discovery and if on any such examination it shall not appear to the commissioner that the same had been invented or discovered by any other person in this country prior to the alleged invention or discovery thereof by the applicant or that it had been patented or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country or had been in public use or on sale with the applicants consent or allowance prior to the application if the commissioner shall deem it to be sufficiently useful and important it shall be his duty to issue a patent therefor but whenever on such examination it shall appear to the commissioner that the applicant was not the original and first inventor or discoverer thereof or that any part of that which is claimed as new had before been invented or discovered or patented or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country as aforesaid or that the description is defective and insufficient he shall notify the applicant thereof giving him briefly such information and references as may be useful in judging of the propriety of renewing his application or of altering his specification to embrace only that part of the invention or discovery which is new in every such case if the applicant shall elect to withdraw his application relinquishing his claim to the model he shall be entitled to receive back twenty dollars part of the duty required by this act on filing a notice in writing of such election in the patent office a copy of which certified by the commissioner shall be a sufficient warrant to the treasurer for paying back to the said applicant the said sum of twenty dollars but if the applicant in such case shall persist in his claim for a patent with or without any alteration his specification he shall be required to make oath or affirmation anew in manner as aforesaid and if specification and claim shall not have been so modified as in the opinion of the commissioner shall entitle the applicant to a patent he may appeal to the chief justice of the united states court for the district of columbia who may affirm or reverse the decision of the commissioner of patents in whole or in part and may order a patent to issue or he may have remedy against the decision of the commissioner of patents or the decision of the chief justice of the united states court for the district of columbia by filing a bill in equity in any of the united states courts having jurisdiction as hereinafter explained to be continued consolation for the christian eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for those that love him1 cor ii 9 but it is said in the words following that god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit in this we are not to understand that the excellent things spoken of are communicated to men but that by the aid of the divine spirit they are enabled to receive such sublime and brilliant ideas of the glorious things which are prepared for them that they are filled with sublime and unspeakable joy though they find it utterly impracticable to describe these things to another so as to be understood it is like the new name which no man can know but him to whom it is given and although in the solicitude of those who have been favored with a view of these things to represent them to others the most full and expressive forms of language have been put in requisition it has in every instance failed to convey the least correct idea on the subject because no man can see or in anywise appreciate the excellence of these things without the aid of the spirit of truth but to those who obtain such enlightened viewsand every man may or might obtain themthe glorious things prepared are as the pearl of great price which when a man hath found he is ready to sacrifice all things elseriches honors friends pleasures reputation in the world or even life itselfto obtain it neither adam nor eve in their sinless paradisaical state could have had any correct idea of such delectable and glorious excellence of blessings as are prepared for these who become joint heirs of the son of god through the blood of a crucified saviour for had they been capable of seeing or imagining such things they would never have fallen there can be no question but that the glorious consolation of the faithful and obedient believers will incomparably not to say infinitely excel that of the primitive state of man or anything which could have been by man attained if the blessed son had not suffered let the most brilliant and soaring imagination exert its most strenuous and happy efforts in conceiving arranging and representing to itself the highest possible state of bliss and glory and it will fall as far short of the reality of the immortal state of the glorified saintsthe salvation purchased by the suffering of christas a mere shadow of the most beautiful picture comes short of the rich coloring of the original and this fact is well known to those who have had the beauties of the world to come revealed to them by the divine spirit these statements may appear strange to those who are accustomed to look upon the popular reverend clergy fashionable church members and wealthy deacons as choice specimens of the saints of the lord the true and most favored saints are generally found among those who are subject to poverty and tribulation in this world but these blessings of the gospel are free for all who will conform to the requisitions plainly expressed by our savior and recorded by the evangelist and practicable by all who are willing to forsake all things else for the sake of this great and everlasting salvation a cotton manufacturer in newhaven lost his operatives last week by attempting to reduce their wages the color printing machine illustration introductionthere have appeared in modern times but few machines to which more importance apparently attaches than to the one here presented it is well known that the best paper hangings or roompapers command from 1 to 150 per piece of eight yards while most of those of american manufacture are sold for 25 to 50 cents per piece and this difference is occasioned by the difficulty and extra labor of applying a great variety of different colors but by means of this machine seven twelve or even twenty different colors may be accurately applied by one operation and with less labor than is required to print with a single color by the ordinary method and thus the manufacturer will be enabled to sell for 50 cents such patterns as ordinarily cost a dollar or more to either import or manufacture them explanationthe first row of gear wheels a b are attached to the ends of a row of cylinders each cylinder being 30 inches long and 3 inches in diameter these cylinders support a broad endless apron or belt which passes over the whole series and supports the strip of paper as it passes through the machine to receive the colors the second series of wheels c d are attached to cylinders of the same dimensions of those in the first row and are connected to each other by intervening pinions whereby a uniform velocity is maintained through the whole series the peripheries of this row of cylinders are cut in figures according to the design of the pattern to be worked the figures are left prominent so as to come in contact with the paper upon the apron as the cylinder revolves the surface between the figures being cut away to the depth of one eighth of an inch each of these printing cylinders contains sections of the figures to be printed and is calculated to work a different color from the others and the sections of figures on each cylinder are calculated to match those of the others so as to complete the entire figure in all its colors on the paper the entire machine is put in operation by a band passing over the bandwheel h the third row of cylinders e f are distributing cylinders which are put in motion by mere contact with the series below and receives the several colors from the small cylinders in the upper rows and distributes the same upon the prominent figures of the printing cylinders the fourth series i j are called the receiving cylinders because they receive the colors from the hoppers or reservoirs m n and impart them to the series below the cylinders of the third and fourth rows are covered with cloth and the bottom of each hopper is so nicely fitted to its respective cylinder that but a small quantity of each color which passes through an aperture at the bottom of the hopper adheres to the cloth periphery of the cylinder the colors ordinarily used consist of various pigments ground and mixed in water with a solution of glue the principles of this mode of color printing have been satisfactorily tested though the entire machine has not yet been constructed and any person who may be disposed to construct and enjoy the exclusive use of this invention may have the most favorable terms new inventions a new brick machine messrs culbertson mcmillen co of cincinnati have recently put in successful operation a new machine a description of which is given in a cincinnati paper as follows a frame of fourteen moulds one brick to each is drawn by the power of steam between two press rollers the lower one of which enables the frame to support the pressure of the upper roller and being run through backwards and forwards equalizes the pressure over the entire face of the brick these after undergoing in this mode a pressure of nearly one hundred tons to each brick a pressure which covers clay apparently perfectly dry with a coat of glossy moisture are raised above the surface of the mould by parallel levers and are then delivered over to a bench or table by selfacting machinery whence they are taken in barrows to the stacker at the kiln the dry clay is shoveled into a hopper and if more of the material is pressed into a mould than serves to make a brick a knife which ranges with the surface of the mould shaves off the surplus two hands shoveling two more taking off and one at the barrow constitute a gang of five persons who turn out from 30000 to 35000 per day of ten hours as brick makers days are from sun to sun say twelve working hours per day during the season from 46 to 50000 bricks per day may be made by a single machine this is however by no means the most important feature in the invention in the ordinary mode of making bricks the manufacturer cannot begin operations for the season until the spring has so far advanced that working in wet clay will no longer chill his moulders hands on the same account he loses also morning hours until the advance of summer enables his hands to put in the whole period of daylight he loses also sometimes days togetherfrom the entire stoppage of his operations in the rainy weather which forbids the bricks being put out to dry in making press brick all these difficulties are obviated as a theory operations in this mode can go on throughout the entire winter frost never extending into solid clay but as a practical business it can be conveniently carried on two months earlier and one month later than in the ordinary mode pressed brick made by these machines are also stronger than their competitive article the last of equal hardness in burning always giving way when struck by the pressed bricks as i have witnessed indeed it cannot be otherwise the one being porous and the other as compact as the enormous pressure employed can make it the machine it must be apparent offers peculiar advantages in turning out brick without occupying the ordinary brick yard space necessary for spreading wet brick out to dry it affords great economy in time owing to its operations being independent of frost or rains to every new and thriving place commencing the making of bricks it dispenses with the necessity of bringing skilful workmen from other placesin short it enables every man to be his own brickmaker under these considerations i anticipate an extensive sale of these machines especially for places at a distance marble saw mills we are informed that a large mill for sawing marble is in course of erection at brandon vt the marble in that vicinity is principally of a beautiful white and of a fine texture though not very hard railroad locks it is reported that locks for elevating railroad trains from one level to another are coming into successful use in france it appears to us to be much behind the age since by certain american inventions an ordinary train may be elevated 100 feet in five minutes by the engine alone illustration the vertical propeller we have alluded to this subject in a former number and now present one of the several plans which have been introduced within the present year although we are not fully authorised to give the name of the inventor of this particular plan we have preferred to represent the paddles and crank unconnected with an apparent vessel or section thereof but must require the reader to suppose that the line a b is the level of the railing of the boat and that the crankshaft e projects from the side while the crankpivot governs the motion of the walking bar d e and with it the paddles which are supposed to be just now dipping in the surface of the water it will be understood that the motion of the walking bar being circular and that of the heads of the paddles being vertical and nearly rectilinear the motion of the blades of the paddles must be elliptical inclining to the horizontal and that the position of the paddles is kept so nearly vertical that they will meet with less resistance in entering or leaving the water than those of a common paddle wheel while the atmospheric resistance to be encountered thereby is much less there appears no reasonable doubt that this plan might be made to succeed well on a larger scale though it is very doubtful whether any of the steamboat proprietors can be persuaded to adopt it until it has been more thoroughly tested by experiment a great astronomical discovery a late number of an astronomical journal published at altona near hamburg contains a long article by dr maedler director of the dorpat observatory russia well known to the astronomical world in which he announces the extraordinary discovery of the grand central star or sun about which the universe of stars is revolving our own sun and system among the rest this discovery the result of many years of incessant toil and research has been deduced by a train of reasoning and an examination of facts scarcely to be surpassed in the annals of science he announces his discovery in the following language i therefore pronounce the pleiades to be the central group of that mass of fixed stars limited by the stratum composing the milky way and alcyene as the individual star of this group which among all others combines the greatest probability of being the true central sun by a train of reasoning which i shall not attempt to explain he finds the probable parallax of this great central star to be six thousandths of one second of arc and its distance to be 34 millions of times the distance of the sun or so remote that light with a velocity of 12 millions of miles per minute requires a period of 537 years to pass from the great centre to our sun as a first rough approximation he deduces the period of the revolution of our sun with all its train of planets satellites and comets about the grand centre to be eighteen millions two hundred thousand years ocean steam navigation the ocean steam company which has the patronage of the united states government to the amount of 400000 per annum are getting on rapidly with the first steamship of their line she is to be completed and commence running on the first of march next scientific american new york october 10 1846 employment it is dangerous for a man of superior ability to find himself thrown upon the world without some regular employment the restlessness inherent in genius being thus undirected by any permanent influence frames for itself occupations out of accidents moral integrity sometimes falls a prey to the want of a fixed pursuit and the man who receives his direction in active life from the fortuitous impulse of circumstances will be very apt to receive his principles likewise from chance genius under such guidance attains no noble ends but resembles rather a copious spring conveyed in a falling aqueduct where the waters continually escape through the frequent crevices and waste themselves ineffectually on their passage the law of nature is here as elsewhere binding and no powerful results ever ensue from the trivial exercise of high endowments the finest mind when thus destitute of a fixed purpose passes away without leaving permanent traces of its existence losing its energy by turning aside from its course it becomes as harmless and inefficient as the lightning which of itself irresistible may yet be rendered powerless by a slight

rochester buffalo philadelphia and baltimore the following beautiful extract we find in a recent number of the new york sun it is from the pen of mr c d stuart the able correspondent of that paper now in london on remarking to an englishman that i did not see here in london as at home the artizan the drayman the laborer of every kind with a newspaper in his pocket which at intervals in his toil he could glance at and be as learned in the condition of his country and the world as the man of fortune he repliedno they have something better to do they attend to their work here lies the rub and it may be a fear of the sedition of thought that has put these close hampers upon the english press it would seem by such an argument that the differences of condition are not induced by unholy oppressions by the trampling for ages of one class upon another until servitude became almost a birthrightand the law of strength that proved itself in barbarous times the supremacy had at last from concession so long made become the law of human justice and divine right the steer may work under his yoke an appointed time the slave bow mutely through his whole life but the freemanhas he so fallen

astronomy mercury the nearest planet to the sun is a globe of about 3140 miles in diameter rotating on its axis in 24 hours and 5 12 minutes and revolving round the central luminary at a distance of 37000000 of miles in 88 daysfrom the earth it can only be seen occasionally in the morning or evening as it never rises before or sets after the sun at a greater distance of the time than 1 hour and 50 minutes it appears to the naked eye as a small and brilliant star but when observed through a telescope is horned like the moon because we only see a part of the surface which the sun is illuminating mountains of great height have been observed on the surface of this planet particularly in its lower or southern hemisphere one has been calculated at 10 34 miles in height being about eight times higher in proportion to the bulk of the planet than the loftiest mountains upon earth the matter of mercury is of much greater density than that of the earth equalling lead in weight so that a human being placed upon its surface would be so strongly drawn towards the ground as scarcely to be able to crawl venus is a globe of about 7800 miles in diameter or nearly the size of the earth rotating on its axis in 23 hours 21 minutes and 19 seconds and revolving round the sun at the distance of 68000000 of miles in 225 dayslike mercury it is visible to an observer on the earth only in the morning and evening but for a greater space of time before sunrise and after sunset it appears to us the most brilliant and beautiful of all the planetary and stellar bodies occasionally giving so much light as to produce a sensible shadow observed through a telescope it appears horned on account of our seeing only a part of its luminous surface the illuminating part of venus occasionally presents slight spots it has been ascertained that its surface is very unequal the greatest mountains being in the southern hemisphere as in the case of both mercury and the earth the higher mountains in venus range between 10 and 22 miles in altitude the planet is also enveloped in an atmosphere like that by which animal and vegetable life is supported on earth and it has consequently a twilight venus performs its revolution round the sun in 225 days mercury and venus have been termed the inferior planets as being placed within the orbit of the earth the earth the third planet in order and one of the smaller size though not the smallest is important to us as the theatre on which our race have been placed to live move and have their being it is 7902 miles in mean diameter rotating on its axis in 24 hours at a mean distance of 95000000 of miles from the sun round which it revolves in 365 days 5 hours 50 minutes and 57 seconds as a planet viewed from another of the planets suppose the moon it would present a pretty variegated and sometimes a mottled appearance the distinction between its seas oceans continents and islands would be clearly marked they would appear like brighter and darker spots upon its disc the continents would appear bright and the ocean of a darker hue because water absorbs the greater part of the solar light that falls upon it the level plains excepting perhaps such regions as the arabian deserts of sand would appear of a somewhat darker color than the more elevated and mountainous regions as we find to be the case on the surface of the moon the islands would appear like small bright specks on the darker surface of the ocean and the lakes and mediterranean seas like darker spots or broad streaks intersecting the bright parts or the land by its revolution round its axis successive portions of the surface would be brought into view and present a different aspect from the parts which precededdicks celestial scenery 135 the form of the earth and probably that of every other planet is not strictly spheroidal that is flattened a little at the poles or extremities of the axis the diameter of the earth at the axis is 56 miles less than in the cross direction this peculiarity of the form is a consequence of the rotatory motion as will be afterwards explained illustration latest news late foreign news the steamer hibernia arrived at

assembled 5000 troops to defend the canon pass but on account of the disaffection and insubordination of his officers and men he was constrained to retreat on the approach of a few companies of americans gen taylor had advanced steadily though slowly on monterey and has probably ere this taken possession notwithstanding the strong force and full supply of well mounted cannon concentrated to oppose him should he prove successful in this it would seem that mexico is destined to fall under the protection of the united states whether our government desires it or not what can we do the

the blast furnace in the manufacture of iron by dr j l smith the great difference existing between metallurgical operations of the present day and those of a former period is owing chiefly to the ameliorations produced by the application of the science of chemistry to the modus operandi of the various changes taking place during the operations from their commencement to their termination copper and some other metals are now made to assume forms in the chemists laboratory that formerly required great artistical skill for their productionthe chemist simply making use of such agents and forces as are at his command and over which he has by close analytical study acquired perfect control our object at present is only to advert to the chemical investigations more recently made on the manufacture of iron treating of those changes that occur in the ore coal and flux that are thrown in at the mouth of the furnace and in the air thrown in from below for most that will be said on this subject we are principally indebted to the recent interesting researches of m ebelman the importance of a knowledge of the facts to be brought forward in this article will be apparent to every one in any way acquainted with the manufacture of iron it will be seen that the time is not far distant when the economy in the article of fuel will amount in value to the present profit of many of the works the consequences must be that many of those works that are abandoned will be resumed and others erected in localities formerly thought unfit it is well known that the blast furnace is the first into which the ore is introduced for the purpose of converting it into malleable iron and much therefore depends upon the state in which the pig metal passes from this furnace whether subsequent operations will furnish an iron of the first quality or not in putting the blast furnace into operation the first step is to heat it for some time with coal only after the furnace has arrived at a proper temperature ore fuel and flux are thrown in alternately in small quantities so as to have the three ingredients properly mixed in their descent in from 25 to 48 hours from the time when the ore is first thrown in the entire capacity of the furnace from the tuyer to the mouth is occupied with the ore fuel and flux in their various stages of transformation in order to explain clearly and in as short space as possible what these transformations are and how they are brought about we may consider1 the changes that take place in the descending mass composed of ore fuel and flux 2 the changes that take place in the ascending mass composed of air and its hygrometric moisture thrown in at the tuyer 3 the chemical action going on between the ascending and descending masses 4 the composition of the gases in various parts of the furnace during its operation 5 the causes that render necessary the great heat of the blast furnace 1 changes that take place in the descending mass composed of ore coal and fluxby coal is here meant charcoal when any other species of fuel is alluded to it will be specified in the upper half of the fireroom the materials are subjected to a comparatively low temperature and they lose only the moisture volatile matter hydrogen and carbonic acid that they may contain this change taking place principally in the lower part of the upper half of the fireroom in the lower half of the fireroom the ore is the only material that undergoes a change it being converted wholly or in part into iron or magnetic oxide of ironthe coal is not altered no consumption of it taking place from the mouth down to the commencement of the boshes from the commencement of the boshes down to the tuyer the reduction of the ore is completed very little of the coal is consumed between the boshes and in the upper part of the hearth the principal consumption of it taking place in the immediate neighborhood of the tuyer the fusion of the iron and slag occurs at a short distance above the tuyer and it is in the hearth of the furnace that the iron combines with a portion of coal to form the fusible carburet or pigiron it is also on the hearth that the flux combines with the siliceous and other impurities of the ore this concludes the changes which the ore coal and flux undergo from the mouth of the furnace to the tuyer if the fuel used be wood or partly wood it is during its passage through the upper half of the fireroom that its volatile parts are lost and it becomes converted into charcoal m ebelman ascertained that wood at the depth of ten feet in a fireroom twentysix feet high preserved its appearance after an exposure for 1 34 of an hour and that the mineral mixed with it preserved its moisture at this depth but three and a half feet lower an exposure of 3 14 hours reduced the wood to perfect charcoal and the ore to magnetic oxide the temperature of the upper half of the fireroom when wood is used is lower than in the case of charcoal from the great amount of heat made latent by the vapor arising from the wood in the case of bituminous coal bunsen and playfair find that it has to descend still lower before it is perfectly coked after the wood is completely charred or the coal become coked the subsequent changes are the same that happen in the charcoal furnaces to be continued animalculae in water illustration the fact is generally known that nearly all liquids contain a variety of minute living animals though in some they are too small for observation even with a microscope in others especially in water that has been long stagnant these animals appear not only in hideous forms but with malignant and voracious propensities the print at the head of this article purports to be a microscopic representation of a single drop of such water with the various animals therein and some of the inventors and venders of the various improved filters for the croton water would have no objection to the prevalence of the opinion that this water contains all the variety of monsters represented in this cut but the fact is far otherwise and it is doubtful whether these animals could frequently be detected in the croton water with the best solar microscope nevertheless the fact is readily and clearly established that the croton water contains a quantity of deleterious matter which is arrested by the filters and on this account we cheerfully and heartily recommend the adoption of filters by all who use this water from either the public or private hydrants to this end we would call the special attention of our city readers to

opening of a new section of railroad remarks on the occasion it is really amusing to see the sensation a train of railroad cars produces on all animate beings human and brute for the first few times it passes over a section of road we saw herds of cattle sheep and horses stand for a few seconds and gaze at the passing train then turn and run for a few rods with all possible speed stop and look again with eyes distended and head and ears erect seemingly so frightened at the tramp of the iron horse as to have lost the power of locomotion men women and children also seemed dumbfounded at the strange and unusual spectacle as the cars came rumbling along early in the morning they seemed to bring everybody out of bed all eager to catch a glance as we whirled past old men and women middleaged

editors had exceeded their authority and a majority of the editorial committee resigned and a resolution was passed that the resignation should be published in the eureka but it has not appeared mr

matter for publication in the eureka and on the understanding that they had advanced money they were allowed to have the first use of the reports and advertisements of the association but as they in effect refuse to publish a resolution of great importance to the reputation of all the parties interested it is left for the public to decide whether the acting editors are in any respect entitled to

linkem are not such first cousins as some folks may thinkem we did not expect to mention large peaches again but the louisville journal speaks of a lot which measured nearly twelve inches each in circumference proposition of a new patent law the following remarks and proposition which we copy from the farmer and mechanic was written by a prominent member of the national association of inventors and expresses the sentiments of a large majority of the members of that association no person who carefully examines the subject can fail of seeing that the cause of justice and equity as well as the advance of improvement would be promoted by the substitution of the principles therein expressed in place of some of those embraced in the existing patent laws of the united states we advance the principle which may be novel to some that if the inventor apply genius time toil and capital to produce anything he may consider valuable he has the same right to the exclusive use and enjoyment of it as the man who may apply time and toil and capital without genius that the application of genius does not divest him of any right enjoyed by all others in society it is true the creations of genius are sometimes intangible but that is no objection all rights are abstractions until embodied in constitutions and laws and rendered practical by penalties if an inventor can define the limits of his claim he is entitled to protection in it just the same as when a deed is put on record limiting the boundaries of a lot of ground all rights to real property are traced back to original discovery and occupancy and now all the inventor desires or nearly all in any patent law is a simple registry just as we find in our halls of record the commissioner of patents should be called the register of patents indeed grants of land as they are termed have frequently been registered by the name of patents in our halls of records so strong is the analogy if not perfect similarity then what should be the patent law we answer by sections at once the first should be declaratory of the rights of inventors as follows sec 1 the application of capital time skill and ingenuity to the production of new and useful discoveries shall be protected under the 5th article of the amendments to the constitution which forbids private use without the consent of the owner and for public use without just compensation sec 2 should any invention or discovery be deemed of great importance to the general prosperity its value shall he appraised on the requisition of the secretary of state which value which ascertained as hereinafter provided shall be paid to the inventor from the treasury of the united states and until this payment shall take place the discovery of any inventor duly qualified to take out a patent shall remain his property and inalienable without his consent or the consent of his legal representatives sec 3 any inventor or discoverer who may desire a patent for any discovery of his own shall make oath or solemnly affirm thereto and any specification drawing or model he may see fit to deposit with the register of patents shall be received by him and recorded as a matter of evidence of original right sec 4 there shall be no salaried examiners of patents but each patentee may contract on any terms he may see fit with any patent agent or examiner to examine the records of the patent office on the payment of ten dollars fee for the use of the books and privilege of the patent office and no more fees than this first 10 shall be charged on any single patent excepting five dollars each for every record of transfer of rights or parts of rights nor shall the fees be raised until it may be discovered that they will not support the expenses of the patent office and it is provided no expenses for the improvement of agriculture or any purpose foreign to the business of the registry of patents and the necessary books and buildings and salaries of the register librarian and two clerks and doorkeeper shall be charged upon the patent fund sec 5 the commissioner of patents shall give advice of a scientific and legal character as he may be desired and qualified to do to inventors he may guaranty the originality of any invention at his own risk at any price be may agree upon with any inventor to give certificates thereof and this shall not interfere with his regular salary but it is provided that the commissioner shall not in any manner prevent others from examining and guarantying the originality of any invention for which a patent may be desired and it is also provided that any commissioner register clerk attorney examiner or agent who may give a guaranty or warrant of the novelty of any invention shall be held responsible in costs on any information to be filed by any party who may feel himself aggrieved to rescind the patent which may not be an original invention of the claimant so guarantied sec 6 to rescind a patent any party feeling himself aggrieved may file information in the district court of the united states of the district in which the patentee resides notifying the patentee of such information filed with what the former intends to prove and where the patentee may discover the evidence relied upon by the informer on which the patentee may surrender his patent without costs should he so elect but should the patentee determine to stand trial he shall plead to such information within twenty days denying the allegations of the informer on which the trial shall proceed in its regular order on the calendar and the patentee if found wilfully and knowingly a monopolizer of the public rights shall suffer costs and the reasonable expenses and counsel fee of the informer and if such inventor shall make oath he has not been enabled to examine the proofs on which the informer relies to rescind his patent he shall be allowed such further time as the court having jurisdiction may prescribe and the court may make an order to the informer to exhibit fully his evidence of priority of invention and no other evidence than has been exhibited to the inventor excepting rebutting shall be introduced on the trial to rescind the patent sec 7 the commissioner of patents shall collect and keep in the patent office all the scientific works published and useful for references and pay the expenses of the same from the patent fund but the commissioner shall not subscribe for more than three copies of any publication for the use of the office as aforesaid out of the patent fund sec 8 the application of any known machinery or matter of combination of machinery or matter to new purposes or old purposes after a new method or any means by which useful results are to be more advantageously produced than formerly shall be the subject of a patent sec 9 a method plan design or any new and useful idea which can be defined shall be the subject of a patent sec 10 a simple change of form shall not entitle any one to evade the patent of any inventor by a new patent the above are the principal improvements desired by inventors some think it not well to ask for all they want at once but we think differently for it will be said hereafter when new amendments are desired gentlemen you petitioned for the very provisions you now seek to have annulled your own committee was here at washington assenting what answer will there be to this none can be made without confusion of face for having over assented to a wrong we do not desire to censure the committee charged with the mission to washingtonthey have thought to act prudently and for the greatest good we differ only on the real expediency of the case we do not believe that such men as benton calhoun and other kindred spirits ask or desire anything but what they think is right they will not sacrifice their reputation against a body of men to whom the republic owe so much and who have so long suffered in silence the law as it now stands is an improvement on the former law and considering how low was the state of morals in former times respecting inventors such sentiments as have been advanced by judge woodbury and which are in spirit the same as the above are destined ultimately to prevail and those who choose to record their names in opposition are free to do so as are also the tribe of persecutors who in all ages have stoned the prophets the principle endeavored to be followed throughout is that of the common and statutes laws respecting the rights to real property it may tend to create litigation as to claims which are now refused entirely but if no litigation or less is the grand desideratum why not establish a dictatorship at once the ipse dixit of one man will then prevent all argument but the rights of property and jury trial in all cases are ours by the constitutionand equally are we entitled by the constitution to the pursuit of happiness and wealth in rial regions as on the common earthand if we may not be divested of our other property without certain laws and a fair jury trial why should we be of patent property and if patent agents presume to beguile honest inventors why should they not be held responsible they may refuse to back their operation by a guaranty but then the inventor has a right to know it and to know he has a remedy should they do so improperly the clerk of one of our courts guarantied the searches of one of his clerks as to a piece of real property and had to pay some ten thousand dollars and why should it not be so when a tailor makes a coat he warrants it to fit and when a surgeon sets a leg unscientifically he is also responsible in damages to his patient and as is an attorney for negligent practice holding examiners responsible will leave the patent office open to the filing of new claims at the same time that it will prevent a world of litigation favoritism and corruption we are not striking at our present worthy commissioner mr burke we are friendly to him but the more honest a man may be the sooner will he find himself displaced if the office he holds may be used to grasp a vast amount of patronage

delivered before the london royal institute made an allusion to the formation of a watch and stated that a watch consists of 992 pieces and that 40 trades and probably 215 persons are employed in making one of these little machines the iron of which the balance wheel is formed is valued at something less than a farthing this produces an ounce of steel worth 4 12 pence which is drawn into 2250 yards of steel wire and represents in the market 13l 3s but still another process of hardening this originally a farthings worth of iron renders it workable into 7050 balance springs which will realize at the common price of 2s 6d each 746l 5s the effect of labor alone thus it may be seen that the mere labor bestowed upon one farthings worth of iron gives it the value of 950l 5s or 4552 which is 75680 times its original value mule boats this kind of conveyance is we believe peculiar to the illinois river for we never remember to have seen one belonging to any other stream a year or two since we were perfectly astonished at beholding the first one that ever arrived in this port but now they are as common as the species usually termed broad horns and their appearance creates about as much surprise and curiosity among the more aristocratic order of steam and sail a genuine mule boat is not unlike an ocean steamer as they are susceptible of being propelled both by steam and wind with this difference the muleboat steam is generated upon the treadmill plan and by the united exertions of some half dozen quadrupeds generally of the longeared kind to this treading or pulling apparatus are attached cylinder pittman boilers c in the shape of some three or more cogwheels and immediately connected with them is a couple of shafts which give a rotary motion to a couple of waterwheels one on each side and which usually propel a keel about 100 feet in length and of about 75 tons burthen over it is a roof and covering usually called a cargo box to protect the inside from the weather and the whole making an appearance similar to an ohio river keel boat with the exception of a space left her to operate in the difficulty and danger attending the management of a boat propelled by steam is upon the mule boat entirely dispensed with there is no firing up or blowing up all that is necessary when wishing to commence a journey is to start and when tired of going all that is to be done is to stop the mules in giving a lick ahead they are all made to bounce at once and in giving a lick back they are turned around and made to pull the other way and should the wind prove favorable by means of a mast with which they are all provided sails can be hoisted and the the double power of mules and wind be put in requisition this description of boat is getting to be quite fashionable on the illinois and tributaries and some two or three extend their trips to this city they are a great benefit in low water as they are of exceeding light draught and the running of them is attended with but trifling expense we learn that several new ones are in a state of completion on the line of the illinois intended as regular traders up the sangamon river and from the head of navigation on the illinois to this city there is nothing like enterprise or a mule boat on the illinois in a low stage of water to get alongst louis new era discovery of glass as some merchants says pliny were carrying nitre they stopped near a river which issues from mount carmel as they could not readily find stones to rest their kettles on they used for this purpose some of these pieces of nitre the fire which gradually dissolved the nitre and mixed it with the sand occasioned a transparent matter to flow which in fact was nothing less than glass pumping the water out of lake michigan it is well known to our readers that by an arrangement with the english bond holders the state of illinois has given over to them the unfinished canal from the waters of lake michigan at chicago to the illinois riverthey are about completing it but the principal difficulty now is to supply it with water owing to the level of the lake being eight feet below the bottom of the canal to overcome this the present company after various propositions finally bethought themselves of raising the water of the lake so as to supply the canal they went to messrs knapp totten of this city and furnished them with a data to calculate whether it could be done and what force and what machinery would accomplish it these gentlemen soon furnished an answer to build some powerful machinery for that purposea steam engine and eight pumps of four and a half bore and six feet stroke we are glad to hear that this eminently scientific firm have been selected to execute this order their shop and mechanical force are not excelled by any establishment in the united statespittsburg gaz the selfregulating ventilator illustration explanationthis is a cheap and simple but scientific apparatus for regulating the airvent of a common cheap stove according to the temperature of the atmosphere in the room in which it is located the draught door is a plain iron door hung by a common hinge joint at the upper end and to the front of the hinge is attached a piece of brass wire which extends vertically nearly to the top of the room and is connected at b to a horizontal brass wire c d this is the only apparatus required but must be so adjusted as to allow the door to be closed or nearly so when the temperature is about right if the temperature rises above that point the horizontal wire will immediately expand so as to allow the door to close but as soon as the temperature begins to fail the wire contracts and opens the vent on this principle the apparatus will readily find a medium and there remain varying only occasionally to accommodate itself to the variations of the quantity of fuel in the stove the entire expense of this apparatus exclusive of the stove will not exceed 50 cents it is generally conceded that a large portion of cases of colds coughs c are occasioned by irregularities of the temperature of sittingrooms but with this plan of regulation this evil may be avoided

prices ornamental kites illustration this month being considered as one of the best for flying kites we may indulge our young friends with an article on that subject the principle on which kites are made to ascend by the action of the wind is too well understood even by children to require explanation we shall merely introduce and describe some fancy models of kites which are not often seen the pattern fig 1 which is the figure called a star is very easily made the frame consists simply of the strips or rods of light wood spruce timber willow twigsand interlocked as shown in the cut so that each rod shall pass alternately over and under the other rods at each intersection these rods being lashed together at the points the whole frame is covered with white or yellow paper and the twine is attached to three of the angles of the star the eagle fig 2 is but little more difficult a rod extends from the beak to the tail and is crossed by another which extends from tip to tip of the wings the rods being lashed together a small thread is drawn from the place of the head of the eagle to the two extremities of the wings and thence to the leeward end of the centre rod this thread should be white or light blue and will not be visible when aloft but the form of the eagle should be made of black dark or brown paper the paper eagle must be sewed to the several threads and two or more threads may extend from the wings to the centre rod to support the feathers of the wings the eagle kite appears curious but is not so elegant as the rose fig 3 to construct this figure there must be four light rods of wood made to cross each other in the centre being there lashed together and thus constituting eight arms from the end of each arm a thin strip of light wood or reed is bent in a curved form to the next arm on either side the bow being lashed to the arms this frame is covered with white paper which is to be afterward colored with rose color with the yellow centre the twine must be fastened to four of the arms and the tail of the kite should be covered with green paper which by the contrast will have a pleasing effect rochester edge tools in england some time since a mr ash an extensive manufacturer of mechanics tools at sheffield england sent to this country for patterns of the latest improvements and amongst the rest ordered a variety from messrs barton belden of rochester which were promptly forwarded on their arrival there it seems that their make gave such universal satisfaction that they were immediately copied and the fact that they came from this country made prominent by stamping upon them rochester pattern an animal curiosity travellers state that there is on the island of st luce a cavern in which is a large basin twelve or fifteen feet deep at the bottom of which are rocks from these rocks proceed certain substances that present at first sight beautiful flowers but on the approach of a hand or instrument retire like a snail out of sight on examination there appears in the middle of a disk filaments resembling spiders legs which moved briskly round a kind of petal the filaments or legs have pincers to seize their prey when the petals close so that it cannot escape under this flower is the body of an animal and it is probable he lives on the marine insects thrown by the sea into his basin the first clock that ever measured time was made for the caliph of bagdad this art was afterwards lost for several centuries skate runners at drontheim in norway they have a regiment of soldiers called skate runners they wear leg gaiters for travelling in deep snow and green uniform they carry a short sword a rifle fastened by a broad strap passing over the shoulder and a climbing staff seven feet long with a spike in the end they move so fast in the snow that no cavalry can overtake them and it does little good to fire cannon balls at them as they go two or three hundred feet apart they are very useful soldiers in following an enemy on a march they go over marshes rivers and lakes at a great rate a receipt to make peach wine take four or five bushels of ripe juicy peaches mash or bruise them in a tub and pour them into a barrel large enough to contain them and place it in a cool place at the bottom of the barrel before putting in the peaches some clean straw must be placed to prevent the pumice from filling up the spigot the head of the barrel must be covered in about three days the peach wine is ready for use draw it off from the spigot and if care and attention have been adopted a delicious beverage will be produced a
