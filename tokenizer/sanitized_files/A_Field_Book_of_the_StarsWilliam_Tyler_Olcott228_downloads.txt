america introduction considering the ease with which a knowledge of the constellations can be acquired it seems a remarkable fact that so few are conversant with these timehonored configurations of the heavens aside from a knowledge of the dipper and the pleiades the constellations to the vast majority are utterly unknown to facilitate and popularize if possible this fascinating recreation of stargazing the author has designed this fieldbook it is limited in scope solely to that purpose and all matter of a technical or theoretical nature has been omitted the endeavor has been to include in these pages only such matter as the reader can observe with the naked eye or an operaglass simplicity and brevity have been aimed at the main idea being that whatever is bulky or verbose is a hindrance rather than a help when actually engaged in the observation of the heavens the constellations embraced in this manual are only those visible from the average latitude of the new england and middle states and owe their place in the particular season in which they are found to the fact that in that season they are favorably situated for observation with this brief explanatory note of the purpose and design of the book the author proceeds to outline the scheme of study scheme of study the table of contents shows the scheme of study to be pursued and to facilitate the work it is desirable that the student follow the therein circumscribed order a knowledge on the part of the reader of ursa major or the dipper as it is commonly called and the pleiades the wellknown group in taurus is presupposed by the author with this knowledge as a basis the student is enabled in any season to take up the study of the constellations by following out the order dictated he will in a few nights of observation be enabled to identify the various configurations making up the several constellations that are set apart for study in that particular season a large plate showing the appearance of the heavens at a designated time on the first night of the quarter is inserted before each seasons work this should be consulted by the student before he makes an observation in order that he may obtain a comprehensive idea of the relative position of the constellations and also know in what part of the heavens to locate the constellation which he wishes to identify a knowledge of one constellation enables the student to determine the position of the next in order in this work the identification of each constellation depends on a knowledge of what precedes always bearing in mind the fact that each season starts as a new and distinct part to be taken by itself and has no bearing on that which comes before contents page introduction iii scheme of study v the constellations of

constellations as they appear at 9 oclock pm in midseason to facilitate finding and observing the constellations the student should face in the direction indicated in the text this applies to all constellations excepting those near the zenith the four large plates are so arranged that the observer is supposed to be looking at the southern skies by turning the plate about from left to right the eastern northern and western skies are shown successively on many of the diagrams the position of nebul is indicated these are designated by the initial letter of the astronomer who catalogued them preceded by his catalogue number as for instance 8 m signifies nebula number 8 in messiers catalogue the magnitudes assigned to the stars in the diagrams are derived from the harvard photometry when a star is midway between two magnitudes the numeral is underlined thus 2 indicates a star of magnitude 25 if a stars magnitude is between 1 and 15 it is regarded as a firstmagnitude star if it lies between 15 and 2 it is designated second magnitude the constellations of spring illustration map showing the principal stars visible from lat 40 n at 9 oclock april 1st ursa major ersa majorthe great bear face north locationursa major is probably the best known of the constellations and in this work i presuppose that the reader is familiar with its position in the heavens it is one of the most noted and conspicuous constellations in the northern hemisphere and is readily and unmistakably distinguished from all others by means of a remarkable cluster of seven bright stars in the northern heavens forming what is familiarly termed the dipper the stars a and b are called the pointers because they always point toward the pole star 28 distant from a alioth is very nearly opposite shedir in cassiopeia and at an equal distance from the pole the same can be said of megres in ursa major and caph in cassiopeia the star o is at the tip of the bears nose a clearly defined semicircle begins at o and ends in the pair i and k at the extremity of the bears right fore paw this group of stars resembles a sickle note little alcor close to mizar this star was used by the arabs as a test of good eyesight mizar and alcor are known as the horse and his rider this plate shows the bear lying on his back his feet projected up the sky three conspicuous pairs of stars represent three of his four feet the chaldean shepherds and the iroquois indians gave to this constellation the same name the egyptians called it the thigh a and are moving through space in a contrary direction to the remaining five stars in the dipper illustration ursa major ursa minor ersa minorthe little bear face north locationthe two pointer stars in ursa major indicate the position of polaris the north star which represents the tip of the tail of the little bear and the end of the handle of the little dipper in all ages of the world ursa minor has been more universally observed and more carefully noticed than any other constellation on account of the importance of the north star polaris is a little more than 1 from the true pole its light takes fifty years to reach us a line joining b cassiopei and megres in ursa major will pass through polaris at the distance of the nearest fixed star our sun would shine as a star no brighter than polaris which is presumably about the suns size polaris revolves around the true pole once in twentyfour hours in a little circle 2 in diameter within this circle two hundred stars have been photographed the north star is always elevated as many degrees above the horizon as the observer is north of the equator compare the light of the four stars forming the bowl of the little dipper as they are each of a different magnitude a standard firstmagnitude star is 2 times brighter than a standard second magnitude star etc illustration ursa minor gemini jeminithe twins face west locationa line drawn from b to k urs majoris and prolonged an equal distance ends near castor in gemini gemini is characterized by two nearly parallel rows of stars the northern row if extended would reach taurus the southern one orion note the fine cluster 35 m herschel discovered uranus in 1781 a short distance southwest of it two wonderful streams of little stars run parallel northwest on each side of the cluster where the ecliptic crosses the solstitial colure is the spot where the sun appears to be when it is farthest north of the equator june 21st castor is a fine double for a telescope and pollux has three little attendant stars an isoceles triangle is formed by castor aldebaran in taurus and capella in auriga there is a record of an occultation in gemini noted about the middle of the fourth century bc the arabs saw in this group of stars two peacocks the egyptians two sprouting plants and the hindus twin deities while in the buddhist zodiac they represented a woman holding a golden cord since classic times however the figure has always been that of human twins at the point indicated near th a new star was discovered by enebo in march 1912 it attained a maximum of about magnitude 35 and has at this writing waned to the eleventh magnitude illustration gemini auriga rigathe charioteer face northwest locationa line drawn from d to a urs majoris and prolonged about 45 ends near the bright capella in auriga a star of the first magnitude and one of the most brilliant in the heavens it is unmistakable having no rival in brightness near it auriga is a beautiful and conspicuous constellation it is characterized by a clearly defined pentagon note the three fourthmagnitude stars near capella known as the kids the star b is common to auriga and taurus being the formers right foot and the latters northern horn the field within the pentagon is particularly rich in clusters capella forms a rude square with polaris e cassiopei and o urs majoris and forms an equilateral triangle with betelgeuze in orion and the pleiades in taurus a line from th to a aurig prolonged about 20 ends near a persei capella is visible at some hour of every clear night throughout the year of the firstmagnitude stars it is nearest to the pole and it rises almost exactly in the northeast to the arabs capella was the driver because it seemed to rise earlier than the other stars and so apparently watched over them or still more practically as the singer who rode before the procession cheering on the camels which last were represented by the pleiades illustration auriga cancer kanserthe crab face west locationcancer lies between gemini and leo a line drawn from nath in auriga to pollux in gemini and prolonged about 15 ends in prsepe the manger the great star cluster in cancer which is also called the bee hive it contains 300 stars the stars g and d are called the asellithe asss colts feeding from the silver manger the star b lies about 10 northeast of procyon acubens a lies on the same line the same distance beyond b these two stars form the tips of the inverted y which distinguishes cancer an imaginary line from capella through pollux will point out acubens close to it are two faint stars the bee hive lies within an irregular square formed by g d and th and looks like a nebula to the naked eye in june 1895 all the planets except neptune were in this quarter of the heavens and halleys comet was in this constellation on its first appearance in 1531 the dimness of g and d is an infallible precursor of rain and if the bee hive is not visible in a clear sky it is a presage of a violent storm illustration cancer hydra hidrathe seaserpent face south and southwest locationthe head of hydra a striking and beautiful arrangement of stars lies just below the bee hive in cancer 6 south of acubens in that constellation and forms a rhomboidal figure of five stars hydra is about 100 in length and reaches almost from canis minor to libra its stars are all faint except alphard or the hydras heart a secondmagnitude star remarkable for its lonely situation southwest of regulus in leo a line drawn from g leonis through regulus points it out it is of a rich orange tint castor and pollux in gemini point southeast to it the constellations crater the cup and corvus the crow both stand on the coils of hydra south of denebola the bright star in the tail of the lion hydra is supposed to be the snake shown on a uranographic stone from the euphrates 1200 bc the little asterism sextans the sextant lies in the region between regulus and alphard it contains no stars brighter than the fourth magnitude illustration hydra leo leothe lion face south locationa line drawn from pollux in gemini to g in cancer and prolonged about 12 strikes regulus the brilliant star in the heart of the lion regulus lies about 9 east of acubens in cancer and about 12 northeast of alphard in the heart of hydra leo is one of the most beautiful constellations in the zodiac it lies south of the great bear and its principal stars are arranged in the form of a sickle which nearly outlines the lions head this group is so striking as to be unmistakable regulus is in the handle of the sickle it is one of the stars from which longitude is reckoned lies almost exactly on the ecliptic and is visible for eight months in the year denebola the bright star in the lions tail lies 25 east of regulus and about 35 west of arcturus in botes it is the same distance northwest of spica in virgo and forms with spica and arcturus a large equilateral triangle z is double and has three faint companion stars e has two seventhmagnitude companion stars forming a beautiful little triangle regulus is white in color g yellow p red g is a beautiful colored telescopic double star and has a companion visible in an operaglass the figure of leo very much as we now have it appears in all the indian and egyptian zodiacs illustration leo the sickle coma berenices koma berenisezberenices hair locationa line drawn from regulus to zosma in leo and prolonged an equal distance strikes this fine cluster which is 18 northeast of zosma d leonis the group lies well within a triangle formed by denebola arcturus in botes and cor caroli in canes venatici which triangle is the upper half of the diamond of virgo twenty or thirty stars in this group can be counted with an operaglass and the group can be easily distinguished with the naked eye when the moon is not visible the first half of the month of april can be called the most brilliant sidereal period of the year at this time eleven firstmagnitude stars are visible in this latitude at 9 pm from east to west they are vega arcturus spica regulus pollux procyon sirius capella aldebaran betelgeuze and rigel truly a glorious company an incomparable sight illustration coma berenices canis minor kanis minorthe lesser dog face west locationprocyon the little dog star lies about 23 south of pollux in gemini a line drawn from nath in auriga to alhena in gemini and prolonged about 18 reaches procyon procyon is equidistant from betelgeuze in orion and sirius in canis major and forms with them an equilateral triangle it forms a large rightangled triangle with pollux and betelgeuze the light from procyon is golden yellow four degrees northwest of it is the thirdmagnitude star gomeisa the glass shows two small stars forming a rightangled triangle with it procyon was distinctly mentioned by ptolemy it rises in this latitude a little north of east about half an hour before sirius the dog star hence it was called procyon from two greek words which signify before the dog procyon is one of our nearest neighbors in space at a distance of ten light years and is attended by a very faint companion which is only visible in the largest telescopes illustration canis minor corvus krvusthe crow face south locationa line drawn from the bee hive in cancer through regulus in leo and prolonged about 40 ends near the conspicuous quadrilateral which distinguishes corvus the brightest star in this region of the sky is spica in virgo it lies about 10 northeast of algorab z is a double star for an operaglass a faint pair of stars lie close below and to the west of b the crow is represented as standing on and pecking at the coils of hydra the star al chiba is in the crows bill corvus was known as the raven in chaucers time d is an interesting telescopic double a line drawn from g to b corvi and prolonged twice its length locates the thirdmagnitude star i centauri in the right shoulder of the centaur the brightest stars in this constellation are not visible in this latitude illustration corvus crater kraterthe cup face south locationcrater is situated 15 west of corvus and due south of th leonis it is easily distinguished by reason of a beautiful and very striking semicircle of six stars of the fourth magnitude forming the bowl of the cup the constellation resembles a goblet with its base resting on the coils of hydra the star alkes is common to hydra and crater and may be seen 24 southeast of alphard in the heart of hydra it is distinguished by its forming an equilateral triangle with a and g stars of the same magnitude 6 south and east of it corvus and crater are to be seen halfway up the southern sky during the early evenings in spring d is now the lucida crater is situated at about the centre of hydra and is on the meridian april 26th owing to its many faint stars it is best seen on a clear moonless night the zodiacal light is well worth observing at this season of the year it is to be seen in the western sky shortly after sundown and is most intense during the

10slightly south of that is above the line from a to polaris is giansar l in the tip of the dragons tail above l and almost in line with it are two more stars in draco which form with two stars in ursa major a quadrilateral see diagram draco now curves sharply eastward coiling about the little bear as shown then turns abruptly southerly ending in a characteristic and clearly defined group of four stars forming an irregular square representing the dragons head this group is almost overhead in the early evening in summer the star in the heel of hercules lies just south of the dragons head the brilliant vega will be seen about overhead 12 southwest of the dragons head eltanin one of the dragons eyes is noted for its connection with the discovery of the law of aberration of light it is of an orange hue while the star b near it is white note thuban once the pole star at one corner of a quadrilateral that draco forms with ursa major thuban could be seen by day or night from the bottom of the central passage of several of the pyramids in egypt the rising of eltanin was visible about thirtyfive hundred years bc through the central passages of the temples of hathor at denderah the egyptians called draco the hippopotamus vega and the four stars in the dragons head offer an opportunity to compare the first five stellar magnitudes with which all should be familiar illustration draco lyra lirathe lyre locationlyra may be easily distinguished because of the brilliant vega its brightest star which is situated about 12 southwest of the dragons head it is unmistakable as it is the brightest star in this region of the heavens and the third brightest in this latitude in july and august vega is close to the zenith in the early evening the six bright stars in lyra form an equilateral triangle on one corner of a rhomboid a very characteristic figure e is a pretty double for an operaglass and a 3 glass reveals the duplicity of each star of this pair e is therefore a double double z is a double for a good glass b is a variable changing from magnitude 34 to 44 in twelve days at its brightest it is about equal to its near neighbor g lyr the noted ring nebula lies between b and g a 3 glass reveals it but a powerful telescope is required to render its details visible if the distance from the earth to the sun equalled one inch the distance from the earth to vega would be 158 miles vega was the first star to be photographed in 1850 it is visible at some hour every clear night and has been called the arclight of the sky its light has the bluishwhite hue that suggests a diamond in the sky the spectroscope reveals that vega is a star probably only in its infancy as hydrogen is its predominating element illustration lyra cygnus signusthe swan or the northern cross locationdeneb the brightest star in cygnus is at the top of the cross and a little over 20 east of vega it forms a triangle with vega and altair in aquilaaltair being at the apex about 35 from deneb and vega b cygni is at the base of the cross and a line drawn from vega to altair nearly touches it it is a beautiful colored double for a small telescope note 61 one of the nearest stars to us it was the first star whose distance was measured by bessel in 1838 it is a double star and 104 light years distant the cross is nearly perfect and easily traced out it lies almost wholly in the milky way note the coal sack one of the dark gap in the milky way cygnus contains an unusual number of deeply colored stars and variable stars o cygni has a sixthmagnitude companion and g is in the midst of a beautiful stream of faint stars this region is perhaps richer than any similar extent in the heavens an operaglass will reveal many of its beauties herschel counted 331000 stars in an area of only 5 in cygnus illustration cygnus aquila akwilthe eagle and antinos face southeast locationhalfway up the sky in the milky way you will see three stars in a line the middle one much brighter than the other two this bright star is altair in aquila it forms with vega and deneb an isosceles triangle altair is at the apex about 35 from the other two a triangle is formed by vega altair and ras alhague in the serpent bearer which is about 30 west of altair this is a double constellation composed of aquila and antinos altair is in the neck of the eagle alschain in the head of antinos when the moon is absent a rude arrowhead can be traced out embracing almost all the stars in aquila is an interesting variable star changing from magnitude 35 to 47 and back again within a period of 7 days 4 hours 12 minutes altair rises about 8 north of the exact eastern point on the horizon in ad 389 a wonderful temporary star flashed out near altair that equalled venus in brightness and vanished within three weeks time illustration aquila antinos delphinus delfinusthe dolphin or jobs coffin face southeast locationthe little cluster of five stars forming delphinus is to be seen about 10 northeast of altair and though there are no bright stars in the group it can hardly escape notice a line drawn from vega to albireo and prolonged about 20 strikes the star e in the tail of the dolphin the four other stars of prominence in the constellation are a little above e and form a diamondshaped figure the little asterisms sagitta the arrow and vulpecula and anser the fox and goose are shown just above delphinus delphinus is also called jobs coffin the origin of this appellation is unknown in greece delphinus was the sacred fish the sky emblem of philanthropy the arabs called it the riding camel the star g delphini is a fine double for a small telescope with a marked and beautiful contrast of colors the names for a and b reversed spell nicolaus venator the latinized name of the assistant to the astronomer piazzi illustration delphinus sagittarius sajitariusthe archer face south locationa line drawn from deneb in cygnus to altair in aquila and prolonged an equal distance terminates in sagittarius about 10 east of its distinguishing characteristic the milk dipper sagittarius is one of the signs of the zodiac and lies between capricornus on the east and scorpius on the west the bow is easily traced out g marks the arrows tip note the star m which serves to point out the winter solstice where the solstitial colure intersects the ecliptic on a clear night the pretty cluster known as corona australis the southern crown can be seen about 10 below the bowl of the milk dipper its lucida the fourthmagnitude star alfecca meridiana culminates at 9 pm august 13th sagittarius is about due south in a splendid position for observation during the month of july between the hours of ninethirty and eleven oclock pm observe with an operaglass the fine clusters 20 m and 8 m also an almost circular black void near the stars g and d and to the east of this spot another of narrow crescent form the stars ph and z in the milk dipper are moving in opposite directions future generations therefore will not have this timehonored figure to guide them in locating the archer in their summer night skies illustration sagittarius ophiuchus ofiukusthe serpent bearer and serpens face southwest locationa line drawn from e delphini to g aquil prolonged about 30 strikes the star ras alhague the brightest star in the constellation and the head of ophiuchus it is at one angle of an isosceles triangle of which altair is at the apex and vega the third angle two constellations are here combined ophiuchus is represented as an old man holding in his hands a writhing serpent ras algethi marking the head of hercules lies just west of ras alhague equally distant southeast and southwest of ras alhague are to be seen two stars close together representing the shoulders of ophiuchus his foot rests on the scorpion just above antares the head of serpens is the star group in the form of an x just below the crown 1604 indicates the spot where in that year a famous temporary star appeared called keplers star note the asterism the bull of poniatowski just east of g the star marked 70 is one of the most distant stars for which a parallax has been obtained its distance from the earth 1300000 radii of the earths orbit or 120 quadrillion miles there is something remarkable in the central position of this gigantic figure it is situated almost exactly in the midheavens being nearly equidistant from the poles and midway between the vernal and autumnal equinoxes illustration ophiuchus serpens scorpius skrpiusthe scorpion face south locationscorpius one of the signs of the zodiac is a beautiful star group and one that is easily traced out it lies just under the serpent bearer between sagittarius and libra the resemblance to a scorpion is not difficult to see hence this constellation is perhaps the most aptly named of any the ruddy star antares the brightest star in the constellation is in the heart of the scorpion it lies about 40 southwest of ras alhague in ophiuchus and a little over 20 west of the bow of sagittarius the fact that it is the most brilliant star in this region of the sky renders its identity unmistakable it is one of the reddest stars in the firmament there are several star clusters and double stars to be seen in this constellation their position is indicated in the diagram the curved tail of the scorpion is very conspicuous l and y are a striking pair and the fine clusters above them can be seen with the naked eye a record of a lunar occultation of b scorpii in 295 bc is extant note a pair just below b they are known as 1 and 2 in this region of the sky have appeared many of the brilliant temporary stars the first one in astronomical annals being discovered in 134 bc scorpius is mentioned by all the early writers on astronomy and is supposed to be so named because in egypt it was a sickly time of the year when the sun entered this sign illustration scorpius libra librathe scales face southwest locationlibra is one of the signs of the zodiac and lies between virgo and scorpius its two chief stars a and b may be recognized west of and above the head of the scorpion the star i libr is about 20 northwest of antares in the scorpion spica in virgo a star of the first magnitude is a little over 20 northwest of a libr a quadrilateral is formed by the stars a b g e which characterizes the constellation the star a libr looks elongated an operaglass shows that it has a fifthmagnitude companion b is a pale green star its color is very unusual lyra corona and hercules are almost directly overhead in the early evening during july and august and can best be observed in a reclining position thus placed with an operaglass to assist the vision you may study to the best advantage the wonderful sight spread out before you and search depths only measured by the power of your glass when the sun enters the sign libra the days and nights are equal all over the world and seem to observe a certain equilibrium like a balance hence the name of the constellation illustration libra corona borealis koron borealisthe northern crown locationa line drawn from a cygni to a lyr and projected a little over 40 terminates in the crown which lies between hercules and botes and just above the diamondshaped group of stars in the head of the serpent the characteristic semicircle resembling a crown is easily traced out the principal stars are of the fourth magnitude excepting gemma which is a secondmagnitude star and known as the pearl of the crown gemma sometimes called alphacca forms with the stars seginus and arcturus in botes an isosceles triangle the vertex of which is at arcturus close to e a famous temporary appeared suddenly may 12 1866 as a secondmagnitude star it was known as the blaze star and was visible to the naked eye only eight days fading at that time to a tenthmagnitude star and then rising to an eighthmagnitude where it still remains the native australians called this constellation the boomerang to the hebrews it was ataroth and by this name it is known in the east today no two of the seven stars composing the crown are moving in the same direction or at the same rate a coron is seventyeight light years distant and sixty times brighter than the sun illustration corona borealis hercules herkulezthe kneeler locationa line drawn from either vega in lyra or altair

sun is bearing the earth and planets at the rate of twelve miles a second or 373 million miles a year on a clear night the asterism cerberus the threeheaded dog which hercules holds in his hand can be seen this constellation is said to have been an object of worship in phoenicia there is a good deal of mystery about its origin the ancient greeks called it the phantom and the man upon his knees the stars e z and p form a keystone shaped figure that serves to identify the constellation illustration hercules botes bootezthe herdsman or bear driver face west locationbotes lies just west of the crown and east of cor caroli it may be easily distinguished by the position and splendor of its principal star arcturus which shines with a golden yellow lustre it is about 35 east of denebola in leo and nearly as far north of spica in virgo and forms with these two a large equilateral triangle a line drawn from z to urs majoris and prolonged about 30 locates it as does one from d herculis to g coron prolonged its length the brightest stars in botes outline a characteristic kiteshaped figure arcturus is mentioned in the book of job and is often referred to as the star of job three stars of

wolves by the arabians th i k and l the whelps of the hyenas they knew the constellation as the vociferator arcturus is the fourth brightest star in the northern hemisphere it is 1000 times the size of our sun and rushes through space toward virgo at the astounding rate of ninety miles a second it is forty light years distant the ancient greeks called this constellation lycaon a name which signifies a wolf the hebrew name for it was the barking dog illustration botes virgo vergothe virgin face west locationan imaginary line drawn from antares in scorpius through a libr and prolonged a

distance from polaris as ursa major and about midway between polaris and the zenith in the milky way cassiopeia is characterized by a zigzag row of stars which form a rude w but in midautumn to an observer facing north the w appears more like an m and is almost overhead note the spot marked 1572 this is where a very famous temporary star appeared in that year it was bright enough at one time to be seen in full sunshine the star is sixteen light years distant caph is equidistant from the pole and exactly opposite the star megres in ursa major with a andromed and g pegasi it marks the equinoctial colure these stars are known as the three guides the chair can be readily traced out b a and g mark three of the four corners of the back and d and e one of the front legs the word bagdei

of this constellation through an operaglass will repay the observer cepheus is characterized by a rude square one side of which is the base of an isosceles triangle look for the socalled garnet star m probably the reddest star visible to the naked eye in the united states the star z has a blue companion star a forms an equilateral triangle with polaris and e cassiopei it is claimed that cepheus was known to the chaldans twentythree centuries before our era surrounding d e z and l which mark the kings head is a vacant space in the milky way similar to the coal sack of cygnus about 4 from g in the direction of k is a pretty pair of sixthmagnitude stars owing to precession g b and a cephei will be successively the pole star in 4500 6000 and 7500 ad respectively d is a double whose components are yellow and blue it is an interesting variable changing from magnitude 37 to 49 at intervals of 5 days 8 hours 47 minutes as it is three times as bright at maximum as at minimum and can be observed with the naked eye its variations are well worth observing illustration cepheus pegasus pegasusthe winged horse face south locationone corner of the great square is found by drawing a line from polaris to cassiopeia and prolonging it an equal distance the great square is a stellar landmark three of the corners of the square are marked by stars in pegasus the fourth and northeastern corner is marked by the star alpheratz in andromeda each side of the square is about 18 long the horse is generally seen upside down with his fore feet projected up into the sky only the head neck and fore feet are represented the star enif marks the nose p is an interesting double easily seen in an operaglass all the stars of the square are approaching us at an inconceivable speed the position of the

algol the famous variable lines connecting the stars g andromed algol and a persei form a rightangled triangle the right angle is marked by algol the chief object of interest in this constellation is the great nebula the first to be discovered it can be seen by the naked eye and it is a fine sight in an operaglass its location is indicated in the diagram the star g is the radiant point of the bielid meteors looked for in november it is a colored double visible in a 3 glass the great nebula has been called the queen of the nebul it is said to have been known as far back as ad 905 and it was described 986 ad as the little cloud andromeda is very favorable for observation in september low in the eastern sky note the characteristic y shaped asterism known as gloria frederika or frederiks

length points it out illustration andromeda perseus persusthe champion face northeast locationa persei lies on a line drawn from b to g andromed and is about 9 from the latter the most striking feature in perseus is the socalled segment of perseus a curve of stars beginning about 12 below cassiopeia and curving toward ursa major note the famous variable algol the demon star it represents the medusas head which perseus holds in his hand it varies from the second to the fourth magnitude in about three and onehalf hours and back again in the same time after which it remains steadily brilliant for two and threequarters days when the same change recurs algenib and algol form with g andromed a rightangled triangle note a dull red star near algol and a pretty pair just above algenib an operaglass reveals much that is worthy of observation in this region of the sky it has been said of the clusters between cassiopeia and perseus that they form the most striking sidereal spectacle in the northern heavens they are visible to the naked eye algenib never sets in the latitude of new york just touching the horizon at its lower culmination it is estimated that algol is a little over a million miles in diameter has three faint stars on one side nearly in a line and one on the othera miniature representation of jupiter and his satellites algol when on the meridian of new york city is only one tenth of a degree from the zenith point this remarkable variable has a dark companion star revolving near it obscuring its light in part from us at stated intervals by means of the spectroscope the speed diameter and mass of this invisible star has been reckoned illustration perseus pisces pisezthe fishes face southeast locationthis constellation is represented by two fishes each with a ribbon tied to its tail one the northern fish lies just below b andromedthe other represented by the circlet is just below pegasus the ribbons represented by streams of faint stars from a v with elongated sides and terminate in the star al rischa the knot below and to the east of l the spot marked is the place which the sun occupies at the time of the equinox it is one of the two crossing places of the equinoctial or equator of the heavens and the ecliptic or suns path below pisces is cetus the whale pisces is thought to have taken its name from its coincidence with the sun during the rainy season three distinct conjunctions of jupiter and saturn took place in this constellation in the year 747 of rome pisces was considered the national constellation of the jews as well as a tribal symbol in 1881 jupiter saturn and venus were grouped together in pisces the circlet is a very striking group forming a pentagon the glass reveals two faint stars in addition making the figure sevensided or elliptical in form as to the number of the stars as classified according to their magnitude that is their brightness it may be mentioned that there are approximately 20 stars of the first magnitude 65 of the second 300 of the third and 450 of the fourth we cannot see stars fainter than the sixth magnitude with the naked eye illustration pisces triangulum triangulumthe triangle face east locationa line drawn from the star g pegasi to algol in perseus passes through b trianguli the triangle is clearly defined and a beautiful figure it lies just below andromeda and above aries triangulum is a very ancient constellation being formerly named deltoton from the greek letter delta d it was in this locality that piazzi discovered the asteroid ceres january 1 1800 a trianguli is sometimes called caput trianguli a and b trianguli were known as the scale beam according to argelander the constellation contains fifteen stars the triangle has been likened to the trinity and the mitre of st peter illustration triangulum aquarius akwariusthe water carrier face southwest locationa line drawn from b pegasi to a of the same constellation and prolonged as far again

these two stars are gradually separating b is a double star one being blue the other yellow the constellation resembles a chapeau or peaked hat upside down the stars in the head of the sea goat a and b are only 2 apart and can hardly be mistaken by an observer facing the southwestern sky during the early evening in autumn five degrees east of d is the point announced by le verrier as the position of his predicted new planet neptune flammarion claims that the chinese astronomers noted the five planets in conjunction in capricornus in the year 2449 bc the sign of the goat was called by the ancient orientalists the southern gate of the sun illustration capricornus aries ariezthe ram face southeast locationthe star a in aries known as hamal and sometimes as arietis a star of the second magnitude is about 7 south of a trianguli a line drawn from the pole star to g andromed and prolonged about 20 ends at hamal aries contains three principal stars forming a characteristic obtuseangled triangle the star g arietis was one of the first double stars discovered a telescope is required to split it hamal lies near the path of the moon and is one of the stars from which longitude is reckoned below aries may be seen the characteristic pentagon in the head of cetus the whale more than two thousand years ago aries was the leading constellation of the zodiac and now stands first in

brightest star being generally on the east illustration aries cetus setusthe whale face southeast locationa line drawn from polaris to d cassiopei and prolonged two and one third times its original length reaches the centre of this constellation it lies just below aries and the triangle and resembles the figure of the prehistoric icthyosaurus while some see in the outline an easy chair the head of the beast is characterized by a clearly traced pentagon about 20 southeast of aries the brightest star in the constellation is a of the second magnitude it is at one apex of the pentagon about 15 east of al rischa in pisces and 37 directly south of algol the noted variable mira also known as o ceti is the chief object of interest in this constellation it was discovered by fabricius in 1596 and varies from the ninth magnitude to the third or fourth in a period of 334 days it can be observed during its entire range with a 3 glass in 1779 mira is reported to have been as bright as the firstmagnitude star aldebaran it lies almost exactly on a line joining g and z ceti a little nearer the former ten degrees south of it are four faint stars about 3 apart forming a square t ceti is one

wellknown and unmistakable group the pleiades on the right shoulder of the bull a v shaped group known as the hyades is just to the southeast of the pleiades in the face of the bull forming one of the most beautiful objects in the sky the brightest star in taurus is aldebaran a ruddyhued star known as the follower it is at the beginning of the v in the hyades and is at the apex of a triangle formed by capella in auriga and a persei and equally distant from them both the star b called nath is peculiarly white and is common to taurus and auriga it represents the tip of one of the bulls horns and the right foot of the charioteer the pleiades are mentioned in chinese annals in 2357 bc on a photograph of the group over 2000 stars have been counted the ecliptic passes a little south of a point midway between the two horns where a scattered and broken stream of minute stars can be seen note two pretty pairs in the hyades one south of aldebaran the other northwest of it there are rich clusters below the tip of the horn over orions head taurus was an important object of worship by the druids aldebaran is near one eye of the bull and used to be called the bulls eye an occultation of it by the moon which not infrequently occurs is a striking phenomenon the eskimos regard the pleiades as a team of dogs in pursuit of a bear the group is receding from us at the rate of thirteen miles

explanatory matter regarding them is necessary however to prevent confusion for the student must bear in mind the fact that from time to time the planets appear in the constellations and unless identified would lead him to think that the diagrams were inaccurate the reader is referred to any one of the four large plates that precede each season he will observe that a portion of an ellipse has been traced on each of them and that this line has been designated the ecliptic which simply means the suns apparent pathway across the sky this pathway is divided into twelve equal parts of thirty degrees each and to these twelve divisions are given the names of the constellations of the zodiac in the following order aries symbol aries taurus symbol taurus gemini symbol gemini cancer symbol cancer leo symbol leo virgo symbol virgo libra symbol libra scorpio symbol scorpio sagittarius symbol sagittarius capricornus symbol capricornus aquarius symbol aquarius pisces symbol pisces the sun starting from the first degree of aries the first day of spring passes through one constellation a month the planets follow the same pathway confusion therefore respecting their identity can only arise in connection with a study of one of the twelve constellations named above so that whenever a star of any size is seen in one of these constellations not accounted for in the diagram the student may conclude that this is a planet especially if the unknown star does not twinkle it now remains to identify the planet this can best be done by referring to an almanac which states what planets are above the horizon and which are morning and evening stars by morning star is meant that the planet is east of the sun by evening star that it is west of the sun if the planet is in the west and very brilliant it is safe to assume that it is the planet venus if it is brighter than any of the fixed stars and is some distance from the sun it is doubtless the colossal jupiter if it is very red it will probably be mars saturn is distinguished because of its pale steady yellow light as for mercury uranus and neptune the former is very near the sun and seldom seen while uranus and neptune are so inconspicuous as to lead to no confusion on the part of the novice a few notes of interest relative to the planets follow taking them up in regular order passing outward from the sun mercury venus mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune mercury mercury is the nearest to the sun of any of the planets on this account and because of its rapid changes it is seldom seen the most favorable time for observing it is just after sunset or just before sunrise during the months of march april august and september when it may be seen for a few successive days the greatest distance it ever departs from the sun on either side varies approximately from sixteen to twentyeight degrees its motion resembles a pendulum swinging from one side of the sun to the other venus venus approaches nearer to the earth and is more brilliant than any other planet it is bright enough to cast a shadow at night and is sometimes visible even at noonday it is almost as large as the earth and appears to oscillate as mercury does on either side of the sun it never appears more than three hours after sunset and as long before the sunrise and is never more than fortyeight degrees from the sun mars mars is most like the earth of any of the planets and although not as interesting an object to view as the more brilliant planets venus and jupiter it claims our attention chiefly because of the surmises respecting its habitability mars appears to the naked eye as a bright red star and when at a favorable opposition to the earth which occurs only once in every fifteen years it rivals jupiter in splendor the planet may be mistaken for the first magnitude stars antares in scorpius and aldebaran in taurus near which it frequently passes the fixed stars however twinkle while mars glows steadily if there is any doubt in the students mind as to the identity of the planet a few nights of observation noting the changes in the planets position will decide the point it takes mars about fiftyseven days to pass through one constellation in the zodiac jupiter jupiter is the largest of all the planets in the solar system and it is easily distinguished from the fixed stars because of its brilliancy and splendor exceeding in brightness all the planets excepting venus and casting a perceptible shadow it moves slowly and majestically across the sky advancing through the zodiac at the rate of one constellation yearly it is therefore a simple matter to forecast its position for in whatever constellation it is seen today one year hence it will be seen equally advanced in the next constellation although jupiter appears to move slowly it really travels at the incomprehensible rate of five hundred miles a minute the most interesting feature about jupiter for the amateur astronomer consists in observing four of its moons which are visible with a small telescope they appear like mere dots of light and their transit of or occultation with the planet that is their disappearance before or behind its disk can be watched and is a never failing source of pleasure a large telescope alone reveals jupiters four other moons saturn saturn is farther removed from the earth than any of the planets in the solar system visible to the naked eye it is distinguished from the fixed stars by the steadiness of its light which is dull and of a yellow hue though to some it appears to be of a greenish tinge it seems barely to move so slow is its motion among the stars for it takes two and one half years to pass through a single constellation of the zodiac saturn has eight moons titan its largest one can be seen with a 3 glass its celebrated rings are telescopic objects but a small glass reveals them uranus the student will hardly mistake uranus for a fixed star as it is only under the most favorable circumstances that it can be seen with the naked eye at its nearest approach to the earth it is as bright as a sixthmagnitude star uranus is accompanied by four moons and takes seven years to pass through a constellation of the zodiac neptune neptune is the most distant of the planets in the solar system and is never visible to the naked eye the earth comes properly under a discussion of the planets but a description of it is hardly within the scope of this work confusion in identifying the planets is really confined to mars and saturn for venus and jupiter are much brighter than any of the fixed stars and their position in the heavens identifies them as we have seen before the following table of firstmagnitude stars in the zodiacal constellations confines the question of identifying the planets to a comparison of the unknown star with the followingnamed stars castor and pollux in gemini spica virgo regulus leo aldebaran taurus antares scorpius the first four stars named above are white in color so that either mars or saturn is readily distinguished from them as for aldebaran and antares which are both red stars not unlike mars and saturn in color and magnitude the fact that the latter do not twinkle and that they do not appear in the diagrams should satisfy the observer of their identity reference to an almanac or a few nights of observation will in any case set at rest any doubt in the matter illustration the planetary orbits illustration comparative size of the planets the milky way the milky way or galaxy as it is sometimes called is a great band of light that stretches across the heavens certain portions of it are worthy of being viewed with an operaglass which separates this seemingly confused and hazy stream into numberless points of light emanating from myriads of suns this wonderful feature of the heavens is seen to best advantage during the months of july august september and october beginning near the head of cepheus about thirty degrees from the north pole it passes through cassiopeia perseus auriga part of orion and the feet of gemini where it crosses the ecliptic and thence continues into the southern hemisphere beyond our ken in these latitudes it reappears in two branches in the region of ophiuchus one running through the tail of scorpius the bow of sagittarius aquila delphinus and cygnus the other above and almost parallel to it uniting with the first branch in cygnus and passing to cepheus the place of beginning the student should note especially the strange gap between a g and e cygni this dark space has been called the coal sack the milky way in the vicinity of cassiopeia is particularly rich and well repays a search with an operaglass the galaxy covers more than one tenth of the visible heavens contains ninetenths of the visible stars and seems a vast zoneshaped nebula nearly a great circle of the sphere the poles being at coma and cetus the motions of the stars it may be that the student desires to proceed in this conquest of the sky at a more rapid pace than the scheme of study permits to assist such it should be borne in mind that the circumpolar constellations as ursa major ursa minor draco cepheus and cassiopeia are designatedare visible in our latitude in the northern sky every night a reference to their diagrams and a glance at any of the large plates showing the entire group in their respective positions will suffice for the student to identify them the hours of darkness alone limit the speed with which a knowledge of the constellations can be acquired let us suppose that the student begins his search for the constellations on the night of april 1st at nine pm he has for his guide the large plate and the spring group of eleven constellations set forth in the diagrams the remaining three constellations of the circumpolar group are as we have seen before visible in the north if he faces the western sky he will see andromeda just setting and perseus taurus orion lepus and canis major but a short distance above the horizon if he is so fortunate as to be able to identify these and the spring group he may turn his attention wholly to the eastern sky where new constellations await him in the southeast he may see virgo in the east well up blazes arcturus the gem of botes below which is the beautiful northern crown with the diamond in the head of serpens beneath it hercules is rising and vega in the lyre should be seen just flashing on the view in the northeast this completes the list of wonders visible at this precise time but the stars apparently are never still and doubtless while the student has been passing from one constellation to another in the western and southern skies others have been rising in the east and northeast at ten pm the lyre is well up and ophiuchus and libra can be discerned at midnight scorpius and cygnus are ready to claim the attention by two oclock am aquila delphinus and sagittarius have risen and at break of day andromeda pegasus and capricornus can be seen if the student has had the courage to remain awake this length of time in no way can the seeming movement of the stars be better understood than by actual observation the observer must bear in mind that the movement is an apparent one that it is the earth that is moving and not the stars he has only to think of the analogy of the moving train beside the one that is standing still and the true state of affairs will at once be evident to further appreciate this apparent change in the situation of the constellations the student should refer to the large plates successively in each successive one he will note the advancement westward of the constellations mentioned above rising in the east late at night the student can best get an idea of this westward apparent movement of the stars by noting the position of some bright firstmagnitude star from night to night he will soon be able to calculate the position of this star a month or more ahead and this calculation applies to all the constellations and stars it is not within the scope of this work to go into this matter in detail the author merely desires to mention this fact of apparent change of position in the stars a fact that will be noticeable to the observer in a short time and a fact that it is hoped he will be able to explain to his own satisfaction with the aid of the foregoing remarks it will be noticed that the stars on the diagrams are all numbered and lettered the numbers refer to the magnitude of the starthat is the brightness of it the firstmagnitude stars being the brightest the secondmagnitude stars twoandahalf times less bright etc the letters are those of the greek alphabet and the student if not familiar with it is advised to consult a greek grammar in the text in referring to certain stars in the constellations the genitive case of the latin name of the constellation is given for example vega is known as a lyrae meaning alpha of lyra aldebaran as a tauri alpha of taurus etc the twilight hour affords an excellent opportunity of fixing the relative positions of the firstmagnitude stars in the mind for at that time they alone save the planets are visible meteors or shootingstars as this work is designed primarily to cover what is observable in the starlit heavens with the naked eye the subject of meteors or shootingstars comes properly within its scope there are few persons if any who have not witnessed the sight of a splendid meteor speeding across the sky and such a sight always calls forth exclamations of wonder and delight apparently these evanescent wanderers in space are without distinctive features and baffle classification but like all that nature reveals to us they have been found for the most part to conform to certain laws and to bear certain marks of resemblance that permit of their identification and classification by careful observation for over fifty years the meteors generally speaking have been so arranged that they come under the head of one of the nearly three hundred distinct showers which are now recognized by astronomers many of these showers are too feeble and faint to be worthy of the attention of one not especially interested in the subject but certain ones are well worth observing there is always a pleasure in being able to recognize at a glance a certain definite manifestation of nature be it a rare flower or a flashing meteor the generally accepted theory respecting the meteors is that they were all originally parts of comets now disintegrated and the four wellknown showers of april 20th august 10th and 14th and november 27th bear testimony to this theory the apparent velocity of the meteors is between ten and fortyfive miles a second and their average height is about seventysix miles at first appearance and fiftyone miles at disappearance occasionally a meteor is so large and compact as to escape total destruction and falls to the earth specimens of these meteorites are to be found in our best museums i have seen fit to divide the principal meteor showers into four groups according to the seasons in which they appear and have placed them respectively at the conclusion of each seasons work on the constellations by radiant point is meant the point from which the meteors start on their flight this point is an apparent one however due to an illusion of perspective for the meteors really approach the earth in parallel paths the dates given for these showers are those of the maxima and the meteors should be looked for several nights before and after the dates specified the showers that are to be seen after midnight are unless of special note omitted there are besides the meteors that have been classified certain shootingstars that apparently have no determined radiant point these are called sporadic meteors in these lists of meteors the radiant point is only approximately given for scientific purposes a far more exact position is required in terms of right ascension and declination there are several good lists of meteoric showers to be obtained which afford this information for those who care to pursue the matter more in detail see the rev tw webbs book entitled celestial objects for common telescopes for purposes of identification the radiant points here given will be found for the most part sufficient note many readers of this book may be the fortunate possessors of small telescopes it may be that they have observed the heavens from time to time in a desultory way and have no notion that valuable and practical scientific research work can be accomplished with a small glass if those who are willing to aid in the great work of astrophysical research will communicate with the author he will be pleased to outline for them a most practical and fascinating line of observational work that will enable them to share in the advance of our knowledge respecting the stars it is work that
