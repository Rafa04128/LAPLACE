for numbers and equations underscores before bracketed numbers in equations denote a subscript preface these few pages are intended to serve a twofold purposeto give the student a general outline of blowpipe analysis and to introduce him to the methods of determinative mineralogy every effort has been made to simplify details so that the book may be used in both high schools and colleges tables for systematic examination have been intentionally omitted for in the authors estimation these tend to dull the students power of observation and to make him place little value upon minute details the alphabetic arrangement has been followed for the sake of convenience when referring to the book the last chapter is not intended to serve as a key to determining the minerals therein described but rather it is added to give the student exercise in blowpipe analysis and at the same time to point out the methods of determinative mineralogy finally the author would acknowledge his indebtedness to

chemists among whom may be mentioned bergmann cronstedt gahn berzelius and plattner blowpipethe common blowpipe of the jeweller is not particularly well suited to the operations of blowpipe analysis since the flame has often to be kept playing upon the assay for some time and the condensed moisture of the breath would seriously interfere with the passage of the air through the jet one of the best and least expensive forms of blowpipe is shown in fig 1 this consists as is seen from the illustration of a conicalshaped tube of tin closed at the wide end and formed into a mouthpiece at the small end soldered into the tube at the large end and at right angles to its axis is a small brass tube which terminates in a conical tip pierced with a very fine hole with this pipe it is possible to perform all of the operations of mineral analysis some little practice is necessary to keep the flame steady and to take the breath at the same time no rule can well be given to the beginner but his experience becomes his best guide bunsen flameany kind of flame can be used for the blowpipe provided it be not too small but since almost every laboratory today is furnished with gas and the bunsen burner fig 2 it will only be necessary to describe the use of the flame from this source upon examining the bunsen flame with care it will be seen that the flame consists of three distinct parts a dark inner cone which consists of gas not yet raised to the ignition point beyond this there is a luminous cone where combustion is incomplete owing to lack of oxygen and outside of this we find the nonluminous cone where the gas is completely burned this outer envelope is the hottest portion of the flame and is known as the oxidizing flame because there is an excess of oxygen which is imparted to substances placed therein the luminous cone is known as the reducing flame for in it metallic oxides are reduced the oxygen being taken up by the small incandescent particles of carbon if the airholes at the base of the bunsen burner be opened the two inner cones become elongated and the flame appears almost colorless the blowpipe enables us to get an oxidizing and a reducing flame of better form and greater power to do this we cut off the air supply at the base of the burner and turn off the gas until the flame is about 1 cm high then upon introducing the blowpipe and blowing a strong continuous jet of air across the bunsen flame we produce an oxidizing flame about 45 cm in length if the tip of the blowpipe be held outside of the bunsen flame and the pressure of the stream of air be diminished we obtain a reducing flame supportsfor supports charcoal platinum and glass are chiefly used the charcoal should be made from some light wood such as alder it should be well burnt and should not scintillate or smoke the platinum supports are generally in the form of wire and foil platinumtipped forceps are frequently employed in blowpipe analysis glass is used in the form of tubing hard glass tubing 3 mm bore is drawn off into ignition tubes 78 cm in length several dozen of these tubes should be made before commencing the tests of the next chapter apparatusa small agate mortar 45 cm in diameter should be provided in which to grind the samples to be examined the pestle which should also be of agate must be adapted to the mortar in shape and size two pairs of forceps will also be needed one pair should be of steel and the other pair of brass with fine points of other apparatus the most necessary is a small hammer and anvil two threecornered files small piece of cobalt glass about 5 10 cm pocket magnifying lens several small watch glassesfor metallic beads etc chemicalsa list of the principal chemicals is here given sodium carbonate na2co3 borax na2b4o7 10

in order to examine a substance before the blowpipe to determine the presence or absence of certain elements it becomes necessary to arrange a systematic method as with all branches of chemical work ones success is largely dependent upon neatness of manipulation and carefulness of observation the following order of observation is essentially that given by berzelius 1 examination on charcoal by itself 2 examination on charcoal with na2co3 3 examination in ignition tube with na2co3 and charcoal 4 examination on platinum wire 5 examination in borax bead 6 examination with cono32 after having examined a body in these six different ways we shall be able to say what are its principal constituents before describing the method of carrying out these six different operations it will be necessary to give a few definitions of terms which we shall have frequent occasion to employ definitionsignition is the heating of a substance to a high temperature fusion is the heating of a substance to the meltingpoint intumescence is the swelling of the substance upon heating decrepitation is the crackling of a substance due to the sudden expansion of combined water upon heating deflagration is the burning of a substance with explosive violence generally due to excess of oxygen incandescence is the white light emitted by a substance that is infusible when subjected to a high temperature examination on charcoal alonethe size of the assay should be about that of a mustard seed this is sufficiently large to show all of the reactions clearly and though a larger piece would exhibit the characteristic phenomena yet much more effort is required a very small shallow hole should be cut in the ch to receive the assay the bp flame should be directed at an angle of about 30 with the surface of the ch considerable care must be taken lest the hole in the ch is burned too deep and the assay lost in the coal the force of the air from the jet must also be borne in mind for a strong blast or sudden puffs may blow the substance away the following changes are to be looked for a whether the substance is volatile or nonvolatile illustrations examine before the bp on ch some arsenious oxide as2o3 also some alumina al2o3 b whether the substance is fusible or infusible illustrations examine before the bp on ch some silver oxide ago also some zinc oxide zno c whether the substance is alkaline or nonalkaline when placed upon moistened red litmus illustrations ignite some calcium carbonate caco3 before the bp on ch and place residue on moistened red litmus in like manner examine some magnesium carbonate mgco3 d color of coating on ch caused by combination of metal and oxygen due to heat of bp flame illustrations examine some oxide of lead pbo before the bp on ch also some

ammonium nitrate nh4no3 g intumescence illustration examine some alum k2al2so44 before the bp on ch h incandescence illustration examine some oxide of barium bao before the bp on ch i formation of a metallic beadcolor and malleability illustration examine some silver oxide ago before the bp on ch examination on charcoal with na2co3metallic compounds are often difficult to reduce with the blowpipe flame alone and hence no bead is obtained in order to facilitate reduction and the obtaining of a metallic bead the substance in a finely powdered condition is mixed with four parts of sodium carbonate na2co3 and ignited before the bp on ch the metallic compound is decomposed the metal being transformed into the carbonate which in turn through the agency of the ch and the heat of the flame is reduced to the free metal sometimes the reduction is made easier by adding to the substance about its own bulk of potassium cyanide kcn which takes up oxygen from the compound and is converted into potassium cyanate kcno the reactions in reducing copper sulphate cuso4 with na2co3 and with kcn before the blowpipe are here given cuso4 na2co3 cuco3 na2so4 1 2cuco3 c 3co2 2cu cuso4 na2co3 cuco3 na2so4 cuco3 cuo co2 2 cuo kcn cu kcno after obtaining beads it is well to obtain their coatings for oftentimes it is only in this way that we can distinguish between the metals examination in tube with na2co3 and charcoalif the substance in a finely pulverized condition be mixed with twelve parts na2co3 and six parts of charcoal powder and the mixture be placed in an ignition tube and subjected to heat the acid of the substance combines with the soda and the metal is set free if this metal is volatile a sublimate is formed in the upper end of the tube mercury deposits in minute globules which may be seen with the magnifying glass arsenic forms a ring which when examined with the magnifying glass is seen to be made up of minute crystals ammonia is recognized by its characteristic odor and also by its turning a slip of moistened red litmus held over the mouth of the tube blue examination on platinum wiremany substances possess the property of imparting to the colorless flame of the bunsen burner characteristic colors the chlorides of these substances exhibit these flame reactions best and hence before applying the flame tests we dip the wire which serves as a support into hydrochloric acid and then into the substance when the substance has been taken up on the wire it is placed in the edge of the long colorless flame of the bunsen burner near the apex when instantly the flame becomes tinged with the characteristic color of the substance illustrations sodium compounds color the flame yellow and a crystal of potassium dichromate appears colorless in the sodium light this sodium reaction is extremely delicate it being possible to detect with ease a quantity of a sodium salt less than 13000000 of a milligram in weight potassium colors the flame purplishviolet barium colors the flame applegreen strontium colors the flame crimson calcium colors the flame orangered distinguished from strontium by appearing gray when seen through blue glass boracic acid colors the flame green when the substance has been moistened with glycerine examination in borax beadborax na2b4o7 and microcosmic salt nanh4h po4 possess the property of dissolving many of the metallic oxides at the temperature of the bunsen flame for example with oxide of cobalt the following reactions take place with the two fluxes coo na2b4o7 cobo22 2 nabo2 on heating nanh4h po4 it is decomposed into the metaphosphate of sodium napo3 coo napo3 conapo4 now in such cases of solution the metallic oxides impart a characteristic color to the flux the platinum wire is the best supportit is heated to incandescence in the bunsen flame and then is quickly dipped into the borax when a small globule will adherethis is removed to the flame again when the borax melts to a clear glassy bead while the bead is still melted touch it to the finely pulverized substance and replace in the flame in a few seconds the small particles of the substance will have dissolved and the bead will be seen to have assumed the color characteristic of the substance note the color when hot and then when cold often there is a wide difference then too the test should be made in both o f and r f some analysts prefer to make a small loop in the end of the wire before taking up the borax to make the bead care should be taken to see that the bead is colorless before bringing it in contact with the substance as the depth of color produced is largely dependent upon the amount of substance taken some little caution should be exercised to insure taking up about the same quantity each time illustrations make several beads and note the colors characteristic of the following oxides cobalt nickel iron manganese chromium and copper the microcosmic salt bead dissolves almost every oxide except silica sio2 and this is seen to float about in the melted mass this is used as a test for silica examination with cono32if after examination on the ch per se a white infusible residue remains it is moistened with a drop of cobalt nitrate cono32 and reignited before the bp when a change of color will be observed this change in color is owing to the fact that the heat of the bp flame decomposes the cobalt nitrate nitric acid being driven off and the remaining coo forming with the oxide of the residue a colored mass illustrations ignite before the bp on ch the following oxidesallow to cool add a drop of cono32 reignite and note coloraluminum magnesium zinc and calcium care should be taken to thoroughly ignite before adding the cobalt nitrate solution with the six methods of examination just given almost every simple substance can be detected but should any doubt remain a few simple tests in the liquid way will be sufficient to substantiate the blowpipe examination chapter iii general reactions for the detection of the metallic elements in simple compounds for the sake of convenience rather than for scientific reasons the following compounds have been arranged in alphabetic order also the oxides of the elements have been taken since they exhibit the reactions to best advantage the student should work through carefully each one of the tests and satisfy himself as to the characteristic reactions of the various elements for only in this way can he expect to recognize the substances when presented to him as unknowns it is advisable to provide a notebook and rule it as follows behavior

when cold with cono32 green mass having now given the principal reactions for the most important metals we will proceed to the examination of the alkali metals the alkaline earths and some of the acid elements the alkali metals 17 ammonium nh4this hypothetical compound is commonly classed among the alkali metals from its close resemblance to the members of this group to detect the presence of this hypothetical metal mix the assay with about four parts of na2co3 place in an ignition tube and apply heat the odor of the evolved gas will be recognized and if a piece of red litmus paper be moistened and held at the mouth of the tube it will be turned blue by the escaping ammonia gas we are not authorized to infer the preexistence of ammonium however from the appearance of this reaction for the presence of nitrogenous organic matter in the substance which would be decomposed by this treatment would give rise to such a reaction 18 potassiumpotassium is recognized by the color which its salts impart to the bunsen flame if a portion of a salt of potassium be held on a platinum wire in the flame it imparts a blueviolet tint which rapidly disappears 19 sodiumlike potassium this alkali metal is detected by the color which its salts give to the flame if a sodium salt be held on the platinum wire in the flame it imparts an intense yellow color the extreme delicacy of this reaction has been mentioned elsewhere the value of this test is really lessened by its great delicacy for it is possible to detect minute quantities of sodium in almost all substances although it may not be in chemical combination as an example draw the platinum wire between the fingers and then place in flame and note presence of sodium 20 lithium li2oin the bunsen flame on the platinum wire it imparts a carminered tinge hydrochloric acid on the sample augments the coloration the alkaline earths 21 barium baoin the bunsen flame on the platinum wire it imparts an applegreen coloration this reaction is intensified by moistening the sample with hydrochloric acid 22 calcium caoin the bunsen flame on the platinum wire it imparts an orangered color which appears gray when seen through blue glass hydrochloric acid on the sample makes the color more intense 23 strontium sroin the bunsen flame on the platinum wire it imparts an intensely red color which is increased by converting the substance into the chloride the acid elements 24 boratesif the substance be finely powdered moistened with glycerine and then placed on a platinum wire in the bunsen flame it imparts a brilliant green color if turmeric paper be dipped into a solution of a borate and then be dried at 100 c it is turned to a peculiar red color these two reactions are extremely delicate 25 bromidesbromides treated with microcosmic salt and oxide of copper on platinum wire impart to the flame a greenishblue color the edges being decidedly green 26 chlorideschlorides are treated in the same way as bromides the color imparted to the flame is azureblue to discriminate between bromides and chlorides more clearly the substance is mixed with anhydrous potassium bisulphate and fused in an ignition tube bromine and sulphur dioxide are evolved if the substance be a bromide the tube being filled with a yellow gas possessing the characteristic odor of bromine 27 fluoridesa small portion of the substance in a finely powdered condition is placed in one of the ignition tubes a strip of moist brazilwood paper is introduced into the open end and heat is applied hydrofluoric acid is evolved and the red color of the paper is changed into a strawyellow mica containing only 075 of fluorine shows the reaction clearly 28 iodidesiodides are treated as the bromides and chlorides in a bead of microcosmic salt with oxide of copper the flame is colored green fused with potassium bisulphate in an ignition tube the violet vapors of iodine are evolved and thus iodides may be distinguished from chlorides and bromides 29 nitratesif a nitrate be heated upon charcoal before the bp violent deflagration occurs if the substance containing the nitric acid be mixed with a very small quantity of finely powdered potassium cyanide the deflagration is accompanied with ignition and detonation if the substance be mixed in a dry condition with dry potassium bisulphate and is then heated in an ignition tube redbrown nitrous fumes are evolved this reaction takes place if there is but a small quantity of nitrate present 30 phosphatesphosphates impart to the flame a bluish green color the color is made more intense by moistening the substance with sulphuric acid and then taking the paste so formed on the platinum wire and placing it in the bunsen flame 31 silicatessilicates when treated with microcosmic salt on a platinum wire suffer decomposition the bases unite with the phosphoric acid to form a transparent glass in which the silica may be seen floating as a cloudy mass the bead must only be examined for silica while hot since on cooling it becomes opaque 32 sulphidesmany sulphides when heated in an ignition tube volatilize and give a sublimate of sulphur in combination with the metallic portion of the substance a very delicate test for sulphur in whatever combination it may be found in a substance and which may be performed with great ease is to mix the finely powdered assay with four parts na2co3 and fuse in an ignition tube when thoroughly fused the tube is broken and the fused mass is placed on a bright silver coin and a drop of water is added if the substance contains sulphur a black spot will be observed on the coin where the fused mass was placed before going on to the next chapter the student should assure himself of his familiarity with the reactions just given and he should practise with various substances the nature of which is unknown to him chapter iv behavior of some of the principal ores before the blowpipe for the sake of practice and as a fitting introduction to determinative mineralogy this chapter is appended it is not intended to give a detailed account of the minerals but rather to set before the student the most marked characters such as hardness specific gravity color lustre etc to determine the hardness of a mineral we try to scratch it with the minerals forming an arbitrary scale of hardness proceeding successively from the softest to the hardest when we say that a certain mineral has hardness 4 we mean that the mineral is scratched by 4 on the scale and that 4 on the scale is scratched by the mineral the scale of hardness chiefly in use is the mohsbreithaupt scale which is as follows 1 talc common laminated light green variety 2 gypsum crystallized 3 calcareous spar transparent variety 4 fluor spar crystalline 5 apatite transparent 6 orthoclase white cleavable variety 7 quartz transparent 8 topaz transparent 9 sapphire cleavable variety 10 diamond it seldom happens in determining the hardness of a mineral that its hardness exactly conforms to that of some one member of the scale in such cases we generally estimate the hardness for example suppose a mineral was harder than 4 but softer than 5 and that it was nearer 5 than 4 then we would call its hardness 434 in order to preserve the scale some operators use a threecornered file first cutting the mineral and then the scale until a number is found which is abraded to about the same depth as the mineral under examination since a set of minerals forming a scale of hardness is not always at hand the following scale given by chapman is appended 1 yields easily to the nail 2 yields with difficulty to the nail or just receives an impression from it does not scratch a copper coin 3 scratches a copper coin but is also scratched by it being of about the same degree of hardness 4 not scratched by a copper coin does not scratch glass 5 scratches glass with difficulty leaving its powder on it yields readily to the knife 6 scratches glass easily yields with difficulty to the knife 7 does not yield to the knife yields to the edge of a file though with difficulty 8 9 10 harder than flint specific gravity cannot well be determined without the aid of a balance and

translated by ludwig gattermann phd william shafer phd professor in university instructor in organic chemistry of heidelberg in lehigh university the guardian the selection and judgment throughout is excellent the book is a most useful practical adjunct to any good textbook on organic chemistry pharmaceutical review this is a book that should be in the library of every teacher of organic chemistry and one which will no doubt be of great value to students in their second year of organic chemistry its chief peculiarity and merit is in the great stress laid on practical laboratory work it is permanently a workers guide nature since the advance of organic chemistry in this country must in a measure depend on the nature of the available textbooks both the author and the translator deserve our thanks for providing us with a work such as the present one published by the macmillan company 66 fifth avenue new york outlines of industrial chemistry a textbook for students by frank hall thorp phd instructor in industrial chemistry in the massachusetts institute of technology cloth 8vo price 350 net james lewis howe department of chemistry washington and lee university the book is brought thoroughly up to date and in some cases the lines of probable development are nicely foreshadowed the descriptions are particularly lucid and the illustrations well selected the general arrangement and makeup of the book is excellent and altogether the book fills well a need long felt by teachers of industrial chemistry i shall adopt the book for my class and shall take pleasure in recommending it charles e coates jr phd professor of chemistry louisiana state university i have examined it carefully and think it a most excellent book meeting a want i have long felt in my higher classes i have introduced it in this years classes w a noyes in science the descriptions of processes while necessarily concise are clear and interesting the author has evidently made a careful study of recent methods of manufacture as well as of older standard processes the frequent reference to american practice is an important feature which distinguishes the book from other works on chemical technology a

the project gutenberg concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support project gutenberg ebooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the us unless a copyright notice is included thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition most people start at our website which has the main pg search facility wwwgutenbergorg this website includes
