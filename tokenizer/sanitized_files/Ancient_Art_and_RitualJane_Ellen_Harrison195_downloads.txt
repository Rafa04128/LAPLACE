the aim of the present volume the title is ancient art and ritual but the reader will find in it no general summary or even outline of the facts of either ancient art or ancient ritual these facts are easily accessible in handbooks the point of my title and the real gist of my argument lie perhaps in the word andthat is in the intimate connection which i have tried to show exists between ritual and art this connection has i believe an important bearing on questions vital today as for example the question of the place of art in our modern civilization its relation to and its difference from religion and morality in a word on the whole enquiry as to what the nature of art is and how it can help or hinder spiritual life i have taken greek drama as a typical instance because in it we have the clear historical case of a great art which arose out of a very primitive and almost worldwide ritual the rise of the indian drama or the medival and from it the modern stage would have told us the same tale and served the like purpose but greece is nearer to us today than either india or the middle ages greece and the greek drama remind me that i should like to offer my thanks to professor

the reader as strange and even dissonant what have art and ritual to do together the ritualist is to the modern mind a man concerned perhaps unduly with fixed forms and ceremonies with carrying out the rigidly prescribed ordinances of a church or sect the artist on the other hand we think of as free in thought and untrammelled by convention in practice his tendency is towards licence art and ritual it is quite true have diverged today but the title of this book is chosen advisedly its object is to show that these two divergent developments have a common root and that neither can be understood without the other it is at the outset one and the same impulse that sends a man to church and to the theatre such a statement may sound today paradoxical even irreverent but to the greek of the sixth fifth and even fourth century bc it would have been a simple truism we shall see this best by following an athenian to his theatre on the day of the great spring festival of dionysos passing through the entrancegate to the theatre on the south side of the acropolis our athenian citizen will find himself at once on holy ground he is within a temenos or precinct a place cut off from the common land and dedicated to a god he will pass to the left fig 2 p 144 two temples standing near to each other one of earlier the other of later date for a temple once built was so sacred that it would only be reluctantly destroyed as he enters the actual theatre he will pay nothing for his seat his attendance is an act of worship and from the social point of view obligatory the entrance fee is therefore paid for him by the state the theatre is open to all athenian citizens but the ordinary man will not venture to seat himself in the front row in the front row and that only the seats have backs and the central seat of this row is an armchair the whole of the front row is permanently reserved not for individual rich men who can afford to hire boxes but for certain state officials and these officials are all priests on each seat the name of the owner is inscribed the central seat is of the priest of dionysos eleuthereus the god of the precinct near him is the seat of the priest of apollo the laurelbearer and again of the priest of asklepios and of the priest of olympian zeus and so on round the whole front semicircle it is as though at his majestys the front row of stalls was occupied by the whole bench of bishops with the archbishop of canterbury enthroned in the central stall the theatre at athens is not open night by night nor even day by day dramatic performances take place only at certain high festivals of dionysos in winter and spring it is again as though the modern theatre was open only at the festivals of the epiphany and of easter our modern at least our protestant custom is in direct contrast we tend on great religious festivals rather to close than to open our theatres another point of contrast is in the time allotted to the performance we give to the theatre our afterdinner hours when work is done or at best a couple of hours in the afternoon the theatre is for us a recreation the greek theatre opened at sunrise and the whole day was consecrated to high and strenuous religious attention during the five or six days of the great dionysia the whole city was in a state of unwonted sanctity under a taboo to distrain a debtor was illegal any personal assault however trifling was sacrilege most impressive and convincing of all is the ceremony that took place on the eve of the performance by torchlight accompanied by a great procession the image of the god dionysos himself was brought to the theatre and placed in the orchestra moreover he came not only in human but in animal form chosen young men of the athenians in the flower of their youthepheboiescorted to the precinct a splendid bull it was expressly ordained that the bull should be worthy of the god he was in fact as we shall presently see the primitive incarnation of the god it is again as though in our modern theatre there stood sanctifying all things to our use and us to his service the human figure of the saviour and beside him the paschal lamb but now we come to a strange thing a god presides over the theatre to go to the theatre is an act of worship to the god dionysos and yet when the play begins three times out of four of dionysos we hear nothing we see it may be agamemnon returning from troy clytemnestra waiting to slay him the vengeance of orestes the love of phdra for hippolytos the hate of medea and the slaying of her children stories beautiful tragic morally instructive it may be but scarcely we feel religious the orthodox greeks themselves sometimes complained that in the plays enacted before them there was nothing to do with dionysos if drama be at the outset divine with its roots in ritual why does it issue in an art profoundly solemn tragic yet purely human the actors wear ritual vestments like those of the celebrants at the eleusinian mysteries why then do we find them not executing a religious service or even a drama of gods and goddesses but rather impersonating mere homeric heroes and heroines greek drama which seemed at first to give us our clue to show us a real link between ritual and art breaks down betrays us it would seem just at the crucial moment and leaves us with our problem on our hands had we only greek ritual and art we might well despair the greeks are a people of such swift constructive imagination that they almost always obscure any problem of origins so fair and magical are their cloudcappd towers that they distract our minds from the task of digging for foundations there is scarcely a problem in the origins of greek mythology and religion that has been solved within the domain of greek thinking only ritual with them was in the case of drama so swiftly and completely transmuted into art that had we had greek material only to hand we might never have marked the transition happily however we are not confined within the greek paradise wider fields are open to us our subject is not only greek but ancient art and ritual we can turn at once to the egyptians a people slowerwitted than the greeks and watch their sluggish but more instructive operations to one who is studying the development of the human mind the average or even stupid child is often more illuminating than the abnormally brilliant greece is often too near to us too advanced too modern to be for comparative purposes instructive of all egyptian perhaps of all ancient deities no god has lived so long or had so wide and deep an influence as osiris he stands as the prototype of the great class of resurrectiongods who die that they may live again his sufferings his death and his resurrection were enacted year by year in a great mysteryplay at abydos in that mysteryplay was set forth first what the greeks call his agon his contest with his enemy set then his pathos his suffering or downfall and defeat his wounding his death and his burial finally his resurrection and recognition his anagnorisis either as himself or as his only begotten son horus now the meaning of this thricetold tale we shall consider later for the moment we are concerned only with the fact that it is set forth both in art and ritual at the festival of osiris small images of the god were made of sand and vegetable earth his cheek bones were painted green and his face yellow the images were cast in a mould of pure gold representing the god as a mummy after sunset on the 24th day of the month choiak the effigy of osiris was laid in a grave and the image of the previous year was removed the intent of all this was made transparently clear by other rites at the beginning of the festival there was a ceremony of ploughing and sowing one end of the field was sown with barley the other with spelt another part with flax while this was going on the chief priest recited the ritual of the sowing of the fields into the garden of the god which seems to have been a large pot were put sand and barley then fresh living water from the inundation of the nile was poured out of a golden vase over the garden and the barley was allowed to grow up it was the symbol of the resurrection of the god after his burial for the growth of the garden is the growth of the divine substance the death and resurrection of the gods and pari passu of the life and fruits of the earth was thus set forth in ritual butand this is our immediate pointit was also set forth in definite unmistakable art in the great temple of isis at phil there is a chamber dedicated to osiris here is represented the dead osiris out of his body spring ears of corn and a priest waters the growing stalk from a pitcher the inscription to the picture reads this is the form of him whom one may not name osiris of the mysteries who springs from the returning waters it is but another presentation of the ritual of the month choiak in which effigies of the god made of earth and corn were buried when these effigies were taken up it would be found that the corn had sprouted actually from the body of the god and this sprouting of the grain would as dr frazer says be hailed as an omen or rather as the cause of the growth of the crops1 even more vividly is the resurrection set forth in the basreliefs that accompany the great osiris inscription at denderah here the god is represented at first as a mummy swathed and lying flat on his bier bit by bit he is seen raising himself up in a series of gymnastically impossible positions till at last he rises from a bowlperhaps his gardenall but erect between the outspread wings of isis while before him a male figure holds the crux ansata the cross with a handle the egyptian symbol of life in ritual the thing desired ie the resurrection is acted in art it is represented no one will refuse to these basreliefs the title of art in egypt then we have clearly an instanceonly one out of manywhere art and ritual go hand in hand countless basreliefs that decorate egyptian tombs and temples are but ritual practices translated into stone this as we shall later see is an important step in our argument ancient art and ritual are not only closely connected not only do they mutually explain and illustrate each other but as we shall presently find they actually arise out of a common human impulse the god who died and rose again is not of course confined to egypt he is worldwide when ezekiel viii 14 came to the gate of the lords house which was toward the north he beheld there the women weeping for tammuz this abomination the house of judah had brought with them from babylon tammuz is dumuzi the true son or more fully dumuziabsu true son of the waters he too like osiris is a god of the life that springs from inundation and that dies down in the heat of the summer in miltons procession of false gods thammuz came next behind whose annual wound in lebanon allured the syrian damsels to lament his fate in amorous ditties all a summers day tammuz in babylon was the young love of ishtar each year he died and passed below the earth to the place of dust and death the land from which there is no returning the house of darkness where dust lies on door and bolt and the goddess went after him and while she was below life ceased in the earth no flower blossomed and no child of animal or man was born we know tammuz the true son best by one of his titles adonis the lord or king the rites of adonis were celebrated at midsummer that is certain and memorable for just as the athenian fleet was setting sail on its illomened voyage to syracuse the streets of athens were thronged with funeral processions everywhere was seen the image of the dead god and the air was full of the lamentations of weeping women thucydides does not so much as mention the coincidence but plutarch2 tells us those who took account of omens were full of concern for the fate of their countrymen to start an expedition on the day of the funeral rites of adonis the canaanitish lord was no luckier than to set sail on a friday the deathday of the lord of christendom the rites of tammuz and of adonis celebrated in the summer were rites of death rather than of resurrection the emphasis is on the fading and dying down of vegetation rather than on its upspringing the reason of this is simple and will soon become manifest for the moment we have only to note that while in egypt the rites of osiris are represented as much by art as by ritual in babylon and palestine in the feasts of tammuz and adonis it is ritual rather than art that obtains we have now to pass to another enquiry we have seen that art and ritual not only in greece but in egypt and palestine are closely linked so closely indeed are they linked that we even begin to suspect they may have a common origin we have now to ask what is it that links art and ritual so closely together what have they in common do they start from the same impulse and if so why do they as they develop fall so widely asunder it will clear the air if we consider for a moment what we mean by art and also in somewhat greater detail what we mean by ritual art plato3 tells us in a famous passage of the republic is imitation the artist imitates natural objects which are themselves in his philosophy but copies of higher realities all the artist can do is to make a copy of a copy to hold up a mirror to nature in which as he turns it whither he will are reflected sun and heavens and earth and man anything and everything never did a statement so false so wrongheaded contain so much suggestion of truthtruth which by the help of analysing ritual we may perhaps be able to disentangle but first its falsehood must be grasped and this is the more important as platos misconception in modified form lives on today a painter not long ago thus defined his own art the art of painting is the art of imitating solid objects upon a flat surface by means of pigments a sorry lifework few people today perhaps regard art as the close and realistic copy of nature photography has at least scotched if not slain that error but many people still regard art as a sort of improvement on or an idealization of nature it is the part of the artist they think to take suggestions and materials from nature and from these to build up as it were a revised version it is perhaps only by studying those rudimentary forms of art that are closely akin to ritual that we come to see how utterly wrongheaded is this conception take the representations of osiris that we have just describedthe mummy rising bit by bit from his bier can any one maintain that art is here a copy or imitation of reality however realistic the painting it represents a thing imagined not actual there never was any such person as osiris and if there had been he would certainly never once mummified have risen from his tomb there is no question of fact and the copy of fact in the matter moreover had there been why should anyone desire to make a copy of natural fact the whole imitation theory to which and to the element of truth it contains we shall later have occasion to return errs in fact through supplying no adequate motive for a widespread human energy it is probably this lack of motive that has led other theorizers to adopt the view that art is idealization man with pardonable optimism desires it is thought to improve on nature modern science confronted with a problem like that of the rise of art no longer casts about to conjecture how art might have arisen she examines how it actually did arise abundant material has now been collected from among savage peoples of an art so primitive that we hesitate to call it art at all and it is in these inchoate efforts that we are able to track the secret motive springs that move the artist now as then among the huichol indians4 if the people fear a drought from the extreme heat of the sun they take a clay disk and on one side of it they paint the face of father sun a circular space surrounded by rays of red and blue and yellow which are called his arrows for the huichol sun like phoebus apollo has arrows for rays on the reverse side they will paint the progress of the sun through the four quarters of the sky the journey is symbolized by a large crosslike figure with a central circle for midday round the edge are beehiveshaped mounds these represent the hills of earth the red and yellow dots that surround the hills are cornfields the crosses on the hills are signs of wealth and money on some of the disks birds and scorpions are painted and on one are curving lines which mean rain these disks are deposited on the altar of the godhouse and left and then all is well the intention might be to us obscure but a huichol indian would read it thus father sun with his broad shield or face and his arrows rises in the east bringing money and wealth to the huichols his heat and the light from his rays make the corn to grow but he is asked not to interfere with the clouds that are gathering on the hills now is this art or ritual it is both and neither we distinguish between a form of prayer and a work of art and count them in no danger of confusion but the huichol goes back to that earlier thing a presentation he utters expresses his thought about the sun and his emotion about the sun and his relation to the sun and if prayer is the souls sincere desire he has painted a prayer it is not a little curious that the same notion comes out in the old greek word for prayer euch the greek when he wanted help in trouble from the saviours the dioscuri carved a picture of them and if he was a sailor added a ship underneath he inscribed the word euch it was not to begin with a vow paid it was a presentation of his strong inner desire it was a sculptured prayer ritual then involves imitation but does not arise out of it it desires to recreate an emotion not to reproduce an object a rite is indeed we shall later see p 42 a sort of stereotyped action not really practical but yet not wholly cut loose from practice a reminiscence or an anticipation of actual practical doing it is fitly though not quite correctly called by the greeks a dromenon a thing done at the bottom of art as its motive power and its mainspring lies not the wish to copy nature or even improve on herthe huichol indian does not vainly expend his energies on an effort so fruitlessbut rather an impulse shared by art with ritual the desire that is to utter to give out a strongly felt emotion or desire by representing by making or doing or enriching the object or act desired the common source of the art and ritual of osiris is the intense worldwide desire that the life of nature which seemed dead should live again this common emotional factor it is that makes art and ritual in their beginnings wellnigh indistinguishable both to begin with copy an act but not at first for the sake of the copy only when the emotion dies down and is forgotten does the copy become an end in itself a mere mimicry it is this downward path this sinking of making to mimicry that makes us nowadays think of ritual as a dull and formal thing because a rite has ceased to be believed in it does not in the least follow that it will cease to be done we have to reckon with all the huge forces of habit the motor nerves once set in one direction given the slightest impulse tend always to repeat the same reaction we mimic not only others but ourselves mechanically even after all emotion proper to the act is dead and then because mimicry has a certain ingenious charm it becomes an end in itself for ritual even for art it is not easy as we saw to classify the huichol prayerdisks as prayers they are ritual as surfaces decorated they are specimens of primitive art in the next chapter we shall have to consider a kind of ceremony very instructive for our point but again not very easy to classifythe pantomimic dances which are almost all over the world so striking a feature in savage social and religious life are they to be classed as ritual or art these pantomime dances lie indeed at the very heart and root of our whole subject and it is of the first importance that before going further in our analysis of art and ritual we should have some familiarity with their general character and gist the more so as they are a class of ceremonies now practically extinct we shall find in these dances the meetingpoint between art and ritual or rather we shall find in them the rude inchoate material out of which both ritual and art at least in one of its forms developed moreover we shall find in pantomimic dancing a ritual bridge as it were between actual life and those representations of life which we call art in our next chapter therefore we shall study the ritual dance in general and try to understand its psychological origin in the following chapter iii we shall take a particular dance of special importance the spring dance as practised among various primitive peoples we shall then be prepared to approach the study of the spring dance among the greeks which developed into their drama and thereby to we hope throw light on the relation between ritual and art footnotes 1 adonis attis osiris2 p 324 2 vit nik 13 3 rep x 5969 4 ch lumholtz symbolism of the huichol indians in mem

pictured as a being of strange perversity apt to bow down to gods of wood and stone the question why he acted thus foolishly was never raised it was just his blindness the light of the gospel had not yet reached him nowadays the savage has become material not only for conversion and hymnwriting but for scientific observation we want to understand his psychology ie how he behaves not merely for his sake that we may abruptly and despotically convert or reform him but for our own sakes partly of course for sheer love of knowing but alsosince we realize that our own behaviour is based on instincts kindred to hisin order that by understanding his behaviour we may understand and it may be better our own anthropologists who study the primitive peoples of today find that the worship of false gods bowing down to wood and stone bulks larger in the mind of the hymnwriter than in the mind of the savage we look for temples to heathen idols we find dancingplaces and ritual dances the savage is a man of action instead of asking a god to do what he wants done he does it or tries to do it himself instead of prayers he utters spells in a word he practises magic and above all he is strenuously and frequently engaged in dancing magical dances when a savage wants sun or wind or rain he does not go to church and prostrate himself before a false god he summons his tribe and dances a sun dance or a wind dance or a rain dance when he would hunt and catch a bear he does not pray to his god for strength to outwit and outmatch the bear he rehearses his hunt in a bear dance here again we have some modern prejudice and misunderstanding to overcome dancing is to us a light form of recreation practised by the quite young from sheer joie de vivre and essentially inappropriate to the mature but among the tarahumares of mexico the word nolvoa means both to work and to dance an old man will reproach a young man saying why do you not go and work nolvoa he means why do you not dance instead of looking on it is strange to us to learn that among savages as a man passes from childhood to youth from youth to mature manhood so the number of his dances increase and the number of these dances is the measure pari passu of his social importance finally in extreme old age he falls out he ceases to exist because he cannot dance his dance and with it his social status passes to another and a younger magical dancing still goes on in europe today in swabia and among the transylvanian saxons it is a common custom says dr frazer5 for a man who has some hemp to leap high in the field in the belief that this will make the hemp grow tall in many parts of germany and austria the peasant thinks he can make the flax grow tall by dancing or leaping high or by jumping backwards from a table the higher the leap the taller will be the flax that year there is happily little possible doubt as to the practical reason of this mimic dancing when macedonian farmers have done digging their fields they throw their spades up into the air and catching them again exclaim may the crop grow as high as the spade has gone in some parts of eastern russia the girls dance one by one in a large hoop at midnight on shrove tuesday the hoop is decked with leaves flowers and ribbons and attached to it are a small bell and some flax while dancing within the hoop each girl has to wave her arms vigorously and cry flax grow or words to that effect when she has done she leaps out of the hoop or is lifted out of it by her partner is this art we shall unhesitatingly answer no is it ritual with some hesitation we shall probably again answer no it is we think not a rite but merely a superstitious practice of ignorant men and women but take another instance among the omaha indians of north america when the corn is withering for want of rain the members of the sacred buffalo society fill a large vessel with water and dance four times round it one of them drinks some of the water and spirts it into the air making a fine spray in imitation of mist or drizzling rain then he upsets the vessel spilling the water on the ground whereupon the dancers fall down and drink up the water getting mud all over their faces this saves the corn now probably any dispassionate person would describe such a ceremonial as an interesting instance of primitive ritual the sole difference between the two types is that in the one the practice is carried on privately or at least unofficially in the other it is done publicly by a collective authorized body officially for the public good the distinction is one of high importance but for the moment what concerns us is to see the common factor in the two sets of acts what is indeed their source and mainspring in the case of the girl dancing in the hoop and leaping out of it there is no doubt the words she says flax grow prove the point she does what she wants done her intense desire finds utterance in an act she obeys the simplest possible impulse let anyone watch an exciting game of tennis or better still perhaps a game of billiards he will find himself doing in sheer sympathy the thing he wants done reaching out a tense arm where the billiard cue should go raising an unoccupied leg to help the suspended ball over the net sympathetic magic is modern psychology teaches us in the main and at the outset not the outcome of intellectual illusion not even the exercise of a mimetic instinct but simply in its ultimate analysis an utterance a discharge of emotion and longing but though the utterance of emotion is the prime and moving it is not the sole factor we may utter emotion in a prolonged howl we may even utter it in a collective prolonged howl yet we should scarcely call this ritual still less art it is true that a prolonged collective howl will probably because it is collective develop a rhythm a regular recurrence and hence probably issue in a kind of ritual music but for the further stage of development into art another step is necessary we must not only utter emotion we must represent it that is we must in some way reproduce or imitate or express the thought which is causing us emotion art is not imitation but art and also ritual frequently and legitimately contain an element of imitation plato was so far right what exactly is imitated we shall see when we come to discuss the precise difference between art and ritual the greek word for a rite as already noted is dromenon a thing doneand the word is full of instruction the greek had realized that to perform a rite you must do something that is you must not only feel something but express it in action or to put it psychologically you must not only receive an impulse you must react to it the word for rite dromenon thing done arose of course not from any psychological analysis but from the simple fact that rites among the primitive greeks were things done mimetic dances and the like it is a fact of cardinal importance that their word for theatrical representation drama is own cousin to their word for rite dromenon drama also means thing done greek linguistic instinct pointed plainly to the fact that art and ritual are near relations to this fact of crucial importance for our argument we shall return later but from the outset it should be borne in mind that in these two greek words dromenon and drama in their exact meaning their relation and their distinction we have the keynote and clue to our whole discussion for the moment we have to note that the greek word for rite dromenon thing done is not strictly adequate it omits a factor of prime importance it includes too much and not enough all things done are not rites you may shrink back from a blow that is the expression of an emotion that is a reaction to a stimulus but that is not a rite you may digest your dinner that is a thing done and a thing of high importance but it is not a rite one element in the rite we have already observed and that is that it be done collectively by a number of persons feeling the same emotion a meal digested alone is certainly no rite a meal eaten in common under the influence of a common emotion may and often does tend to become a rite collectivity and emotional tension two elements that tend to turn the simple reaction into a rite arespecially among primitive peoplesclosely associated indeed scarcely separable the individual among savages has but a thin and meagre personality high emotional tension is to him only caused and maintained by a thing felt socially it is what the tribe feels that is sacred that is matter for ritual he may make by himself excited movements he may leap for joy for fear but unless these movements are made by the tribe together they will not become rhythmical they will probably lack intensity and certainly permanence intensity then and collectivity go together and both are necessary for ritual but both may be present without constituting art we have not yet touched the dividing line between art and ritual when and how does the dromenon the rite done pass over into the drama the genius of the greek language felt before it consciously knew the difference this feeling ahead for distinctions is characteristic of all languages as has been well shown by mr pearsall smith6 in another manual of our series it is an instinctive process arising independently of reason though afterwards justified by it what then is the distinction between art and ritual which the genius of the greek language felt after when it used the two words dromenon and drama for two different sorts of things done to answer our question we must turn for a brief moment to psychology the science of human behaviour we are accustomed for practical convenience to divide up our human nature into partitionsintellect will the emotions the passionswith further subdivisions eg of the intellect into reason imagination and the like these partitions we are apt to arrange into a sort of order of merit or as it is called a hierarchy with reason as head and crown and under her sway the emotions and passions the result of establishing this hierarchy is that the impulsive side of our nature comes off badly the passions and even the emotions lying under a certain ban this popular psychology is really a convenient and perhaps indispensable mythology reason the emotions and the will have no more separate existences than jupiter juno and minerva a more fruitful way of looking at our human constitution is to see it not as a bundle of separate faculties but as a sort of continuous cycle of activities what really happens is putting it very roughly something of this sort to each one of us the world is or seems to be eternally divided into two halves on the one side is ourself on the other all the rest of things all our action our behaviour our life is a relation between these two halves and that behaviour seems to have three not divisions but stages the outside world the other half the object if we like so to call it acts upon us gets at us through our senses we hear or see or taste or feel something to put it roughly we perceive something and as we perceive it so instantly we feel about it towards it we have emotion and instantly again that emotion becomes a motivepower we react towards the object that got at us we want to alter it or our relation to it if we did not perceive we should not feel if we did not feel we should not act when we talkas we almost must talkof reason the emotions or the passions and the will leading to action we think of the three stages or aspects of our behaviour as separable and even perhaps hostile we want perhaps to purge the intellect from all infection of the emotions but in reality though at a given moment one or the other element knowing feeling or acting may be dominant in our consciousness the rest are always immanent when we think of the three elements or stages knowing feeling striving as all being necessary factors in any complete bit of human behaviour we no longer try to arrange them in a hierarchy with knowing or reason at the head knowingthat is receiving and recognizing a stimulus from withoutwould seem to come first we must be acted on before we can react but priority confers no supremacy we can look at it another way perceiving is the first rung on the ladder that leads to action feeling is the second action is the topmost rung the primary goal as it were of all the climbing for the purpose of our discussion this is perhaps the simplest way of looking at human behaviour movement then action is as it were the goal and the end of thought perception finds its natural outlet and completion in doing but here comes in a curious consideration important for our purpose in animals in so far as they act by instinct as we say perception knowing is usually followed immediately and inevitably by doing by such doing as is calculated to conserve the animal and his species but in some of the higher animals and especially in man where the nervous system is more complex perception is not instantly transformed into action there is an interval for choice between several possible actions perception is pent up and becomes helped by emotion conscious representation now it is psychologists tell us just in this interval this space between perception and reaction this momentary halt that all our mental life our images our ideas our consciousness and assuredly our religion and our art is built up if the cycle of knowing feeling acting were instantly fulfilled that is if we were a mass of wellcontrived instincts we should hardly have dromena and we should certainly never pass from dromena to drama art and religion though perhaps not wholly ritual spring from the incomplete cycle from unsatisfied desire from perception and emotion that have somehow not found immediate outlet in practical action when we come later to establish the dividing line between art and ritual we shall find this fact to be cardinal we have next to watch how out of representation repeated there grows up a kind of abstraction which helps the transition from ritual to art when the men of a tribe return from a hunt a journey a battle or any event that has caused them keen and pleasant emotion they will often react their doings round the campfire at night to an attentive audience of women and young boys the cause of this worldwide custom is no doubt in great part the desire to repeat a pleasant experience the battle or the hunt will not be reenacted unless it has been successful together with this must be reckoned a motive seldom absent from human endeavour the desire for selfexhibition selfenhancement but in this reenactment we see at once lies the germ of history and of commemorative ceremonial and also oddly enough an impulse emotional in itself begets a process we think of as characteristically and exclusively intellectual the process of abstraction the savage begins with the particular battle that actually did happen but it is easy to see that if he reenacts it again and again the particular battle or hunt will be forgotten the representation cuts itself loose from the particular action from which it arose and becomes generalized as it were abstracted like children he plays not at a funeral but at funerals not at a battle but at battles and so arises the wardance or the deathdance or the huntdance this will serve to show how inextricably the elements of knowing and feeling are intertwined so too with the element of action if we consider the occasions when a savage dances it will soon appear that it is not only after a battle or a hunt that he dances in order to commemorate it but before once the commemorative dance has got abstracted or generalized it becomes material for the magical dance the dance predone a tribe about to go to war will work itself up by a war dance about to start out hunting they will catch their game in pantomime here clearly the main emphasis is on the practical the active doingelement in the cycle the dance is as it were a sort of precipitated desire a discharge of pentup emotion into action in both these kinds of dances the dance that commemorates by representing and the dance that anticipates by prepresenting plato would have seen the element of imitation what the greeks called mimesis which we saw he believed to be the very source and essence of all art in a sense he would have been right the commemorative dance does especially represent it reproduces the past hunt or battle but if we analyse a little more closely we see it is not for the sake of copying the actual battle itself but for the emotion felt about the battle this they desire to relive the emotional element is seen still more clearly in the dance foredone for magical purposes success in war or in the hunt is keenly intensely desired the hunt or the battle cannot take place at the moment so the cycle cannot complete itself the desire cannot find utterance in the actual act it grows and accumulates by inhibition till at last the exasperated nerves and muscles can bear it no longer it breaks out into mimetic anticipatory action but and this is the important point the action is mimetic not of what you see done by another but of what you desire to do yourself the habit of this mimesis of the thing desired is set up and ritual begins ritual then does imitate but for an emotional not an altogether practical end plato never saw a savage wardance or a huntdance or a raindance and it is not likely that if he had seen one he would have allowed it to be art at all but he must often have seen a class of performances very similar to which unquestionably he would give the name of art he must have seen plays like those of aristophanes with the chorus dressed up as birds or clouds or frogs or wasps and he might undoubtedly have claimed such plays as evidence of the rightness of his definition here were men imitating birds and beasts dressed in their skins and feathers mimicking their gestures for his own days his judgment would have been unquestionably right but again if we look at the beginning of things we find an origin and an impulse much deeper vaguer and more emotional the beast dances found widespread over the savage world took their rise when men really believed what st francis tried to preach that beasts and birds and fishes were his little brothers or rather perhaps more strictly he felt them to be his great brothers and his fathers for the attitude of the australian towards the kangaroo the north american towards the grizzly bear is one of affection tempered by deep religious awe the beast dances look back to that early phase of civilization which survives in crystallized form in what we call totemism totem means tribe but the tribe was of animals as well as men in the kangaroo tribe there were real leaping kangaroos as well as menkangaroos the menkangaroos when they danced and leapt did it not to imitate kangaroosyou cannot imitate yourselfbut just for natural joy of heart because they were kangaroos they belonged to the kangaroo tribe they bore the tribal marks and delighted to assert their tribal unity what they felt was not mimesis but participation unity and community later when man begins to distinguish between himself and his strange fellowtribesmen to realize that he is not a kangaroo like other kangaroos he will try to revive his old faith his old sense of participation and oneness by conscious imitation thus though imitation is not the object of these dances it grows up in and through them it is the same with art the origin of art is not mimesis but mimesis springs up out of art out of emotional expression and constantly and closely neighbours it art and ritual are at the outset alike in this that they do not seek to copy a fact but to reproduce to reenact an emotion we shall see this more clearly if we examine for a moment this greek word mimesis we translate mimesis by imitation and we do very wrongly the word mimesis means the action or doing of a person called a mime now a mime was simply a person who dressed up and acted in a pantomime or primitive drama he was roughly what we should call an actor and it is significant that in the word actor we stress not imitating but acting doing just what the greek stressed in his words dromenon and drama the actor dresses up puts on a mask wears the skin of a beast or the feathers of a bird not as we have seen to copy something or some one who is not himself but to emphasize enlarge enhance his own personality he masquerades he does not mimic the celebrants in the very primitive ritual of the mountainmother in thrace were we know called mimes in the fragment of his lost play schylus after describing the din made by the mountain gear of the mother the maddening hum of the bombykes a sort of spinningtop the clash of the brazen cymbals and the twang of the strings thus goes on and bullvoices roar thereto from somewhere out of the unseen fearful mimes and from a drum an image as it were of thunder underground is borne on the air heavy with dread here we have undoubtedly some sort of bullroaring thunderand windmaking ceremony like those that go on in australia today the mimes are not mimicking thunder out of curiosity they are making it and enacting and uttering it for magical purposes when a sailor wants a wind he makes it or as he later says he whistles for it when a savage or a greek wants thunder to bring rain he makes it becomes it but it is easy to see that as the belief in magic declines what was once intense desire issuing in the making of or the being of a thing becomes mere copying of it the mime the maker sinks to be in our modern sense the mimic as faith declines folly and futility set in the earnest zealous act sinks into a frivolous mimicry a sort of childsplay footnotes 5 these instances are all taken from the golden bough3 the magic art i 139 ff 6 the english language home university library p 28 chapter iii seasonal rites the spring festival we have seen in the last chapter that whatever interests primitive man whatever makes him feel strongly he tends to reenact any one of his manifold occupations hunting fighting later ploughing and sowing provided it be of sufficient interest and importance is material for a dromenon or rite we have also seen that weak as he is in individuality it is not his private and personal emotions that tend to become ritual but those that are public felt and expressed officially that is by the whole tribe or community it is further obvious that such dances when they develop into actual rites tend to be performed at fixed times we have now to consider when and why the element of fixity and regular repetition in rites cannot be too strongly emphasized it is a factor of paramount importance essential to the development from ritual to art from dromenon to drama the two great interests of primitive man are food and children as dr frazer has well said if man the individual is to live he must have food if his race is to persist he must have children to live and to cause to live to eat food and to beget children these were the primary wants of man in the past and they will be the primary wants of men in the future so long as the world lasts other things may be added to enrich and beautify human life but unless these wants are first satisfied humanity itself must cease to exist these two things therefore food and children were what men chiefly sought to procure by the performance of magical rites for the regulation of the seasons they are the very foundationstones of that ritual from which art if we are right took its rise from this need for food sprang seasonal periodic festivals the fact that festivals are seasonal constantly recurrent solidifies makes permanent and as already explained p 42 in a sense intellectualizes and abstracts the emotion that prompts them the seasons are indeed only of value to primitive man because they are related as he swiftly and necessarily finds out to his food supply he has it would seem little sensitiveness to the sthetic impulse of the beauty of a spring morning to the pathos of autumn what he realizes first and foremost is that at certain times the animals and still more the plants which form his food appear at certain others they disappear it is these times that become the central points the focuses of his interest and the dates of his religious festivals these dates will vary of course in different countries and in different climates it is therefore idle to attempt a study of the ritual of a people without knowing the facts of their climate and surroundings in egypt the food supply will depend on the rise and fall of the nile and on this rise and fall will depend the ritual and calendar of osiris and yet treatises on egyptian religion are still to be found which begin by recounting the rites and mythology of osiris as though these were primary and then end with a corollary to the effect that these rites and this calendar were associated with the worship of osiris or even worse still instituted by the religion of osiris the nile regulates the food supply of egypt the monsoon that of certain south pacific islands the calendar of egypt depends on the nile of the south pacific islands on the monsoon in his recent introduction to mathematics7 dr whitehead has pointed out how the whole life of nature is dominated by the existence of periodic events the rotation of the earth produces successive days the path of the earth round the sun leads to the yearly recurrence of the seasons the phases of the moon are recurrent and though artificial light has made these phases pass almost unnoticed today in climates where the skies are clear human life was largely influenced by moonlight even our own bodily life with its recurrent heartbeats and breathings is essentially periodic8 the presupposition of periodicity is indeed fundamental to our very conception of life and but for periodicity the very means of measuring time as a quantity would be absent periodicity is fundamental to certain departments of mathematics that is evident it is perhaps less evident that periodicity is a factor that has gone to the making of ritual and hence as we shall see of art and yet this is manifestly the case all primitive calendars are ritual calendars successions of feastdays a patchwork of days of different quality and character recurring pattern at least is based on periodicity but there is another and perhaps more important way in which periodicity affects and in a sense causes ritual we have seen already that out of the space between an impulse and a reaction there arises an idea or presentation a presentation is indeed it would seem in its final analysis only a delayed intensified desirea desire of which the active satisfaction is blocked and which runs over into a presentation an image conceived presented what we call an idea is as it were an act prefigured ritual acts then which depend on the periodicity of the seasons are acts necessarily delayed the thing delayed expected waited for is more and more a source of value more and more apt to precipitate into what we call an idea which is in reality but the projected shadow of an unaccomplished action more beautiful it may be but comparatively bloodless yet capable in its turn of acting as an initial motor impulse in the cycle of activity it will later p 70 be seen that these periodic festivals are the stuff of which those faded unaccomplished actions and desires which we call godsattis osiris dionysosare made to primitive man as we have seen beast and bird and plant and himself were not sharply divided and the periodicity of the seasons was for all it will depend on mans social and geographical conditions whether he notices periodicity most in plants or animals if he is nomadic he will note the recurrent births of other animals and of human children and will connect them with the lunar year but it is at once evident that at least in mediterranean lands and probably everywhere it is the periodicity of plants and vegetation generally which depends on moisture that is most striking plants die down in the heat of summer trees shed their leaves in autumn all nature sleeps or dies in winter and awakes in spring sometimes it is the dying down that attracts most attention this is very clear in the rites of adonis which are though he rises again essentially rites of lamentation the details of the ritual show this clearly and specially as already seen in the cult of osiris for the gardens of adonis the women took baskets or pots filled with earth and in them as children sow cress nowadays they planted wheat fennel lettuce and various kinds of flowers which they watered and tended for eight days in hot countries the seeds sprang up rapidly but as the plants had no roots they withered quickly away at the end of the eight days they were carried out with the images of the dead adonis and thrown with them into the sea or into springs the gardens of adonis became the type of transient loveliness and swift decay what waste would it be says plutarch9 what inconceivable waste for god to create man had he not an immortal soul he would be like the women who make little gardens not less pleasant than the gardens of adonis in earthen pots and pans so would our souls blossom and flourish but for a day in a soft and tender body of flesh without any firm and solid root of life and then be blasted and put out in a moment celebrated at midsummer as they were and as the gardens were thrown into water it is probable that the rites of adonis may have been at least in part a raincharm in the long summer droughts of palestine and babylonia the longing for rain must often have been intense enough to provoke expression and we remember p 19 that the sumerian tammuz was originally dumuziabsu true son of the waters water is the first need for vegetation gardens of adonis are still in use in the madras presidency10 at the marriage of a brahman seeds of five or nine sorts are mixed and sown in earthen pots which are made specially for the purpose and are filled with earth bride and bridegroom water the seeds both morning and evening for four days and on the fifth day the seedlings are thrown like the real gardens of adonis into a tank or river seasonal festivals with one and the same intentthe promotion of fertility in plants animals and manmay occur at almost any time of the year at midsummer as we have seen we may have raincharms in autumn we shall have harvest festivals in late autumn and early winter among pastoral peoples we shall have festivals like that of martinmas for the blessing and purification of flocks and herds when they come in from their summer pasture in midwinter there will be a christmas festival to promote and protect the suns heat at the winter solstice but in southern europe to which we mainly owe our drama and our art the festival most widely celebrated and that of which we know most is the spring festival and to that we must turn the spring is to the greek of today the noixis the opening and it was in spring and with rites of spring that both greek and roman originally began their year it was this spring festival that gave to the greek their god dionysos and in part his drama in cambridge on may day two or three puzzled and weary little boys and girls are still to be sometimes seen dragging round a perambulator with a doll on it bedecked with ribbons and a flower or two that is all that is left in most parts of england of the queen of the may and jackinthegreen though here and there a maypole survives and is resuscitated by enthusiasts about folkdances but in the days of good queen bess merry england it would seem was lustier the puritan stubbs in his anatomie of abuses11 thus describes the festival they have twentie or fortie yoke of oxen every oxe havyng a sweete nosegaie of flowers tyed on the tippe of his hornes and these oxen draw home this maiepoole this stinckying idoll rather which is covered all over with flowers and hearbes bound round aboute with stringes from the top to the bottome and sometyme painted with variable colours with two or three hundred men women and children following it with great devotion and thus beyng reared up with handkerchiefes and flagges streaming on the toppe they strewe the ground about binde greene boughs about it set up summer haules bowers and arbours hard by it and then fall they to banquet and feast to leap and daunce aboute it as the heathen people did at the dedication of their idolles whereof this is a perfect patterne or rather the thyng itself the stern old puritan was right the maypole was the perfect pattern of a heathen idoll or rather the thyng itself he would have exterminated it root and branch but other and perhaps wiser divines took the maypole into the service of the christian church and still12 on may day in saffron walden the spring song is heard with its christian moral a branch of may we have brought you and at your door it stands it is a sprout that is well budded out the work of our lords hands the maypole was of course at first no pole cut down and dried the gist of it was that it should be a sprout well budded out the object of carrying in the may was to bring the very spirit of life and greenery into the village when this was forgotten idleness or economy would prompt the villagers to use the same tree or branch year after year in the villages of upper bavaria dr frazer13 tells us the maypole is renewed once every three four or five years it is a firtree fetched from the forest and amid all the wreaths flags and inscriptions with which it is bedecked an essential part is the bunch of dark green foliage left at the top as a memento that in it we have to do not with a dead pole but with a living tree from the greenwood at the ritual of may day not only was the fresh green bough or tree carried into the village but with it came a girl or a boy the queen or king of the may sometimes the tree itself as in russia is dressed up in womans clothes more often a real man or maid covered with flowers and greenery walks with the tree or carries the bough thus in thuringia14 as soon as the trees begin to be green in spring the children assemble on a sunday and go out into the woods where they choose one of their playmates to be little leaf man they break branches from the trees and twine them about the child till only his shoes are left peeping out two of the other children lead him for fear he should stumble they take him singing and dancing from house to house asking for gifts of food such as eggs cream sausages cakes finally they sprinkle the leaf man with water and feast on the food such a leaf man is our english jackinthegreen a chimneysweeper who as late as 1892 was seen by dr rouse walking about at cheltenham encased in a wooden framework covered with greenery the bringing in of the new leafage in the form of a tree or flowers is one and perhaps the simplest form of spring festival it takes little notice of death and winter uttering and emphasizing only the desire for the joy in life and spring but in other and severer climates the emotion is fiercer and more complex it takes the form of a struggle or contest what the greeks called an agon thus on may day in the isle of man a queen of the may was chosen and with her twenty maids of honour together with a troop of young men for escort but there was not only a queen of the may but a queen of winter a man dressed as a woman loaded with warm clothes and wearing a woollen hood and fur tippet winter too had attendants like the queen of the may the two troops met and fought and whichever queen was taken prisoner had to pay the expenses of the feast in the isle of man the real gist of the ceremony is quite forgotten it has become a mere play but among the esquimaux15 there is still carried on a similar rite and its magical intent is clearly understood in autumn when the storms begin and the long and dismal arctic winter is at hand the central esquimaux divide themselves into two parties called the ptarmigans and the ducks the ptarmigans are the people born in winter the ducks those born in summer they stretch out a long rope of sealskin the ducks take hold of one end the ptarmigans of the other then comes a tugofwar if the ducks win there will be fine weather through the winter if the ptarmigans bad this autumn festival might of course with equal magical intent be performed in the spring but probably autumn is chosen because with the dread of the arctic ice and snow upon them the fear of winter is stronger than the hope of spring the intense emotion towards the weather which breaks out into these magical agones or contests is not very easy to realize the weather to us nowadays for the most part damps a days pleasuring or raises the price of fruit and vegetables but our main supplies come to us from other lands and other weathers and we find it hard to think ourselves back into the state when a bad harvest meant starvation the intensely practical attitude of man towards the seasons the way that many of these magical dramatic ceremonies rose straight out of the emotion towards the foodsupply would perhaps never have been fully realized but for the study of the foodproducing ceremonies of the central australians the central australian spring is not the shift from winter to summer from cold to heat but from a long arid and barren season to a season short and often irregular in recurrence of torrential rain and sudden fertility the dry steppes of central australia are the scene of a marvellous transformation in the dry season all is hot and desolate the ground has only patches of wiry scrub with an occasional parched acacia tree all is stones and sand there is no sign of animal life save for the thousand anthills then suddenly the rainy season sets in torrents fill the rivers and the sandy plain is a sheet of water almost as suddenly the rain ceases the streams dry up sucked in by the thirsty ground and as though literally by magic a luxuriant vegetation bursts forth the desert blossoms as a rose insects lizards frogs birds chirp frisk and chatter no plant or animal can live unless it live quickly the struggle for existence is keen and short it seems as though the change came and life was born by magic and the primitive australian takes care that magic should not be wanting and magic of the most instructive kind as soon as the season of fertility approaches he begins his rites with the avowed object of making and multiplying the plants and chiefly the animals by which he lives he paints the figure of the emu on the sand with vermilion drawn from his own blood he puts on emu feathers and gazes about him vacantly in stupid fashion like an emu bird he makes a structure of boughs like the chrysalis of a witchetty grubhis favourite food and drags his body through it in pantomime gliding and shuffling to promote its birth here difficult and intricate though the ceremonies are and uncertain in meaning as many of the details must probably always remain the main emotional gist is clear it is not that the australian wonders at and admires the miracle of his spring the bursting of the flowers and the singing of birds it is not that his heart goes out in gratitude to an allfather who is the giver of all good things it is that obedient to the push of life within him his impulse is towards food he must eat that he and his tribe may grow and multiply it is this his will to live that he utters and represents the savage utters his will to live his intense desire for food but it should be noted it is desire and will and longing not certainty and satisfaction that he utters in this respect it is interesting to note that his rites and ceremonies when periodic are of fairly long periods winter and summer are not the only natural periodic cycles there is the cycle of day and night and yet among primitive peoples but little ritual centres round day and night the reason is simple the cycle of day and night is so short it recurs so frequently that man naturally counted upon it and had no cause to be anxious the emotional tension necessary to ritual was absent a few peoples eg the egyptians have practised daily incantations to bring back the sun probably they had at first felt a real tension of anxiety and thenbeing a people hidebound by customhad gone on from mere conservatism where the sun returns at a longer interval and is even as among the esquimaux hidden for the long space of six months ritual inevitably arises they play at catscradle to catch the ball of the sun lest it should sink and be lost for ever round the moon whose cycle is long but not too long ritual very early centred but probably only when its supposed influence on vegetation was first surmised the moon as it were practises magic herself she waxes and wanes and with her man thinks all the vegetable kingdom waxes and wanes too all but the lawless onion the moon plutarch16 tells us is fertile in its light and contains moisture it is kindly to the young of animals and to the new shoots of plants even bacon17 held that observations of the moon with a view to planting and sowing and the grafting of trees were not altogether frivolous it cannot too often be remembered that primitive man has but little if any interest in sun and moon and heavenly bodies for their inherent beauty or wonder he cares for them he holds them sacred he performs rites in relation to them mainly when he notes that they bring the seasons and he cares for the seasons mainly because they bring him food a season is to him as a hora was at first to the greeks the fruits of a season what our farmers would call a good year the sun then had no ritual till it was seen that he led in the seasons but long before that was known it was seen that the seasons were annual that they went round in a ring and because that annual ring was long in revolving great was mans hope and fear in the winter great his relief and joy in the spring it was literally a matter of death and life and it was as death and life that he sometimes represented it as we have seen in the figures of adonis and osiris adonis and osiris have their modern parallels who leave us in no doubt as to the meaning of their figures thus on the 1st of march in thringen a ceremony is performed called driving out the death the young people make up a figure of straw dress it in old clothes carry it out and throw it into the river then they come back tell the good news to the village and are given eggs and food as a reward in bohemia the children carry out a straw puppet and burn it while they are burning it they sing now carry we death out of the village the new summer into the village welcome dear summer green little corn in other parts of bohemia the song varies it is not summer that comes back but life we have carried away death and brought back life in both these cases it is interesting to note that though death is dramatically carried out the coming back of life is only announced not enacted often and it would seem quite naturally the puppet representing death or winter is reviled and roughly handled or pelted with stones and treated in some way as a sort of scapegoat but in not a few cases and these are of special interest it seems to be the seat of a sort of magical potency which can be and is transferred to the figure of summer or life thus causing as it were a sort of resurrection in lusatia the women only carry out the death they are dressed in black themselves as mourners but the puppet of straw which they dress up as the death wears a white shirt they carry it to the village boundary followed by boys throwing stones and there tear it to pieces then they cut down a tree and dress it in the white shirt of the death and carry it home singing so at the feast of the ascension in transylvania after morning service the girls of the village dress up the death they tie a threshedout sheaf of corn into a rough copy of a head and body and stick a broomstick through the body for arms then they dress the figure up in the ordinary holiday clothes of a peasant girla red hood silver brooches and ribbons galore they put the death at an open window that all the people when they go to vespers may see it vespers over two girls take the death by the arms and walk in front the rest follow they sing an ordinary church hymn having wound through the village they go to another house shut out the boys strip the death of its clothes and throw the straw body out of the window to the boys who fling it into a river then one of the girls is dressed in the deaths discarded clothes and the procession again winds through the village the same hymn is sung thus it is clear that the girl is a sort of resuscitated death this resurrection aspect this passing of the old into the new will be seen to be of great ritual importance when we come to dionysos and the dithyramb these ceremonies of death and life are more complex than the simple carrying in of green boughs or even the dancing round maypoles when we have these figures these impersonations we are getting away from the merely emotional dance from the domain of simple psychological motor discharge to something that is very like rude art at all events to personification on this question of personification in which so much of art and religion has its roots it is allimportant to be clear in discussions on such primitive rites as carrying out the death bringing in summer we are often told that the puppet of the girl is carried round buried burnt brought back because it personifies the spirit of vegetation or it embodies the spirit of summer the spirit of vegetation is incarnate in the puppet we are led by this way of speaking to suppose that the savage or the villager first forms an idea or conception of a spirit of vegetation and then later embodies it we naturally wonder that he should perform a mental act so high and difficult as abstraction a very little consideration shows that he performs at first no abstraction at all abstraction is foreign to his mental habit he begins with a vague excited dance to relieve his emotion that dance has probably almost from the first a leader the dancers choose an actual person and he is the root and ground of personification there is nothing mysterious about the process the leader does not embody a previously conceived idea rather he begets it from his personality springs the personification the abstract idea arises from the only thing it possibly can arise from the concrete fact without perception there is no conception we noted in speaking of dances p 43 how the dance got generalized how from many commemorations of actual hunts and battles there arose the hunt dance and the war dance so from many actual living personal may queens and deaths from many actual men and women decked with leaves or trees dressed up as men and women arises the tree spirit the vegetation spirit the death at the back then of the fact of personification lies the fact that the emotion is felt collectively the rite is performed by a band or chorus who dance together with a common leader round that leader the emotion centres when there is an act of carryingout or bringingin he either is himself the puppet or he carries it emotion is of the whole band dramadoingtends to focus on the leader this leader this focus is then remembered thought of imaged from being perceived year by year he is finally conceived but his basis is always in actual fact of which he is but the reflection had there been no periodic festivals personification might long have halted but it is easy to see that a recurrent perception helps to form a permanent abstract conception the different actual recurrent may kings and deaths because they recur get a sort of permanent life of their own and become beings apart in this way a conception a kind of daimon or spirit is fashioned who dies and lives again in a perpetual cycle the periodic festival begets a kind of not immortal but perennial god yet the faculty of conception is but dim and feeble in the mind even of the peasant today his function is to perceive the actual fact year by year and to feel about it perhaps a simple instance best makes this clear the greek church does not gladly suffer images in the round though she delights in pictureimages eikons but at her great spring festival of easter she makes in the remote villages concession to a strong perhaps imperative popular need she allows an image an actual idol of the dead christ to be laid in the tomb that it may rise again a traveller in euboea18 during holy week had been struck by the genuine grief shown at the good friday services on easter eve there was the same general gloom and despondency and he asked an old woman why it was she answered of course i am anxious for if christ does not rise tomorrow we shall have no corn this year the old womans state of mind is fairly clear her emotion is the old emotion not sorrow for the christ the son of mary but fear imminent fear for the failure of food the christ again is not the historical christ of juda still less the incarnation of the godhead proceeding from the father he is the actual figure fashioned by his village chorus and laid by the priests the leaders of that chorus in the local sepulchre so far then we have seen that the vague emotional dance tends to become a periodic rite performed at regular intervals the periodic rite may occur at any date of importance to the foodsupply of the community in summer in winter at the coming of the annual rains or the regular rising of a river among mediterranean peoples both in ancient days and at the present time the spring festival arrests attention having learnt the general characteristics of this spring festival we have now to turn to one particular case the spring festival of the greeks this is allimportant to us because as will be seen from the ritual of this and kindred festivals arose we believe a great form of art the greek drama footnotes 7 chapter xii periodicity in nature 8 ibid 9 de ser num 17 10 frazer adonis attis and osiris3 p 200 11 quoted by dr frazer the golden bough2 p 203 12 ek chambers the medival stage i p 169 13

p 573 chapter iv the spring festival in greece the tragedies of schylus sophocles and euripides were performed at athens at a festival known as the great dionysia this took place early in april so that the time itself makes us suspect that its ceremonies were connected with the spring but we have more certain evidence aristotle in his treatise on the art of poetry raises the question of the origin of the drama he was not specially interested in primitive ritual beast dances and spring mummeries might even have seemed to him mere savagery the lowest form of imitation but he divined that a structure so complex as greek tragedy must have arisen out of a simpler form he saw or felt in fact that art had in some way risen out of ritual and he has left us a memorable statement in describing the carryingout of summer we saw that the element of real drama real impersonation began with the leaders of the band with the queen of the may and with the death or the winter great is our delight when we find that for greek drama aristotle19 divined a like beginning he says tragedyas also comedywas at first mere improvisationthe one tragedy originated with the leaders of the dithyramb the further question faces us what was the dithyramb we shall find to our joy that this obscuresounding dithyramb though before aristotles time it had taken literary form was in origin a festival closely akin to those we have just been discussing the dithyramb was to begin with a spring ritual and when aristotle tells us tragedy arose out of the dithyramb he gives us though perhaps half unconsciously a clear instance of a splendid art that arose from the simplest of rites he plants our theory of the connection of art with ritual firmly with its feet on historical ground when we use the word dithyrambic we certainly do not ordinarily think of spring we say a style is dithyrambic when it is unmeasured too ornate impassioned flowery the greeks themselves had forgotten that the word dithyramb meant a leaping inspired dance but they had not forgotten on what occasion that dance was danced pindar wrote a dithyramb for the dionysiac festival at athens and his song is full of springtime and flowers he bids all the gods come to athens to dance flowercrowned look upon the dance olympians send us the grace of victory ye gods who come to the heart of our city where many feet

the fragrant spring then then are flung over the immortal earth lovely petals of pansies and roses are amid our hair and voices of song are loud among the pipes the dancingfloors are loud with the calling of crowned semele bromios he of the loud cry is a title of dionysos semele is his mother the earth we keep her name in nova zembla new earth the song might have been sung at a carryingin of summer the hor the seasons a chorus of maidens lead in the figure of spring the queen of the may and they call to mother earth to wake to rise up from the earth flowercrowned you may bring back the life of the spring in the form of a tree or a maiden or you may summon her to rise from the sleeping earth in greek mythology we are most familiar with the risingup form persephone the daughter of demeter is carried below the earth and rises up again year by year on greek vasepaintings20 the scene occurs again and again a mound of earth is represented sometimes surmounted by a tree out of the mound a womans figure rises and all about the mound are figures of dancing dmons waiting to welcome her all this is not mere late poetry and art it is the primitive art and poetry that come straight out of ritual out of actual things done dromena in the village of megara near athens the very place where today on easter tuesday the hills are covered with throngs of dancing men and specially women pausanias21 saw near the city hearth a rock called anaklethra place of callingup because if any one will believe it when she was wandering in search of her daughter demeter called her up there and he adds the women to this day perform rites analogous to the story told these rites of calling up must have been spring rites in which in some pantomimic dance the uprising of the earth spirit was enacted another festival of uprising is perhaps more primitive and instructive because it is near akin to the carrying out of winter and also because it shows clearly the close connection of these rites with the foodsupply plutarch22 tells us of a festival held every nine years at delphi it was called from the name of the puppet used charila a word which originally meant springmaiden and is connected with the russian word yaro spring and is also akin to the greek charis grace in the sense of increase give us all grace the rites of charila the gracious one the springmaiden were as follows the king presided and made a distribution in public of grain and pulse to all both citizens and strangers and the childimage of charila is brought in when they had all received their share the king struck the image with his sandal the leader of the thyiades lifted the image and took it away to a precipitous place and there tied a rope round the neck of the image and buried it mr calderon has shown that very similar rites go on today in bulgaria in honour of yarilo the spring god the image is beaten insulted let down into some cleft or cave it is clearly a carrying out the death though we do not know the exact date at which it was celebrated it had its sequel in another festival at delphi called herois or the heroine plutarch23 says it was too mystical and secret to describe but he lets us know the main gist most of the ceremonies of the herois have a mystical reason which is known to the thyiades but from the rites that are done in public one may conjecture it to be a bringing up of semele some one or something a real woman or more likely the buried puppet charila the springmaiden was brought up from the ground to enact and magically induce the coming of spring these ceremonies of beating driving out burying have all with the greeks as with the savage and the modern peasant but one real object to get rid of the season that is bad for food to bring in and revive the new supply this comes out very clearly in a ceremony that went on down to plutarchs time and he tells us24 it was ancestral it was called the driving out of oxhunger by oxhunger was meant any great ravenous hunger and the very intensity and monstrosity of the word takes us back to days when famine was a grim reality when plutarch was archon he had as chief official to perform the ceremony at the prytaneion or common hearth a slave was taken beaten with rods of a magical plant and driven out of doors to the words out with oxhunger in with wealth and health here we see the actual sensation or emotion of ravenous hunger gets a name and thereby a personality though a less completely abstracted one than death or summer we do not know that the ceremony of driving out oxhunger was performed in the spring it is only instanced here because more plainly even than the charila when the king distributes pulse and peas it shows the relation of ancient mimic ritual to foodsupply if we keep clearly in mind the object rather than the exact date of the spring song we shall avoid many difficulties a dithyramb was sung at delphi through the winter months which at first seems odd but we must remember that among agricultural peoples the performance of magical ceremonies to promote fertility and the food supply may begin at any moment after the earth is ploughed and the seed sown the sowing of the seed is its death and burial that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die when the death and burial are once accomplished the hope of resurrection and new birth begins and with the hope the magical ceremonies that may help to fulfil that hope the sun is newborn in midwinter at the solstice and our new year follows yet it is in the spring that to this day we keep our great resurrection festival we return to our argument holding steadily in our minds this connection the dithyramb is a spring song at a spring festival and the importance of the spring festival is that it magically promotes the foodsupply do we know any more about the dithyramb happily yes and the next point is as curious as significant pindar in one of his odes asks a strange question whence did appear the graces of dionysos with the bulldriving dithyramb scholars have broken their own heads and one anothers to find a meaning and an answer to the odd query it is only quite lately that they have come at all to see that the dithyramb was a spring song a primitive rite formerly it was considered to be a rather elaborate form of lyric poetry invented comparatively late but even allowing it is the spring song are we much further why should the dithyramb be bulldriving how can driving a bull help the spring to come and above all what are the slenderankled graces doing helping to drive the great unwieldy bull the difficulty about the graces or charites as the greeks called them is soon settled they are the seasons or hours and the chief season or hour was spring herself they are called charites or graces because they are in the words of the collect the givers of all grace that is of all increase physical and spiritual but why do they want to come driving in a bull it is easy to see why the givers of all grace lead the dithyramb the spring song their coming with their fruits in due season is the very gist of the dithyramb but why is the dithyramb bulldriving is this a mere poetical epithet if it is it is not particularly poetical but pindar is not we now know merely being poetical which amounts according to some scholars to meaning anything or nothing he is describing alluding to an actual rite or dromenon in which a bull is summoned and driven to come in spring about that we must be clear plutarch the first anthropologist wrote a little treatise called greek questions in which he tells us all the strange outoftheway rites and customs he saw in greece and then asks himself what they meant in his 36th question he asks why do the women of elis summon dionysos in their hymns to be present with them with his bullfoot and then by a piece of luck that almost makes ones heart stand still he gives us the very words of the little ritual hymn the women sang our earliest bulldriving spring song in springtime25 o dionysos to thy holy temple come to elis with thy graces rushing with thy bullfoot come noble bull noble bull it is a strange primitive picturethe holy women standing in springtime in front of the temple summoning the bull and the bull garlanded and filleted rushing towards them driven by the graces probably three real women three queens of the may wreathed and flowerbedecked but what does it mean plutarch tries to answer his own question and half in a dim confused fashion succeeds is it he suggests that some entitle the god as born of a bull and as a bull himself or is it that many hold the god is the beginner of sowing and ploughing we have seen how a kind of daimon or spirit of winter or summer arose from an actual tree or maid or man disguised year by year as a tree did the god dionysos take his rise in like fashion from the driving and summoning year by year of some holy bull first we must notice that it was not only at elis that a holy bull appears at the spring festival plutarch asks another instructive question26 who among the delphians is the sanctifier and we find to our amazement that the sanctifier is a bull a bull who not only is holy himself but is so holy that he has power to make others holy he is the sanctifier and most important for us he sanctifies by his death in the month bysios the month that fell plutarch tells us at the beginning of spring the time of the blossoming of many plants we do not hear that the sanctifier at delphi was driven but in all probability he was led from house to house that every one might partake in the sanctity that simply exuded from him at magnesia27 a city of asia minor we have more particulars there at the annual fair year by year the stewards of the city bought a bull the finest that could be got and at the new moon of the month at the beginning of seedtime they dedicated it for the citys welfare the bulls sanctified life began with the opening of the agricultural year whether with the spring or the autumn ploughing we do not know the dedication of the bull was a high solemnity he was led in procession at the head of which went the chief priest and priestess of the city with them went a herald and the sacrificer and two bands of youths and maidens so holy was the bull that nothing unlucky might come near him the youths and maidens must have both their parents alive they must not have been under the taboo the infection of death the herald pronounced aloud a prayer for the safety of the city and the land and the citizens and the women and children for peace and wealth and for the bringing forth of grain and of all the other fruits and of cattle all this longing for fertility for food and children focuses round the holy bull whose holiness is his strength and fruitfulness the bull thus solemnly set apart charged as it were with the luck of the whole people is fed at the public cost the official charged with his keep has to drive him into the marketplace and it is good for those cornmerchants who give the bull grain as a gift good for them because they are feeding nurturing the luck of the state which is their own luck so through autumn and winter the bull lives on but early in april the end comes again a great procession is led forth the senate and the priests walk in it and with them come representatives of each class of the statechildren and young boys and youths just come to manhood epheboi as the greeks called them the bull is sacrificed and why why must a thing so holy die why not live out the term of his life he dies because he is so holy that he may give his holiness his strength his life just at the moment it is holiest to his people when they shall have sacrificed the bull let them divide it up among those who took part in the procession the mandate is clear the procession included representatives of the whole state the holy flesh is not offered to a god it is eatento every man his portionby each and every citizen that he may get his share of the strength of the bull of the luck of the state now at magnesia after the holy civic communion the meal shared we hear no more next year a fresh bull will be chosen and the cycle begin again but at athens at the annual oxmurder the bouphonia as it was called the scene did not so close the ox was slain with all solemnity and all those present partook of the flesh and thenthe hide was stuffed with straw and sewed up and next the stuffed animal was set on its feet and yoked to a plough as though it were ploughing the death is followed by a resurrection now this is allimportant we are so accustomed to think of sacrifice as the death the giving up the renouncing of something but sacrifice does not mean death at all it means making holy sanctifying and holiness was to primitive man just special strength and life what they wanted from the bull was just that special life and strength which all the year long they had put into him and nourished and fostered that life was in his blood they could not eat that flesh nor drink that blood unless they killed him so he must die but it was not to give him up to the gods that they killed him not to sacrifice him in our sense but to have him keep him eat him live by him and through him by his grace and so this killing of the sacred beast was always a terrible thing a thing they fain would have shirked they fled away after the deed not looking backwards they publicly tried and condemned the axe that struck the blow but their best hope their strongest desire was that he had not could not really have died so this intense desire uttered itself in the dromenon of his resurrection if he did not rise again how could they plough and sow again next year he must live again he should he did the athenians were a little ashamed of their oxmurder with its grotesque pantomime of the stuffed resurrected beast just so some of us nowadays are getting a little shy of deliberately cursing our neighbours on ash wednesday they probably did not feel very keenly about their foodsupply they thought their daily dinner was secure anyhow the emotion that had issued in the pantomime was dead though from sheer habit the pantomime went on probably some of the less educated among them thought there might be something in it and anyhow it was as well to be on the safe side the queer ceremony had got associated with the worship of olympian zeus and with him you must reckon then perhaps your brotherinlaw was the oxstriker and anyhow it was desirable that the women should go some of the wellborn girls had to act as watercarriers the oxmurder was obsolete at athens but the spirit of the rite is alive today among the ainos in the remote island of saghalien among the ainos the bear is what psychologists rather oddly call the main food focus the chief value centre and well he may be bears flesh is the ainos staple food they eat it both fresh and salted bearskins are their principal clothing part of their taxes are paid in bears fat the aino men spend the autumn winter and spring in hunting the bear yet we are told the ainos worship the bear they apply to it the name kamui which has been translated god but it is a word applied to all strangers and so only means what catches attention and hence is formidable in the religion of the ainos the bear plays a chief part says one writer the bear receives idolatrous veneration says another they worship it after their fashion says a third have we another case of the heathen in his blindness only here he bows down not to gods of wood and stone but to a live thing uncouth shambling but graciousa bear instead of theorizing as to what the aino thinks and imagines let us observe his doings his dromena his rites and most of all his great spring and autumn rite the dromenon of the bear we shall find that detail for detail it strangely resembles the greek dromenon of the bull as winter draws to a close among the ainos a young bear is trapped and brought into the village at first an aino woman suckles him at her breast then later he is fed on his favourite food fishhis tastes are semipolar when he is at his full strength that is when he threatens to break the cage in which he lives the feast is held this is usually in september or october that is when the season of bearhunting begins before the feast begins the ainos apologize profusely saying that they have been good to the bear they can feed him no longer they must kill him then the man who gives the bearfeast invites his relations and friends and if the community be small nearly the whole village attends on the occasion described by dr scheube about thirty ainos were present men women and children all dressed in their best clothes the woman of the house who had suckled the bear sat by herself sad and silent only now and then she burst into helpless tears the ceremony began with libations made to the firegod and to the housegod set up in a corner of the house next the master and some of the guests left the hut and offered libations in front of the bears cage a few drops were presented to him in a saucer which he promptly upset then the women and girls danced round the cage rising and hopping on their toes and as they danced they clapped their hands and chanted a monotonous chant the mother and some of the old women cried as they danced and stretched out their arms to the bear calling him loving names the young women who had nursed no bears laughed after the manner of the young the bear began to get upset and rushed round his cage howling lamentably next came a ceremony of special significance which is never omitted at the sacrifice of a bear libations were offered to the inabos sacred wands which stand outside the aino hut these wands are about two feet high and are whittled at the top into spiral shavings five new wands with bamboo leaves attached to them are set up for the festival the leaves according to the ainos mean that the bear may come to life again these wands are specially interesting the chief focus of attention is of course the bear because his flesh is for the aino his staple food but vegetation is not quite forgotten the animal life of the bear and the vegetable life of the bambooleaves are thought of together then comes the actual sacrifice the bear is led out of his cage a rope is thrown round his neck and he is perambulated round the neighbourhood of the hut we do not hear that among the ainos he goes in procession round the village but among the gilyaks not far away in eastern siberia the bear is led about the villages and it is held to be specially important that he should be dragged down to the river for this will ensure the village a plentiful supply of fish he is then among the gilyaks taken to each hut in the village and fish brandy and other delicacies are offered to him some of the people prostrate themselves in front of him and his coming into a house brings a blessing and if he snuffs at the food that brings a blessing too to return to the aino bear while he is being led about the hut the men headed by a chief shoot at the bear with arrows tipped with buttons but the object of the shooting is not to kill only apparently to irritate him he is killed at last without shedding of his sacred blood and we hope without much pain he is taken in front of the sacred wands a stick placed in his mouth and nine men press his neck against a beam he dies without a sound meantime the women and girls who stand behind the men dance lament and beat the men who are killing their bear the body of the dead bear is then laid on a mat before the sacred wands a sword and quiver taken from the wands are hung about the bear if it is a shebear it is also bedecked with a necklace and rings food and drink millet broth and millet cakes are offered to it it is decked as an aino it is fed as an aino it is clear that the bear is in some sense a human bear an aino the men sit down on mats in front of the bear and offer libations and themselves drink deep now that the death is fairly over the mourning ends and all is feasting and merriment even the old women lament no more cakes of millet are scrambled for the bear is skinned and disembowelled the trunk is severed from the head to which the skin is left hanging the blood which might not be shed before is now carefully collected in cups and eagerly drunk by the men for the blood is the life the liver is cut up and eaten raw the flesh and the rest of the vitals are kept for the day next but one when it is divided among all persons present at the feast it is what the greeks call a dais a meal divided or distributed while the bear is being dismembered the girls dance in front of the sacred wands and the old women again lament the bears brain is extracted from his head and eaten and the skull severed from the skin is hung on a pole near the sacred wands thus it would seem the life and strength of the bear is brought near to the living growth of the leaves the stick with which the bear was gagged is also hung on the pole and with it the sword and quiver he had worn after his death the whole congregation men and women dance about this strange maypole and a great drinking bout in which all men and women alike join ends the feast the rite varies as to detail in different places among the gilyaks the bear is dressed after death in full gilyak costume and seated on a bench of honour in one part the bones and skull are carried out by the oldest people to a place in the forest not far from the village there all the bones except the skull are buried after that a young tree is felled a few inches above the ground its stump is cleft and the skull wedged into the cleft when the grass grows over the spot the skull disappears and there is an end of the bear sometimes the bears flesh is eaten in special vessels prepared for this festival and only used at it these vessels which include bowls platters spoons are elaborately carved with figures of bears and other devices through all varieties in detail the main intent is the same and it is identical with that of the rite of the holy bull in greece and the maypole of our forefathers great is the sanctity of the bear or the bull or the tree the bear for a hunting people the bull for nomads later for agriculturists the tree for a forest folk on the bear and the bull and the tree are focussed the desire of the whole people bear and bull and tree are sacred that is set apart because full of a special life and strength intensely desired they are led and carried about from house to house that their sanctity may touch all and avail for all the animal dies that he may be eaten the tree is torn to pieces that all may have a fragment and above all bear and bull and tree die only that they may live again we have seen p 71 that out of the puppet or the may queen actually perceived year after year there arose a remembrance a mental image an imagined tree spirit or summer or death a thing never actually seen but conceived just so with the bull year by year in the various villages of greece was seen an actual holy bull and bit by bit from the remembrance of these various holy bulls who only died to live again each year there arose the image of a bullspirit or bulldaimon and finally if we like to call him so a bullgod the growth of this idea this conception must have been much helped by the fact that in some places the dancers attendant on the holy bull dressed up as bulls and cows the women worshippers of dionysos we are told wore bulls horns in imitation of the god for they represented him in pictures as having a bulls head we know that a man does not turn into a bull or a bull into a man the line of demarcation is clearly drawn but the rustic has no such conviction even today that crone his aged aunt may any day come in at the window in the shape of a black cat why should she not it is not then that a god takes upon him the form of a bull or is incarnate in a bull but that the real bull and the worshipper dressed as a bull are seen and remembered and give rise to an imagined bullgod but it should be observed only among gifted imaginative that is imagemaking peoples the ainos have their actual holy bear as the greeks had their holy bull but with them out of the succession of holy bears there arises alas no beargod we have dwelt long on the bulldriving dithyramb because it was not obvious on the face of it how driving a bull could help the coming of spring we understand now why on the day before the tragedies were performed at athens the young men epheboi brought in not only the human figure of the god but also a bull worthy of the god we understand too why in addition to the tragedies performed at the great festival dithyrambs were also sungbulldriving dithyrambs we come next to a third aspect of the dithyramb and one perhaps the most important of all for the understanding of art and especially the drama the dithyramb was the song and dance of the new birth plato is discussing various sorts of odes or songs some he says are prayers to the godsthese are called hymns others of an opposite sort might best be called dirges another sort are pans and anotherthe birth of dionysos i supposeis called dithyramb plato is not much interested in dithyrambs to him they are just a particular kind of choral song it is doubtful if he even knew that they were spring songs but this he did know though he throws out the information carelesslythe dithyramb had for its proper subject the birth or coming to be the genesis of dionysos the common usage of greek poetry bears out platos statement when a poet is going to describe the birth of dionysos he calls the god by the title dithyrambos thus an inscribed hymn found at delphi28 opens thus come o dithyrambos bacchos come bromios come and coming with thee bring holy hours of thine own holy spring all the stars danced for joy mirth of mortals hailed thee bacchos at thy birth the dithyramb is the song of the birth and the birth of dionysos is in the spring the time of the maypole the time of the holy bull and now we come to a curious thing we have seen how a spirit a dmon and perhaps ultimately a god develops out of an actual rite dionysos the treegod the spirit of vegetation is but a maypole once perceived then remembered and conceived dionysos the bullgod is but the actual holy bull himself or rather the succession of annual holy bulls once perceived then remembered generalized conceived but the god conceived will surely always be made in the image the mental image of the fact perceived if then we have a song and dance of the birth of dionysos shall we not as in the christian religion have a childgod a holy babe a saviour in the manger at first in original form as a calf then as a human child now it is quite true that in greek religion there is a babe dionysos called liknites him of the cradle29 the rite of waking up or bringing to light the child liknites was performed each year at delphi by the holy women but it is equally clear and certain that the dionysos of greek worship and of the drama was not a babe in the cradle he was a goodly youth in the first bloom of manhood with the down upon his cheek the time when homer says youth is most gracious this is the dionysos that we know in statuary the fair dreamy youth sunk in reverie this is the dionysos whom pentheus despised and insulted because of his young beauty like a womans but how could such a dionysos arise out of a rite of birth he could not and he did not the dithyramb is also the song of the second or new birth the dithyrambos is the twiceborn this the greeks themselves knew by a false etymology they explained the word dithyrambos as meaning he of the double door their word thyra being the same as our door they were quite mistaken dithyrambos modern philology tells us is the divine leaper dancer and lifegiver but their false etymology is important to us because it shows that they believed the dithyrambos was the twiceborn dionysos was born they fabled once of his mother like all men once of his fathers thigh like no man but if the dithyrambos the young dionysos like the bullgod the treegod arises from a dromenon a rite what is the rite of second birth from which it arises we look in vain among our village customs if ever rite of second birth existed it is dead and buried we turn to anthropology for help and find this the rite of the second birth widespread universal over half the savage world with the savage to be twice born is the rule not the exception by his first birth he comes into the world by his second he is born into his tribe at his first birth he belongs to his mother and the womenfolk at his second he becomes a fullfledged man and passes into the society of the warriors of his tribe this second birth is a little difficult for us to realize a boy with us passes very gradually from childhood to manhood there is no definite moment when he suddenly emerges as a man little by little as his education advances he is admitted to the social privileges of the circle in which he is born he goes to school enters a workshop or a university and finally adopts a trade or a profession in the case of girls in whose upbringing primitive savagery is apt to linger there is still in certain social strata a ceremony known as coming out a girls dress is suddenly lengthened her hair is put up she is allowed to wear jewels she kisses her sovereigns hand a dance is given in her honour abruptly from her seclusion in the cocoon state of the schoolroom she emerges fullblown into society but the custom with its halfrealized savagery is already dying and with boys it does not obtain at all both sexes share of course the religious rite of confirmation to avoid harsh distinctions to bridge over abrupt transitions is always a mark of advancing civilization but the savage in his ignorance and fear lamentably overstresses distinctions and transitions the long process of education of passing from child to man is with him condensed into a few days weeks or sometimes months of tremendous educational emphasisof what is called initiation going in that is entering the tribe the ceremonies vary but the gist is always substantially the same the boy is to put away childish things and become a grown and competent tribesman above all he is to cease to be a womanthing and become a man his initiation prepares him for his two chief functions as a tribesmanto be a warrior to be a father that to the savage is the main if not the whole duty of man this initiation is of tremendous importance and we should expect what in fact we find that all this emotion that centres about it issues in dromena rites done these rites are very various but they all point one moral that the former things are passed away and that the newborn man has entered on a new life simplest perhaps of all and most instructive is the rite practised by the kikuyu of british east africa30 who require that every boy just before circumcision must be born again the mother stands up with the boy crouching at her feet she pretends to go through all the labour pains and the boy on being reborn cries like a babe and is washed more often the new birth is simulated or imagined as a death and a resurrection either of the boys themselves or of some one else in their presence thus at initiation among some tribes of southeast australia31 when the boys are assembled an old man dressed in stringy bark fibre lies down in a grave he is covered up lightly with sticks and earth and the grave is smoothed over the buried man holds in his hand a small bush which seems to be growing from the ground and other bushes are stuck in the ground round about the novices are then brought to the edge of the grave and a song is sung gradually as the song goes on the bush held by the buried man begins to quiver it moves more and more and bit by bit the man himself starts up from the grave the fijians have a drastic and repulsive way of simulating death the boys are shown a row of seemingly dead men their bodies covered with blood and entrails which are really those of a dead pig the first gives a sudden yell up start the men and then run to the river to cleanse themselves here the death is vicarious another goes through the simulated death that the initiated boy may have new life but often the mimicry is practised on the boys themselves thus in west ceram32 boys at puberty are admitted to the kakian association the boys are taken blindfold followed by their relations to an oblong wooden shed under the darkest trees in the depths of the forest when all are assembled the high priest calls aloud on the devils and immediately a hideous uproar is heard from the shed it is really made by men in the shed with bamboo trumpets but the women and children think it is the devils then the priest enters the shed with the boys one at a time a dull thud of chopping is heard a fearful cry rings out and a sword dripping with blood is thrust out through the roof this is the token that the boys head has been cut off and that the devil has taken him away to the other world whence he will return born again in a day or two the men who act as sponsors to the boys return daubed with mud and in a halffainting state like messengers from another world they bring the good news that the devil has restored the boys to life the boys themselves appear but when they return they totter as they walk they go into the house backwards if food is given them they upset the plate they sit dumb and only make signs the sponsors have to teach them the simplest daily acts as though they were newborn children at the end of twenty to thirty days during which their mothers and sisters may not comb their hair the high priest takes them to a lonely place in the forest and cuts off a lock of hair from the crown of each of their heads at the close of these rites the boys are men and may marry sometimes the new birth is not simulated but merely suggested a new name is given a new language taught a new dress worn new dances are danced almost always it is accompanied by moral teaching thus in the kakian ceremony already described the boys have to sit in a row crosslegged without moving a muscle with their hands stretched out the chief takes a trumpet and placing the mouth of it on the hand of each lad he speaks through it in strange tones imitating the voice of spirits he warns the boys on pain of death to observe the rules of the society and never to reveal what they have seen in the kakian house the priests also instruct the boys on their duty to their blood relations and teach them the secrets of the tribe sometimes it is not clear whether the new birth is merely suggested or represented in pantomime thus among the binbinga of north australia it is generally believed that at initiation a monstrous being called katajalina like the kronos of the greeks swallows the boys and brings them up again initiated but whether there is or is not a dromenon or rite of swallowing we are not told in totemistic societies and in the animal secret societies that seem to grow out of them the novice is born again as the sacred animal thus among the carrier indians33 when a man wants to become a lulem or bear however cold the season he tears off his clothes puts on a bearskin and dashes into the woods where he will stay for three or four days every night his fellowvillagers will go out in search parties to find him they cry out yi kelulem come on bear and he answers with angry growls usually they fail to find him but he comes back at last himself he is met and conducted to the ceremonial lodge and there in company with the rest of the bears dances solemnly his first appearance disappearance and reappearance is as common a rite in initiation as simulated killing and resurrection and has the same object both are rites of transition of passing from one state to another it has often been remarked by students of ancient greek and other ceremonies that the rites of birth marriage and death which seem to us so different are to primitive man oddly similar this is explained if we see that in intent they are all the same all a passing from one social state to another there are but two factors in every rite the putting off of the old the putting on of the new you carry out winter or death you bring in summer or life between them is a midway state when you are neither here nor there you are secluded under a taboo to the greeks and to many primitive peoples the rites of birth marriage and death were for the most part family rites needing little or no social emphasis but the rite which concerned the whole tribe the essence of which was entrance into the tribe was the rite of initiation at puberty this allimportant fact is oddly and significantly enshrined in the greek language the general greek word for rite was telete it was applied to all mysteries and sometimes to marriages and funerals but it has nothing to do with death it comes from a root meaning to grow up the word telete means rite of growing up becoming complete it meant at first maturity then rite of maturity then by a natural extension any rite of initiation that was mysterious the rites of puberty were in their essence mysterious because they consisted in initiation into the sanctities of the tribe the things which society sanctioned and protected excluding the uninitiated whether they were young boys women or members of other tribes then by contagion the mystery notion spread to other rites we understand now who and what was the god who arose out of the rite the dromenon of tribal initiation the rite of the new the second birth he was dionysos his name according to recent philology tells usdionysos divine young man when once we see that out of the emotion of the rite and the facts of the rite arises that remembrance and shadow of the rite that image which is the god we realize instantly that the god of the spring rite must be a young god and in primitive societies where young women are but of secondary account he will necessarily be a young man where emotion centres round tribal initiation he will be a young man just initiated what the greeks called a kouros or ephebos a youth of quite different social status from a mere pais or boy such a youth survives in our king of the may and jackinthegreen old men and women are for death and winter the young for life and spring and most of all the young man or bear or bull or tree just come to maturity and because life is one at the spring festival the young man carries a blossoming branch bound with wool of the young sheep at athens in spring and autumn alike they carry out the eiresione a branch of olive wound about with wool and laden with all sorts of firstfruits that scarcity may cease and they sing over it eiresione brings figs and fat cakes and a pot of honey and oil to mix and a winecup strong and deep that she may drink and sleep the eiresione had another name that told its own tale it was called korythalia34 branch of blooming youth the young men says a greek orator are the spring of the people the excavations of crete have given to us an ancient inscribed hymn a dithyramb we may safely call it that is at once a springsong and a young mansong the god here invoked is what the greeks call a kouros a young man it is sung and danced by young warriors ho kouros most great i give thee hail lord of all that is wet and gleaming thou art come at the head of thy daimones to dikt for the year oh march and rejoice in the dance and song the leader of the band of kouroi of young men the real actual leader has become by remembrance and abstraction as we noted a daimon or spirit at the head of a band of spirits and he brings in the new year at spring the real leader the first kouros as the greeks called him is there in the body but from the succession of leaders year by year they have imaged a spirit leader greatest of all he is lord of all that is wet and gleaming for the may bough we remember is drenched with dew and water that it may burgeon and blossom then they chant the tale of how of old a child was taken away from its mother taken by armed men to be initiated armed men dancing their tribal dance the stone is unhappily broken here but enough remains to make the meaning clear and because this boy grew up and was initiated into manhood the hor seasons began to be fruitful year by year and dik to possess mankind and all wild living things were held about by wealthloving peace we know the seasons the fruit and food bringers but dik is strange we translate the word justice but dik means not justice as between man and man but the order of the world the way of life it is through this way this order that the seasons go round as long as the seasons observe this order there is fruitfulness and peace if once that order were overstepped then would be disorder strife confusion barrenness and next comes a mandate strange to our modern ears to us also leap for full jars and leap for fleecy flocks and leap for fields of fruit and for hives to bring increase and yet not strange if we remember the macedonian farmer p 32 who throws his spade into the air that the wheat may be tall or the russian peasant girls who leap high in the air crying flax grow the leaping of the youths of the cretan hymn is just the utterance of their tense desire they have grown up and with them all live things must grow by their magic year by year the fruits of the earth come to their annual new birth and that there be no mistake they end leap for our cities and leap for our seaborne ships and for our young citizens and for goodly themis they are now young citizens of a fencd city instead of young tribesmen of the bush but their magic is the same and the strength that holds them together is the bond of social custom social structure goodly themis no man liveth to himself crete is not athens but at athens in the theatre of dionysos if the priest of dionysos seated at the great spring festival in his beautiful carved central seat looked across the orchestra he would see facing him a stone frieze on which was sculptured the cretan ritual the armed dancing youths and the child to be year by year reborn we have seen what the dithyramb from which sprang the drama was a spring song a song of bulldriving a song and dance of second birth but all this seems perhaps not to bring us nearer to greek drama rather to put us farther away what have the spring and the bull and the birth rite to do with the stately tragedies we knowwith agamemnon and iphigenia and orestes and hippolytos that is the question before us and the answer will lead us to the very heart of our subject so far we have seen that ritual arose from the presentation and emphasis of emotionemotion felt mainly about food we have further seen that ritual develops out of and by means of periodic festivals one of the chief periodic festivals at athens was the spring festival of the dithyramb out of this dithyramb arose aristotle says tragedythat is out of ritual arose art how and why that is the question before us footnotes 19

performance according perhaps more to their temperament than to their training they are either very much excited or very much bored in many minds there will be left a feeling that whether they have enjoyed the play or not they are puzzled there are odd effects conventions suggestions for example the main deed of the tragedy the slaying of hero or heroine is not done on the stage that disappoints some modern minds unconsciously avid of realism to the point of horror instead of a fine thrilling murder or suicide before his very eyes the spectator is put off with an account of the murder done off the stage this account is regularly given and usually at considerable length in a messengers speech the messengers speech is a regular item in a greek play and though actually it gives scope not only for fine elocution but for real dramatic effect in theory we feel it undramatic and a modern actor has sometimes much ado to make it acceptable the spectator is told that all these to him odd conventions are due to greek restraint moderation good taste and yet for all their supposed restraint and reserve he finds when he reads his homer that greek heroes frequently burst into floods of tears when a selfrespecting englishman would have suffered in silence then again specially if the play be by euripides it ends not with a curtain not with a great decisive moment but with the appearance of a god who says a few lines of either exhortation or consolation or reconciliation which after the strain and stress of the action itself strikes some people as rather stilted and formal or as rather flat and somehow unsatisfying worse still there are in many of the scenes long dialogues in which the actors wrangle with each other and in which the action does not advance so quickly as we wish or again instead of beginning with the action and having our curiosity excited bit by bit about the plot at the outset some one comes in and tells us the whole thing in the prologue prologues we feel are out of date and the greeks ought to have known better or again of course we admit that tragedy must be tragic and we are prepared for a decent amount of lamentation but when an antiphonal lament goes on for pages we weary and wish that the chorus would stop lamenting and do something at the back of our modern discontent there is lurking always this queer anomaly of the chorus we have in our modern theatre no chorus and when in the opera something of the nature of a chorus appears in the ballet it is a chorus that really dances to amuse and excite us in the intervals of operatic action it is not a chorus of doddering and pottering old men moralizing on an action in which they are too feeble to join of course if we are classical scholars we do not cavil at the choral songs the extreme difficulty of scanning and construing them alone commands a traditional respect but if we are merely modern spectators we may be respectful we may even feel strangely excited but we are certainly puzzled the reason of our bewilderment is simple enough these prologues and messengers speeches and everpresent choruses that trouble us are ritual forms still surviving at a time when the drama has fully developed out of the dromenon we cannot here examine all these ritual forms in detail35 one however the chorus strangest and most beautiful of all it is essential we should understand suppose that these choral songs have been put into english that in any way represents the beauty of the greek then certainly there will be some among the spectators who get a thrill from the chorus quite unknown to any modern stage effect a feeling of emotion heightened yet restrained a sense of entering into higher places filled with a larger and a purer aira sense of beauty born clean out of conflict and disaster a suspicion dawns upon the spectator that great though the tragedies in themselves are they owe their peculiar their incommunicable beauty largely to this element of the chorus which seemed at first so strange now by examining this chorus and understanding its functionnay more by considering the actual orchestra the space on which the chorus danced and the relation of that space to the rest of the theatre to the stage and the place where the spectators satwe shall get light at last on our main central problem how did art arise out of ritual and what is the relation of both to that actual life from which both art and ritual sprang the dramas of schylus certainly and perhaps also those of sophocles and euripides were played not upon the stage and not in the theatre but strange though it sounds to us in the orchestra the theatre to the greeks was simply the place of seeing the place where the spectators sat what they called the skene or scene was the tent or hut in which the actors dressed but the kernel and centre of the whole was the orchestra the circular dancingplace of the chorus and as the orchestra was the kernel and centre of the theatre so the chorus the band of dancing and singing menthis chorus that seems to us so odd and even superfluouswas the centre and kernel and startingpoint of the drama the chorus danced and sang that dithyramb we know so well and from the leaders of that dithyramb we remember tragedy arose and the chorus were at first as an ancient writer tells us just men and boys tillers of the earth who danced when they rested from sowing and ploughing now it is in the relation between the orchestra or dancingplace of the chorus and the theatre or place of the spectators a relation that shifted as time went on that we see mirrored the whole development from ritual to artfrom dromenon to drama the orchestra on which the dithyramb was danced was just a circular dancingplace beaten flat for the convenience of the dancers and sometimes edged by a stone basement to mark the circle this circular orchestra is very well seen in the theatre of epidaurus of which a sketch is given in fig 1 the orchestra here is surrounded by a splendid theatron or spectator place with seats rising tier above tier if we want to realize the primitive greek orchestra or dancingplace we must think these stone seats away threshingfloors are used in greece today as convenient dancingplaces the dance tends to be circular because it is round some sacred thing at first a maypole or the reaped corn later the figure of a god or his altar on this dancingplace the whole body of worshippers would gather just as nowadays the whole community will assemble on a village green there is no division at first between actors and spectators all are actors all are doing the thing done dancing the dance danced thus at initiation ceremonies the whole tribe assembles the only spectators are the uninitiated the women and children no one at this early stage thinks of building a theatre a spectator place it is in the common act the common or collective emotion that ritual starts this must never be forgotten illustration fig 1 theatre of epidaurus showing circular orchestra the most convenient spot for a mere dancingplace is some flat place but any one who travels through greece will notice instantly that all the greek theatres that remain at athens at epidaurus at delos syracuse and elsewhere are built against the side of hills none of these are very early the earliest ancient orchestra we have is at athens it is a simple stone ring but it is built against the steep south side of the acropolis the oldest festival of dionysos was as will presently be seen held in quite another spot in the agora or marketplace the reason for moving the dance was that the wooden seats that used to be set up on a sort of grand stand in the marketplace fell down and it was seen how safely and comfortably the spectators could be seated on the side of a steep hill the spectators are a new and different element the dance is not only danced but it is watched from a distance it is a spectacle whereas in old days all or nearly all were worshippers acting now many indeed most are spectators watching feeling thinking not doing it is in this new attitude of the spectator that we touch on the difference between ritual and art the dromenon the thing actually done by yourself has become a drama a thing also done but abstracted from your doing let us look for a moment at the psychology of the spectator at his behaviour artists it is often said and usually felt are so unpractical they are always late for dinner they forget to post their letters and to return the books or even money that is lent them art is to most peoples minds a sort of luxury not a necessity in but recently bygone days music drawing and dancing were no part of a training for ordinary life they were taught at school as accomplishments paid for as extras poets on their side equally used to contrast art and life as though they were things essentially distinct art is long and time is fleeting now commonplaces such as these being unconscious utterances of the collective mind usually contain much truth and are well worth weighing art we shall show later is profoundly connected with life it is nowise superfluous but for all that art both its creation and its enjoyment is unpractical thanks be to god life is not limited to the practical when we say art is unpractical we mean that art is cut loose from immediate action take a simple instance a manor perhaps still better a childsees a plate of cherries through his senses comes the stimulus of the smell of the cherries and their bright colour urging him luring him to eat he eats and is satisfied the cycle of normal behaviour is complete he is a man or a child of action but he is no artist and no artlover another man looks at the same plate of cherries his sight and his smell lure him and urge him to eat he does not eat the cycle is not completed and because he does not eat the sight of those cherries though perhaps not the smell is altered purified from desire and in some way intensified enlarged if he is just a man of taste he will take what we call an sthetic pleasure in those cherries if he is an actual artist he will paint not the cherries but his vision of them his purified emotion towards them he has so to speak come out from the chorus of actors of cherryeaters and become a spectator i borrow by his kind permission a beautiful instance of what he well calls psychical distance from the writings of a psychologist36 imagine a fog at sea for most people it is an experience of acute unpleasantness apart from the physical annoyance and remoter forms of discomfort such as delays it is apt to produce feelings of peculiar anxiety fears of invisible dangers strains of watching and listening for distant and unlocalized signals the listless movements of the ship and her warning calls soon tell upon the nerves of the passengers and that special expectant tacit anxiety and nervousness always associated with this experience make a fog the dreaded terror of the sea all the more terrifying because of its very silence and gentleness for the expert seafarer no less than the ignorant landsman nevertheless a fog at sea can be a source of intense relish and enjoyment abstract from the experience of the seafog for the moment its danger and practical unpleasantness direct the attention to the features objectively constituting the phenomenathe veil surrounding you with an opaqueness as of transparent milk blurring the outlines of things and distorting their shapes into weird grotesqueness observe the carrying power of the air producing the impression as if you could touch some faroff siren by merely putting out your hand and letting it lose itself behind that white wall note the curious creamy smoothness of the water hypercritically denying as it were any suggestion of danger and above all the strange solitude and remoteness from the world as it can be found only on the highest mountain tops and the experience may acquire in its uncanny mingling of repose and terror a flavour of such concentrated poignancy and delight as to contrast sharply with the blind and distempered anxiety of its other aspects this contrast often emerging with startling suddenness is like the momentary switching on of some new current or the passing ray of a brighter light illuminating the outlook upon perhaps the most ordinary and familiar objectsan impression which we experience sometimes in instants of direst extremity when our practical interest snaps like a wire from sheer overtension and we watch the consummation of some impending catastrophe with the marvelling unconcern of a mere spectator it has often been noted that two and two only of our senses are the channels of art and give us artistic material these two senses are sight and hearing touch and its special modifications taste and smell do not go to the making of art decadent french novelists such as huysmann make their heroes revel in perfumesymphonies but we feel that the sentiment described is morbid and unreal and we feel rightly some people speak of a cook as an artist and a pudding as a perfect poem but a healthy instinct rebels art whether sculpture painting drama music is of sight or hearing the reason is simple sight and hearing are the distant senses sight is as some one has well said touch at a distance sight and hearing are of things already detached and somewhat remote they are the fitting channels for art which is cut loose from immediate action and reaction taste and touch are too intimate too immediately vital in russian as tolstoi has pointed out and indeed in other languages the same is observable the word for beauty krasota means to begin with only that which pleases the sight even hearing is excluded and though latterly people have begun to speak of an ugly deed or of beautiful music it is not good russian the simple russian does not make platos divine muddle between the good and the beautiful if a man gives his coat to another the russian peasant knowing no foreign language will not say the man has acted beautifully to see a thing to feel a thing as a work of art we must then become for the time unpractical must be loosed from the fear and the flurry of actual living must become spectators why is this why can we not live and look at once the fact that we cannot is clear if we watch a friend drowning we do not note the exquisite curve made by his body as he falls into the water nor the play of the sunlight on the ripples as he disappears below the surface we should be inhuman sthetic fiends if we did and again why it would do our friend no harm that we should enjoy the curves and the sunlight provided we also threw him a rope but the simple fact is that we cannot look at the curves and the sunlight because our whole being is centred on acting on saving him we cannot even at the moment fully feel our own terror and impending loss so again if we want to see and to feel the splendour and vigour of a lion or even to watch the cumbrous grace of a bear we prefer that a cage should intervene the cage cuts off the need for motor actions it interposes the needful physical and moral distance and we are free for contemplation released from our own terrors we see more and better and we feel differently a man intent on action is like a horse in blinkers he goes straight forward seeing only the road ahead our brain is indeed it would seem in part an elaborate arrangement for providing these blinkers if we saw and realized the whole of everything we should want to do too many things the brain allows us not only to remember but which is quite as important to forget and neglect it is an organ of oblivion by neglecting most of the things we see and hear we can focus just on those which are important for action we can cease to be potential artists and become efficient practical human beings but it is only by limiting our view by a great renunciation as to the things we see and feel the artist does just the reverse he renounces doing in order to practise seeing he is by nature what professor bergson calls distrait aloof absentminded intent only or mainly on contemplation that is why the ordinary man often thinks the artist a fool or if he does not go so far as that is made vaguely uncomfortable by him never really understands him the artists focus all his system of values is different his world is a world of images which are his realities the distinction between art and ritual which has so long haunted and puzzled us now comes out quite clearly and also in part the relation of each to actual life ritual we saw was a representation or a prepresentation a redoing or predoing a copy or imitation of life butand this is the important pointalways with a practical end art is also a representation of life and the emotions of life but cut loose from immediate action action may be and often is represented but it is not that it may lead on to a practical further end the end of art is in itself its value is not mediate but immediate thus ritual makes as it were a bridge between real life and art a bridge over which in primitive times it would seem man must pass in his actual life he hunts and fishes and ploughs and sows being utterly intent on the practical end of gaining his food in the dromenon of the spring festival though his acts are unpractical being mere singing and dancing and mimicry his intent is practical to induce the return of his foodsupply in the drama the representation may remain for a time the same but the intent is altered man has come out from action he is separate from the dancers and has become a spectator the drama is an end in itself we know from tradition that in athens ritual became art a dromenon became the drama and we have seen that the shift is symbolized and expressed by the addition of the theatre or spectatorplace to the orchestra or dancingplace we have also tried to analyse the meaning of the shift it remains to ask what was its cause ritual does not always develop into art though in all probability dramatic art has always to go through the stage of ritual the leap from real life to the emotional contemplation of life cut loose from action would otherwise be too wide nature abhors a leap she prefers to crawl over the ritual bridge there seem at athens to have been two main causes why the dromenon passed swiftly inevitably into the drama they are first the decay of religious faith second the influx from abroad of a new culture and new dramatic material it may seem surprising to some that the decay of religious faith should be an impulse to the birth of art we are accustomed to talk rather vaguely of art as the handmaid of religion we think of art as inspired by religion but the decay of religious faith of which we now speak is not the decay of faith in a god or even the decay of some high spiritual emotion it is the decay of a belief in the efficacy of certain magical rites and especially of the spring rite so long as people believed that by excited dancing by bringing in an image or leading in a bull you could induce the coming of spring so long would the dromena of the dithyramb be enacted with intense enthusiasm and with this enthusiasm would come an actual accession and invigoration of vital force but once the faintest doubt crept in once men began to be guided by experience rather than custom the enthusiasm would die down and the collective invigoration no longer be felt then some day there will be a bad summer things will go all wrong and the chorus will sadly ask why should i dance my dance they will drift away or become mere spectators of a rite established by custom the rite itself will die down or it will live on only as the may day rites of today a childrens play or at best a thing done vaguely for luck the spirit of the rite the belief in its efficacy dies but the rite itself the actual mould persists and it is this ancient ritual mould foreign to our own usage that strikes us today when a greek play is revived as odd and perhaps chill a chorus a band of dancers there must be because the drama arose out of a ritual dance an agon or contest or wrangling there will probably be because summer contends with winter life with death the new year with the old a tragedy must be tragic must have its pathos because the winter the old year must die there must needs be a swift transition a clash and change from sorrow to joy what the greeks called a peripeteia a quickturnround because though you carry out winter you bring in summer at the end we shall have an appearance an epiphany of a god because the whole gist of the ancient ritual was to summon the spirit of life all these ritual forms haunt and shadow the play whatever its plot like ancient traditional ghosts they underlie and sway the movement and the speeches like some compelling rhythm now this ritual mould this underlying rhythm is a fine thing in itself and moreover it was once shaped and cast by a living spirit the intense immediate desire for food and life and for the return of the seasons which bring that food and life but we have seen that once the faith in mans power magically to bring back these seasons waned once he began to doubt whether he could really carry out winter and bring in summer his emotion towards these rites would cool further we have seen that these rites repeated year by year ended among an imaginative people in the mental creation of some sort of dmon or god this dmon or god was more and more held responsible on his own account for the foodsupply and the order of the hor or seasons so we get the notion that this dmon or god himself led in the seasons hermes dances at the head of the charites or an eiresione is carried to helios and the hor the thought then arises that this manlike dmon who rose from a real king of the may must himself be approached and dealt with as a man bargained with sacrificed to in a word in place of dromena things done we get gods worshipped in place of sacraments holy bulls killed and eaten in common we get sacrifices in the modern sense holy bulls offered to yet holier gods the relation of these figures of gods to art we shall consider when we come to sculpture so the dromenon the thing done wanes the prayer the praise the sacrifice waxes religion moves away from drama towards theology but the ritual mould of the dromenon is left ready for a new content again there is another point the magical dromenon the carrying out of winter the bringing in of spring is doomed to an inherent and deadly monotony it is only when its magical efficacy is intensely believed that it can go on the lifehistory of a holy bull is always the same its magical essence is that it should be the same even when the lifedmon is human his career is unchequered he is born initiated or born again he is married grows old dies is buried and the old old story is told again next year there are no fresh personal incidents peculiar to one particular dmon if the drama rose from the spring song only beautiful it might be but with a beauty that was monotonous a beauty doomed to sterility we seem to have come to a sort of impasse the spirit of the dromenon is dead or dying the spectators will not stay long to watch a doing doomed to monotony the ancient moulds are there the old bottles but where is the new wine the pool is stagnant what angel will step down to trouble the waters fortunately we are not left to conjecture what might have happened in the case of greece we know though not as clearly as we wish what did happen we can see in part why though the dromena of adonis and osiris emotional as they were and intensely picturesque remained mere ritual the dromenon of dionysos his dithyramb blossomed into drama let us look at the facts and first at some structural facts in the building of the theatre we have seen that the orchestra with its dancing chorus stands for ritual for the stage in which all were worshippers all joined in a rite of practical intent we further saw that the theatre the place for the spectators stood for art in the orchestra all is life and dancing the marble seats are the very symbol of rest aloofness from action contemplation the seats for the spectators grow and grow in importance till at last they absorb as it were the whole spirit and give their name theatre to the whole structure action is swallowed up in contemplation but contemplation of what at first of course of the ritual dance but not for long that we have seen was doomed to a deadly monotony in a greek theatre there was not only orchestra and a spectatorplace there was also a scene or stage the greek word for stage is as we said sken our scene the scene was not a stage in our sense ie a platform raised so that the players might be better viewed it was simply a tent or rude hut in which the players or rather dancers could put on their ritual dresses the fact that the greek theatre had to begin with no permanent stage in our sense shows very clearly how little it was regarded as a spectacle the ritual dance was a dromenon a thing to be done not a thing to be looked at the history of the greek stage is one long story of the encroachment of the stage on the orchestra at first a rude platform or table is set up then scenery is added the movable tent is translated into a stone house or a temple front this stands at first outside the orchestra then bit by bit the scene encroaches till the sacred circle of the dancingplace is cut clean across as the drama and the stage wax the dromenon and the orchestra wane this shift in the relation of dancingplace and stage is very clearly seen in fig 2 a plan of the dionysiac theatre at athens p 144 the old circular orchestra shows the dominance of ritual the new curtailed orchestra of roman times and semicircular shape shows the dominance of the spectacle illustration fig 2 dionysiac theatre at athens greek tragedy arose aristotle has told us from the leaders of the dithyramb the leaders of the spring dance the spring dance the mime of summer and winter had as we have seen only one actor one actor with two partsdeath and life with only one play to be played and that a oneactor play there was not much need for a stage a scene that is a tent was needed as we saw because all the dancers had to put on their ritual gear but scarcely a stage from a rude platform the prologue might be spoken and on that platform the epiphany or appearance of the new year might take place but the play played the lifehistory of the lifespirit was all too familiar there was no need to look the thing was to dance you need a stagenot necessarily a raised stage but a place apart from the dancerswhen you have new material for your players something you need to look at to attend to in the sixth century bc at athens came the great innovation instead of the old plot the lifehistory of the lifespirit with its deadly monotony new plots were introduced not of lifespirits but of human individual heroes in a word homer came to athens and out of homeric stories playwrights began to make their plots this innovation was the death of ritual monotony and the dromenon it is not so much the old that dies as the new that kills schylus himself is reported to have said that his tragedies were slices from the great banquet of homer the metaphor is not a very pleasing one but it expresses a truth by homer schylus meant not only our iliad and odyssey but the whole body of epic or heroic poetry which centred round not only the siege of troy but the great expedition of the seven against thebes and which moreover contained the stories of the heroes before the siege began and their adventures after it was ended it was from these heroic sagas for the most part though not wholly that the myths or plots of not only schylus but also sophocles and euripides and a host of other writers whose plays are lost to us are taken the new wine that was poured into the old bottles of the dromena at the spring festival was the heroic saga we know as an historical fact the name of the man who was mainly responsible for this inpouringthe great democratic tyrant peisistratos we must look for a moment at what peisistratos found and then pass to what he did he found an ancient spring dromenon perhaps wellnigh effete without destroying the old he contrived to introduce the new to add to the old plot of summer and winter the lifestories of heroes and thereby arose the drama let us look first then at what peisistratos found the april festival of dionysos at which the great dramas were performed was not the earliest festival of the god thucydides37 expressly tells us that on the 12th day of the month anthesterion that is in the quite early spring at the turn of our february and march were celebrated the more ancient dionysia it was a threedays festival38 on the first day called caskopening the jars of new wine were broached among the boeotians the day was called not the day of dionysos but the day of the good or wealthy daimon the next day was called the day of the cupsthere was a contest or agon of drinking the last day was called the pots and it too had its potcontests it is the ceremonies of this day that we must notice a little in detail for they are very surprising casks cups and pots sound primitive enough casks and cups go well with the winegod but the pots call for explanation the second day of the cups joyful though it sounds was by the athenians counted unlucky because on that day they believed the ghosts of the dead rose up the sanctuaries were roped in each householder anointed his door with pitch that the ghost who tried to enter might catch and stick there further to make assurance doubly sure from early dawn he chewed a bit of buckthorn a plant of strong purgative powers so that if a ghost should by evil chance go down his throat it should at least be promptly expelled for two perhaps three days of constant anxiety and ceaseless precautions the ghosts fluttered about athens mens hearts were full of nameless dread and as we shall see hope at the close of the third day the ghosts or as the greeks called them keres were bidden to go some one we do not know whom it may be each father of a household pronounced the words out of the door ye keres it is no longer anthesteria and obedient the keres were gone but before they went there was a supper for these souls all the citizens cooked a panspermia or potofallseeds but of this potofallseeds no citizen tasted it was made over to the spirits of the underworld and hermes their daimon hermes psychopompos conductor leader of the dead we have seen how a forest people dependent on fruit trees and berries for their food will carry a maypole and imagine a treespirit but a people of agriculturists will feel and do and think quite otherwise they will look not to the forest but to the earth for their returning life and food they will sow seeds and wait for their sprouting as in the gardens of adonis adonis seems to have passed through the two stages of treespirit and seedspirit his effigy was sometimes a tree cut down sometimes his planted gardens now seeds are many innumerable and they are planted in the earth and a people who bury their dead know or rather feel that the earth is dead mans land so when they prepare a pot of seeds on their all souls day it is not really or merely as a supper for the souls though it may be that kindly notion enters the ghosts have other work to do than to eat their supper and go they take that supper of all seeds that panspermia with them down to the world below that they may tend it and foster it and bring it back in autumn as a pot of all fruits a pankarpia thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die the dead then as well as the livingthis is for us the important pointhad their share in the dromena of the more ancient dionysia these agricultural spring dromena were celebrated just outside the ancient city gates in the agora or place of assembly on a circular dancingplace near to a very primitive sanctuary of dionysos which was opened only once in the year at the feast of cups just outside the gates was celebrated yet another festival of dionysos equally primitive called the dionysia in the fields it had the form though not the date of our may day festival plutarch39 thus laments over the good old times in ancient days he says our fathers used to keep the feast of dionysos in homely jovial fashion there was a procession a jar of wine and a branch then some one dragged in a goat another followed bringing a wicker basket of figs and to crown all the phallos it was just a festival of the fruits of the whole earth wine and the basket of figs and the branch for vegetation the goat for animal life the phallos for man no thought here of the dead it is all for the living and his food such sanctities even a great tyrant might not tamper with but if you may not upset the old you may without irreverence add the new peisistratos probably cared little for and believed less in magical ceremonies for the renewal of fruits incantations of the dead we can scarcely picture him chewing buckthorn on the day of the cups or anointing his front door with pitch to keep out the ghosts very wisely he left the anthesteria and the kindred festival in the fields where and as they were but for his own purposes he wanted to do honour to dionysos and also above all things to enlarge and improve the rites done in the gods honour so leaving the old sanctuary to its fate he built a new temple on the south side of the acropolis where the present theatre now stands and consecrated to the god a new and more splendid precinct he did not build the present theatre we must always remember that the rows of stone seats the chief priests splendid marble chair were not erected till two centuries later what peisistratos did was to build a small stone temple see fig 2 and a great round orchestra of stone close beside it small fragments of the circular foundation can still be seen the spectators sat on the hillside or on wooden seats there was as yet no permanent theatron or spectatorplace still less a stone stage the dromena were done on the dancingplace but for spectatorplace they had the south slope of the acropolis what kind of wooden stage they had unhappily we cannot tell it may be that only a portion of the orchestra was marked off why did peisistratos if he cared little for magic and ancestral ghosts take such trouble to foster and amplify the worship of this maypolespirit dionysos why did he add to the anthesteria the festival of the family ghosts and the peasant festival in the fields a new and splendid festival a little later in the spring the great dionysia or dionysia of the city one reason among others was thispeisistratos was a tyrant now a greek tyrant was not in our sense tyrannical he took his own way it is true but that way was to help and serve the common people the tyrant was usually raised to his position by the people and he stood for democracy for trade and industry as against an idle aristocracy it was but a rudimentary democracy a democratic tyranny the power vested in one man but it stood for the rights of the many as against the few moreover dionysos was always of the people of the working classes just as the king and queen of the may are now the upper classes worshipped then as now not the spirit of spring but their own ancestors butand this was what peisistratos with great insight sawdionysos must be transplanted from the fields to the city the country is always conservative the natural stronghold of a landed aristocracy with fixed traditions the city with its closer contacts and consequent swifter changes and above all with its acquired not inherited wealth tends towards democracy peisistratos left the dionysia in the fields but he added the great dionysia in the city peisistratos was not the only tyrant who concerned himself with the dromena of dionysos herodotos40 tells the story of another tyrant a story which is like a window opening suddenly on a dark room at sicyon a town near corinth there was in the agora a heroon a herotomb of an argive hero adrastos the sicyonians says herodotos paid other honours to adrastos and moreover they celebrated his death and disasters with tragic choruses not honouring dionysos but adrastos we think of tragic choruses as belonging exclusively to the theatre and dionysos so did herodotus but clearly here they belonged to a local hero his adventures and his death were commemorated by choral dances and songs now when cleisthenes became tyrant of sicyon he felt that the cult of the local hero was a danger what did he do very adroitly he brought in from thebes another hero as rival to adrastos he then split up the worship of adrastos part of his worship and especially his sacrifices he gave to the new theban hero but the tragic choruses he gave to the common peoples god to dionysos adrastos the objectionable hero was left to dwindle and die no local hero can live on without his cult the act of cleisthenes seems to us a very drastic proceeding but perhaps it was not really so revolutionary as it seems the local hero was not so very unlike a local dmon a spring or winter spirit we have seen in the anthesteria how the paternal ghosts are expected to look after the seeds in spring the more important the ghost the more incumbent is this duty upon him noblesse oblige on the river olynthiakos41 in northern greece stood the tomb of the hero olynthos who gave the river its name in the spring months of anthesterion and elaphebolion the river rises and an immense shoal of fish pass from the lake of bolbe to the river of olynthiakos and the inhabitants round about can lay in a store of salt fish for all their needs and it is a wonderful fact that they never pass by the monument of olynthus they say that formerly the people used to perform the accustomed rites to the dead in the month elaphebolion but now they do them in anthesterion and that on this account the fish come up in those months only in which they are wont to do honour to the dead the river is the chief source of the foodsupply so to send fish not seeds and flowers is the dead heros business peisistratos was not so daring as cleisthenes we do not hear that he disturbed or diminished any local cult he did not attempt to move the anthesteria with its ghost cult he only added a new festival and trusted to its recent splendour gradually to efface the old and at this new festival he celebrated the deeds of other heroes not local but of greater splendour and of wider fame if he did not bring homer to athens he at least gave homer official recognition now to bring homer to athens was like opening the eyes of the blind cicero in speaking of the influence of peisistratos on literature says he is said to have arranged in their present order the works of homer which were previously in confusion he arranged them not for what we should call publication but for public recitation and another tradition adds that he or his son fixed the order of their recitation at the great festival of all athens the panathenaia homer of course was known before in athens in a scrappy way now he was publicly officially promulgated it is probable though not certain that the homer which peisistratos prescribed for recitation at the panathenaia was just our iliad and odyssey and that the rest of the heroic cycle all the remaining slices from the heroic banquet remained as material for dithyrambs and dramas the tyranny of peisistratos and his son lasted from 560 to 501 bc tradition said that the first dramatic contest was held in the new theatre built by peisistratos in 535 bc when thespis won the prize schylus was born in 525 bc his first play with a plot from the heroic saga the seven against thebes was produced in 467 bc it all came very swiftly the shift from the dithyramb as spring song to the heroic drama was accomplished in something much under a century its effect on the whole of greek life and religionnay on the whole of subsequent literature and thoughtwas incalculable let us try to see why homer was the outcome the expression of an heroic age when we use the word heroic we think vaguely of something brave brilliant splendid something exciting and invigorating a hero is to us a man of clear vivid personality valiant generous perhaps hottempered a good friend and a good hater the word hero calls up such figures as achilles patroklos hector figures of passion and adventure now such figures with their special virtues and perhaps their proper vices are not confined to homer they occur in any and every heroic age we are beginning now to see that heroic poetry heroic characters do not arise from any peculiarity of race or even of geographical surroundings but given certain social conditions they may and do appear anywhere and at any time the world has seen several heroic ages though it is perhaps doubtful if it will ever see another what then are the conditions that produce an heroic age and why was this influx of heroic poetry coming just when it did of such immense influence on and importance to the development of greek dramatic art why had it power to change the old stiff ritual dithyramb into the new and living drama why above all things did the democratic tyrant peisistratos so eagerly welcome it to athens in the old ritual dance the individual was nothing the choral band the group everything and in this it did but reflect primitive tribal life now in the heroic saga the individual is everything the mass of the people the tribe or the group are but a shadowy background which throws up the brilliant clearcut personality into a more vivid light the epic poet is all taken up with what he called klea andron glorious deeds of men of individual heroes and what these heroes themselves ardently long and pray for is just this glory this personal distinction this deathless fame for their great deeds when the armies meet it is the leaders who fight in single combat these glorious heroes are for the most part kings but not kings in the old sense not hereditary kings bound to the soil and responsible for its fertility rather they are leaders in war and adventure the homage paid them is a personal devotion for personal character the leader must win his followers by bravery he must keep them by personal generosity moreover heroic wars are oftenest not tribal feuds consequent on tribal raids more often they arise from personal grievances personal jealousies the siege of troy is undertaken not because the trojans have raided the cattle of the achans but because a single trojan paris has carried off helen a single achans wife another noticeable point is that in heroic poems scarcely any one is safely and quietly at home the heroes are fighting in faroff lands or voyaging by sea hence we hear little of tribal and even of family ties the real centre is not the hearth but the leaders tent or ship local ties that bind to particular spots of earth are cut local differences fall into abeyance a sort of cosmopolitanism a forecast of panhellenism begins to arise and a curious pointall this is reflected in the gods we hear scarcely anything of local cults nothing at all of local magical maypoles and carryingsout of winter and bringingsin of summer nothing whatever of suppers for the souls or even of worship paid to particular local heroes a mans ghost when he dies does not abide in its grave ready to rise at springtime and help the seeds to sprout it goes to a remote and shadowy region a common panhellenic hades and so with the gods themselves they are cut clean from earth and from the local bits of earth out of which they grewthe sacred trees and holy stones and rivers and still holier beasts there is not a holy bull to be found in all olympus only figures of men bright and vivid and intensely personal like so many glorified transfigured homeric heroes in a word the heroic spirit as seen in heroic poetry is the outcome of a society cut loose from its roots of a time of migrations of the shifting of populations42 but more is needed and just this something more the age that gave birth to homer had we know now that before the northern people whom we call greeks and who called themselves hellenes came down into greece there had grown up in the basin of the gean a civilization splendid wealthy rich in art and already ancient the civilization that has come to light at troy mycen tiryns and most of all in crete the adventurers from north and south came upon a land rich in spoils where a chieftain with a band of hardy followers might sack a city and dower himself and his men with sudden wealth such conditions such a contact of new and old of settled splendour beset by unbridled adventure go to the making of a heroic age its virtues and its vices its obvious beauty and its hidden ugliness in settled social conditions as has been well remarked most of the heroes would sooner or later have found themselves in prison a heroic age happily for society cannot last long it has about it while it does last a sheen of passing and pathetic splendour such as that which lights up the figure of achilles but it is bound to fade and pass a heroic society is almost a contradiction in terms heroism is for individuals if a society is to go on at all it must strike its roots deep in some soil native or alien the bands of adventurers must disband and go home or settle anew on the land they have conquered they must beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks their gallant glorious leader must become a sober homekeeping lawgiving and lawabiding king his followers must abate their individuality and make it subserve a common social purpose athens in her sheltered peninsula lay somewhat outside the tide of migrations and heroic exploits her population and that of all attica remained comparatively unchanged her kings are kings of the stationary lawabiding statereforming type cecrops erechtheus theseus are not splendid flashing allconquering figures like achilles and agamemnon athens might it would seem but for the coming of homer have lain stagnant in a backwater of conservatism content to go on chanting her traditional spring songs year by year it is a wonderful thing that this city of athens beloved of the gods should have been saved from the storm and stress sheltered from what might have broken even shattered her spared the actual horrors of a heroic age yet given heroic poetry given the clear winecup poured when the ferment was over she drank of it deep and was glad and rose up like a giant refreshed we have seen that to make up a heroic age there must be two factors the new and the old the young vigorous warlike people must seize on appropriate in part assimilate an old and wealthy civilization it almost seems as if we might go a step farther and say that for every great movement in art or literature we must have the same conditions a contact of new and old of a new spirit seizing or appropriated by an old established order anyhow for athens the historical fact stands certain the amazing development of the fifthcentury drama is just this the old vessel of the ritual dithyramb filled to the full with the new wine of the heroic saga and it would seem that it was by the hand of peisistratos the great democratic tyrant that the new wine was outpoured such were roughly the outside conditions under which the drama of art grew out of the dromena of ritual the racial secret of the individual genius of schylus and the forgotten men who preceded him we cannot hope to touch we can only try to see the conditions in which they worked and mark the splendid new material that lay to their hands above all things we can see that this material these homeric saga were just fitted to give the needed impulse to art the homeric saga had for an athenian poet just that remoteness from immediate action which as we have seen is the essence of art as contrasted with ritual tradition says that the athenians fined the dramatic poet phrynichus for choosing as the plot of one of his tragedies the taking of miletus probably the fine was inflicted for political party reasons and had nothing whatever to do with the question of whether the subject was artistic or not but the story may stand and indeed was later understood to be a sort of allegory as to the attitude of art towards life to understand and still more to contemplate life you must come out from the choral dance of life and stand apart in the case of ones own sorrows be they national or personal this is all but impossible we can ritualize our sorrows but not turn them into tragedies we cannot stand back far enough to see the picture we want to be doing or at least lamenting in the case of the sorrows of others this standing back is all too easy we not only bear their pain with easy stoicism but we picture it dispassionately at a safe distance we feel about rather than with it the trouble is that we do not feel enough such was the attitude of the athenian towards the doings and sufferings of homeric heroes they stood towards them as spectators these heroes had not the intimate sanctity of homegrown things but they had sufficient traditional sanctity to make them acceptable as the material of drama adequately sacred though they were they were yet free and flexible it is impiety to alter the myth of your local hero it is impossible to recast the myth of your local dmonthat is fixed foreverhis conflict his agon his death his pathos his resurrection and its heralding his epiphany but the stories of agamemnon and achilles though at home these heroes were local daimones have already been variously told in their wanderings from place to place and you can mould them more or less to your will moreover these figures are already personal and individual not representative puppets mere functionaries like the may queen and winter they have lifehistories of their own never quite to be repeated it is in this blend of the individual and the general the personal and the universal that one element at least of all really great art will be found to lie and just here at athens we get a glimpse of the moment of fusion we see a definite historical reason why and how the universal in dromena came to include the particular in drama we see moreover how in place of the old monotonous plots intimately connected with actual practical needs we get material cut off from immediate reactions seen as it were at the right distance remote yet not too remote we see in a word how a ritual enacted year by year became a work of art that was a possession for ever possibly in the mind of the reader there may have been for some time a growing discomfort an inarticulate protest all this about dromena and drama and dithyrambs bears and bulls may queens and treespirits even about homeric heroes is all very well curious and perhaps even in a way interesting but it is not at all what he expected still less what he wants when he bought a book with the odd incongruous title ancient art and ritual he was prepared to put up with some remarks on the artistic side of ritual but he did expect to be told something about what the ordinary man calls art that is statues and pictures greek drama is no doubt a form of ancient art but acting is not to the readers mind the chief of arts nay more he has heard doubts raised latelyand he shares themas to whether acting and dancing about which so much has been said are properly speaking arts at all now about painting and sculpture there is no doubt let us come to business to a business so beautiful and pleasant as greek sculpture we shall gladly come but a word must first be said to explain the reason of our long delay the main contention of the present book is that ritual and art have in emotion towards life a common root and further that primitive art develops normally at least in the case of the drama straight out of ritual the nature of that primitive ritual from which the drama arose is not very familiar to english readers it has been necessary to stress its characteristics almost everywhere all over the world it is found that primitive ritual consists not in prayer and praise and sacrifice but in mimetic dancing but it is in greece and perhaps greece only in the religion of dionysos that we can actually trace if dimly the transition steps that led from dance to drama from ritual to art it was therefore of the first importance to realize the nature of the dithyramb from which the drama rose and so far as might be to mark the cause and circumstances of the transition leaving the drama we come in the next chapter to sculpture and here too we shall see how closely art was shadowed by that ritual out of which she sprang footnotes 35 see bibliography at end for professor murrays examination 36 mr edward bullough the british journal of psychology 1912 p 88 37 ii 15 38

panathenaic frieze and the apollo belvedere in passing from the drama to sculpture we make a great leap we pass from the living thing the dance or the play acted by real people the thing done whether as ritual or art whether dromenon or drama to the thing made cast in outside material rigid form a thing that can be looked at again and again but the making of which can never actually be relived whether by artist or spectator moreover we come to a clear threefold distinction and division hitherto neglected we must at last sharply differentiate the artist the work of art and the spectator the artist may and usually indeed does become the spectator of his own work but the spectator is not the artist the work of art is once executed forever distinct both from artist and spectator in the primitive choral dance all threeartist work of art spectatorwere fused or rather not yet differentiated handbooks on art are apt to begin with the discussion of rude decorative patterns and after leading up through sculpture and painting something vague is said at the end about the primitiveness of the ritual dance but historically and also genetically or logically the dance in its inchoateness its undifferentiatedness comes first it has in it a larger element of emotion and less of presentation it is this inchoateness this undifferentiatedness that apart from historical fact makes us feel sure that logically the dance is primitive to illustrate the meaning of greek sculpture and show its close affinity with ritual we shall take two instances perhaps the bestknown of those that survive one of them in relief the other in the round the panathenaic frieze of the parthenon at athens and the apollo belvedere and we shall take them in chronological order as the actual frieze and the statue cannot be before us we shall discuss no technical questions of style or treatment but simply ask how they came to be what human need do they express the parthenon frieze is in the british museum the apollo belvedere is in the vatican at rome but is readily accessible in casts or photographs the outlines given in figs 5 and 6 can of course only serve to recall subjectmatter and design the panathenaic frieze once decorated the cella or innermost shrine of the parthenon the temple of the maiden goddess athena it twined like a ribbon round the brow of the building and thence it was torn by lord elgin and brought home to the british museum as a national trophy for the price of a few hundred pounds of coffee and yards of scarlet cloth to realize its meaning we must always think it back into its place inside the cella or shrine dwelt the goddess herself her great image in gold and ivory outside the shrine was sculptured her worship by the whole of her people for the frieze is nothing but a great ritual procession translated into stone the panathenaic procession or procession of all the athenians of all athens in honour of the goddess who was but the city incarnate athena a wonder enthroned on the hills and the sea a maiden crowned with a fourfold glory that none from the pride of her head may rend violet and olive leaf purple and hoary songwreath and story the fairest of fame flowers that the winter can blast not nor bend a light upon earth as the suns own flame a name as his name athens a praise without end swinburne erechtheus 141 sculptural art at least in this instance comes out of ritual has ritual as its subject is embodied ritual the reader perhaps at this point may suspect that he is being juggled with that out of the thousands of greek reliefs that remain to us just this one instance has been selected to bolster up the writers art and ritual theory he has only to walk through any museum to be convinced at once that the author is playing quite fair practically the whole of the reliefs that remain to us from the archaic period and a very large proportion of those at later date when they do not represent heroic mythology are ritual reliefs votive reliefs as we call them that is prayers or praises translated into stone illustration fig 3 panathenaic procession of the choral dance we have heard much of the procession but little yet its ritual importance was great in religion today the dance is dead save for the dance of the choristers before the altar at seville but the procession lives on has even taken to itself new life it is a means of bringing masses of people together of ordering them and coordinating them it is a means for the magical spread of supposed good influence of grace witness the beating of the bounds and the frequent processions of the blessed sacrament in roman catholic lands the queen of the may and the jackinthegreen still go from house to house nowadays it is to collect pence once it was to diffuse grace and increase we remember the procession of the holy bull at magnesia and the holy bear at saghalien pp 92100 illustration fig 4 panathenaic procession what then was the object of the panathenaic procession it was first as its name indicates a procession that brought all athens together its object was social and political to express the unity of athens ritual in primitive times is always social collective the arrangement of the procession is shown in figs 3 and 4 pp 174 175 in fig 3 we see the procession as it were in real life just as it is about to enter the temple and the presence of the twelve gods these gods are shaded black because in reality invisible fig 4 is a diagram showing the position of the various parts of the procession in the sculptural frieze at the west end of the temple the procession begins to form the youths of athens are mounting their horses it divides as it needs must into two halves one sculptured on the north one on the south side of the cella after the throng of the cavalry getting denser and denser we come to the chariots next the sacrificial animals sheep and restive cows then the instruments of sacrifice flutes and lyres and baskets and trays for offerings men who carry blossoming oliveboughs maidens with watervessels and drinkingcups the whole tumult of the gathering is marshalled and at last met and as it were held in check by a band of magistrates who face the procession just as it enters the presence of the twelve seated gods at the east end the whole body politic of the gods has come down to feast with the whole body politic of athens and her allies of whom these gods are but the projection and reflection the gods are there together because man is collectively assembled the great procession culminates in a sacrifice and a communal feast a sacramental feast like that on the flesh of the holy bull at magnesia the panathenaia was a high festival including rites and ceremonies of diverse dates an armed dance of immemorial antiquity that may have dated from the days when athens was subject to crete and a recitation ordered by peisistratos of the poems of homer some theorists have seen in art only an extension of the play instinct just a liberation of superfluous vitality and energies as it were a rehearsing for life this is not our view but into all art in so far as it is a cutting off of motor reactions there certainly enters an element of recreation it is interesting to note that to the greek mind religion was specially connected with the notion rather of a festival than a fast thucydides43 is assuredly by nature no reveller yet religion is to him mainly a rest from toil he makes perikles say moreover we have provided for our spirit by many opportunities of recreation by the celebration of games and sacrifices throughout the year to the anonymous writer known as the old oligarch the main gist of religion appears to be a decorous social enjoyment in easy aristocratic fashion he rejoices that religious ceremonials exist to provide for the less welltodo citizens suitable amusements that they would otherwise lack as to sacrifices and sanctuaries and festivals and precincts the people knowing that it is impossible for each man individually to sacrifice and feast and have sacrifices and an ample and beautiful city has discovered by what means he may enjoy these privileges in the procession of the panathenaia all athens was gathered together butand this is importantfor a special purpose more primitive than any great political or social union happily this purpose is clear it is depicted in the central slab of the east end of the frieze fig 5 a priest is there represented receiving from the hands of a boy a great peplos or robe it is the sacred robe of athena woven for her and embroidered by young athenian maidens and offered to her every five years the great gold and ivory statue in the parthenon itself had no need of a robe she would scarcely have known what to do with one her raiment was already of wrought gold she carried helmet and spear and shield but there was an ancient image of athena an old madonna of the people fashioned before athena became a warrior maiden this image was rudely hewn in wood it was dressed and decked dollfashion like a may queen and to her the great peplos was dedicated the peplos was hoisted as a sail on the panathenaic ship and this ship athena had borrowed from dionysos himself who went every spring in procession in a shipcar on wheels to open the season for sailing to a seafaring people like the athenians the opening of the sailing season was allimportant and naturally began not at midsummer but in spring illustration fig 5 the sacred peplos or robe takes us back to the old days when the spirit of the year and the luck of the people was bound up with a rude image the life of the year died out each year and had to be renewed to make a new image was expensive and inconvenient so with primitive economy it was decided that the life and luck of the image should be renewed by redressing it by offering to it each year a new robe we remember p 60 how in thuringia the new puppet wore the shirt of the old and thereby new life was passed from one to the other but behind the old image we can get to a stage still earlier when there was at the panathenaia no image at all only a yearly maypole a bough hung with ribbons and cakes and fruits and the like a bough was cut from the sacred olive tree of athens called the moria or fate tree it was bound about with fillets and hung with fruit and nuts and in the festival of the panathenaia they carried it up to the acropolis to give to athena polias herofthecity and as they went they sang the old eiresione song p 114 polias is but the city the polis incarnate this moria or fate tree was the very life of athens the life of the olive which fed her and lighted her was the very life of the city when the persian host sacked the acropolis they burnt the holy olive and it seemed that all was over but next day it put forth a new shoot and the people knew that the citys life still lived sophocles44 sang of the glory of the wondrous life tree of athens the untended the selfplanted selfdefended from the foe seagray childrennurturing olive tree that here delights to grow none may take nor touch nor harm it headstrong youth nor age grown bold for the round of morian zeus has been its watcher from of old he beholds it and athene thy own seagray eyes behold the holy tree carried in procession is like the image of athena made of olivewood just the incarnate life of athens ever renewed the panathenaia was not like the dithyramb a spring festival it took place in july at the height of the summer heat when need for rain was the greatest but the month hecatombaion in which it was celebrated was the first month of the athenian year and the day of the festival was the birthday of the goddess when the goddess became a wargoddess it was fabled that she was born in olympus and that she sprang full grown from her fathers head in glittering armour but she was really born on earth and the day of her birth was the birthday of every earthborn goddess the day of the beginning of the new year with its returning life when men observe only the actual growth of new green life from the ground this birthday will be in spring when they begin to know that the seasons depend on the sun or when the heat of the sun causes great need of rain it will be at midsummer at the solstice or in northern regions where men fear to lose the sun in midwinter as with us the frieze of the parthenon is then but a primitive festival translated into stone a rite frozen to a monument passing over a long space of time we come to our next illustration the apollo belvedere fig 6 it might seem that here at last we have nothing primitive here we have art pure and simple ideal art utterly cut loose from ritual art for arts sake yet in this apollo belvedere this product of late and accomplished even decadent art we shall see most clearly the intimate relation of art and ritual we shall as it were walk actually across that transition bridge of ritual which leads from actual life to art illustration fig 6 the apollo belvedere the date of this famous apollo cannot be fixed but it is clearly a copy of a type belonging to the fourth century bc the poise of the figure is singular and till its intent is grasped unsatisfactory apollo is caught in swift motion but seems as he stands delicately poised to be about to fly rather than to run he stands tiptoe and in a moment will have left the earth the greek sculptors genius was all focussed as we shall presently see on the human figure and on the mastery of its many possibilities of movement and action greek statues can roughly be dated by the way they stand at first in the archaic period they stand firmly planted with equal weight on either foot the feet close together then one foot is advanced but the weight still equally divided an almost impossible position next the weight is thrown on the right foot and the left knee is bent this is of all positions the loveliest for the human body we allow it to women forbid it to men save to sthetes if the back numbers of punch be examined for the figure of postlethwaite it will be seen that he always stands in this characteristic relaxed pose when the sculptor has mastered the possible he bethinks him of the impossible he will render the human body flying it may have been the accident of a mythological subject that first suggested the motive leochares a famous artist of the fourth century bc made a group of zeus in the form of an eagle carrying off ganymede a replica of the group is preserved in the vatican and should stand for comparison near the apollo we have the same tiptoe poise the figure just about to leave the earth again it is not a dance but a flight this poise is suggestive to us because it marks an art cut loose as far as may be from earth and its realities even its rituals what is it that apollo is doing the question and suggested answers have occupied many treatises there is only one answer we do not know it was at first thought that the apollo had just drawn his bow and shot an arrow this suggestion was made to account for the pose but that as we have seen is sufficiently explained by the flightmotive another possible solution is that apollo brandishes in his uplifted hand the gis or goatskin shield of zeus another suggestion is that he holds as often a lustral or laurel bough that he is figured as daphnephoros laurelbearer we do not know if the belvedere apollo carried a laurel but we do know that it was of the very essence of the god to be a laurelbearer that as we shall see in a moment he like dionysos arose in part out of a rite a rite of laurelbearinga daphnephoria we have not got clear of ritual yet when pausanias45 the ancient traveller whose notebook is our chief source about these early festivals came to thebes he saw a hill sacred to apollo and after describing the temple on the hill he says the following custom is still i know observed at thebes a boy of distinguished family and himself welllooking and strong is made the priest of apollo for the space of a year the title given him is laurelbearer daphnephoros for these boys wear wreaths made of laurel we know for certain now what these yearly priests are they are the kings of the year the spirits of the year maykings jacksothegreen the name given to the boy is enough to show he carried a laurel branch though pausanias only mentions a wreath another ancient writer gives us more details46 he says in describing the festival of the laurelbearing they wreathe a pole of olive wood with laurel and various flowers on the top is fitted a bronze globe from which they suspend smaller ones midway round the pole they place a lesser globe binding it with purple fillets but the end of the pole is decked with saffron by the topmost globe they mean the sun to which they actually compare apollo the globe beneath this is the moon the smaller globes hung on are the stars and constellations and the fillets are the course of the year for they make them 365 in number the daphnephoria is headed by a boy both whose parents are alive and his nearest male relation carries the filleted pole the laurelbearer himself who follows next holds on to the laurel he has his hair hanging loose he wears a golden wreath and he is dressed out in a splendid robe to his feet and he wears light shoes there follows him a band of maidens holding out boughs before them to enforce the supplication of the hymns this is the most elaborate maypole ceremony that we know of in ancient times the globes representing sun and moon show us that we have come to a time when men know that the fruits of the earth in due season depended on the heavenly bodies the year with its 365 days is a sunyear once this sunyear established and we find that the times of the solstices midwinter and midsummer became as or even more important than the spring itself the date of the daphnephoria is not known at delphi itself the centre of apolloworship there was a festival called the stepteria or festival of those who make the wreathes in which mystery a christian bishop st cyprian tells us he was initiated in faroff tempethat wonderful valley that is still the greenest spot in stony barren greece and where the laurel trees still clusterthere was an altar and near it a laurel tree the story went that apollo had made himself a crown from this very laurel and taking in his hand a branch of this same laurel ie as laurelbearer had come to delphi and taken over the oracle and to this day the people of delphi send highborn boys in procession there and they when they have reached tempe and made a splendid sacrifice return back after wearing themselves wreaths from the very laurel from which the god made himself a wreath we are inclined to think of the greeks as a people apt to indulge in the singular practice of wearing wreaths in public a practice among us confined to children on their birthdays and a few eccentric people on their wedding days we forget the intensely practical purport of the custom the ancient greeks wore wreaths and carried boughs not because they were artistic or poetical but because they were ritualists that they might bring back the spring and carry in the summer the greek bridegroom today as well as the greek bride wears a wreath that his marriage may be the beginning of new life that his wife may be as the fruitful vine and his children as the olive branches round about his table and our children today though they do not know it wear wreaths on their birthdays because with each new year their life is reborn apollo then was like dionysos king of the may andsaving his presencejackinthegreen the god manifestly arose out of the rite for a moment let us see how he arose it will be remembered that in a previous chapter p 70 we spoke of personification we think of the god apollo as an abstraction an unreal thing perhaps as a false god the god apollo does not and never did exist he is an ideaa thing made by the imagination but primitive man does not deal with abstractions does not worship them what happens is as we saw p 71 something like this year by year a boy is chosen to carry the laurel to bring in the may and later year by year a puppet is made it is a different boy each year carrying a different laurel branch and yet in a sense it is the same boy he is always the laurelbearerdaphnephoros always the luck of the village or city this laurelbearer the same yesterday today and forever is the stuff of which the god is made the god arises from the rite he is gradually detached from the rite and as soon as he gets a life and being of his own apart from the rite he is a first stage in art a work of art existing in the mind gradually detached from even the faded action of ritual and later to be the model of the actual work of art the copy in stone the stages it would seem are actual life with its motor reactions the ritual copy of life with its faded reactions the image of the god projected by the rite and last the copy of that image the work of art we see now why in the history of all ages and every place art is what is called the handmaid of religion she is not really the handmaid at all she springs straight out of the rite and her first outward leap is the image of the god primitive art in greece in egypt in assyria47 represents either rites processions sacrifices magical ceremonies embodied prayers or else it represents the images of the gods who spring from those rites track any god right home and you will find him lurking in a ritual sheath from which he slowly emerges first as a dmon or spirit of the year then as a fullblown divinity in chapter ii we saw how the dromenon gave birth to the drama how bit by bit out of the chorus of dancers some dancers withdrew and became spectators sitting apart and on the other hand others of the dancers drew apart on to the stage and presented to the spectators a spectacle a thing to be looked at not joined in and we saw how in this spectacular mood this being cut loose from immediate action lay the very essence of the artist and the artlover now in the drama of thespis there was at first we are told but one actor later schylus added a second it is clear who this actor this protagonist or first contender was the one actor with the double part who was death to be carried out and summer to be carried in he was the boughbearer the only possible actor in the onepart play of the renewal of life and the return of the year the mayking the leader of the choral dance gave birth not only to the first actor of the drama but also as we have just seen to the god be he dionysos or be he apollo and this figure of the god thus imagined out of the yearspirit was perhaps more fertile for art than even the protagonist of the drama it may seem strange to us that a god should rise up out of a dance or a procession because dances and processions are not an integral part of our national life and do not call up any very strong and instant emotion the old instinct lingers it is true and emerges at critical moments when a king dies we form a great procession to carry him to the grave but we do not dance we have court balls and these with their stately ordered ceremonials are perhaps the last survival of the genuinely civic dance but a court ball is not given at a kings funeral nor in honour of a god but to the greek the god and the dance were never quite sundered it almost seems as if in the minds of greek poets and philosophers there lingered some dim halfconscious remembrance that some of these gods at least actually came out of the ritual dance thus plato48 in treating of the importance of rhythm in education says the gods pitying the toilsome race of men have appointed the sequence of religious festivals to give them times of rest and have given them the muses and apollo the museleader as fellowrevellers the young of all animals he goes on to say cannot keep quiet either in body or voice they must leap and skip and overflow with gamesomeness and sheer joy and they must utter all sorts of cries but whereas animals have no perception of order or disorder in their motions the gods who have been appointed to men as our fellowdancers have given to us a sense of pleasure in rhythm and harmony and so they move us and lead our bands knitting us together with songs and in dances and these we call choruses nor was it only apollo and dionysos who led the dance athena herself danced the pyrrhic dance our virgin lady says plato delighting in the sports of the dance thought it not meet to dance with empty hands she must be clothed in full armour and in this attire go through the dance and youths and maidens should in every respect imitate her example honouring the goddess both with a view to the actual necessities of war and to the festivals plato is unconsciously inverting the order of things natural happenings take the armed dance there is first the actual necessity of war men go to war armed to face actual dangers and at their head is a leader in full armour that is real life there is then the festal reenactment of war when the fight is not actually fought but there is an imitation of war that is the ritual stage the dromenon here too there is a leader more and more this dance becomes a spectacle less and less an action then from the periodic dromenon the ritual enacted year by year emerges an imagined permanent leader a dmon or goda dionysos an apollo an athena finally the account of what actually happens is thrown into the past into a remote distance and we have an tiological mytha story told to give a cause or reason the whole natural process is inverted and last as already seen the god the first work of art the thing unseen imagined out of the ritual of the dance is cast back into the visible world and fixed in space can we wonder that a classical writer49 should say the statues of the craftsmen of old times are the relics of ancient dancing that is just what they are rites caught and fixed and frozen drawing says a modern critic50 is at bottom like all the arts a kind of gesture a method of dancing on paper sculpture drawing all the arts save music are imitative so was the dance from which they sprang but imitation is not all or even first the dance may be mimetic but the beauty and verve of the performance not closeness of the imitation impresses and tame additions of truth will encumber and not convince the dance must control the pantomime art that is gradually dominates mere ritual we come to another point the greek gods as we know them in classical sculpture are always imaged in human shape this was not of course always the case with other nations we have seen how among savages the totem that is the emblem of tribal unity was usually an animal or a plant we have seen how the emotions of the siberian tribe in saghalien focussed on a bear the savage totem the saghalien bear is on the way to be but is not quite a god he is not personal enough the egyptians and in part the assyrians halted halfway and made their gods into monstrous shapes halfanimal halfman which have their own mystical grandeur but since we are men ourselves feeling human emotion if our gods are in great part projected emotions the natural form for them to take is human shape art imitates nature says aristotle in a phrase that has been much misunderstood it has been taken to mean that art is a copy or reproduction of natural objects but by nature aristotle never means the outside world of created things he means rather creative force what produces not what has been produced we might almost translate the greek phrase art like nature creates things art acts like nature in producing things these things are first and foremost human things human action the drama with which aristotle is so much concerned invents human action like real natural action dancing imitates character emotion action art is to aristotle almost wholly bound by the limitations of human nature this is of course characteristically a greek limitation man is the measure of all things said the old greek sophist but modern science has taught us another lesson man may be in the foreground but the drama of mans life is acted out for us against a tremendous background of natural happenings a background that preceded man and will outlast him and this background profoundly affects our imagination and hence our art we moderns are in love with the background our art is a landscape art the ancient landscape painter could not or would not trust the background to tell its own tale if he painted a mountain he set up a mountaingod to make it real if he outlined a coast he set human coastnymphs on its shore to make clear the meaning contrast with this our modern landscape from which bit by bit the nymph has been wholly banished it is the art of a stage without actors a scene which is all background all suggestion it is an art given us by sheer recoil from science which has dwarfed actual human life almost to imaginative extinction landscape then offered to the modern imagination a scene empty of definite actors superhuman or human that yielded to reverie without challenge all that is in a moral without a creed tension or ambush of the dark threat of ominous gloom the relenting and tender return or overwhelming outburst of light the pageantry of clouds above a world turned quaker the monstrous weeds of trees outside the town the sea that is obstinately epic still51 it was to this world of backgrounds that men fled hunted by the sense of their own insignificance minds the most strictly bound in their acts by civil life in their fancy by the shrivelled look of destiny under scientific speculation felt on solitary hill or shore those tides of the blood stir again that are ruled by the sun and the moon and travelled as if to tryst where an apparition might take form poets ordained themselves to this vigil haunters of a desert church prompters of an elemental theatre listeners in solitary places for intimations from a spirit in hiding and painters followed the impulse of wordsworth we can only see the strength and weakness of greek sculpture feel the emotion of which it was the utterance if we realize clearly this modern spirit of the background all great modern and perhaps even ancient poets are touched by it drama itself as nietzsche showed hankers after dissolution into mystery shakespeare would occasionally knock the back out of the stage with a window opening on the cloudcappd towers but maeterlinck is the best example because his genius is less he is the embodiment almost the caricature of a tendency maeterlinck sets us figures in the foreground only to launch us into that limbus the supers jabbering on the scene are there children of presentiment and fear to make us aware of a third the mysterious one whose name is not on the bills they come to warn us by the nervous check and hurry of their gossip of the approach of that background power omen after omen announces him the talk starts and drops at his approach a door shuts and the thrill of his passage is the play52 it is perhaps the temperaments that are most allured and terrified by this art of the bogey and the background that most feel the need of and best appreciate the calm and level rational dignity of greek naturalism and especially the naturalism of greek sculpture for it is naturalism not realism not imitation by all manner of renunciations greek sculpture is what it is the material itself marble is utterly unlike life it is perfectly cold and still it has neither the texture nor the colouring of life the story of pygmalion who fell in love with the statue he had himself sculptured is as false as it is tasteless greek sculpture is the last form of art to incite physical reaction it is remote almost to the point of chill abstraction the statue in the round renounces not only human life itself but all the natural background and setting of life the statues of the greek gods are olympian in spirit as well as subject they are like the gods of epicurus cut loose alike from the affairs of men and even the ordered ways of nature so lucretius53 pictures them the divinity of the gods is revealed and their tranquil abodes which neither winds do shake nor clouds drench with rains nor snow congealed by sharp frost harms with hoary fall an ever cloudless ether oercanopies them and they laugh with light shed largely around nature too supplies all their wants and nothing ever impairs their peace of mind greek art moves on through a long course of technical accomplishment of everincreasing mastery over materials and methods but this course we need not follow for our argument the last word is said in the figures of these olympians translated into stone born of pressing human needs and desires images projected by active and even anxious ritual they pass into the upper air and dwell aloof spectatorlike and all but spectral footnotes 43 ii 38 44 oed col 694 trans ds maccoll 45 ix 10 4 46 see my themis p 438 47 it is now held by some and good authorities that the prehistoric paintings of cavedwelling man had also a ritual origin that is that the representations of animals were intended to act magically to

ritual art and life in the preceding chapters we have seen ritual emerge from the practical doings of life we have noted that in ritual we have the beginning of a detachment from practical ends we have watched the merely emotional dance develop from an undifferentiated chorus into a spectacle performed by actors and watched by spectators a spectacle cut off not only from real life but also from ritual issues a spectacle in a word that has become an end in itself we have further seen that the choral dance is an undifferentiated whole which later divides out into three clearly articulate parts the artist the work of art the spectator or art lover we are now in a position to ask what is the good of all this antiquarian enquiry why is it apart from the mere delight of scientific enquiry important to have seen that art arose from ritual the answer is simple the object of this book as stated in the preface is to try to throw some light on the function of art that is on what it has done and still does today for life now in the case of a complex growth like art it is rarely if ever possible to understand its functionwhat it does how it worksunless we know something of how that growth began or if its origin is hid at least of the simpler forms of activity that preceded it for art this earlier stage this simpler form which is indeed itself as it were an embryo and rudimentary art we found to beritual ritual then has not been studied for its own sake still less for its connection with any particular dogma though as a subject of singular gravity and beauty ritual is well worth a lifetimes study it has been studied because ritual is we believe a frequent and perhaps universal transition stage between actual life and that peculiar contemplation of or emotion towards life which we call art all our long examination of beastdances mayday festivals and even of greek drama has had just this for its objectto make clear that artsave perhaps in a few specially gifted naturesdid not arise straight out of life but out of that collective emphasis of the needs and desires of life which we have agreed to call ritual our formal argument is now over and ritual may drop out of the discussion but we would guard against a possible misunderstanding we would not be taken to imply that ritual is obsolete and must drop out of life giving place to the art it has engendered it may well be that for certain temperaments ritual is a perennial need natures specially gifted can live lives that are emotionally vivid even in the rare high air of art or science but many perhaps most of us breathe more freely in the medium literally the midway space of some collective ritual moreover for those of us who are not artists or original thinkers the life of the imagination and even of the emotions has been perhaps too long lived at second hand received from the artist ready made and felt today owing largely to the progress of science and a host of other causes social and economic life grows daily fuller and freer and every manifestation of life is regarded with a new reverence with this fresh outpouring of the spirit this fuller consciousness of life there comes a need for firsthand emotion and expression and that expression is found for all classes in a revival of the ritual dance some of the strenuous exciting selfexpressive dances of today are of the soil and some exotic but based as they mostly are on very primitive ritual they stand as singular evidence of this real recurrent need art in these latter days goes back as it were on her own steps recrossing the ritual bridge back to life it remains to ask what in the light of this ritual origin is the function of art how do we relate it to other forms of life to science to religion to morality to philosophy these are bigsounding questions and towards their solution only hints here and there can be offered stray thoughts that have grown up out of this study of ritual origins and which because they have helped the writer are offered with no thought of dogmatism to the reader we english are not supposed to be an artistic people yet art in some form or another bulks large in the national life we have theatres a national gallery we have artschools our tradesmen provide for us artfurniture we even hear absurdly enough of artcolours moreover all this is not a matter of mere antiquarian interest we do not simply go and admire the beauty of the past in museums a movement towards or about art is all alive and astir among us we have new developments of the theatre problem plays reinhardt productions gordon craig scenery russian ballets we have new schools of painting treading on each others heels with breathless rapidity impressionists postimpressionists futurists artor at least the desire for the interest in artis assuredly not dead moreover and this is very important we all feel about art a certain obligation such as some of us feel about religion there is an ought about it perhaps we do not really care much about pictures and poetry and music but we feel we ought to in the case of music it has happily been at last recognized that if you have not an ear you cannot care for it but two generations ago owing to the unfortunate cheapness and popularity of keyed instruments it was widely held that one half of humanity the feminine half ought to play the piano this ought is of course like most social oughts a very complex product but its existence is well worth noting it is worth noting because it indicates a vague feeling that art has a real value that art is not a mere luxury nor even a rarefied form of pleasure no one feels they ought to take pleasure in beautiful scents or in the touch of velvet they either do or they dont the first point then that must be made clear is that art is of real value to life in a perfectly clear biological sense it invigorates enhances promotes actual spiritual and through it physical life this from our historical account we should at the outset expect because we have seen art by way of ritual arose out of life and yet the statement is a sort of paradox for we have seen also that art differs from ritual just in this that in art whether of the spectator or the creator the motor reactions ie practical life the life of doing is for the time checked this is of the essence of the artists vision that he sees things detached and therefore more vividly more completely and in a different light this is of the essence of the artists emotion that it is purified from personal desire but though the artists vision and emotion alike are modified purified they are not devitalized far from that by detachment from action they are focussed and intensified life is enhanced only it is a different kind of life it is the life of the imageworld of the imagination it is the spiritual and human life as differentiated from the life we share with animals it is a life we all as human beings possess in some but very varying degrees and the natural man will always view the spiritual man askance because he is not practical but the life of imagination cut off from practical reaction as it is becomes in turn a motorforce causing new emotions and so pervading the general life and thus ultimately becoming practical no one function is completely cut off from another the main function of art is probably to intensify and purify emotion but it is substantially certain that if we did not feel we could not think and should not act still it remains true that in artistic contemplation and in the realms of the artists imagination not only are practical motorreactions cut off but intelligence is suffused in and to some extent subordinated to emotion one function then of art is to feed and nurture the imagination and the spirit and thereby enhance and invigorate the whole of human life this is far removed from the view that the end of art is to give pleasure art does usually cause pleasure singular and intense and to that which causes such pleasure we give the name of beauty but to produce and enjoy beauty is not the function of art beautyor rather the sensation of beautyis what the greeks would call an epigignomenon ti telos words hard to translate something between a byproduct and a supervening perfection a thing likeas aristotle54 for once beautifully says of pleasurethe bloom of youth to a healthy young body that this is so we see most clearly in the simple fact that when the artist begins to aim direct at beauty he usually misses it we all know perhaps by sad experience that the man who seeks out pleasure for herself fails to find her let him do his work well for that works sake exercise his faculties energize as aristotle would say and he will find pleasure come out unawares to meet him with her shining face but let him look for her think of her even desire her and she hides her head a man goes out hunting thinks of nothing but following the hounds and taking his fences being in at the death his day is fullalas of pleasure though he has scarcely known it let him forget the fox and the fences think of pleasure desire her and he will be in at pleasures death so it is with the artist let him feel strongly and see raptlythat is in complete detachment let him cast this his rapt vision and his intense emotion into outside form a statue or a painting that form will have about it a nameless thing an unearthly aroma which we call beauty this nameless presence will cause in the spectator a sensation too rare to be called pleasure and we shall call it a sense of beauty but let the artist aim direct at beauty and she is gone gone before we hear the flutter of her wings the sign manual the banner as it were of artistic creation is for the creative artist not pleasure but something better called joy pleasure it has been well said is no more than an instrument contrived by nature to obtain from the individual the preservation and the propagation of life true joy is not the lure of life but the consciousness of the triumph of creation wherever joy is creation has been55 it may be the joy of a mother in the physical creation of a child it may be the joy of the merchant adventurer in pushing out new enterprise or of the engineer in building a bridge or of the artist in a masterpiece accomplished but it is always of the thing created again contrast joy with glory glory comes with success and is exceedingly pleasant it is not joyous some men say an artists crown is glory his deepest satisfaction is in the applause of his fellows there is no greater mistake we care for praise just in proportion as we are not sure we have succeeded to the real creative artist even praise and glory are swallowed up in the supreme joy of creation only the artist himself feels the real divine fire but it flames over into the work of art and even the spectator warms his hands at the glow we can now i think understand the difference between the artist and true lover of art on the one hand and the mere sthete on the other the sthete does not produce or if he produces his work is thin and scanty in this he differs from the artist he does not feel so strongly and see so clearly that he is forced to utterance he has no joy only pleasure he cannot even feel the reflection of this creative joy in fact he does not so much feel as want to feel he seeks for pleasure for sensual pleasure as his name says not for the grosser kinds but for pleasure of that rarefied kind that we call a sense of beauty the sthete like the flirt is cold it is not even that his senses are easily stirred but he seeks the sensation of stirring and most often feigns it not finds it the sthete is no more released from his own desires than the practical man and he is without the practical mans healthy outlet in action he sees life not indeed in relation to action but to his own personal sensation by this alone he is debarred for ever from being an artist as m andr beaunier has well observed by the irony of things when we see life in relation to ourselves we cannot really represent it at all the profligate thinks he knows women it is his irony his curse that because he sees them always in relation to his own desires his own pleasure he never really knows them at all there is another important point we have seen that art promotes a part of life the spiritual imagemaking side but this side wonderful though it is is never the whole of actual life there is always the practical side the artist is always also a man now the sthete tries to make his whole attitude artisticthat is contemplative he is always looking and prying and savouring savourant as he would say when he ought to be living the result is that there is nothing to savourer all art springs by way of ritual out of keen emotion towards life and even the power to appreciate art needs this emotional reality in the spectator the sthete leads at best a parasite artistic life dogged always by death and corruption this brings us straight on to another question what about art and morality is art immoral or nonmoral or highly moral here again public opinion is worth examining artists we are told are bad husbands and they do not pay their debts or if they become good husbands and take to paying their debts they take also to wallowing in domesticity and produce bad art or none at all they get tangled in the machinery of practical reactions art again is apt to deal with risky subjects where should we be if there were not a censor of plays many of these instructive attitudes about artists as immoral or nonmoral explain themselves instantly if we remember that the artist is ipso facto detached from practical life in so far as he is an artist for each and every creative moment he is inevitably a bad husband if being a good husband means constant attention to your wife and her interests spiritual creation deux is a happening so rare as to be negligible the remoteness of the artist his essential inherent detachment from motorreaction explains the perplexities of the normal censor he being a practical man regards emotion and vision feeling and ideas as leading to action he does not see that art arises out of ritual and that even ritual is one remove from practical life in the censors world the spectacle of the nude leads straight to desire so the dancer must be draped the problemplay leads straight to the divorce court therefore it must be censored the normal censor apparently knows nothing of that world where motorreactions are cut off that house made without hands whose doors are closed on desire eternal in the heavens the censor is not for the moment a persona grata but let us give him his due he acts according to his lights and these often quite adequately represent the average darkness a normal audience contains many practical men whose standard is the same as that of the normal censor artthat is vision detached from practical reactionsis to them an unknown world full of moral risks from which the artist is qu artist immune so far we might perhaps say that art was nonmoral but the statement would be misleading since as we have seen art is in its very origin social and social means human and collective moral and social are in their final analysis the same that human collective emotion out of which we have seen the choral dance arise is in its essence moral that is it unites art says tolstoy has this characteristic that it unites people in this conviction as we shall later see he anticipates the modern movement of the unanimists p 249 but there is another and perhaps simpler way in which art is moral as already suggested it purifies by cutting off the motorreactions of personal desire an artist deeply in love with his friends wife once said if only i could paint her and get what i want from her i could bear it his wish strikes a chill at first it sounds egotistic it has the peculiar instinctive inevitable cruelty of the artist seeing in human nature material for his art but it shows us the moral side of art the artist was a good and sensitive man he saw the misery he had brought and would bring to people he loved and he saw or rather felt a way of escape he saw that through art through vision through detachment desire might be slain and the man within him find peace to some natures this instinct after art is almost their sole morality if they find themselves intimately entangled in hate or jealousy or even contempt so that they are unable to see the object of their hate or jealousy or contempt in a clear quiet and lovely light they are restless miserable morally out of gear and they are constrained to fetter or slay personal desire and so find rest this aloofness this purgation of emotion from personal passion art has in common with philosophy if the philosopher will seek after truth there must be says plotinus a turning away of the spirit a detachment he must aim at contemplation action he says is a weakening of contemplation our word theory which we use in connection with reasoning and which comes from the same greek root as theatre means really looking fixedly at contemplation it is very near in meaning to our imagination but the philosopher differs from the artist in this he aims not only at the contemplation of truth but at the ordering of truths he seeks to make of the whole universe an intelligible structure further he is not driven by the gadfly of creation he is not forced to cast his images into visible or audible shape he is remoter from the push of life still the philosopher like the artist lives in a world of his own with a spell of its own near akin to beauty and the secret of that spell is the same detachment from the tyranny of practical life the essence of art says santayana is the steady contemplation of things in their order and worth he might have been defining philosophy if art and philosophy are thus near akin art and science are in their beginning though not in their final development contrasted science it seems begins with the desire for practical utility science as professor bergson has told us has for its initial aim the making of tools for life man tries to find out the laws of nature that is how natural things behave in order primarily that he may get the better of them rule over them shape them to his ends that is why science is at first so near akin to magicthe cry of both is ill do ill do and ill do but though the feet of science are thus firmly planted on the solid ground of practical action her head too sometimes touches the highest heavens the real man of science like the philosopher soon comes to seek truth and knowledge for their own sake in art in science in philosophy there come eventually the same detachment from personal desire and practical reaction and to artist man of science and philosopher alike through this detachment there comes at times the same peace that passeth all understanding attempts have been often made to claim for art the utility the toolmaking property that characterizes the beginnings of science nothing is beautiful it is sometimes said that is not useful the beauty of a jug or a table depends we are often told on its perfect adaptation to its use there is here some confusion of thought and some obvious but possibly unconscious special pleading much of art specially decorative art arises out of utilities but its aim and its criterion is not utility art may be structural commemorative magical whatnot may grow up out of all manner of practical needs but it is not till it is cut loose from these practical needs that art is herself and comes to her own this does not mean that the jugs or tables are to be bad jugs or tables still less does it mean that the jugs or tables should be covered with senseless machinemade ornament but the utility of the jug or table is a good in itself independent of though often associated with its merit as art no one has i think ever called art the handmaid of science there is indeed no need to establish a hierarchy yet in a sense the converse is true and science is the handmaid of art art is only practicable as we have seen when it is possible safely to cut off motorreactions by the long discipline of ritual man accustomed himself to slacken his hold on action and be content with a shadowy counterfeit practice then last when through knowledge he was relieved from the need of immediate reaction to imminent realities he loosed hold for a moment altogether and was free to look and art was born he can never quit his hold for long but it would seem that as science advances and life gets easier and easier safer and safer he may loose his hold for longer spaces man subdues the world about him first by force and then by reason and when the material world is mastered and lies at his beck he needs brute force no longer and needs reason no more to make tools for conquest he is free to think for thoughts sake he may trust intuition once again and above all dare to lose himself in contemplation dare to be more and more an artist only here there lurks an almost ironical danger emotion towards life is the primary stuff of which art is made there might be a shortage of this very emotional stuff of which art herself is ultimately compacted science then helps to make art possible by making life safer and easier it makes straight in the desert a highway for our god but only rarely and with special limitations easily understood does it provide actual material for art science deals with abstractions concepts class names made by the intellect for convenience that we may handle life on the side desirable to us when we classify things give them classnames we simply mean that we note for convenience that certain actually existing objects have similar qualities a fact it is convenient for us to know and register these classnames being abstractthat is bundles of qualities rent away from living actual objects do not easily stir emotion and therefore do not easily become material for art whose function it is to express and communicate emotion particular qualities like love honour faith may and do stir emotion and certain bundles of qualities like for example motherhood tend towards personification but the normal class label like horse man triangle does not easily become material for art it remains a practical utility for science the abstractions the classnames of science are in this respect quite different from those other abstractions or unrealities already studiedthe gods of primitive religion the very term we use shows this abstractions are things qualities dragged away consciously by the intellect from actual things objectively existing the primitive gods are personificationsie collective emotions taking shape in imagined form dionysos has no more actual objective existence than the abstract horse but the god dionysos was not made by the intellect for practical convenience he was begotten by emotion and therefore he rebegets it he and all the other gods are therefore the proper material for art he is indeed one of the earliest forms of art the abstract horse on the other hand is the outcome of reflection we must honour him as of quite extraordinary use for the purposes of practical life but he leaves us cold and by the artist is best neglected there remains the relation of art to religion56 by now it may be hoped this relation is transparently clear the whole object of the present book has been to show how primitive art grew out of ritual how art is in fact but a later and more sublimated more detached form of ritual we saw further that the primitive gods themselves were but projections or if we like it better personifications of the rite they arose straight out of it now we say advisedly primitive gods and this with no intention of obscurantism the god of later days the unknown source of life the unresolved mystery of the world is not begotten of a rite is not essentially not the occasion or object of art with his relation to artwhich is indeed practically nonexistentwe have nothing to do of the other gods we may safely say that not only are they objects of art they are its prime material in a word primitive theology is an early stage in the formation of art each primitive god like the rite from which he sprang is a halfway house between practical life and art he comes into being from a half but only half inhibited desire is there then no difference except in degree of detachment between religion and art both have the like emotional power both carry with them a sense of obligation though the obligation of religion is the stronger but there is one infallible criterion between the two which is allimportant and of widereaching consequences primitive religion asserts that her imaginations have objective existence art more happily makes no such claim the worshipper of apollo believes not only that he has imagined the lovely figure of the god and cast a copy of its shape in stone but he also believes that in the outside world the god apollo exists as an object now this is certainly untrue that is it does not correspond with fact there is no such thing as the god apollo and science makes a clean sweep of apollo and dionysos and all such fictitious objectivities they are eidola idols phantasms not objective realities apollo fades earlier than dionysos because the worshipper of dionysos keeps hold of the reality that he and his church or group have projected the god he knows that prier cest laborer dieu or as he would put it he is one with his god religion has this in common with art that it discredits the actual practical world but only because it creates a new world and insists on its actuality and objectivity why does the conception of a god impose obligation just because and in so far as he claims to have objective existence by giving to his god from the outset objective existence the worshipper prevents his god from taking his place in that high kingdom of spiritual realities which is the imagination and sets him down in that lower objective world which always compels practical reaction what might have been an ideal becomes an idol straightway this objectified idol compels all sorts of ritual reactions of prayer and praise and sacrifice it is as though another and a more exacting and commanding fellowman were added to the universe but a moments reflection will show that when we pass from the vague sense of power or mana felt by the savage to the personal god to dionysos or apollo though it may seem a set back it is a real advance it is the substitution of a human and tolerably humane power for an incalculable whimsical and often cruel force the idol is a step towards not a step from the ideal ritual makes these idols and it is the business of science to shatter them and set the spirit free for contemplation ritual must wane that art may wax but we must never forget that ritual is the bridge by which man passes the ladder by which he climbs from earth to heaven the bridge must not be broken till the transit is made and the time is not yet we must not pull down the ladder till we are sure the last angel has climbed only then at last we dare not leave it standing earth pulls hard and it may be that the angels who ascended might descend and be for ever fallen it may be well at the close of our enquiry to test the conclusions at which we have arrived by comparing them with certain endoxa as aristotle would call them that is opinions and theories actually current at the present moment we take these contemporary controversies not implying that they are necessarily of high moment in the history of art or that they are in any fundamental sense new discoveries but because they are at this moment current and vital and consequently form a good test for the adequacy of our doctrines it will be satisfactory if we find our view includes these current opinions even if it to some extent modifies them and it may be hoped sets them in a new light we have already considered the theory that holds art to be the creation or pursuit or enjoyment of beauty the other view falls readily into two groups 1 the imitation theory with its modification the idealization theory which holds that art either copies nature or out of natural materials improves on her 2 the expression theory which holds that the aim of art is to express the emotions and thoughts of the artist the imitation theory is out of fashion nowadays plato and aristotle held it though aristotle as we have seen did not mean by imitating nature quite what we mean today the imitation theory began to die down with the rise of romanticism which stressed the personal individual emotion of the artist whistler dealt it a rude illconsidered blow by his effective but really foolish and irrelevant remark that to attempt to create art by imitating nature was like trying to make music by sitting on the piano but as already noted the imitation theory of art was really killed by the invention of photography it was impossible for the most insensate not to see that in a work of art of sculpture or painting there was an element of value not to be found in the exact transcript of a photograph henceforth the imitation theory lived on only in the weakened form of idealization the reaction against the imitation theory has naturally and inevitably gone much too far we have thrown out the child with the bathwater all through the present book we have tried to show that art arises from ritual and ritual is in its essence a faded action an imitation moreover every work of art is a copy of something only not a copy of anything having actual existence in the outside world rather it is a copy of that inner and highly emotionalized vision of the artist which it is granted to him to see and recreate when he is released from certain practical reactions the impressionism that dominated the pictorial art of the later years of the nineteenth century was largely a modified and very delicate imitation breaking with conventions as to how things are supposed to beconventions mainly based not on seeing but on knowing or imaginingthe impressionist insists on purging his vision from knowledge and representing things not as they are but as they really look he imitates nature not as a whole but as she presents herself to his eyes it was a most needful and valuable purgation since painting is the art proper of the eye but when the new effects of the world as simply seen the new material of light and shadow and tone had been to some extentnever completelymastered there was inevitable reaction up sprang postimpressionists and futurists they will not gladly be classed together but both have this in commonthey are expressionists not impressionists not imitators the expressionists no matter by what name they call themselves have one criterion they believe that art is not the copying or idealizing of nature or of any aspect of nature but the expression and communication of the artists emotion we can see that between them and the imitationists the impressionists form a delicate bridge they too focus their attention on the artist rather than the object only it is on the artists particular vision his impression what he actually sees not on his emotion what he feels modern life is not simplecannot be simpleought not to be it is not for nothing that we are heirs to the ages therefore the art that utters and expresses our emotion towards modern life cannot be simple and moreover it must before all things embody not only that living tangle which is felt by the futurists as so real but it must purge and order it by complexities of tone and rhythm hitherto unattempted one art beyond all others has blossomed into real spontaneous unconscious life today and that is music the other arts stand round arrayed half paralyzed with drooping empty hands the nineteenth century saw vast developments in an art that could express abstract unlocalized unpersonified feelings more completely than painting or poetry the art of music as a modern critic57 has well observed in tone and rhythm music has a notation for every kind and degree of action and passion presenting abstract moulds of its excitement fluctuation suspense crisis appeasement and all this anonymously without place actors circumstances named or described without a word spoken poetry has to supply definite thought arguments driving at a conclusion ideas mortgaged to this or that creed or system and to give force to these can command only a few rhythms limited by the duration of a human breath and the pitch of an octave the little effects worked out in this small compass music sweeps up and builds into vast fabrics of emotion with a dissolute freedom undreamed of in any other art it may be that music provides for a century too stagnant and listless to act out its own emotions too reflective to be frankly sensuous a shadowy pageant of sense and emotion that serves as a katharsis or purgation anyhow an art that came out of the old world two centuries ago with a few chants lovesongs and dances that a century ago was still tied to the words of a mass or an opera or threading little dancemovements together in a suite became in the last century this extraordinary debauch in which the man who has never seen a battle loved a woman or worshipped a god may not only ideally but through the response of his nerves and pulses to immediate rhythmical attack enjoy the ghosts of struggle rapture and exaltation with a volume and intricacy an anguish a triumph an irresponsibility unheard of an amplified pattern of action and emotion is given each man may fit to it what images he will58 if our contention throughout this book be correct the expressionists are in one matter abundantly right art we have seen again and again rises by way of ritual out of emotion out of life keenly and vividly livid the younger generation are always talking of life they have a sort of cult of life some of the more valorous spirits among them even tend to disparage art that life may be the more exalted stop painting and sculping they cry and go and see a football match there you have life life is undoubtedly essential to art because life is the stuff of emotion but some thinkers and artists have an oddly limited notion of what life is it must it seems in the first place be essentially physical to sit and dream in your study is not to live the reason of this odd limitation is easy to see we all think life is especially the sort of life we are not living ourselves the hardworked university professor thinks that life is to be found in a french caf the polished london journalist looks for life among the naked polynesians the cult of savagery and even of simplicity in every form simply spells complex civilization and diminished physical vitality the expressionist is then triumphantly right in the stress he lays on emotion but he is not right if he limits life to certain of its more elementary manifestations and still less is he right to our minds in making life and art in any sense coextensive art as we have seen sustains and invigorates life but only does it by withdrawal from these very same elementary forms of life by inhibiting certain sensuous reactions in another matter one section of expressionists the futurists are in the main right the emotion to be expressed is the emotion of today or still better tomorrow the mimetic dance arose not only nor chiefly out of reflection on the past but out of either immediate joy or imminent fear or insistent hope for the future we are not prepared perhaps to go all lengths to burn all museums because of their contagious corruption though we might be prepared to banish the nude for the space of ten years if there is to be any true living art it must arise not from the contemplation of greek statues not from the revival of folksongs not even from the reenacting of greek plays but from a keen emotion felt towards things and people living today in modern conditions including among other and deeper forms of life the haste and hurry of the modern street the whirr of motor cars and aeroplanes there are artists alive today strayed revellers who wish themselves back in the middle ages who long for the time when each man would have his house carved with a bit of lovely ornament when every village church had its madonna and child when in a word art and life and religion went hand in hand not sharply sundered by castes and professions but we may not put back the clock and if by differentiation we lose something we gain much the old choral dance on the orchestral floor was an undifferentiated thing it had a beauty of its own but by its differentiation by the severance of artist and actors and spectators we have gainedthe drama we may not cast reluctant eyes backwards the world goes forward to new forms of life and the churches of today must and should become the museums of tomorrow it is curious and instructive to note that tolstoys theory of art though not his practice is essentially expressive and even approaches the dogmas of the futurist art is to him just the transmission of personal emotion to others it may be bad emotion or it may be good emotion emotion it must be to take his simple and instructive instance a boy goes out into a wood and meets a wolf he is frightened he comes back and tells the other villagers what he felt how he went to the wood feeling happy and lighthearted and the wolf came and what the wolf looked like and how he began to be frightened this is according to tolstoy art even if the boy never saw a wolf at all if he had really at another time been frightened and if he was able to conjure up fear in himself and communicate it to othersthat also would be art the essential is according to tolstoy that he should feel himself and so represent his feeling that he communicates it to others59 artschools artprofessionalism artcriticism are all useless or worse than useless because they cannot teach a man to feel only life can do that all art is according to tolstoy good qu art that succeeds in transmitting emotion but there is good emotion and bad emotion and the only right material for art is good emotion and the only good emotion the only emotion worth expressing is subsumed according to tolstoy in the religion of the day this is how he explains the constant affinity in nearly all ages of art and religion instead of regarding religion as an early phase of art he proceeds to define religious perception as the highest social ideal of the moment as that understanding of the meaning of life which represents the highest level to which men of that society have attained an understanding defining the highest good at which that society aims religious perception in a society he beautifully adds is like the direction of a flowing river if the river flows at all it must have a direction thus religion to tolstoy is not dogma not petrifaction it makes indeed dogma impossible the religious perception of today flows tolstoi says in the christian channel towards the union of man in a common brotherhood it is the business of the modern artist to feel and transmit emotion towards this unity of man now it is not our purpose to examine whether tolstoys definition of religion is adequate or indeed illuminating what we wish to note is that he grasps the truth that in art we must look and feel and look and feel forward not backward if we would live art somehow like language is always feeling forward to newer fuller subtler emotions she seems indeed in a way to feel ahead even of science a poet will forecast dimly what a later discovery will confirm whether and how long old channels old forms will suffice for the new spirit can never be foreseen we end with a point of great importance though the doctrine we would emphasize may be to some a hard saying even a stumblingblock art as tolstoy divined is social not individual art is as we have seen social in origin it remains and must remain social in function the dance from which the drama rose was a choral dance the dance of a band a group a church a community what the greeks called a thiasos the word means a band and a thing of devotion and reverence devotion collective emotion is social in its very being that band was to begin with as we saw the whole collection of initiated tribesmen linked by a common name rallying round a common symbol even today when individualism is rampant art bears traces of its collective social origin we feel about it as noted before a certain ought which always spells social obligation moreover whenever we have a new movement in art it issues from a group usually from a small professional coterie but marked by strong social instincts by a missionary spirit by intemperate zeal in propaganda by a tendency always social to crystallize conviction into dogma we can scarcely unless we are as highhearted as tolstoy hope nowadays for an art that shall be worldwide the tribe is extinct the family in its old rigid form moribund the social groups we now look to as centres of emotion are the groups of industry of professionalism and of sheer mutual attraction small and strange though such groups may appear they are real social factors now this social collective element in art is too apt to be forgotten when an artist claims that expression is the aim of art he is too apt to mean selfexpression onlyutterance of individual emotion utterance of individual emotion is very closely neighboured by is almost identical with selfenhancement what should be a generous and in part altruistic exaltation becomes mere megalomania this egotism is of course a danger inherent in all art the suspension of motorreactions to the practical world isolates the artist cuts him off from his fellowmen makes him in a sense an egotist art said zola is the world seen through a temperament but this suspension is not that he should turn inward to feed on his own vitals but rather to free him for contemplation all great art releases from self the young are often temporary artists art being based on life calls for a strong vitality the young are also selfcentred and seek selfenhancement this need of selfexpression is a sort of artistic impulse the young are partly from sheer immaturity still more through a foolish convention shut out from real life they are secluded forced to become in a sense artists or if they have not the power for that at least selfaggrandizers they write lyric poems they love masquerading they focus life on to themselves in a way which later on life itself makes impossible this pseudoart this selfaggrandizement usually dies a natural death before the age of thirty if it live on one remedy is of course the scientific attitude that attitude which is bent on considering and discovering the relations of things among themselves not their personal relation to us the study of science is a priceless discipline in selfabnegation but only in negation it looses us from self it does not link us to others the real and natural remedy for the egotism of youth is life not necessarily the haunting of cafs or even the watching of football matches but strenuous activity in the simplest human relations of daily happenings whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might there is always apt to be some discord between the artist and the large practical world in which he lives but those ages are happiest in which the discord is least the nineteenth century amid its splendid achievements in science and industry in government and learning and above all in humanity illustrates this conflict in an interesting way to literature an art which can explain itself the great public world lent on the whole a reverent and intelligent ear its great prose writers were at peace with their audience and were inspired by great public interests some of the greatest for example tolstoy produced their finest work on widely human subjects and numbered their readers and admirers probably by the million writers like dickens thackeray kingsley mill and carlyle even poets like tennyson and browning were full of great public interests and causes and in different degrees and at different stages of their lives were thoroughly and immensely popular on the other hand one can find at the beginning of the period figures like blake and shelley and all through it a number of paintersthe preraphaelites the impressionistswalking like aliens in a philistine world even great figures like burnejones and whistler were for the greater part of their lives unrecognized or mocked at millais reached the attention of the world but was thought by the stricter fraternity to have in some sense or other sold his soul and committed the great sin of considering the bourgeois the bourgeois should be despised not partially but completely his life his interests his code of ethics and conduct must all be matters of entire indifference or amused contempt to the true artist who intends to do his own true work and call his soul his own at a certain moment during the eighties and nineties it looked as if these doctrines were generally accepted and the divorce between art and the community had become permanent but it seems as if this attitude which coincided with a period of reaction in political matters and a recrudescence of a belief in force and on unreasoned authority is already passing away there are not wanting signs that art both in painting and sculpture and in poetry and novelwriting is beginning again to realize its social function beginning to be impatient of mere individual emotion beginning to aim at something bigger more bound up with a feeling towards and for the common weal take work like that of mr galsworthy or mr masefield or mr arnold bennett without appraising its merits or demerits we cannot but note that the social sense is always there whether it be of a class or of a whole community in a play like justice the writer does not express himself he does not even merely show the pathos of a single human beings destiny he sets before us a much bigger thingman tragically caught and torn in the iron hands of a manmade machine society itself incarnate law is the protagonist and as it happens the villain of the piece it is a fragment of les misrables over again in a severer and more restrained technique an art like this starts no doubt from emotion towards personal happeningsthere is nothing else from which it can start but even as it sets sail for wider seas it is loosed from personal moorings science has given us back something strangely like a worldsoul and art is beginning to feel she must utter our emotion towards it such art is exposed to an inherent and imminent peril its very bigness and newness tends to set up fresh and powerful reactions unless in the process of creation these can be inhibited the artist will be lost in the reformer and the play or the novel turn tract this does not mean that the artist if he is strong enough may not be reformer too only not at the moment of creation the art of mr arnold bennett gets its bigness its collectivity in partfrom extension over time far from seeking after beauty he almost goes out to embrace ugliness he does not spare us even dullness that we may get a sense of the long waste spaces of life their dreary reality we are keenly interested in the loves of hero and heroine but all the time something much bigger is going on generation after generation rolls by in ceaseless panorama it is the life not of edwin and hilda it is the life of the five towns after a vision so big to come back to the ordinary individualistic lovestory is like looking through the wrong end of a telescope art of high quality and calibre is seldom obscure the great popular writers of the nineteenth centurydickens thackeray tennyson tolstoywrote so that all could understand a really big artist has something important to say something vast to show something that moves him and presses on him and he will say it simply because he must get it said he will trick it out with no devices most of all with no obscurities it has vexed and torn him enough while it was pushing its way to be born he has no peace till it is said and said as clearly as he may he says it not consciously for the sake of others but for himself to ease him from the burden of big thought moreover art whose business is to transmit emotion should need no commentary art comes out of theoria contemplation steady looking at but never out of theory theory can neither engender nor finally support it an exhibition of pictures with an explanatory catalogue scientifically interesting though it may be stands in a sense selfcondemned we must however remember that all art is not of the whole community there are small groups feeling their own small but still collective emotion fashioning their own language obscure sometimes to all but themselves they are right so to fashion it but if they appeal to a wider world they must strive to speak in the vulgar tongue understanded of the people it is indeed a hopeful sign of the times a mark of the revival of social as contrasted with merely individualistic instincts that a younger generation of poets at least in france tend to form themselves into small groups held together not merely by eccentricities of language or garb but by some deep inner conviction strongly held in common such a unity of spirit is seen in the works of the latter group of thinkers and writers known as unanimists they tried and failed to found a community their doctrine if doctrine convictions so fluid can be called is strangely like the old groupreligion of the common dance only more articulate of the unanimist it might truly be said il buvait lindistinction to him the harsh old roman mandate divide et impera divide men that you may rule them spells death his dream is not of empire and personal property but of the realization of life common to all to this school the great reality is the social group whatever form it take family village or town their only dogma is the unity and immeasurable sanctity of life in practice they are christian yet wholly free from the asceticism of modern christianity their attitude in art is as remote as possible from it is indeed the very antithesis to the sthetic exclusiveness of the close of last century like st peter the unanimists have seen a sheet let down and heard a voice from heaven saying call thou nothing common nor unclean above all the unanimist remembers and realizes afresh the old truth that no man liveth unto himself according to the expressionists creed as we have seen the end of art is to utter and communicate emotion the fullest and finest emotions are those one human being feels towards another every sympathy is an enrichment of life every antipathy a negation it follows then that for the unanimist love is the fulfilling of his law it is a beautiful and lifegiving faith felt and with a perfect sincerity expressed towards all nature by the indian poet tagore and towards humanity especially by m vildrac in his book of love livre damour he tells us in his commentary how today the poet sitting at home with pen and paper before him feels that he is pent in stifled by himself he had been about to retell the old old story of himself to set himself once more on the stage of his poemthe same old dusty self tricked out costumed anew suddenly he knows the figure to be tawdry and shameful he is hot all over when he looks at it he must out into the air into the street out of the stuffy museum where so long he has stirred the dead egotist ashes out into the bigger life the life of his fellows he must live with them by them in them i am weary of deeds done inside myself i am weary of voyages inside myself and of heroism wrought by strokes of the pen and of a beauty made up of formul i am ashamed of lying to my work of my work lying to my life and of being able to content myself by burning sweet spices with the mouldering smell that is master here again in the conquerors the poet dreams of the victorious one who has no army the knight who rides afoot the crusader without breviary or scrip the pilgrim of love who by the shining in his eyes draws all men to him and they in turn draw other men until at last the time came in the land the time of the great conquest when the people with this desire left the threshold of their door to go forth towards one another and the time came in the land when to fill all its story there was nothing but songs in unison one round danced about the houses one battle and one victory and so our tale ends where it began with the choral dance footnotes 54
